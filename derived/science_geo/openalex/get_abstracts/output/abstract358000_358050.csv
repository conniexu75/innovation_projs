This property can be used to create 'spintronics' devices and has possible application in quantum information processing. Two groups this week describe the application of this technology to nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging. Maze et al. demonstrate magnetic sensing using coherent control of diamond spins. They show that in principle, precision measurements of nano-tesla magnetic fields are possible, corresponding roughly to the field of a single proton at a distance of 10 nm. Balasubramanian et al. demonstrate initial steps towards a sensitive, high-resolution imaging technique using diamond spins. They show that the location of single nitrogen-vacancy spins can be determined to 5-nm resolution. In an accompanying News & Views, Michael Romalis observes that a combination of these two techniques could lead to detection and imaging of individual nuclear spins, even the structure determination for a single molecule. And as both experiments were done at room temperature, biological applications of these methods can be anticipated. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre, a naturally occurring impurity in diamond crystals, has a unique, long-lived single-electron spin state that can be controlled and detected optically. This paper demonstrates the first steps towards a sensitive, high-resolution imaging technique in which these diamond spins are exploited. It is shown that the location of single NV spins can be determined with nanometre scale resolution, at ambient conditions, using magneto-optical spin detection. Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques1,2, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells3,4, and magnetic resonance force microscopy5 has succeeded in detecting single electrons6 and small nuclear spin ensembles7. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications8. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically9,10, even at room temperature in some systems11,12,13,14. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells."

However, the mechanisms controlling adipocyte number are unknown in part because the identity of the physiological adipocyte progenitor cells has not been defined in vivo. In this report, we employ a variety of approaches, including a noninvasive assay for following fat mass reconstitution in vivo, to identify a subpopulation of early adipocyte progenitor cells (Lin−:CD29+:CD34+:Sca-1+:CD24+) resident in adult WAT. When injected into the residual fat pads of A-Zip lipodystrophic mice, these cells reconstitute a normal WAT depot and rescue the diabetic phenotype that develops in these animals. This report provides the identification of an undifferentiated adipocyte precursor subpopulation resident within the adipose tissue stroma that is capable of proliferating and differentiating into an adipose depot in vivo.

This report provides the identification of an undifferentiated adipocyte precursor subpopulation resident within the adipose tissue stroma that is capable of proliferating and differentiating into an adipose depot in vivo. Obesity, the excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT), is a highly prevalent condition that results from an imbalance of energy expenditure versus food intake, leading to an increase in the storage of energy in the form of lipid within WAT (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2006Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Adipocytes as regulators of energy balance and glucose homeostasis.Nature. 2006; 444: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Obesity is associated with increased risk of type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and certain types of cancer, causing a major public health problem (Kopelman, 2000Kopelman P.G. Obesity as a medical problem.Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar). Despite the clinical importance of obesity, our understanding WAT development in vivo is extremely limited. The increase in adipose mass in obesity is the result of both hypertrophy, an increase in adipocyte size, and hyperplasia, an increase in cell number (Hirsch and Batchelor, 1976Hirsch J. Batchelor B. Adipose tissue cellularity in human obesity.Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1976; 5: 299-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, Lane and Tang, 2005Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. From multipotent stem cell to adipocyte.Birth Defects Res. A. Clin. Mol. Teratol. 2005; 73: 476-477Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since mature adipocytes are postmitotic (Simon, 1965Simon G. Histogenesis.in: Renold A.E. Cahill G.F. Handbook of Physiology. Section 5: Adipose Tissue. American Physiological Society, Washington, DC1965Google Scholar), adipocyte hyperplasia in adults requires that new adipocytes be produced from the differentiation of precursor cells. However, the identity of the precursor cells in vivo is unknown (Gesta et al., 2007Gesta S. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Developmental origin of fat: Tracking obesity to its source.Cell. 2007; 131: 242-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), and the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating adipogenesis in vivo are poorly understood. In vitro studies using well-characterized preadipocyte cell lines have elucidated a transcriptional cascade that is required for adipogenesis, involving the sequential induction of a series of transcription factors, including Krox20, Klf4, C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ, that leads to the formation of differentiated, lipid-laden adipocytes (Birsoy et al., 2008aBirsoy K.

Experiments studying the ability of preadipocyte cell lines to differentiate into adipocytes have shown that these cell lines have a limited ability to differentiate in vivo (Fischbach et al., 2004Fischbach C. Spruss T. Weiser B. Neubauer M. Becker C. Hacker M. Gopferich A. Blunk T. Generation of mature fat pads in vitro and in vivo utilizing 3-D long-term culture of 3T3–L1 preadipocytes.Exp.

Previous reports have also shown that cells derived from the WAT stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) from mice and humans can differentiate into several lineages, including adipocytes, in primary cell culture (Zheng et al., 2006Zheng B. Cao B. Li G. Huard J.

However, the capacity of ADSCs and primary preadipocytes to differentiate into adipocytes in vivo is limited (Hemmrich et al., 2005Hemmrich K. von Heimburg D. Rendchen R. Di Bartolo C. Milella E.

Here, we report the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in combination with a functional in vivo transplantation scheme to identify early adipocyte precursor cells resident in the WAT vascular stroma. Analogous assays employing precursor cell transplantation in vivo have previously been developed for the study of hematopoietic, mammary epithelial, and spermatogonial stem cells (Brinster and Zimmermann, 1994Brinster R.L.

We assayed the adipogenic potential of different stromal cell populations in A-Zip lipodystrophic transgenic mice, which have a generalized lack of adipose tissue, and show that the residual WAT depots of A-Zip mice can provide a microenvironment that supports proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue from a small subpopulation of cells isolated from wild-type WAT stroma. WAT is composed of multiple cell types, including adipocytes, vascular cells, and populations of fibroblast like cells, that have not been well characterized (Cinti, 2005Cinti S. The adipose organ.Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 73: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). So that potential adipocyte progenitor cells could be identified, the SVF of wild-type WAT was fractionated (Rodbell, 1964Rodbell M. Metabolism of isolated fat cells. I. Effects of hormones on glucose metabolism and lipolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FACS was performed for the isolation of distinct cell populations on the basis of the differential expression of previously characterized cell-surface markers expressed by stem cell populations in other tissues. Populations of individual cells were first sorted on the basis of their expression of CD29 (β1-integrin) and CD34, both of which are expressed by several stem cell populations (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E.

Four populations were isolated: CD29−:CD34− (P1), CD29lo:CD34− (P2), CD29lo:CD34+ (P3), and CD29hi:CD34+ (P4). Sorted cells were plated and grown to confluence, and the adipogenic potential of these sorted populations (P1–P4) was analyzed in vitro by oil red O staining. The induction of adipocyte differentiation was tested through the use of a standard protocol for adipogenesis that employs a cocktail of insulin, glucocorticoids, and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (see the Experimental Procedures). Only the P3 fraction of CD29hi:CD34+ cells showed significant differentiation in vitro, with accumulation of cells displaying unilocular lipid droplets (Figure S1 available online). Having established that there was a subpopulation of cells in adipose stroma that was capable of differentiating into adipocytes in vitro, we next performed FACS for additional cell surface to further purify the adipogenic subpopulations. The strategy that was used in these studies is shown (see Figure 1) and described below. First, endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells were depleted from the SVF on the basis of staining of CD31, CD45, and Ter119, generating a lineage-negative (Lin−) population. This step removed ∼25% of the cells in the SVF. Second, the cell populations depleted of the lineage markers were separated on the basis of staining for CD34 and CD29, as described above. The Lin−:CD34+:CD29+ subpopulation was further separated on the basis of staining for stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1) and CD24 (Figure 1 and Figure 2A), two cell-surface proteins that are expressed on stem cell populations from other tissues (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M.

Sci. 2007; 1106: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The Lin−:CD29+:CD34+:Sca-1+ (Sca-1+) population comprises approximately half of the cells present in the SVF (53.5%), but only a small population of cells also expressed CD24 with the total number of Lin−:CD29+:CD34+:Sca-1+:CD24+ (CD24+) cells constituting in total ∼0.08% of the cells in the SVF (see Figure 1). The Sca-1+ population was negative for CD105 (endoglin) and CD117 (c-kit) (data not shown), distinguishing these cells from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells (Li and Johnson, 1995Li C.L.

We next tested whether the CD24+, Lin−:CD29+:CD34+:Sca-1+:CD24− (CD24−) and Lin−:CD29+:CD34− (CD34−) subpopulations can differentiate into adipocytes in vitro via the aforementioned protocol. We found that after exposure to an adipogenic cocktail in vitro, both the CD24+ and CD24− populations developed into adipocytes with large, unilocular lipid droplets that stain with oil red O (Figure 2B). Similar levels of differentiation of both the CD24+ and CD24− subpopulations were also observed when insulin alone was substituted for the full adipogenic hormone cocktail (data not shown). RT-PCR analysis of mRNAs derived from these differentiated adipocytes showed an approximately 7-fold increase in the expression of aP2 in both the CD24+ and CD24− cultures versus the undifferentiated populations. Expression of Adipsin was increased 5-fold in the CD24− population and 25-fold in the CD24+ population (Figure 2C). The 5-fold greater induction of Adipsin expression in the CD24+ versus CD24− adipocytes suggested that these are functionally distinct populations (confirmed in vivo, see below). Although both CD24− and CD24+ populations could robustly differentiate into adipocytes, the CD34− cells failed to differentiate in response to the same adipogenic cocktail. Further experiments showed that the CD24− and CD24+ cell populations are also capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, and muscle in vitro (Figure S2). In addition, although the unfractionated SVF showed some ability to differentiate into adipocytes, it did so poorly when compared to the CD24− and CD24+ populations, displaying significantly smaller numbers of oil red O positive cells with multilocular lipid accumulation (Figure 2B) and lower levels of Adipsin and aP2 expression (Figure 2C). The finding that the SVF is poorly adipogenic in comparison to the CD24− population, which represents 53.5% of the SVF, suggested that there may be inhibitory factors present in the unfractionated SVF. Quantification of the number of oil red O-positive cells derived from each cultured cell population isolated in the FACS sorting scheme revealed that the CD24− and CD24+ were 24-fold and 19-fold enriched, respectively, for adipocytes versus the unfractionated SVF (Table S1). The extent of differentiation of the SVF in these experiments was similar to that documented in previous studies (Boquest et al., 2005Boquest A.C. Shahdadfar A. Fronsdal K. Sigurjonsson O.

Hematol. 2005; 33: 1402-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the FACS strategy that was employed enriched for adipocyte precursor cells. We next tested whether the different stromal cell fractions could reconstitute WAT in vivo by transplanting ∼50,000 donor cells into recipient animals. However, we did not observe any differentiation of either the CD24+ or CD24− subpopulation into adipocytes after injection of ∼50,000 cells into adipose tissue of wild-type mice. This suggested that the microenvironment of an adult adipose depot might not be conducive for the proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte precursor cells. We next considered the possibility that A-Zip lipodystrophic mice could support adipogenesis after injection of the precursor cells capable of differentiating into adipocytes in vitro. A-Zip mice express a dominant-negative transcription factor (A-Zip), which inhibits C/EBP transcription factors, under the control of the aP2 promoter (Moitra et al., 1998Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. et al.Life without white fat: A transgenic mouse.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Since aP2 is expressed relatively late in adipogenesis, we reasoned that there might be an expansion of precursor cells upstream of the block in differentiation caused by the expression of the transgene. Consistent with this hypothesis, A-Zip mice, which have a severe, generalized lack of WAT (Moitra et al., 1998Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. et al.Life without white fat: A transgenic mouse.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), do retain small WAT depots discernable at the sites where mature WAT depots typically develop in wild-type animals (Figure 3A). Despite the paucity of adipocytes in A-Zip WAT, these small depots do contain a limited number of lipid-filled cells that are similar in size to wild-type adipocytes (Figure 3B), suggesting that some cells may escape the block in adipogenesis caused by A-Zip expression. There is also a marked increase in the number of stromal cells present in A-Zip WAT, and approximately half of this expanded cell population expresses the preadipocyte marker Pref-1 (Figures 3B and 3E). We hypothesized that inhibition of the formation of mature adipocytes in the WAT depots of the A-Zip animals would lead to an increase of proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells upstream of the block in differentiation. If true, cells in the stromal fraction of these depots should continue to express genes induced early during adipogenesis (upstream of the block induced by the transgene) and continually proliferate in a manner similar to the clonal expansion phase of adipogenesis in preadipocyte cells lines induced to differentiate in vitro. To test this possibility, we analyzed the expression of genes typically induced early during adipogenesis in vitro in the A-Zip WAT depots. We found that the RNA levels for the early markers of adipogenesis, Klf4, Krox20, and C/EBPδ, were increased in A-Zip WAT depots relative to wild-type WAT by 191%, 498%, and 291%, respectively, whereas the expression of PPARγ, a marker of mature adipocytes, was decreased to 56% of the levels in wild-type tissue (Figure 3C). Immunohistochemistry for the preadipocyte marker Pref-1 demonstrates both the presence of preadipocytes in wild-type WAT and an increase in Pref-1-positive cells in lipodystrophic WAT (Figures 3B and 3E). Immunohistochemistry for Krox20 and Klf4 indicated very low expression of these factors at the protein level in wild-type WAT (Figures 3D and 3E), with a significant increase in the numbers of Klf4- and Krox20-positive cells in A-Zip WAT (Figures 3D and 3E). In lipodystrophic WAT, there was also a similar increase in the level of CREB phosphorylation, one of the earliest events observed during adipogenesis in vitro (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Role of CREB in transcriptional regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta gene during adipogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). During adipogenesis in vitro, preadipocytes proliferate during a stage of clonal expansion (Bernlohr et al., 1985Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. Evidence for an increase in transcription of specific mRNAs during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that coincides with the expression of the aforementioned transcription factors. To test whether proliferation is also increased in lipodystrophic WAT, we treated A-Zip mice with BrdU for 7 days. Analysis of BrdU incorporation demonstrated that A-Zip adipose tissue contains large numbers of proliferating cells compared to wild-type adipose, in which there are low levels of BrdU incorporation (Figures 3D and 3E). Flow cytometry demonstrated that the cells from A-Zip mice that incorporated BrdU overlapped substantially with the adipogenic Sca-1+ cell subpopulation (which includes both the CD24+ and CD24− subpopulations) that we showed are capable of robustly differentiating into adipose tissue in vitro. In contrast, the Sca-1+ population from wild-type animals did not incorporate BrdU (Figure 3F). The increase in BrdU incorporation in A-Zip mice is almost exclusively due to proliferation of the Sca-1+ population because BrdU incorporation into the Lin+ population was not different between cell populations derived from wild-type and A-Zip WAT (Figure 3F). Of note, the number of CD24+ cells is increased 277% in A-Zip WAT (Figure S3). These data suggested that the adipose tissue depot of lipodystrophic mice might provide a microenvironment, or niche, capable of supporting the proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte precursor cells. We next tested whether the FACS-sorted subpopulations could develop into adipose tissue when injected into the WAT depots of A-Zip mice. We used cells derived from ubiquitin-GFP mice, which express GFP ubiquitously, as donors in transplantation experiments in which a total of 50,000 freshly purified cells from the CD24+, CD24−, or CD34− subpopulations were injected unilaterally into the parametrial WAT depot of A-Zip recipients. Inspection of the injected depots 12 weeks after injection revealed that injection of CD24+ donor cells developed into a normal-sized WAT depot at the site of injection (Figure 4A). Reconstitution of the injected parametrial fat pad was seen in 11 out of 20 animals that received the injection of CD24+ donor cells, which is comparable to the success rates achieved in similar grafting experiments from mammary gland (∼80%) and testis (18%–37%) (Brinster and Zimmermann, 1994Brinster R.L.

A morphologically distinct candidate for an epithelial stem cell in mouse mammary gland.J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 173-183PubMed Google Scholar). The depots that develop after injection of 50,000 CD24+ cells were composed almost entirely of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells with the unilocular morphology characteristic of mature white adipocytes (Figure 4B), confirming that the adipose depot that developed was derived from the donor cells. In fact, the reconstituted WAT appeared to be identical to the ubiquitin-GFP donor WAT with the exception of the vasculature, which was GFP+ in the donor WAT but GFP-negative in the reconstituted tissue (Figure 4B). To further investigate the contribution of the CD24+ cells to other cell populations within the reconstituted WAT, we analyzed cell subpopulations for GFP expression by FACS. Although GFP+ donor cells remained present in the CD24+ population in the reconstituted WAT (15.6% ± 1.3%), GFP was not detected in the endothelial (CD31+) or hematopoietic populations (CD45+) (Figure 4C), indicating that the CD24+ cells populations do not contribute to these lineages in the reconstituted WAT depots. Injection of the unfractionated SVF resulted in a low success rate of WAT reconstitution (1 of 10 recipients), and the Lin−:CD34+ population, which also contains the CD24+ population, also failed to reconstitute WAT (zero of six injections), indicating that the CD24+ population is highly enriched for adipogenic precursor cells. The CD24− (zero of ten recipients) and CD34− (zero of six recipients) populations also failed to reconstitute WAT after injection into A-Zip mice. Small numbers of GFP+ cells were detectable in adipose depots injected with the CD24− cells, indicating that these cells were able to engraft in WAT. However, in this case, GFP+ lipid-filled cells were not detected, suggesting that these cells have a limited ability to differentiate. Overall, these studies showed that the CD24+ cells were the only subpopulation of the SVF capable of forming an adipose tissue depot. (See Table S2 for a"

https://openalex.org/W2144709865,"Background Diabetic extremity ulcers are associated with chronic infections. Such ulcer infections are too often followed by amputation because there is little or no understanding of the ecology of such infections or how to control or eliminate this type of chronic infection. A primary impediment to the healing of chronic wounds is biofilm phenotype infections. Diabetic foot ulcers are the most common, disabling, and costly complications of diabetes. Here we seek to derive a better understanding of the polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic extremity ulcer infections. Methods and Findings Using a new bacterial tag encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) approach we have evaluated the bacterial diversity of 40 chronic diabetic foot ulcers from different patients. The most prevalent bacterial genus associated with diabetic chronic wounds was Corynebacterium spp. Findings also show that obligate anaerobes including Bacteroides, Peptoniphilus, Fingoldia, Anaerococcus, and Peptostreptococcus spp. are ubiquitous in diabetic ulcers, comprising a significant portion of the wound biofilm communities. Other major components of the bacterial communities included commonly cultured genera such as Streptococcus, Serratia, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. Conclusions In this article, we highlight the patterns of population diversity observed in the samples and introduce preliminary evidence to support the concept of functional equivalent pathogroups (FEP). Here we introduce FEP as consortia of genotypically distinct bacteria that symbiotically produce a pathogenic community. According to this hypothesis, individual members of these communities when they occur alone may not cause disease but when they coaggregate or consort together into a FEP the synergistic effect provides the functional equivalence of well-known pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, giving the biofilm community the factors necessary to maintain chronic biofilm infections. Further work is definitely warranted and needed in order to prove whether the FEPs concept is a viable hypothesis. The findings here also suggest that traditional culturing methods may be extremely biased as a diagnostic tool as they select for easily cultured organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and against difficult to culture bacteria such as anaerobes. While PCR methods also have bias, further work is now needed in comparing traditional culture results to high-resolution molecular diagnostic methods such as bTEFAP."
https://openalex.org/W2088237277,"Mouse ES cells can differentiate into all three germ layers of the embryo but are generally excluded from the trophoblast lineage. Here we show that ES cells deficient in DNA methylation can differentiate efficiently into trophoblast derivatives. In a genome-wide screen we identified the transcription factor Elf5 as methylated and repressed in ES cells, and hypomethylated and expressed in TS and methylation-deficient ES cells. Elf5 creates a positive-feedback loop with the TS cell determinants Cdx2 and Eomes that is restricted to the trophoblast lineage by epigenetic regulation of Elf5. Importantly, the late-acting function of Elf5 allows initial plasticity and regulation in the early blastocyst. Thus, Elf5 functions as a gatekeeper, downstream of initial lineage determination, to reinforce commitment to the trophoblast lineage or to abort this pathway in epiblast cells. This epigenetic restriction of cell lineage fate provides a molecular mechanism for Waddington's concept of canalization of developmental pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2132585192,"The role of inferotemporal cortex in coding two-dimensional patterns has been extensively studied, but the more difficult problem of three-dimensional shape representation has been relatively unexplored. Yamane and colleagues use new techniques for adaptive stimulus presentation and response modeling to extensively characterize neural coding for three-dimensional objects. Previous investigations of the neural code for complex object shape have focused on two-dimensional pattern representation. This may be the primary mode for object vision given its simplicity and direct relation to the retinal image. In contrast, three-dimensional shape representation requires higher-dimensional coding derived from extensive computation. We found evidence for an explicit neural code for complex three-dimensional object shape. We used an evolutionary stimulus strategy and linear/nonlinear response models to characterize three-dimensional shape responses in macaque monkey inferotemporal cortex (IT). We found widespread tuning for three-dimensional spatial configurations of surface fragments characterized by their three-dimensional orientations and joint principal curvatures. Configural representation of three-dimensional shape could provide specific knowledge of object structure to support guidance of complex physical interactions and evaluation of object functionality and utility."
https://openalex.org/W2004167485,"A major breakthrough in systemic phosphate homeostasis regulation was achieved by the demonstration of strikingly similar physical, morphological, and biochemical phenotypes of fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23) and klotho ablated mice, which led to identification of klotho as an Fgf23 signaling cofactor. Here, we generated Fgf23 and klotho double-knockout (Fgf23(-/-)/klotho(-/-)) mice to test the hypothesis whether Fgf23 has a klotho-independent function. Fgf23(-/-)/klotho(-/-) mice are viable and have high serum phosphate levels, similar to Fgf23(-/-) and klotho(-/-) single-knockout mice. In addition, the Fgf23(-/-)/klotho(-/-) mice have increased renal expression of the sodium/phosphate cotransporter NaP(i)2a and of 1- alpha-hydroxylase concomitant with increased serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D, as also observed in the Fgf23(-/-) and klotho(-/-) mice. Moreover, Fgf23(-/-)/klotho(-/-) mice show soft tissue and vascular calcification, severe muscle wasting, hypogonadism, pulmonary emphysema, distention of intestinal wall, and skin atrophy, all of which are also seen in Fgf23(-/-) and klotho(-/-) mice. Notably, injection of bioactive FGF23 protein into Fgf23(-/-)/klotho(-/-) and klotho(-/-) mice does not lower serum phosphate, whereas in wild-type and Fgf23(-/-) mice, it reduces serum phosphate. Together, these results provide compelling evidence that Fgf23 does not have a klotho-independent role in the regulation of systemic phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1626038553,"HIV has advanced from high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users to some in the general population, according to comprehensive new data from the south of China. What needs to be done to halt its spread? A histological specimen from the University of Kinshasa archives has been used to obtain HIV gene sequences dating back to the pre-AIDS era. From a lymph node biopsy taken in 1960 from an adult female in Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo), sample 'DRC60' makes possible the first evolutionary analysis of pre-AIDS 'fossil' HIV-1 sequences, via comparison with the one other viral sequence from the period, from a plasma sample taken in 1959, also in Kinshasa. The analysis supports the idea that diversification of HIV-1 in west-central Africa occurred long before the recognized AIDS pandemic. Almost fifty years on, a major concern in HIV epidemiology is China. Here, HIV-1 infection was largely confined to high-risk groups but it is now breaking out into the general population. Lin Lu et al. report on efforts to contain the epidemic in Yunnan Province, where there has been a dramatic increase in sexual transmission of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2095119525,"Individuals with 22q11.2 microdeletions have cognitive deficits and a high risk of developing schizophrenia. Here we provide evidence that primary hippocampal neurons from a mouse model of 22q11.2 deletion (Df(16)A+/− mice) have decreased density of dendritic spines and glutamatergic synapses, as well as impaired dendritic growth. These deficits were prevented by introduction of the enzymatically active ZDHHC8 palmitoyltransferase encoded by a gene in the 22q11.2 locus, and they were also observed in primary cultures from Zdhhc8-deficient mice. Many of these deficits were also present in the hippocampi of adult Df(16)A+/− and Zdhhc8-deficient mice. Finally, we provide evidence that PSD95 is one of the substrates of ZDHHC8. Our analysis reveals that 22q11.2 microdeletion results in deficits in neuronal development and suggests that impaired neuronal protein palmitoylation contributes to many of these deficits."

Despite intense investigation, the mechanisms through which NO2- exerts its physiological/pharmacological effects remain incompletely understood. We sought to systematically investigate the fate of NO2- in hypoxia from cellular uptake in vitro to tissue utilization in vivo using the Wistar rat as a mammalian model. We find that most tissues (except erythrocytes) produce free NO at rates that are maximal under hypoxia and that correlate robustly with each tissue's capacity for mitochondrial oxygen consumption. By comparing the kinetics of NO release before and after ferricyanide addition in tissue homogenates to mathematical models of NO2- reduction/NO scavenging, we show that the amount of nitrosylated products formed greatly exceeds what can be accounted for by NO trapping. This difference suggests that such products are formed directly from NO2-, without passing through the intermediacy of free NO. Inhibitor and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that NO2- reductase activity involves multiple redundant enzymatic systems (i.e. heme, iron-sulfur cluster, and molybdenum-based reductases) distributed throughout different cellular compartments and acting in concert to elicit NO signaling.

We therefore sought to address systematically the path of NO2- biotransformation in hypoxic tissues and its processing into NO and NO-related species across levels of biological organization by employing an experimental paradigm that ranges from cellular NO2- uptake in vitro to tissue NO2- utilization in vivo. Our findings reveal that multiple heme, iron-sulfur cluster, and molybdenum-based reductases, distributed among distinct subcellular compartments, act in a cooperative manner to convert NO2- to NO and related signaling products. The correlation between NO2- reductase activity and oxidative phosphorylation capacity across organs suggests that NO2- serves a cell regulatory role (e.g. the modulation of intermediary metabolism) beyond its capacity to elicit hypoxic vasodilatation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and ReagentsMale Wistar rats (250–350 g) from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) were allowed food (2018 rodent diet, Harlan) and water ad libitum and were maintained on a regular 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with at least 10 days of local vivarium acclimatization prior to experimental use. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Boston University School of Medicine. All gasses and chemicals were of the highest available grade (see supplemental information for details).Biological Sample Harvest and PreparationHeparinized (0.07 units/g body weight, intraperitoneal) rats were anesthetized with diethylether and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Whole blood (3–5 ml) was collected from the inferior vena cava into EDTA-containing tubes (1.8 mg/mL) and processed as detailed (23Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Rodriguez C.M. Saijo F.

Isolated, packed RBC (1 blood vol-equivalent) were immediately lysed hypotonically with 3 vol of water. After thoracotomy, a catheter was inserted into the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta, and organs were flushed free of blood by retrograde in situ perfusion at a rate of 10 ml/min with air-equilibrated PBS before extirpation. NO2- reductase activity was assessed by measuring the NO generated immediately after addition of 100 μl of a 20 mm NaNO2 stock solution to tissue samples (200 μm final [ NO2-]) using gas-phase chemiluminescence.Liver Homogenate PreparationHepatic tissue was acquired by standard techniques (see supplemental information). Liver homogenate was diluted 180-fold in LHM and preincubated at 37 °C for 4 min with either PBS (vehicle control) or a variety of inhibitors (supplemental Table S1) in a light-protected reaction vessel continuously purged with nitrogen. For analysis of inhibitor effects, the amount of NO generated within the first 4 min of incubation in the presence of test compound was compared with a parallel sample treated only with the respective inhibitor vehicle.Nitrite Reductase Activity in Subcellular FractionsHepatic subcellular fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation (25Rickwood D. Preparative Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Low-speed centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min) of whole-liver homogenate (S0) was used to remove undisrupted tissue, nuclei, and particulate debris into the resulting pellet (P1), which was discarded. The supernatant (S1) was recovered and re-centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min) to obtain a mitochondrial fraction (P2). The corresponding supernatant (S2) was subjected to a final centrifugation (105,000 × g, 60 min) to obtain microsomal (P3) and cytosolic (S3) fractions. For analysis of NO2- reductase activity across fractions, each mitochondrial (P2) and microsomal (P3) pellet was re-suspended in LHM to the same dilution as that of the supernatant fractions from which they were derived and analyzed as described above. The contribution of each subcellular fraction with respect to total hepatic NO2- reductase activity was calculated by accounting for the individual fractional product yield (6.2% for P2; 1.3% for P3; 77.8% for S3, with 14.7% discarded as P1 debris). The influence of NAD(P)H (100 μm) on the conversion of NO2- to NO by the subcellular fractions was determined as the relative NO2- reductase activity in the absence or presence of pyridine nucleotide and expressed as percent of control (with no exogenous pyridine nucleotide added). NO2- interaction with microsomal cytochrome P450 was assessed by difference spectrophotometry and chemiluminescence (see supplemental information).In Vitro StudiesNO2- Uptake by RBCs and Tissues—Rats were anesthetized with diethylether, and 5 ml of arterial blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Blood was immediately centrifuged at 1,400 × g (8 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the RBC pellet was placed on ice. Blood-free heart and liver tissue was obtained as described above and also kept on ice until use. Tissue (0.5 g) was minced into 2-mm pieces and placed into 2 ml of air-saturated or “hypoxic” (15 min bubbling with air or argon, respectively) PBS and incubated at 37 °C. Following addition of 10 μm NaNO2, aliquots of 50 μl were removed after 1, 3, 5, and 10 min and centrifuged briefly (60 s at 16,100 × g) to clarify samples prior to NO2-/NO3- analysis. For uptake measurements by RBC, 4 ml of PBS were added to 1 ml of packed RBC pellet and processed as above. No changes in the concentrations of NO2-/NO3- were observed in the absence of cells/tissue.Tissue Homogenization and Incubation—Blood-free tissue samples were homogenized in chilled PBS (1:5 w/v) using a Polytron (PT10–35) homogenizer. Just prior to use, samples were brought with PBS to a 6-fold final dilution (v/v) for tissues and a 4-fold final dilution (v/v, equivalent to 2.5% hematocrit) for lysed RBC. For incubation, an equivalent tissue/RBC sample volume was placed into the light-protected reaction vessel of an ozone-chemiluminescence NO analyzer (CLD 77sp, EcoPhysics). The vessel was maintained at 37 °C, and samples were purged sequentially with either medical-grade air (normoxia) or nitrogen (hypoxia/near-anoxia). NO generation was continuously monitored for 5 min following addition of 200 μm NaNO2 (final conc.). This NO2- concentration has been established as sufficient to support vasorelaxation in vitro, regional vasodilation in vivo, and nitrosylation and S-nitrosation of Hb in vitro and in vivo (10Cosby K.

Aliquots of samples were collected for protein determination, and all values were normalized to total protein.In Vivo StudiesRats were administered 1.0 mg/kg NaNO2, intraperitoneal This dosing regimen ensures that NO2- equilibrates rapidly across all major organ systems, RBC, and plasma to reach a global steady-state prior to tissue sampling (8Bryan N.S.

Three min after NO2- injection acute systemic hypoxia was induced by cervical dislocation and maintained for 2 min. Normoxic controls were examined in parallel without subjecting animals to global hypoxia. In both cases, animals were sacrificed 5 min after NO2- administration. The same in situ retrograde perfusion technique was performed as for the in vitro studies above except that the perfusate was air-equilibrated PBS supplemented with NEM/EDTA (10 mm/2.5 mm) to eliminate interference by exogenous NO2-. NO-related metabolites following NO2- administration were profiled using previously validated methods (23Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Rodriguez C.M. Saijo F. Rodriguez J.R. Feelisch M. Proc.

Quantification of these species employed group-specific derivatization, denitrosation, and gas-phase chemiluminescence. NO2- and NO3- were quantified by ion chromatography (ENO-20, Eicom).Data Analysis, Presentation, and ModelingUnless otherwise noted, data are averages ± range from n = 3 individual experiments or means ± S.E. from n ≥ 3, as specified. Where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post-hoc test. Least-squares regression analysis was used to characterize the slope and goodness-of-fit of model linear associations between data sets. Spearman rank correlation was applied to evaluate data co-variation. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Origin 7.0 and Graph Pad Prism 4.0 were used for the statistical analyses. Modeling data were obtained through numeric integration using Mathematica, with a working precision of 20 digits.RESULTSTissues Readily Take Up NO2- in an Oxygen-independent Manner— NO2- uptake by RBCs, heart, and liver tissue was assessed under normoxic and hypoxic conditions by measuring its disappearance from an external medium containing 10 μm NO2-. Because NO2- concentrations in these tissues are ≪10 μm (8Bryan N.S. Fernandez B.O. Bauer S.M. Garcia-Saura M.F. Milsom A.B. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Bharti A. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nat. Chem.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the initial disappearance of NO2- from PBS should reflect the flux of this anion into the cells/tissues. Indeed, NO2- is taken up at similar rates by RBC and heart tissue (0.31 μm/min and 0.24 μm/min, respectively), and rates are roughly comparable under hypoxic conditions (heart: 0.16 μm/min; RBC: 0.28 μm/min; see supplemental Fig. S1). Similar data were obtained with liver (not shown). No NO3- accumulation was seen in the extracellular medium.Hypoxia Markedly Potentiates Tissue NO Production from NO2- in Vitro—Under aerobic conditions, NO production by RBC and blood-free tissues was minimal even in the presence of 200 μM NO2- (Fig. 1A). Hypoxia/near-anoxia (achieved by N2 purging) dramatically enhanced NO formation from NO2-, particularly by heart, liver, and vascular tissue. NO production by RBC lysate peaked after ∼3 min, whereas NO production by liver homogenate increased to reach maximal levels after 50–60 min of hypoxia following a brief lag. Near-anoxic, NO2--dependent NO production (standardized as mg protein/min) in all tissues surpassed that of RBC (Fig. 1B). The 2-fold increase in RBC NO2- reduction from normoxic to near-anoxic conditions is consistent with data previously reported (10Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A.N. Cannon III, R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). No NO formation was observed when 200 μm NO2- was substituted for NO3- (not shown).NO Generation from NO2- Is Profoundly Oxygen-dependent—The oxygen-dependence of tissue NO2- reductase activity was investigated by adding 200 μm NaNO2 to liver and heart homogenates and RBC lysate incubated at various oxygen concentrations (21, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, and 0%) and monitoring of the resulting NO formation (Fig. 1C). NO production from NO2- was maximal under anoxia. Oxygen proved to be a potent inhibitor of NO2- reduction in liver and heart with >80% inhibition at 0.5% oxygen. Less pronounced changes in oxygen dependence were observed with RBC lysate, with maximal rates of NO formation occurring at ∼1% oxygen.Acute Hypoxia Potentiates NO2--dependent NO Metabolite Formation in Vivo—To extend the above observations to a more physiological context and to expand on existing observations that hypoxia reduces endogenous brain NO2- stores coincident with RSNO formation (23Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Rodriguez C.M. Saijo F. Rodriguez J.R. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4308-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), the in vivo impact of NO2- on NO-related metabolite formation was assessed. To ensure initial NO2- equilibration across all compartments studied, we followed our previous protocol (8Bryan N.S. Fernandez B.O. Bauer S.M. Garcia-Saura M.F. Milsom A.B. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Bharti A. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and administered to rats a single intraperitoneal bolus of 1.0 mg/kg NaNO2 3 min prior to inducing 2 min of global hypoxia. Acute global hypoxia attenuated NO2- concentrations in heart, liver, kidney, lung, and aorta (Fig. 2A) and enhanced NO metabolite formation in a tissue- and product-selective manner (Fig. 2, B–D). Tissue nitroso/nitrosyl products originated from NO2-, since their levels under identical hypoxic conditions were far less (<0.1%) without the supplied NO2- (23Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Rodriguez C.M. Saijo F. Rodriguez J.R. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4308-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although each tissue examined was capable of hypoxia-induced, NO2--dependent NO metabolite formation, it was most pronounced in liver, heart, and the RBC. The tissue-specificity of these responses to systemic hypoxia accords with previous demonstrations that endogenous substrates and the turnover of NO-related oxidative and nitrosative metabolites vary greatly among tissues (23Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Maloney R.E. Rodriguez C.M. Saijo F. Rodriguez J.R. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4308-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 26Rodriguez J. Maloney R.E. Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although there is limited NO production from NO2- by hypoxic RBC in vitro (Fig. 1), RBC exhibited the greatest relative RSNO formation during acute hypoxia in vivo. This finding is consistent with the S-nitrosation and nitrosylation of hemoglobin (Hb) by NO2- to form both, SNO-Hb and Hb-NO in vitro and in vivo (10Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A.N. Cannon III, R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar); indeed, SNO-Hb is probably generated from circulating NO2- without the intermediate liberation of NO within the RBC (27Angelo M. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8366-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Increased formation of tissue NO metabolites from NO2- during acute global hypoxia in vivo.

Accordingly, liver was used to characterize more comprehensively the kinetics and chemistry of NO production from NO2- in tissue. The NO2- reductase activity of anoxic whole liver homogenate was linearly dependent upon the concentration of supplied NO2- (25–1000 μm) and, to a lesser extent, the amount of tissue protein employed (Fig. 3A). Because the generation of NO was measured over 4 min in each case and therefore represents the initial rate of NO formation, this observation suggests that whole liver homogenate grossly conforms to first order kinetics with respect to NO2- and, to a lesser extent, tissue protein concentration. In contrast to the results obtained with whole liver homogenate, no strict linearity was evident in the cytosolic fraction (S3) between NO formation and NO2- concentration, although the dependence upon protein concentration was similar to that in whole liver homogenate (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Correlation between NO formation from NO2- in different tissues and putative NO2- reductase activity. A, apparent linear dependence of NO2- to NO conversion by hypoxic whole liver homogenate (25–1000 μm NO2-). Inset, hypoxic NO production from 200 μm NO2- is not as linearly dependent upon hepatic protein. B, NO2- and protein dependence deviate from linearity with the cytosolic fraction. C, significant correlation exists between hypoxic NO2- reductase activity and tissue XOR activity (r = 0.892, p = 0.042). The correlation between hypoxic NO2- reductase activity and mitochondrial inner surface area (D) is more striking, except for kidney (r = 0.9998, p = 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NO2- Reduction to NO Requires Enzymatic Activity—To probe the involvement of enzymatic processes in hypoxic NO formation, aliquots of liver homogenate were subjected to heat pretreatment. Exposure of liver homogenate for 60 min to 56 or 80 °C inhibited NO2- reductase activity by 72 and >90%, respectively, relative to control, unheated tissue samples. These results are consistent with the conclusion that thermolabile enzymes mediate the majority of hypoxic NO2- reduction to NO, either directly or indirectly (e.g. by modulating reducing equivalent supply).Putative Cellular NO2- Reductases—To gain insight into potential mechanisms of tissue NO2- reduction, NO2--dependent NO production was quantified as a function of reported literature values"

https://openalex.org/W2011369366,"To understand how traits used in animal communication evolved and are maintained as honest signals, we need to understand the mechanisms that prevent cheating. It has been proposed that honest signaling is guaranteed by the costs associated with the signal expression. However, the nature of these costs is still under debate. Melanin-based signals are intriguing because their expression seems to be tightly controlled by genes and the resource involved (i.e. melanin) seems to be not limited. However, in vertebrates, low levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (i.e. glutathione) are needed to promote melanogenesis. We propose that melanin-based ornaments can signal the ability to cope with oxidative stress because those individuals with low enough levels of glutathione, such as those required for melanin production, should manage well the whole of the antioxidant machinery in order to maintain a certain oxidative status. We analysed the expression of a melanin-based signal: the well-known black stripe of the great tit (Parus major). Great tit nestlings were injected with a specific inhibitor of glutathione production (DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine; BSO) throughout their development. BSO effectively decreased intracellular glutathione levels without apparent side effects on growth or body condition. Instead, treated nestlings developed black breast stripes 70-100% larger than controls. Moreover, treated nestlings also compensated the decrease in glutathione levels by increasing the levels of circulating antioxidants. Results indicate that melanin-based signals can be at least partially permeable to environmental influences such as those associated to oxidative stress. They also reveal a potential handicap associated to the expression of this kind of signals. Finally, although other contributing factors could have been present, our findings emphasize the role of oxidative stress in shaping the evolution of animal signals in general and, in particular, those produced by pigments."

Unexpectedly, we found that a related pathway consisting of JAK2, STAT2, and STAT3 is required for early myogenic differentiation. Interference of this pathway by either a small molecule inhibitor or small interfering RNA inhibits myogenic differentiation. Consistently, all three molecules are activated upon differentiation.

Based on the effect of AG490, an inhibitor for JAK2 (39Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), JAK2 was proposed to be required for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced C2C12 proliferation (36Spangenburg E.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C204-C211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, this result has to be viewed with caution because of potential nonspecific effects of the drug (i.e. inhibition of cellular molecules other than JAK2). Recently, our group showed that a pathway consisting of JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 is involved in myoblast proliferation (40Sun L. Ma K. Wang H. Xiao F. Gao Y. Zhang W. Wang K. Gao X. Ip N. Wu Z. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Perturbation of this pathway by siRNAs up-regulates the expression levels of p21cip1 and p27kip1. Furthermore, we found that this pathway also inhibits the differentiation program by repressing the expression of MyoD and MEF2 genes, whose protein products are required for myogenin induction at the onset of differentiation (11Yee S.P.

Down-regulation of either JAK1 or STAT1 by siRNA accelerates myogenic differentiation in both C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts (40Sun L. Ma K. Wang H. Xiao F. Gao Y. Zhang W. Wang K. Gao X. Ip N. Wu Z. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Although JAK2 is quite homologous to JAK1, unexpectedly, we found that JAK2 plays an opposite role during myogenic differentiation in comparison with JAK1. STAT2 and STAT3 appear to function downstream of JAK2 during myogenic differentiation. In addition to MyoD and MEF2, we showed that JAK2/STAT2/STAT3 also control the expression of HGF and IGF2, both of which are known to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. This finding provides additional mechanisms to explain why JAK2 is required for myogenic differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation and Culturing of Primary Myoblasts—Isolation of primary myoblasts was carried out as described previously (57Beauchamp J.R. Morgan J.E. Pagel C.N. Partridge T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Briefly, C57/B6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Skeletal muscles from hind limbs and back were dissected out and minced with scissors. The muscles were then digested by 1 mg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 1 h to dissociate muscle satellite cells from myofibers. After digestion, myofibers were allowed to sediment, and satellite cells in the supernatant were passed through 40-μm cell sieves (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The cells were then subjected to centrifugation in a Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient. The satellite cells were collected in the interphase between 60 and 20% of Percoll and cultured on Matrigel (Clontech, Mountain View, CA)-coated plates. The cells were first grown for 24 h in the plating medium (DMEM with 10% horse serum, 0.5% chicken embryo extract, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin) to facilitate their attachment to plates, followed by growth in the satellite growth medium (DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2% chicken embryo extract, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin) to promote myoblast proliferation. The myoblasts were induced to differentiate in the satellite differentiation medium (DMEM with 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin).Cell Lines, DNA Constructs, and Reagents—C2C12 cells were maintained in the growth medium (GM, DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin). To induce differentiation, the cells were grown in DMEM containing 2% horse serum (also called differentiation medium (DM)). The cells were kept in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. JAK and STAT constructs were gifts from Dr. Zilong Wen (Hong Kong University of Science & Technology). JAK1 and 2, Tyk2, and STAT1, 2, and 3 were subcloned into pcDNA3 vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag. G133-luc, MCK-luc, 4RE-luc, 3MEF2-luc, Gal4-MyoD, Gal4-MEF2A, Gal4-MEF2C, and Gal4-MEF2D were described previously (18Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M.

Recombinant mouse IGF1 was from R & D (Minneapolis, MN).siRNA and Plasmid Transfection—For siRNA transfection, 50% confluent C2C12 cells or primary myoblasts were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The following siRNAs (top strand sequence is shown) were used: JAK2(1) (5′-gca aac cag gaa ugc uca a), JAK2(2) (5′-gga aug gcc ugc cuu aca a), JAK2-scrambled (5′-guc aag aac cgc caa gau a), STAT2(1) (5′-gga cug guu ggc cga uua a), STAT2(2) (5′-gaa gug aau gca gag cuc uug uua g), STAT2-scrambled (5′-gug acu cag ugc gaa gug u), STAT3(1) (5′-uau cau cga ccu ugu gaa a), STAT3(2) (5′-cca acg acc ugc agc aau a), STAT3-scrambled (5′-gcc uac cgc acc aag aua a), and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (5′-gcu gac ccu gaa guu cau c). For plasmids and siRNA co-transfection, 1 μg of a plasmid was delivered into cells in each 35-mm well with 100 mM siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000.Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assays, the cells were first transfected and incubated in GM for 24 h, followed by growth in DM for another 24 h. The cells were then harvested in the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) at 4 °C for 10 min. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were obtained after centrifugation followed by removal of the debris. The luciferase activity was determined in a luminometor (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wilbad, Germany) and normalized to the amount of proteins present in each sample. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad.RT-PCR—For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). The expression levels of various genes were then detected by PCR. The following primers were used for detection of gene expression: myogenin (forward, 5′-gac tcc cca ctc ccc att cac ata; reverse, 5′-ggc ggc agc ttt aca aac aac aca), GAPDH (forward, 5′-tga tgc tgg tgc tga gta tgt cgt; reverse, 5′-tcc ttg gag gcc atg tag gcc at), MyoD (forward, 5′-agg ctc tgc tgc gcg acc; reverse, 5′-tgc agt cga tct ctc aaa gca cc); MEF2A (forward, 5′-tga cct gtc tgc cct gca; reverse, 5′-tta ggt cac cca tgt gtc), MEF2C (forward, 5′-tga cat ccg gtg cag gca c; reverse, 5′-gag tgc tag tgc aag ctc), IGF2 (forward, 5′-tgc tgc atc gct gct tac; reverse, 5′-tga ttc act gat ggt tgc tg), and HGF (forward, 5′-gac tat gaa gct tgg ctt g; reverse, 5′-ctc aca tgg tcc tga tcc).Antibodies, Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunostaining—The JAK2 and STAT2 antisera were generated by injecting rabbits with the following protein fragments: JAK2, amino acids 820–1129; STAT2, amino acids 315–568. Antibodies from serum were first affinity-purified by incubating with polyvinylidene difluoride membranes containing transferred antigens of JAK2 or STAT2 followed by washing and elusion. The antibodies were subsequently incubated with membranes transferred with the corresponding regions of JAK1 or STAT1 to eliminate those that cross-react with other family members. The sources of commercial antibodies used in this work were listed as follows: anti-phospho-tyrosine (05-321), anti-STAT1 (06-501) and anti-STAT2 (07-140) were from Millipore (Billerica, MA); anti-myogenin (SC-12732), anti-MyoD (SC-760), anti-MEF2 (SC-313), anti-β-actin (SC-8432), and anti-Gal4-DBD (SC-510) were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-β-tubulin (T4026) and anti-Flag (F3165) were from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) (MF20) was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA); anti-Ser(P)473-Akt (9271), anti-Thr(P)308-Akt (9275), anti-Akt (9272), anti-Thr(P)202, Tyr(P)204-ERK (9101), anti-ERK (9102), anti-STAT3 (9132), anti-Tyr(P)705-STAT3 (9131), and anti-JAK1 (3332) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Immunoblotting was carried out according to standard procedures. To perform immunostaining, primary myoblasts or cultured C2C12 cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies against either myogenin (1:10) or MHC (1:10) overnight. The cells were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole for 10 min to counterstain the nuclei. The images were taken by a CCD camera (Spot RT; Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) linked to an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope. Immunoprecipitation was generally performed by adding 1 μg of antibody to 500 μg of whole cell lysates together with 20 μl (bed volume) of protein A-Sepharose beads. The mixture was rotated for 2 h in 4 °C followed by extensive washing with the lysis buffer.Statistics—For statistical analysis, the p value was calculated using Student's t test with p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant.RESULTSInhibition of JAK2 with AG490 Inhibits Myogenic Differentiation— To evaluate the role of JAK2 in myogenic differentiation, we first treated C2C12 cells with AG490, a known inhibitor of JAK2, at the time when cells were induced to differentiate. Even by phase contrast microscopy, we could clearly see that the formation of multinucleated myotubes was inhibited by AG490 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, bottom panels). Consistently, we found that the expression of myogenin and MHC, two proteins that are present at the early and late stages of differentiation, respectively, and are commonly used as stage-specific differentiation markers, was significantly inhibited by AG490 as judged by both immunostaining and immunoblotting analysis with antibodies specific for myogenin and MHC (Fig. 1A, top panels). To find out whether AG490 has a similar inhibitory effect on primary myoblasts, we applied AG490 to primary myoblasts undergoing differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1C, the differentiation of primary myoblasts was significantly inhibited as evidenced by reduced myotube formation.Knockdown of JAK2 by siRNA Represses Myogenic Differentiation—Although it was convenient to employ pharmacological inhibitors like AG490 in our initial studies, it was necessary to complement and verify the drug study with more specific assays because many pharmacological inhibitors may inhibit some unknown cellular targets in addition to their intended and well characterized targets. To this end, we designed two different JAK2-specific siRNAs and two control siRNAs (i.e. an EGFP-specific siRNA and a scrambled JAK2-siRNA). C2C12 cells were first transfected with individual siRNA. The cells were then either grown in the GM or induced to differentiate in the DM. By Western blotting, we showed that both JAK2-siRNAs, but not the two control siRNAs, were specific and effective in knocking down JAK2 gene expression without affecting the expression of JAK1 gene (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1B). Importantly, both JAK2-siRNAs, but not the control siRNAs, significantly inhibited myogenic differentiation, as judged by reduced expression of myogenin and MHC in immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1D). To avoid unnecessary data duplication, the effect of one JAK2-specific siRNA was shown in subsequent assays. By semiquantitative RT-PCR, we showed that the JAK2-siRNA inhibited the expression of myogenin mRNA (Fig. 2B). Consistently, by reporter assays, we found that the JAK2-siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a 133-bp proximal myogenin promoter (i.e. G133-Luc) (24Xu Q. Wu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36750-36757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). By immunostaining, we also confirmed that the expression of myogenin and MHC was inhibited by the JAK2-siRNA (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we showed that the JAK2-siRNA also inhibited the differentiation of primary myoblasts, as evidenced by reduced number of multinucleated myotubes, especially those with four or more nuclei (Fig. 2E).FIGURE 2Knockdown of JAK2 by siRNA inhibits myogenic differentiation. 50% confluent C2C12 cells (A–D) or primary myoblasts (E) were transfected with either an EGFP-siRNA (control) or JAK2-siRNAs as indicated followed by growth in GM for 24 h. Nearly confluent cells were induced to differentiate in DM for various times as indicated. A, WCEs were subjected to immunoblotting by various antibodies. n.s., nonspecific. B, after cell harvest, total RNA was extracted. The mRNA levels of myogenin were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. GAPDH served as a loading control. C, C2C12 cells were co-transfected with siRNAs and G133-luc. After growth in GM for 24 h and DM for 24 h, the cells were harvested, and WCE were subjected to luciferase assays. Fold change was calculated as the ratio of the luciferase activity of cells transfected with the JAK2-siRNA over that with the EGFP-siRNA. D, C2C12 cells were fixed and subjected to immunostaining for either myogenin (left two columns, DM36 h) or MHC (right two columns, DM48 h). E, primary myoblasts were fixed and subjected to immunostaining for MHC. In D and E, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to counterstain the nuclei. Among MHC-positive myotubes in three randomly chosen fields (10× magnification), those with 2–3, 4–7, and >8 nuclei were separately counted. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. *, p < 0.05. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)JAK2 Is Required for Both the Expression and Transactivation Function of MyoD and MEF2—To explain at the molecular level why the interference of the JAK2 function by either AG490 or siRNA represses myogenic differentiation, we examined the status of MyoD and MEF2, because both are indispensable for myogenic differentiation and myogenic gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, compared with nontreated control cells, the AG490-treated cells had significantly reduced levels of MyoD and MEF2. Similarly, the cells treated with the JAK2-siRNA also had reduced levels of MyoD and MEF2 when compared with the control cells transfected with the EGFP-siRNA (Fig. 3B). As a control, we found that the levels of either β-actin or JAK1 were not affected by the JAK2-siRNA. Consistently, both MRF- and MEF2-dependent reporter genes (i.e. 4RE-luc and 3MEF2-luc respectively) displayed obviously reduced activities when cells were co-transfected with the JAK2-siRNA (Fig. 3C). By RT-PCR, we further determined that the JAK2-siRNA-mediated reduction in MyoD and MEF2 protein levels was mainly due to a reduction in their mRNA levels (Fig. 3D). This suggested that JAK2 normally regulates MyoD and MEF2 gene expression at the transcription level. In addition, we also tested whether the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MEF2 was affected by the JAK2-siRNA. To do this, we first fused MyoD or several MEF2 genes to a cDNA fragment encoding the DNA-binding domain (i.e. amino acids 1–147) of yeast Gal4. When these constructs were co-transfected into C2C12 cells with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of multiple Gal4-binding sites (i.e. Gal4-luc), the reporter gene expression was mainly determined by the transactivation domain of MyoD or MEF2 (41Sun L. Liu L. Yang X.J. Wu Z. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3021-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the presence of the JAK2-siRNA, the reporter activity was considerably reduced compared with that in the presence of the EGFP-siRNA (Fig. 3E). This suggests that JAK2 also regulates the transcriptional activity of both MyoD and MEF2, in addition to its effect on the transcription of MyoD and MEF2 genes.FIGURE 3Inhibition of JAK2 red"
https://openalex.org/W1972167068,"HIV-1 protease processes the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins into mature structural and functional proteins, including itself, and is therefore indispensable for viral maturation. The mature protease is active only as a dimer with each subunit contributing catalytic residues. The full-length transframe region protease precursor appears to be monomeric yet undergoes maturation via intramolecular cleavage of a putative precursor dimer, concomitant with the appearance of mature-like catalytic activity. How such intramolecular cleavage can occur when the amino and carboxy termini of the mature protease are part of an intersubunit beta-sheet located distal from the active site is unclear. Here we visualize the early events in N-terminal autoprocessing using an inactive mini-precursor with a four-residue N-terminal extension that mimics the transframe region protease precursor. Using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, a technique that is exquisitely sensitive to the presence of minor species, we show that the mini-precursor forms highly transient, lowly populated (3-5%) dimeric encounter complexes that involve the mature dimer interface but occupy a wide range of subunit orientations relative to the mature dimer. Furthermore, the occupancy of the mature dimer configuration constitutes a very small fraction of the self-associated species (accounting for the very low enzymatic activity of the protease precursor), and the N-terminal extension makes transient intra- and intersubunit contacts with the substrate binding site and is therefore available for autocleavage when the correct dimer orientation is sampled within the encounter complex ensemble."

Li W. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 660-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The critical role of LOX in tissue stability is well exemplified by “lathyrism,” the condition where deleterious effects in connective tissues are caused by lathyrogens such as ;-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) (2Levene C.I. Gross J. J. Exp. Med. 1959; 110: 771-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In lathyritic animals, bone is one of the most severely affected tissues revealing kyphoscoliosis, bone deformities, weakening of tendons and ligament attachments, dislocation of joints, impaired bone fracture healing, and ectopic bone exostoses (3Yeager V.L. Buranarugsa M.W. Arunatut O. J. Exp. Pathol. 1985; 2: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ekholm E.C. Ravanti L. Kahari V. Paavolainen P. Penttinen R.P. Bone (Elmsford). 2000; 27: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). BAPN is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of LOX catalytic activity and thus prevents cross-linking of immature collagen and elastin into mature, stable, and insoluble fibers. Therefore, it has been thought that the phenotypes seen in lathyritic animals are due primarily to the lack of collagen/elastin cross-linking.Recent reports, however, have revealed novel functions for LOX, including the regulation of gene transcription and cellular functions. Although the mechanisms are still not clear, those functions could be associated with its ability to oxidize substrates, other than collagen and elastin, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (5Li W. Nugent M.A. Zhao Y. Chau A.N. Li S.J. Chou I.N. Liu G. Kagan H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as well as histone H1 and H2 (6Giampuzzi M. Oleggini R.

Commun. 1983; 115: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, lathyritic phenotypes could be due in part to the loss of LOX control of cellular functions. Indeed, several studies have reported that collagen synthesis/expression significantly increased when osteoblasts or chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of BAPN (8Beekman B. Verzijl N.

It is also involved in the modulation of osteoclast differentiation (26Fox S.W. Lovibond A.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 243: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The abundance of this growth factor with such potent effects on cells in a dynamic environment of bone clearly requires the need for tight regulation of its biological activities.In this study, we investigated the potential interaction between LOX and TGF-;1 in vitro and in bone matrix, LOX control of TGF-;1 signaling, and its potential mechanism. The results indicated that LOX may play a pivotal role in regulation of TGF-;1 activity that is critical for bone physiology and pathology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Proteins—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Roche Diagnostics), anti-phospho-Smad3 antibody (BIOSOURCE), anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody (Sigma), anti-Smad3, anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 and anti-;-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies), and anti-TGF-;1 antibody (R & D Systems).

The medium was changed twice a week.Molecular Cloning of Mouse LOX cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from MC cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Two ;g of total RNA was used for reverse transcription (RT), and the cDNA was synthesized using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). The cDNA containing the coding region of the mouse LOX was generated by PCR using Hotstar Taq polymerase (Qiagen). The sequences of the primers were designed as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCCGGTCTTCCTTTTTCTCCTAGCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ATACGGTGAAATTGTGCAGCCTGA-3′.

To obtain pcDNA3/LOXdm/V5-His (LOXdm, LOX with double mutations converting lysine 314 to alanine and tyrosine 349 to phenylalanine resulting in an inactive LOX) (29Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the following two additional sets of primers were used: forward primer, 5′-GCTGAAGGCCACGCAGCAAGCTTCTGT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACAGAAGCTTGCTGCGTGGCCTTCAGC-3′, and forward primer 5′-TGTTATGACACCTTTGCGGCAGACATA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TATGTCTGCCGCAAAGGTGTCATAACA-3′.

The sequences of the primers were designed as follows: forward primer, 5′-CATGCCGCCCTCGGGGCTG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCTGCACTTGCAGGAGCGC-3′. 293 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3/LOX/HA vector and pcDNA3.1/TGF-;1/V5-His or pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector harboring the coding sequences of bone morphogenetic proteins-2, -4, -6, or -7 (BMP-2, -4, -6, and -7) that are available in our laboratory (31Mochida Y. Parisuthiman D. Yamauchi M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 585: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After co-transfection, the cultured media were collected and immunoprecipitated with either anti-V5 or anti-HA antibody. The samples were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose 4B conjugate beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min, and the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1.5% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein bound to the beads was dissolved in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, and 4% SDS) in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, applied to 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis with anti-V5 or anti-HA antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). To determine whether LOX binds to the propeptide of TGF-;1 (latency-associated peptide, LAP) or mature TGF-;1, pcDNA3.1/LAP/V5-His was subcloned from pcDNA3.1/TGF-;1/V5-His by PCR. The primers designed were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCTGCACTTGCAGGAGCGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TCTCCGGTGCCGTGAGCTGTG-3′. The PCR product was then ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO mammalian expression vector and sequenced, and the plasmid containing LAP cDNA in a sense orientation (pcDNA3.1/LAP/V5-His) was obtained. 293 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3/LOX/HA and either pcDNA3.1/TGF-;1/V5-His or pcDNA3.1/LAP/V5-His, using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. The total amounts of plasmid were kept constant (2.5 ;g) by supplementing pcDNA3.1/V5-HisA (empty vector; Invitrogen). The media were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot (IP-WB) analysis in the same manner as described above.To investigate the binding domain of LOX to mature TGF-;1, 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/TGF-;1/V5-His and pcDNA3/LOX/HA, pcDNA3/mLOX/HA, pcDNA3/LOXdm/HA, or pcDNA3/LOXPP/HA, and the media were collected and subjected to IP-WB analysis in the same manner as described above.Generation of 293 Cell-derived Stable Clones Overexpressing LOX—293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/LOX/V5-His construct as described above. After transfection, cells were cultured in the presence of 400 ;g/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 3–4 weeks to select stable clones. Positive clones derived from single G418-resistant cells were then isolated by cloning rings and further grown in the same conditions. As a control, 293 cells were also transfected with empty vector, and the stable clones (EV clones) were generated in the same manner. The cultured medium from each clone was subjected to IP-WB analysis with anti-V5 antibody to verify the LOX-V5/His protein (LOX-V5).Purification and Identification of LOX-V5/His Fusion Protein—The 293-derived clones that synthesized the highest level of LOX-V5 were cultured onto 15-cm plates for 6 days, and the culture media were collected in the presence of protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). LOX-V5 was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) at 4 °C, and the purified proteins were pooled, dialyzed against 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 8.2, and kept at -80 °C until used. The protein concentrations were measured by a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). To assess the purity of LOX-V5, aliquots of the sample were dissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining or WB analysis. For the latter analysis, two anti-LOX antibodies (anti-LOXi and anti-LOXh) and anti-V5 antibody were used. The major Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained protein bands on the gel were cut and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-MS) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Proteomics Facility to confirm the identity of LOX.LOX Activity Assay—The LOX enzyme activity was measured using the Amplex Ultra Red fluorescence assay (32Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Five or 10 ;g of LOX-V5 with or without 500 ;m BAPN was suspended in 2 ml of 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.2, containing, 1.2 m urea, 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase (Biochemika), 10 ;m Amplex Red (Molecular Probes), 10 mm 1,5-diaminopentane dihydrochloride (Sigma). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the fluorescence intensities were measured with excitation and emission wavelength at 563 and 587 nm, respectively, using F2000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi).GST Pulldown Assay—The sequences of the primers were designed to amplify the mature form of TGF-;1 (residues 279–390) and they were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCGAATTCGCCCTGGATACCAACTATTGCTTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCCTCGAGTCAGCTGCACTTGCAGGAGCGCAC-3′. The PCR products were amplified using the normal mouse kidney cDNA as a template, purified, and ligated into a pGEX4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) and transformed into BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene). An empty pGEX4T-1 vector was also transformed into the bacterial cells to produce GST protein alone. After DNA purification, plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequenced, and the plasmid harboring the mature form of GST-TGF-;1 (pGEX4T-1-TGF-;1) was obtained. After the bacteria transformed with pGEX4T-1-TGF-;1 or pGEX4T-1 were cultured for several hours at 37 °C, 250 ;m of isopropyl d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to induce the synthesis of GST-TGF-;1 or GST protein. After incubating for 24 h at 20 °C, the cultures were centrifuged, lysed in a buffer containing PBS and 1% Triton X-100, and sonicated for 20 s three times with an interval of 3 min on ice. The lysates were collected by centrifugation, incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were extensively washed with PBS. The recombinant GST-TGF-;1 and GST proteins were then released from the beads with the elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were measured by a DC protein assay kit. The purity of the recombinant proteins was assessed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE.GST pulldown was then performed in the following manner. Five ;g of GST or purified GST-TGF-;1 fusion proteins (2.5 or 5 ;g) were incubated with 10 ;g of LOX-V5 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were then added and further incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, including 0.02% Tween 20 (TBST), and the proteins bound were released by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to WB analysis with anti-V5 antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit.Direct Binding of LOX-V5 and rhTGF-;1 by Immunoprecipitation—Two hundred ng of rhTGF-;1 were incubated with 10 ;g of LOX-V5 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 4 °C. The complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody, and the protein G-Sepharose 4B conjugate beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were then added to the solutions and further incubated for 30 min. The samples were treated in the same manner as described above and subjected to WB analysis with anti-V5 antibody.Laser-scanning Confocal Microscopy—The co-localization of LOX and TGF-;1 was investigated in a MC cell culture system by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. MC cells were cultured for 3 weeks as described above, washed with PBS, and fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cell/matrix layer was then cut into 1 × 1-cm pieces and placed on a glass slide. The slides were then immersed in PBS and treated with 20 ;g/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min. Samples were incubated with two primary antibodies, i.e. anti-TGF-;1 and anti-LOXi antibodies, in PBS containing 1.5% goat serum for 30 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with species-specific fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies, mouse Alexa Fluor 594 and rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), for 30 min each. After washing with PBS, the specimens were mounted, and the immunofluorescence was observed under a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, microscopy services laboratory.Identification of LOX-TGF-;1 Complex in Bone Matrix—Femurs obtained from 0 to 1-year-old bovine animals were purchased from Aries Scientific (Dallas, TX) and kept at -80 °C until use. Both femoral heads were removed and the mid-shafts were longitudinally cut. After the bone marrow was removed and washed with cold PBS, bones were cut into small pieces, defatted with methylene chloride and methanol solution (2:1) overnight at 4 °C, washed with cold distilled water, and lyophilized. The bone fragments were then pulverized to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a freezer mill (Spex Certiprep), washed with cold distilled water, lyophilized, and subjected to sequential extraction by the method reported previously (33Linde A. Bhown M. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5931-5942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Termine J.D. Belcourt A.B. Conn K.M. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol.

Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 g of bone powder was first extracted with 5 ml of 6 m guanidine-HCl (GH), pH 7.4, for 2 days at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, exhaustively dialyzed against cold distilled water, and lyophilized (G1 representing the matrix molecules that are not associated with mineral). The residue (mineral-associated matrix) was then demineralized with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.4, for 2 weeks at 4 °C with several changes of EDTA, and the supernatants were separated by centrifugation as described above, pooled, dialyzed against cold distilled water, and lyophilized (E representing soluble matrix molecules associated with mineral). The residue was further extracted with 5 ml of 6 m GH, pH 7.4, for 2 days at 4 °C, and the extract was collected as described above (G2 including mineral-associated, insoluble matrix). All fractions were weighed, dissolved in lysis buffer, and centrifuged. The protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined by a DC protein assay kit. Fifteen ;g of proteins in each fraction was dissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to WB analysis with either anti-LOXi or anti-TGF-;1 antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit. To confirm the specific binding, various amounts of E fraction (500, 1000, and 2000 ;g of protein) dissolved in lysis buffer were immunoprecipitated with either 5 ;l of anti-LOXi or anti-LOXh antibodies or 5 ;l of normal rabbit serum (negative control) overnight at 4 °C. Then protein G-Sepharose 4B conjugate beads were added and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The immunocomplex was then released from the beads as described above and subjected to WB analysis with anti-TGF-;1 antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit.Effect of LOX on Smad Phosphorylation—To determine the effect of LOX on the TGF-;1 activity, MC cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 2.0 × 105/dish in duplicate and cultured. MC cells were transiently transfected with 1, 2.5, and 5 ;g of the pcDNA3.1/LOX/V5-His using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After 48 h, cells were treated with rhTGF-;1 (5 ng/ml) for 30 min in the presence or absence of 300 ;m BAPN or 200 units/ml of catalase (Worthington). Another set of cells was transiently transfected with 5 ;g of pcDNA3.1/LOXdm/V5-His and treated with rhTGF-;1 in the presence or absence of BAPN. The cells were lysed with 400 ;l of RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants collected were then subjected to WB analysis with anti-phospho-Smad3 (BIOSOURCE) and anti-Smad3 antibodies (Cell Signaling). The intensity of phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3) protein from each sample was normalized to that of total Smad3 protein using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). The expression level of LOX in the cultured medium was quantified by IP-WB analysis with anti-LOXi antibody.The effect of LOX on BMP signaling was also examined. MC cells were plated and cultured as described above and transiently transfected with 1, 2.5, and 5 ;g of the pcDNA3.1/LOX/V5-His using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After 48 h, cells were treated with rhBMP-2 (100 ng/ml) for 30 min in the presence or absence of 300 ;m BAPN. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to WB analysis with anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 and ;-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling). The intensity of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8) protein from each sample was normalized to that of ;-actin protein using Scion Image software. The expression level of LOX in the cultured medium was evaluated by IP-WB analysis with anti-V5 antibody.In another set of experiments, MC cells were cultured as described above. On the following day, cells were treated with 2.5 or 5 ;g of LOX-V5, 5 ;g of LOX-V5 with 300 ;m BAPN, or 300 ;m BAPN alone. Cells were then treated with 5 ng/ml rhTGF-;1 for 30 min, and the phosphorylation of Smad3 was evaluated in the same manner as described above.RNA Interference—MC cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 5.0 × 104/dish in duplicate and cultured in the same manner as described above. On the following day, cells were transfected with 3.75 ;g of LOX siRNA ID 156159, 156160, 156161 or Silencer negative control AM4611 (Ambion) using siPORT amine transfection agent (Ambion). After 48 h, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml rhTGF-;1 for 30 min, and Smad3 phosphorylation was examined in the same manner as described above.

https://openalex.org/W1971011445,"The conduct of Phase I/II HIV vaccine trials internationally necessitates the development of region-specific clinical reference ranges for trial enrollment and participant monitoring. A population based cohort of adults in Kericho, Kenya, a potential vaccine trial site, allowed development of clinical laboratory reference ranges. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed on 1293 HIV seronegative study participants. Hematology and clinical chemistry were performed on up to 1541 cohort enrollees. The ratio of males to females was 1.9:1. Means, medians and 95% reference ranges were calculated and compared with those from other nations. The median CD4+ T cell count for the group was 810 cells/microl. There were significant gender differences for both red and white blood cell parameters. Kenyan subjects had lower median hemoglobin concentrations (9.5 g/dL; range 6.7-11.1) and neutrophil counts (1850 cells/microl; range 914-4715) compared to North Americans. Kenyan clinical chemistry reference ranges were comparable to those from the USA, with the exception of the upper limits for bilirubin and blood urea nitrogen, which were 2.3-fold higher and 1.5-fold lower, respectively. This study is the first to assess clinical reference ranges for a highland community in Kenya and highlights the need to define clinical laboratory ranges from the national community not only for clinical research but also care and treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2015663252,"We report the isolation of a novel vitamin K-dependent protein from the calcified cartilage of Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser nacarii). This 10.2-kDa secreted protein contains 16 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues in its 74-residue sequence, the highest Gla percent of any known protein, and we have therefore termed it Gla-rich protein (GRP). GRP has a high charge density (36 negative + 16 positive = 20 net negative) yet is insoluble at neutral pH. GRP has orthologs in all taxonomic groups of vertebrates, and a paralog (GRP2) in bony fish; no GRP homolog was found in invertebrates. There is no significant sequence homology between GRP and the Gla-containing region of any presently known vitamin K-dependent protein. Forty-seven GRP sequences were obtained by a combination of cDNA cloning and comparative genomics: all 47 have a propeptide that contains a γ-carboxylase recognition site and a mature protein with 14 highly conserved Glu residues, each of them being γ-carboxylated in sturgeon. The protein sequence of GRP is also highly conserved, with 78% identity between sturgeon and human GRP. Analysis of the corresponding gene structures suggests a highly constrained organization, particularly for exon 4, which encodes the core Gla domain. GRP mRNA is found in virtually all rat and sturgeon tissues examined, with the highest expression in cartilage. Cells expressing GRP include chondrocytes, chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. Because of its potential to bind calcium through Gla residues, we suggest that GRP may regulate calcium in the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2035897455,"Formation of female gametes requires acentriolar spindle assembly during meiosis. Mitotic spindles organize from centrosomes and via local activation of the RanGTPase on chromosomes. Vertebrate oocytes present a RanGTP gradient centred on chromatin at all stages of meiotic maturation. However, this gradient is dispensable for assembly of the first meiotic spindle. To understand this meiosis I peculiarity, we studied TPX2, a Ran target, in mouse oocytes. Strikingly, TPX2 activity is controlled at the protein level through its accumulation from meiosis I to II. By RNAi depletion and live imaging, we show that TPX2 is required for spindle assembly via two distinct functions. It controls microtubule assembly and spindle pole integrity via the phosphorylation of TACC3, a regulator of MTOCs activity. We show that meiotic spindle formation in vivo depends on the regulation of at least a target of Ran, TPX2, rather than on the regulation of the RanGTP gradient itself."
https://openalex.org/W2046803736,"Post-translational modifications of histones play a critical role in regulating genome structures and integrity. We have focused on the regulatory relationship between covalent modifications of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3S10 during the cell cycle. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that H3S10 phosphorylation in HeLa, A549, and HCT116 cells was high during prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase, whereas H3K9 monomethylation (H3K9me1) and dimethylation (H3K9me2), but not H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), were significantly suppressed. When H3S10 phosphorylation started to diminish during anaphase, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals reemerged. Western blot analyses confirmed that mitotic histones, extracted in an SDS-containing buffer, had little H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals but abundant H3K9me3 signals. However, when mitotic histones were extracted in the same buffer without SDS, the difference in H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals between interphase and mitotic cells disappeared. Removal of H3S10 phosphorylation by pretreatment with λ-phosphatase unmasked mitotic H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals detected by both fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting. Further, H3S10 phosphorylation completely blocked methylation of H3K9 but not demethylation of the same residue in vitro. Given that several conserved motifs consisting of a Lys residue immediately followed by a Ser residue are present in histone tails, our studies reveal a potential new mechanism by which phosphorylation not only regulates selective access of methylated lysines by cellular factors but also serves to preserve methylation patterns and epigenetic programs during cell division. Post-translational modifications of histones play a critical role in regulating genome structures and integrity. We have focused on the regulatory relationship between covalent modifications of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3S10 during the cell cycle.

Removal of H3S10 phosphorylation by pretreatment with λ-phosphatase unmasked mitotic H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals detected by both fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting. Further, H3S10 phosphorylation completely blocked methylation of H3K9 but not demethylation of the same residue in vitro. Given that several conserved motifs consisting of a Lys residue immediately followed by a Ser residue are present in histone tails, our studies reveal a potential new mechanism by which phosphorylation not only regulates selective access of methylated lysines by cellular factors but also serves to preserve methylation patterns and epigenetic programs during cell division. Histones are highly conserved proteins with a globular domain and a flexible amino-terminal tail. Covalent modifications of histone tails are essential biochemical processes that function to control the eukaryotic genomes. Extensive research in the past has demonstrated that reversible phosphorylation and methylation, as well as other post-translational modifications, play a critical role in regulating the dynamic condensation/relaxation of chromosomes that occur during DNA replication/repair, transcription, and cell cycle progression (1Rice K.L. Hormaeche I. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6697-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (p-H3S10) is tightly associated with cell cycle progression; it also occurs when cells are exposed to certain environmental stresses or growth stimuli (3Bode A.M. Dong Z. Science's STKE. 2005; 2005: re4PubMed Google Scholar). Although p-H3S10 is minimal in interphase, it greatly increases during mitosis and meiosis (4Nowak S.J. Corces V.G. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 214-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 5Prigent C. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Following the development of antibodies specific for p-H3S10, the precise temporal and spatial patterns of p-H3S10 have been clearly described in mammalian cells (6Van Hooser A. Goodrich D.W. Allis C.D. Brinkley B.R. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p-H3S10 is initiated in late G2; it spreads throughout the chromatin and persists during prophase and metaphase as chromosomes undergo high orders of condensation. p-H3S10 rapidly diminishes during late anaphase and essentially disappears upon mitotic exit (6Van Hooser A. Goodrich D.W. Allis C.D. Brinkley B.R. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same cell cycle dependence of p-H3S10 was also demonstrated in plant and lower eukaryotic cells (7Wei Y. Yu L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 8Kaszas E. Cande W.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3217-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, H3S10 is primarily phosphorylated by Aurora B during mitosis (9Hirota T. Lipp J.J. Toh B.H. Peters J.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), whereas its phosphorylation is regulated by c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein (JNK/MAP) kinases when the cells are exposed heavy metals such as nickel (10Ke Q. Li Q. Ellen T.P. Sun H. Costa M. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Many lysine residues in histone tails are methylated (2Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 11Sutherland J.E. Costa M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that histone methylation is also a reversible process. Methylation of specific histone residues and the extent of methylation (mono-, di, and/or trimethylation) on the same residues are either critical for regulating gene expression or marks of heterochromatin and euchromatin in various organisms (2Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 12Ebert A. Lein S. Schotta G. Reuter G. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Tachibana M. Nozaki M. Takeda N. Shinkai Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3346-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It becomes increasingly clear that the methylation status of histones is essential for regulating transcription, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. Mitosis is a unique cell cycle phase in which duplicated chromosomes are highly condensed. This high order of chromatin compaction is particularly important for accurate chromosomal segregation and genomic stability maintenance during cell division. Because histones, primarily as scaffold proteins, function to facilitate the formation of high order structures of chromatin, we proposed that there existed cross-talk between histone methylation and phosphorylation during mitosis. Cell Culture—HeLa and A549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). HCT116 cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein. Cells were cultured in culture dishes or on Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Fisher Scientific) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole overnight. Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min on ice before being permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were blocked in PBS 2The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer. containing 2.0% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. Primary antibodies and fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted into the same medium. Cells were incubated with antibodies to histone H3 mono-, di-, and/or trimethylated lysine 9 (H3K9me1, H3K9me1, or H3K9me3) (AbCam) and phosphohistone H3 (p-H3S10) (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature. Then cells were incubated with Alexa 488- (green) or Alexa 594- (red) conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then co-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 mg/ml, Fluka), a DNA dye, for 5 min followed by washing three times with PBS. Images were collected using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system. Histone Extraction—Cells were lysed in either a Triton X-100-based extraction buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v)) or a RIPA containing SDS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) on ice for 10 min with gentle agitation. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellets were washed two times with a Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0, 10 mm). Pellets were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Washed pellets were resuspended in 0.4 n H2SO4 and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were collected. Extracted histones were then precipitated by the addition of acetone. The precipitated histones were resuspended in 4 m urea. Immunoblotting—Approximately equal amounts of histones were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electro-transferring fractionated samples to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein blots were probed with antibodies to H3K9me1, H3K9me, or H3K9me3. Specific signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Specific signals were detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo Inc.). Equal amounts of histone loading were determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphatase Treatment—HeLa cells grown on chamber slides were fixed and incubated in a phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.01% (w/v) Brij-35) supplemented with or without λ-phosphatase (5 units/ml, New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 25 °C. At the end of incubation, cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with antibodies for fluorescence microscopy. Protein blots were incubated in the same phosphatase buffer as above supplemented with or without λ-phosphatase (5 units/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing, the blots were probed for H3K9me2 signals. In Vitro Histone Methylation Transfer Assay—One μg of biotin-conjugated histone H3 peptide or phospho(Ser-10)-histone H3 peptide (amino acids 1-21; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was mixed with 0.15 μg of recombinant G9a (Upstate Biotechnology) and 1.1 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (13.3 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a histone methylation transfer buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The experiment was performed in triplicate. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 or 17 h, 10 μl of reaction mixture was spotted onto a P81 phosphocellulose filter (Upstate Biotechnology). The P81 filter was washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate solution. The filter was then air-dried. The radioactivity retained on the filter was counted with a Wallac liquid scintillation counter model 1409 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro Demethylation Assay—Histones were extracted from both interphase and mitotic HeLa cells and dissolved in water. Recombinant FLAG-JHDM2A was expressed in insect Sf9 cells and purified by affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG resin (Sigma). For each in vitro demethylation assay, 3 μg of purified FLAG-JHDM2A protein was incubated with 5 μg of histones extracted from either mitotic or interphase HeLa cells, in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 100 μm FeSO4, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm ascorbic acid. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, EDTA, a chelator of divalent ions, was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to terminate the reactions. In a control reaction, EDTA was added to the reaction buffer before the addition of recombinant FLAG-JHDM2A protein. After the reaction, the H3K9 methylation and H3S10 phosphorylation status were detected by immunoblotting. Given that H3K9 and H3S10 are well studied residues and that excellent antibodies are available for biochemical and cellular characterizations, we examined the status of H3K9 dimethylation as well as H3S10 phosphorylation in the same cells via fluorescence microscopy. Mitotic cells contained a high level of phosphorylated H3S10 (p-H3S10) (Fig. 1, arrows), whereas interphase cells had no detectable levels of the phosphorylation. In contrast, H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) levels were uniformly high in interphase cells; these signals were either greatly diminished or disappeared in prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase cells (Fig. 1, arrows). Intriguingly, H3K9me2 levels reappeared when cells entered anaphase (Fig. 1, arrows). Because H3K9 mono- and dimethylation are catalyzed by the same lysine methyltransferase (13Tachibana M. Nozaki M. Takeda N. Shinkai Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3346-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), we examined the patterns of H3K9me1 in interphase and mitotic cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that when compared with those of interphase cells, H3K9me1 levels were also greatly diminished during prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase (Fig. 2A, arrows). On the other hand, H3K9me1 signals in anaphase cells reappeared, the levels of which were comparable with those in interphase cells (Fig. 2A, arrows). Thus, oscillation of H3K9me1 signals were parallel with those of H3K9me2, suggesting a similar underlying mechanism that affects the availability or detection of methylation signals. As control, we also analyzed H3K9me3 because this methylation, catalyzed by a different lysine methyltransferase, is regulated differentially during the cell cycle (15Fodor B.D. Kubicek S. Yonezawa M. O'Sullivan R.J. Sengupta R. Perez-Burgos L. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Schotta G. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1557-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Krouwels I.M. Wiesmeijer K. Abraham T.E. Molenaar C. Verwoerd N.P. Tanke H.J. Dirks R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although H3K9me3 signals were barely detectable in interphase cells, they increased in mitotic cells (Fig. 2B, arrows). However, different from those of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, H3K9me3 signals exhibited a punctuated pattern (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with its known localization at heterochromatin (16Krouwels I.M. Wiesmeijer K. Abraham T.E. Molenaar C. Verwoerd N.P. Tanke H.J. Dirks R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To eliminate a peculiar possibility that the absence of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals in early mitotic cells was cell line-specific, we also examined H3K9me1 in A549 cells. We observed that H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 levels were significantly reduced in prophase, metaphase, and anaphase cells when compared with those of interphase cells (Fig. 3, arrows). Again, these signals reemerged when the cells entered anaphase (Fig. 3, arrows). Thus, our fluorescence microscopy reveals a common phenomenon that mono- and dimethylation of H3K9 is greatly suppressed in mitotic cells until anaphase. Next we analyzed the levels of H3K9 methylation using Western blotting. HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent arresting cells at prometaphase. Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. Collected mitotic cells, as well as interphase cells, were quickly lysed in a RIPA containing SDS. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 levels were low in mitotic cells, whereas they were high in interphase cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, H3K9me3 levels, low in interphase cells, were slightly increased in mitotic cells (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, when histones were extracted with the RIPA containing no SDS, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals, detected by immunoblotting, were high in mitotic cells. In fact, mitotic H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals were indistinguishable from interphase signals (Fig. 4A). In other words, the differences in H3K9 methylation between interphase and mitotic cells disappeared when a mild extraction buffer was used in the preparation of cell lysates. We suspected that an SDS-labile factor(s) might control the status of H3S10 phosphorylation, which in turn affected the recognition of methylation of H3K9. To test this possibility, HeLa cells grown on chamber slides were fixed and then treated with or without λ-phosphatase, which was capable of removing phosphate residues of many phospho-proteins. Upon treatment with λ-phosphatase, H3S10 was efficiently dephosphorylated when compared with that of controls (Fig. 4B, arrows). Surprisingly, dephosphorylation of H3S10 unmasked H3K9me2 signals in mitotic cells (Fig. 4B, arrows for prophase and metaphase cells). The phosphorylation-induced masking of methylation signals at H3K9 was not just limited to HeLa cells. Upon incubation with λ-phosphatase, strong H3K9me2 signals were detected in both A549 and HCT116 cells of various mitotic stages (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 1). These results thus strongly suggest that H3S10 phosphorylation greatly interferes with the detection of methylation on the neighboring residue by fluorescence microscopy. To further confirm the possibility that H3S10 phosphorylation masked H3K9 methylation epitopes, interphase and mitotic histones extracted with the SDS-containing RIPA were fractionated on denaturing gels. Two identical blots with fractionated interphase and mitotic histones were incubated for 10 min in a PBS buffer supplemented with or without λ-phosphatase. The treated blots were then probed with the antibody to H3K9me2. As expected, mitotic histones contained greatly reduced H3K9me2 signals when compared with those of interphase histones; however, λ-phosphatase treatment uncovered H3K9me2 signals in mitotic histones (Fig. 5B), indicating that phosphorylation at the adjacent serine residue interfered with the binding or recognition of H3K9 methylation by the cognate antibody. To test the possibility that H3S10 phosphorylation would block the access of cellular factor(s) to H3K9, we performed in vitro histone methylation assays. Biotin-conjugated histone H3 peptide or its Ser-10 phospho-counterpart was incubated in a reaction containing recombinant histone methyltransferase G9a, which is capable of targeting H3K9. Histone H3 peptide was rapidly methylated, detected as incorporation of radiolabeled methyl group into acid-insoluble peptide precipitates (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, Ser-10 phosphorylation completely blocked methylation of the peptide (Fig. 6A), indicating that phosphorylation of the serine residue greatly suppressed further modifications of the neighboring lysine residue. We then asked whether H3S10 phosphorylation would have an effect on demethylation. Interphase and mitotic cell histones were incubated with or without JHDM2A, a Fe2+-dependent histone demethylase specific for H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 (17Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, JHDM2A efficiently demethylated both H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, and this demethylation was completely blocked by the addition of EDTA. Intriguingly, both interphase and mitotic histone H3 molecules were demethylated at a similar rate, although mitotic histone H3 was highly phosphorylated on Ser-10 (Fig. 6B). Given that all histone H3 molecules are phosphorylated during mitosis (18Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), our observations suggest that H3S10 phosphorylation may selectively blocks the access of cellular regulators to H3K9 in vivo. In our study, we have revealed an unrecognized phenomenon in studying covalent modifications of histones. Phosphorylation of H3S10 is required for chromosomal condensation; it is also tightly associated with mitotic progression (6Van Hooser A. Goodrich D.W. Allis C.D. Brinkley B.R. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wei Y. Yu L. Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We have shown that this phosphorylation interferes with antibody recognition of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, as well as with in vitro methylation of H3K9 peptide. H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 signals detected by cognate antibodies were lowest between early prophase and early anaphase when H3S10 phosphorylation and chromatin condensation is at the highest. When dephosphorylation of H3S10 occurs during anaphase, the signals of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 reemerge (Figs. 1 and 2). At present, we do not know the exact molecular basis that explains failed recognition of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 by specific antibodies when adjacent serine residue is phosphorylated. It could be due to stereo hindrance or masked antibody epitopes. Quantitative phosphorylation of H3S10 can add a bulky phosphate group affecting the conformation of neighbor amino acid residues. In addition, the high order of chromatin structures in mitotic cells can also affect the overall conformation of histone tails. It is conceivable that phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes in chromatin can prevent the binding of specific antibodies to H3K9me1 and H3K9me2. Alternatively, given the negative charge of the phosphate group, it is also possible that charge-charge interaction is substantially altered, resulting in inaccessibility of molecules recognizing H3K9me1 and H3K9me2. This appears to be an attractive possibility because the antibody epitopes of denatured proteins remain unmasked until removal of the phosphate residues (Fig. 5B). The significance of our discovery is beyond technical considerations. It is highly possible that H3S10 phosphorylation is an important mechanism by which other covalent modifications of histone tails, including H3K9 methylation, are co-regulated during cell cycle progression. Specifically, cellular molecules (e.g. lysine methyltransferases), similar to those of the antibodies, are prevented from interacting with H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 in mitotic cells. Our in vitro histone methylation studies strongly support this notion (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, H3S10 phosphorylation does not prevent the access of JHDM2A because interphase and mitotic histone H3 molecules are demethylated at a similar rate by the enzyme (Fig. 6B). The latter observation suggests that H3K9 remains accessible by certain proteins in vivo, although its immediate downstream amino acid is phosphorylated during mitosis. It is also conceivable that new groups of molecules may become associated with H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 during mitosis or stress responses after H3S10 phosphorylation. H3K9 mono- and dimethylation mediated by G9a plays an important role in regulating euchromatin. Given that gene expression is greatly influenced by chromatin structures, which in turn are controlled, to a large extent, by covalent modification of histones, it is conceivable that histone methylation patterns in euchromatin need to be tightly regulated. One attractive model is that H3S10 phosphorylation may serve to selectively prevent the methylation status (i.e. H3K9me1 or H3K9me2) from being further modulated during mitosis, therefore faithfully preserving gene expression patterns. It is imperative that two daughter cells inherit not only the same set of genetic information but also identical epigenetic programs during cell division. Analysis of histone tails reveals additional adjacent lysine and serine structures. For example, H3K27, also an important epigenetic marker, is methylated, and its methylation is reversible (12Ebert A. Lein S. Schotta G. Reuter G. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Swigut T. Wysocka J. Cell. 2007; 131: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Importantly, H3S28 is also phosphorylated during mitosis and meiosis (20Houben A. Demidov D. Caperta A.D. Karimi R. Agueci F. Vlasenko L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1769: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). During meiosis, reversible acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 including serine 28 are key events in chromatin morphology and meiotic chromosome condensation (21Bui H.T. Van Thuan N. Kishigami S. Wakayama S. Hikichi T. Ohta H. Mizutani E. Yamaoka E. Wakayama T. Miyano T. Reproduction (Camb.). 2007; 133: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Besides histone H3, histone H2B contains a lysine residue (Lys-5) followed by serine residue (Ser-6). At present, it remains unknown whether Lys-5 is methylated and Ser-6 is phosphorylated and whether potential covalent modifications of these residues are regulated during the cell cycle. Given that H2B is phosphorylated in yeast (22Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) and that histone modifications are very conserved throughout eukaryotes, it is tempting to speculate that H2BK5 and H2BS6 may be regulated in a fashion similar to that of lysines and serines in histone H3 during cell division. The past decade has witnessed a rapid increase in the study of reversible modifications of histones as a basic mechanism regulating their structures and functions. The identification of histone demethylases has ushered in a new era in the study of histone methylation as an important mechanism controlling chromatin remodeling, gene expression, and epigenetic regulation. As the result, numerous research papers have been published that study the level of H3K9 methylation and its regulation. Our current study, however, calls for a need to interpret with caution the results of some published studies, especially regarding the methylation level of H3K9 during the cell cycle. Covalent modifications of histones are central to cell cycle progression and genomic stability. Ever increasing numbers and combinations of covalent modifications of histone tails can offer great diversity in epigenetically controlling the cell cycle, as well as development of organisms. Chromosome condensation and decondensation are a cyclic process during cell division. At the molecular level, histone tail modifications may represent transient, yet critical, marks modulating chromatin structures, thus allowing orderly progression of the cell cycle and faithful maintenance of genomic stability from generation to generation. Elucidation of the regulatory relationship between various types of histone modifications promises to reveal an additional layer of epigenetic mechanisms controlling the division of stem cells, somatic cells, and cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2087039291,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme for the synthesis of the four DNA building blocks. Class Ia RNRs contain two subunits, denoted R1 (α) and R2 (β). These enzymes are regulated via two nucleotide-binding allosteric sites on the R1 subunit, termed the specificity and overall activity sites. The specificity site binds ATP, dATP, dTTP, or dGTP and determines the substrate to be reduced, whereas the overall activity site binds dATP (inhibitor) or ATP. By using gas-phase electrophoretic mobility macromolecule analysis and enzyme assays, we found that the Escherichia coli class Ia RNR formed an inhibited α4β4 complex in the presence of dATP and an active α2β2 complex in the presence of ATP (main substrate: CDP), dTTP (substrate: GDP) or dGTP (substrate: ADP). The R1-R2 interaction was 30–50 times stronger in the α4β4 complex than in the α2β2 complex, which was in equilibrium with free α2 and β2 subunits. Studies of a known E. coli R1 mutant (H59A) showed that deficient dATP inhibition correlated with reduced ability to form α4β4 complexes. ATP could also induce the formation of a generally inhibited α4β4 complex in the E. coli RNR but only when used in combination with high concentrations of the specificity site effectors, dTTP/dGTP. Both allosteric sites are therefore important for α4β4 formation and overall activity regulation. The E. coli RNR differs from the mammalian enzyme, which is stimulated by ATP also in combination with dGTP/dTTP and forms active and inactive α6β2 complexes.

RNRs can be divided into three different classes (I, II, and III) mainly based on different cofactors for the catalytic activity, oxygen dependence, and mechanism for free radical generation (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Class Ia RNRs (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) contain two non-identical subunits, denoted R1 (α) and R2 (β), that are both needed for enzyme activity. In bacteria, the two subunits are often referred to as NrdA and NrdB, respectively. The required radical for ribonucleotide reduction is generated on a tyrosine residue in the R2 protein and transferred via a radical transfer pathway to the R1 protein where the catalysis occurs. The R1 protein contains the substrate binding site and two allosteric sites termed the specificity and overall activity sites. Based on differences in allosteric regulation and polypeptide sequence, class I RNRs are further subgrouped into class Ia and Ib (4Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Class Ia enzymes have an overall activity site, whereas class Ib lacks the N-terminal region where the overall activity site is located. ribonucleotide reductase gasphase electrophoretic mobility macromolecule analysis/analyzer ribonucleoside-5′-diphosphate dithiothreitol surface plasmon resonance high performance liquid chromatography Class Ia RNRs are found almost in all eukaryotic organisms and some bacteria, viruses, and bacteriophages (see the Ribonucleotide Reductase Database (RNRdb)). The first RNR studied was from Escherichia coli, which is often referred to as a prototype for the class Ia enzymes. However, complementary studies in the mouse enzyme were also important to fully understand its sophisticated allosteric regulation. This regulation is needed to ensure that the intracellular levels of the four DNA building blocks are balanced (specificity site regulation) and not generally too high (overall activity regulation). The specificity site can bind ATP, dATP, dTTP, or dGTP and selects the substrate to be reduced. Class I RNRs use ribonucleoside-5′-diphosphates (NDPs) as substrates. Binding of ATP or low concentrations of dATP (Kd1 = 0.43 μm at 25 °C for the E. coli RNR (5Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) to the specificity site promotes reduction of CDP and UDP. In a similar manner, GDP reduction is stimulated by dTTP and ADP reduction by dGTP. The overall activity site is an ATP cone domain that binds ATP or dATP (6Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 191-194PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP cone domain is located in the N-terminal region of the R1 protein and is, according to the holoenzyme model, located close to the R1-R2 interaction surface (7Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 8Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This allosteric site determines the overall activity of the enzyme. ATP stimulates enzyme activity, whereas high concentrations of dATP (Kd2 = 5.7 μm (5Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) turn it off. Although several models have been proposed (9Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Kashlan0 Kashlan1.Kashlan2. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Reichard P.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14496-14501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it is not known how the two almost identical nucleotides (ATP or dATP) can have opposite effects on enzyme activity. The allosteric regulation of the E. coli enzyme differs from the general model in that dTTP, when assayed with one substrate at a time, stimulates the reduction of all four substrates (12Larsson A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2533-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Larsson A. Reichard P. J. Biol.

However, the physiological effect of dTTP is ambiguous because the combination of dTTP and ATP leads to general inhibition of enzyme activity (ATP is always present in the cell). The enzymatically active form of class Ia RNRs has previously been described to be a tetramer with α2β2 structure (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, studies of the mouse enzyme suggest that the R1 subunit is a hexamer at physiological R1 protein and ATP/dATP concentrations. The R1 hexamer can interact with 1–3 R2 dimers to form an α6β2 complex at physiological nucleotide and R1-R2 protein concentrations (17Rofougaran R. Vodnala M. Hofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27705-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and an α6β6 complex in the presence of gemcitabine diphosphate (18Wang J. Lohman G.J. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 14324-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a substrate analog that stimulates R1-R2 interaction. It is unclear which role these large complexes have in allosteric regulation; ATP and dATP have opposite effects on enzyme activity, but they still seem to stimulate the formation of similar complexes. A role of large complexes in allosteric regulation has also been demonstrated in the bacterial class Ia RNRs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli. The P. aeruginosa enzyme possesses two adjacent ATP cones (19Torrents E. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25287-25296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion of the most N-terminal ATP cone abolishes both the dATP-induced inhibition and the formation of large oligomeric complexes (19Torrents E. Westman M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25287-25296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Early ultracentrifugation studies on the E. coli class Ia RNR showed that dATP induces large complexes that had a 1:1 ratio of α- and β-proteins and was suggested to be a dimer of the classical α2β2 complex (14Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conventional techniques used for the characterization of the E. coli RNR, a previous study of mammalian allosteric RNR complexes (17Rofougaran R. Vodnala M. Hofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27705-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) introduced a high resolution technique termed gas-phase electrophoretic mobility macromolecule analysis (GEMMA) (20Kaufman S.L. Skogen J.W. Dorman F.D. Zarrin F. Lewis K.C. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1895-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Bacher G. Szymanski W.W. Kaufman S.L. Zollner P. Blaas D. Allmaier G. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1038-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In GEMMA, protein complexes are brought into gas phase to measure their diameter. Because there is a good correlation between diameter and mass in the gas phase, it is usually possible to measure the molecular mass of protein complexes within an error of 5.6! (21Bacher G. Szymanski W.W. Kaufman S.L. Zollner P. Blaas D. Allmaier G. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1038-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In comparison with traditional methods such as ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography, weaker RNR protein complexes at low physiologically relevant protein concentrations can be studied with good separation of the different protein complexes in a wide molecular mass range (between 10 and >1000 kDa). Furthermore, the short run time (<5 min/run) enables extensive testing of various conditions. To clarify how the E. coli class Ia RNR is regulated and what role large complexes have in this regulation, we have studied wild-type and mutant forms of this enzyme with GEMMA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analysis, and enzyme activity assays. Moreover, the substrate specificity of the E. coli enzyme was for the first time studied with all four substrates present simultaneously. The conclusion from this study was that the E. coli enzyme is in equilibrium between an active α2β2 complex formed in the presence of ATP, dTTP, or dGTP with similar substrate specificity as other class Ia RNRs and an inactive α4β4 complex formed in the presence of dATP or effector combinations of ATP + dTTP/dGTP. The E. coli RNR is therefore different from the mouse enzyme, which forms an active α6β2 octamer in the presence of ATP (or effector combinations of ATP + dTTP/dGTP) and an inactive α6β2 octamer in the presence of dATP (17Rofougaran R. Vodnala M. Hofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27705-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Contrary to current models for the mouse enzyme (22Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the specificity site in the E. coli enzyme seems to have a central role in the overall activity regulation because the inactive complex is formed regardless whether ATP or dATP occupies the overall activity site as long as a deoxyribonucleotide occupies the specificity site (an inactive complex is not formed when ATP binds both allosteric sites). However, dATP is still the main regulator of overall activity at physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleotides, which is in common with the mouse enzyme. Expression and Purification of the R1 and R2 Proteins—Published procedures were used for the expression and purification of the E. coli R1 protein (23Ekberg M. Sahlin M. Eriksson M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20655-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the E. coli H59A mutant R1 protein (11Larsson Birgander P. Kasrayan A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14496-14501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the E. coli R2 protein (24Sjöberg B. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mouse R1 protein (25Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mouse R2 protein (26Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The E. coli R2Δ30C protein with a functional Tyr-122 residue was purified according to the protocol described for the Y122FΔ30C protein (27Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All proteins in this study (except the R2Δ30C protein) were verified to be enzymatically active. RNR Activity Assay—The E. coli RNR was assayed at 25 °C in the presence of allosteric effector(s), substrate(s), 20–30 mm magnesium acetate, and 33 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.6. As reductant, either the thioredoxin system (0.4 mm NADPH, 13 μm E. coli thioredoxin, 0.5 μm E. coli thioredoxin reductase, and 30 μm EDTA) or 75 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was used. DTT gave a lower specific activity of the enzyme than when the thioredoxin system was used but had no obvious effect on the allosteric properties of the enzyme. The specific activity of each protein (R1 or R2) was measured in nmol × min–1 mg–1 (units/mg) with 0.5 mm CDP as substrate and 1.5 mm ATP as effector in the presence of an excess of the other protein. Two assay procedures were used: the radioactivity assay and the HPLC assay. In the radioactivity assay (50-μl reaction volume), tritium or 14C-labeled substrate was used. The reaction product was separated from the substrate using Dowex-50 (28Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or boronate chromatography (29Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mouse RNR was assayed at 37 °C with 10 mm DTT as reductant (28Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but otherwise, the conditions were similar to the E. coli assay conditions described above to make the experiments comparable. The HPLC assay (50 μl) was performed with all four substrates (non-radioactive CDP, UDP, GDP, and ADP) present at 0.7 mm each. The procedure was essentially as described previously (30Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the differences mentioned below. The assay buffer consisted of 30 mm magnesium acetate, 30 μm EDTA, 33 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaF (to inhibit phosphatases), and 75 mm DTT. The products were separated from the substrates by boronate chromatography (29Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the amount of produced dCDP, dUDP, dGDP, and dADP was quantified by HPLC chromatography using a 100 × 4.6 mm, 3-μm 1500-Å PolyWAX A column (PolyLC, Columbia, MD), and a gradient between solution A (water) and solution B (0.4 m potassium phosphate, pH 5). The gradient started with 20! solution B and increased gradually to 22! solution B (5 min), 45! solution B (30 min), 88! solution B (40 min), continued at 88! solution B (until 62 min), and decreased to 20! solution B (the complete run was finished in 72 min). The HPLC assays were generally performed with low concentrations (0.1 mm) of dNTP effectors to minimize the interference from dNDP impurities (the dNTP effectors dTTP, dGTP, and dATP generally contained ∼0.5! dNDPs (dTDP was not well separated from dUDP in the HPLC chromatography)). A control sample where the R1 protein was omitted was used as background for these experiments. The reaction products were quantified by measuring the peak heights of the dNDPs, subtracting the background coming from effector dNDP impurities (control sample), and comparing the peak heights with a dNDP standard. The peak heights of the dNDPs in the control samples were severalfold lower than in the real samples for the experiments where an effector dNTP concentration of 0.1 mm was used. Cloning of NusA-tagged E. coli R2—The E. coli R2 coding sequence was inserted into the NusA-containing pETM-60 expression vector (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). To make the NusA-R2 fusion construct, the E. coli R2 gene in the pTB2 plasmid (27Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified. The forward and reverse primers used in the amplification procedure contained NcoI or BamHI restriction sites (underlined): forward, 5′-GAC ATG CCA TGG CAT ATA CCA CCT TTT C-3′ (NcoI); and reverse, 5′-GCG GGA TCC TCA GAG CTG GAA GTT ACT C-3′ (BamHI). The PCR product and pETM-60 expression vector were digested with both restriction enzymes, ligated, transformed into E. coli, and purified. The resulting pETM60-R2 plasmid was verified by sequencing the insert from both directions. NusA-R2 Expression and Purification—The pETM60-R2 vector was introduced into E. coli Rosetta BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and expressed. Typically, 3 liters of cultures were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with shaking. When the culture reached an optical density (600 nm) of 0.8, R2 protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged (3,000 × g for 30 min), resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and disintegrated by freezing and thawing. Glycerol (20! (v/v) of final volume) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to the thawed cells prior to ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g for 45 min). The supernatant was precipitated with streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 2! (w/v) and centrifuged (30,000 × g for 20 min). The protein-containing solution was precipitated at 0 °C by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate (0.36 g/ml, corresponds to 60! saturation) and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 20! (v/v) glycerol, and applied to a 40-ml Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein-containing fraction was loaded to an 8-ml DE52 column equilibrated with 120 ml of 150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 150 and 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (15 ml of each concentration). The NusA-R2 fusion protein was eluted with 300 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and equilibrated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography to a buffer containing 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT. The protein concentration was measured at A595 using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. GEMMA Analysis—The R1 and R2 proteins were equilibrated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography into a buffer containing 100 or 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, respectively. In addition, 2 mm DTT was added to the R1 protein solutions to increase protein stability. Prior to GEMMA analysis, the protein samples were diluted to a concentration of 0.025–0.1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, 0.005! (v/v) Tween 20, nucleotides, and magnesium acetate. All GEMMA experiments were performed at a Mg2+/nucleotide ratio of 1:1. At higher concentrations of magnesium, the efficiency of nucleotide-induced 510-kDa complex formation generally decreased but could be compensated for by adding more nucleotides. The GEMMA system contained the following components: 3480 electrospray aerosol generator, 3080 electrostatic classifier, 3085 differential mobility analyzer, and 3025A ultrafine condensation particle counter (TSI Corp., Shoreview, MN). The parameters used in the GEMMA system were similar to those previously described (17Rofougaran R. Vodnala M. Hofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27705-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A capillary pressure drop of 1.4–2 p.s.i. was used to minimize a broad nucleotide peak in the beginning of the graphs. When several experiments were plotted in the same graph (see Figs. 1 and 2), their baselines were plotted at intervals of 4–17.5 units. The samples were generally scanned several times (1–4 times) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.FIGURE 2GEMMA analysis of 0. 05 mg/ml NusA-R2 protein alone (top trace) and in the presence of 0.05 mg/ml R1 protein and 50 μm dATP (bottom trace).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SPR Biosensor Analysis of E. coli R1-R2 Complex Formation in the Presence of ATP and dTTP—A detailed procedure will be published elsewhere 4M. Crona, E. Furrer, E. Torrents, and B.-M. Sjöberg, manuscript in preparation. but is briefly described here. The SPR protein binding studies were performed using a Biacore 3000 biosensor instrument (GE healthcare). A sterile-filtered and degassed mixture of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.005! (v/v) surfactant P20 was used as running buffer. Effector nucleotides dTTP (2 mm) and/or ATP (100 μm) (GE Healthcare) were included in the running buffer when required. The E. coli R2 protein was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. to a ratio of approximately one biotin per R2 dimer. The biotinylated R2 proteins (ligand) were subsequently immobilized to streptavidin-coated sensor chips (GE Healthcare). A biotin-deactivated flow cell was used as reference cell in the experiments. Concentration series of six different R1 protein concentrations (analyte) between 0.01 and 5 μm were injected at a flow rate of 30–90 μl/min. Bound R1 proteins were removed from the immobilized R2 proteins by injection of 15 μl of 0.5 m KCl between the R1 injections. Data were analyzed using steady-state affinity calculations within the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (GE Healthcare). Allosteric Regulation of the E. coli Class Ia RNR Is Not Affected by the GEMMA Buffer—GEMMA is restricted to volatile buffers/salts such as ammonium acetate. Before making a GEMMA analysis of the E. coli RNR, it was confirmed that the allosteric properties of the enzyme were not affected by the GEMMA buffer (20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5). Similar specific activities, dATP inhibition constants, and specificities of the reaction were obtained in the absence or presence of ammonium acetate (data not shown). E. coli RNR Forms a 510-kDa Complex in the Presence of dATP or ATP + dTTP—Gel filtration experiments show that the E. coli R1 protein is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium and is predominantly monomeric at 0.025 mg/ml (31Larsson Birgander P. Bug S. Kasrayan A. Dahlroth S.L. Westman M. Gordon E. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14997-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, dimer formation can be induced by elevating the protein concentration or by the addition of allosteric effectors (31Larsson Birgander P. Bug S. Kasrayan A. Dahlroth S.L. Westman M. Gordon E. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14997-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GEMMA analysis of the R1 subunit at 0.05 mg/ml showed that it is primarily a monomer (theoretical molecular mass of 86 kDa) in the absence of effectors (Fig. 1A, top trace) but forms a dimer in the presence of 50 μm dATP (Fig. 1A, bottom trace). This nucleotide concentration was sufficient to saturate both allosteric sites as judged from filter binding studies (5Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and enzyme activity assays (11Larsson Birgander P. Kasrayan A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14496-14501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Dimer formation was also stimulated by the two specificity site effectors, 50 μm dTTP or dGTP (data not shown). In conclusion, the E. coli R1 subunit is different from the mammalian protein (17Rofougaran R. Vodnala M. Hofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27705-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which forms dimers in the presence of effectors binding only the specificity site (dGTP/dTTP) and hexamers in the presence of effectors that bind to both allosteric sites (ATP/dATP). The R1 protein preparations sometimes contained a 47-kDa impurity (Fig. 1A, bottom trace, 6.5 nm peak). However, quantitative GEMMA and SDS-PAGE analyses (quantitative GEMMA is discussed in Fig. 1F) suggested that the mass concentration of the impurity was very small. Nucleotide-induced RNR oligomerization was equally efficient in the absence and presence of this impurity (data not shown). In agreement with previous experiments (32Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4591-4601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sjöberg B.-M. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9736-9743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GEMMA analysis of the E. coli R2 subunit (Fig. 1B, top trace) showed that it was primarily a dimer (2 × 43 kDa). The minor peak at 9.5 nm (173 kDa) is most likely an R2 tetramer. The R2 mutant protein R2Δ30C was also able to form dimers (Fig. 1B, bottom trace). This protein lacks 30 C-terminal amino acids needed for interaction with the R1 protein (27Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and is therefore suitable as a negative control in R1-R2 interaction studies. GEMMA analysis of R1-R2 complex formation in the presence of 50 μm dATP showed a 510-kDa peak of unknown subunit composition (Fig. 1C, top trace). The formation of this complex was reversible (the complex dissociated upon removal of dATP (data not shown)) and dependent on R1-R2 interaction because it was not formed when the R2Δ30C protein was used instead of the wild-type R2 protein (Fig. 1C, bottom trace). The 510-kDa complex could also be formed in the presence of ATP in combination with dTTP (Fig. 1D, top trace) but not with dTTP used alone (Fig. 1D, bottom trace). The overall activity site is therefore involved in 510-kDa complex formation; this site binds dATP or ATP but neither dTTP nor dGTP. No 510-kDa complex was observed with ATP as sole effector (Fig. 1E, top trace). The formation of R1 dimers in Fig. 1E (bottom trace) is indicative that the concentration of ATP (100 μm) in the experiments was high enough to bind to both allosteric sites (ATP binds to both allosteric sites with equal affinity in the E. coli class Ia RNR (5Ormö M.

https://openalex.org/W1998306653,"Proteasomes mediate the regulated degradation of Insig-1, a membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. We showed previously that sterols inhibit this degradation by blocking ubiquitination of Insig-1. Here we show that unsaturated fatty acids stabilize Insig-1 without affecting its ubiquitination. Instead unsaturated fatty acids inhibit extraction of ubiquitinated Insig-1 from membranes, a process known to be mediated by valosin-containing protein and necessary for ER-associated degradation. Valosin-containing protein is recruited to Insig-1 through the action of another protein, Ubxd8. Unsaturated fatty acids block the binding between Ubxd8 and Insig-1, thereby abrogating the membrane extraction of Insig-1. Unsaturated fatty acid-mediated stabilization of Insig-1 enhances the ability of sterols to inhibit proteolytic activation of SREBP-1, which activates transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. The current study provides a molecular mechanism for regulation of proteasome-mediated ER protein degradation at a postubiquitination step.

The current study provides a molecular mechanism for regulation of proteasome-mediated ER protein degradation at a postubiquitination step. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway by which cells degrade intracellular proteins (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). Most proteins destined to be degraded by proteasomes are first modified by covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitination is mediated by a series of enzymes that include a ubiquitin activation enzyme (E1), 3The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin activation enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; VCP, valosin-containing protein; FCS, fetal calf serum; Ubxd8, UBX domain-containing protein 8; FAF1, Fas-associated factor 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SREBP, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; LXR, liver X receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; UBX, ubiquitin regulatory X. 3The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin activation enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; VCP, valosin-containing protein; FCS, fetal calf serum; Ubxd8, UBX domain-containing protein 8; FAF1, Fas-associated factor 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SREBP, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; LXR, liver X receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; UBX, ubiquitin regulatory X. ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s), the last of which determine substrate specificity (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). To date, interactions between protein substrates and E3s have been considered to be the step primarily regulated by signals that control degradation of substrate proteins (2Fang S. Weissman A.M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ubiquitinated proteins are delivered to the proteasome is less well characterized. In particular, it remains unclear whether proteasomal degradation can be regulated at a postubiquitination step.The ubiquitin-proteasome system degrades membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). In addition to the ubiquitin system and proteasomes, ERAD requires valosin-containing protein (VCP) (3Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 4Halawani D. Latterich M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 713-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which extracts ubiquitinated proteins from the ER membrane to make them accessible to proteasomes (5Carlson E. Pitonzo D. Skach W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4557-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Nakatsukasa K. Huyer G. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Cell. 2008; 132: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). There is no published evidence to indicate that ERAD can be regulated through control of interaction between VCP and ubiquitinated protein substrates.In mammalian cells, ERAD of several proteins can be regulated by small molecule metabolites. One such protein is Insig-1, an ER membrane protein that plays a crucial role in feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis (7Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). When sterols build up in cells Insig-1 reduces cholesterol synthesis by binding to Scap, a polytopic membrane protein (7Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Binding to Scap prevents the activation of SREBPs, membrane-bound transcription factors that enhance transcription of genes required for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 9Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Scap is an escort protein that transports SREBPs from ER to Golgi where the SREBPs are cleaved to release NH2-terminal fragments from the membrane, allowing them to enter the nucleus to activate their target genes. When Insig-1 binds to Scap, the Scap-SREBP complex is trapped in the ER, and transcription of SREBP target genes declines, leading to a reduction in cholesterol synthesis and uptake (10Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that Insig-1 is degraded by proteasomes in a process that is regulated by sterols. In sterol-depleted cells Insig-1 protein becomes ubiquitinated by gp78, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to Insig-1 (11Lee J.N. Song B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39308-39315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated Insig-1 is rapidly degraded by proteasomes (12Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). When cells are presented with sterols, Scap binds to Insig-1, which causes gp78 to dissociate from Insig-1. As a result, ubiquitination of Insig-1 is blocked and Insig-1 is stabilized (11Lee J.N. Song B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39308-39315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Gong Y. Lee J.N. Lee P.C.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ye J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells also contain a close relative of Insig-1, namely Insig-2 (13Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In comparison with Insig-1, Insig-2 has a much longer half-life, and its degradation is not subject to sterol regulation (14Lee J.N. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45257-45265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.N. Gong Y. Zhang X. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4958-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In cultured fibroblasts, Insig-1 is by far the predominant Insig isoform (16Sever N. Lee P.C.W. Song B.L. Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43136-43147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In addition to sterols, unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to decrease the proteolytic processing of one isoform of SREBP, namely SREBP-1 (17Hannah V.C. Ou J. Luong A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4365-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this effect is unknown. In the current study, we demonstrate that unsaturated fatty acids inhibit SREBP cleavage by increasing the amount of Insig-1 protein. This increase is attributable to an inhibition in the degradation of Insig-1. Surprisingly this inhibition occurs at a postubiquitination step. Indeed in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids Insig-1 is ubiquitinated but not extracted from the ER membrane, and therefore it is not degraded. We show that the block in the membrane extraction is attributable to the disruption of the complex between Insig-1 and VCP. The complex is disrupted because unsaturated fatty acids trigger the dissociation of Insig-1 from UBX domain-containing protein 8 (Ubxd8), a protein that mediates complex formation between Insig-1 and VCP. These data provide insight into a mechanism by which metabolites stabilize an ER membrane protein by blocking degradation at a postubiquitination step.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—We obtained all fatty acids, cycloheximide, triacsin C, polyclonal anti-actin, monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG, and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) IgG from Sigma; MG132 and Nonidet P-40 alternative (Nonidet P-40) from Calbiochem; 25-hydroxycholesterol from Steraloids, Inc.; polyclonal anti-Myc, anti-HA, and anti-T7 IgG from Bethyl Laboratories; monoclonal anti-T7 from Novagen; monoclonal anti-CFTR IgG from Upstate Biotechnology; monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor IgG from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; polyclonal anti-Ubxd8 from Novus Biologicals; monoclonal anti-VCP from BD Transduction Laboratories; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs (affinity-purified) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; and Mouse TrueBlot™ Ultra from eBioscience.

To avoid sterol-mediated stabilization of Insig-1, these cells were also treated with compactin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase that blocks synthesis of cholesterol. The amount of endogenous Insig-1 was then determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, arachidonate significantly increased the amount of Insig-1 protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). As observed previously, Insig-1 showed two bands that represent translational products initiated with different methionines (10Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). MG132 also raised the amount of Insig-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Addition of arachidonate on top of MG132 did not further enhance the amount of Insig-1 protein (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The increase of Insig-1 protein upon treatment with arachidonate occurred in the absence of a change in Insig-1 mRNA as determined by quantitative real time PCR analysis (data not shown).FIGURE 1Unsaturated fatty acids inhibit degradation of Insig-1. A, CHO-7 cells were seeded at 3.5 × 105/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 2, cells were switched to medium A supplemented with 5% delipidated FCS with 50 μm compactin and 50 μm mevalonate. On day 3, 100 μm arachidonate or 10 μm MG132 was added into the medium as indicated. After incubation for 6 h, cells were harvested. Cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Insig and anti-transferrin receptor. B, SRD-13A cells were seeded as described in A. On day 2, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pTK-Insig1-myc. Total plasmid concentration was adjusted to 2 μg/dish by using the empty vector pcDNA3.1. Following incubation for 8 h, cells were switched to medium A supplemented with 5% delipidated FCS. On day 3, cells were treated as described in A, and transfected Insig-1 was detected by immunoblot analysis with IgG-9E10. C, SRD-13A cells were seeded, transfected with 0.4 μg of pTK-Insig1-myc or pTK-Insig2-myc, and incubated as described in B for the first 2 days. On day 3, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 μm arachidonate in medium supplemented with 5% delipidated FCS for 6 h. These cells were then treated with 50 μm cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated period of time. Cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with IgG-9E10 to detect transfected Insig proteins. D, SRD-13A cells were seeded, transfected with 0.4 μg of pTK-Insig1-myc or 1.5 μg of pCMV-CFTR(ΔF508), and treated with arachidonate and cycloheximide (CHX) as described in C. Cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with IgG-9E10 (against Insig-1) and anti-CFTR. E, SRD-13A cells were seeded, transfected with 0.4 μg of pTK-Insig1-myc, and incubated as described in B for the first 2 days. On day 3, cells were treated with a 50 μm concentration of the indicated fatty acids or 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in medium supplemented with 5% delipidated FCS for 6 h.

https://openalex.org/W2068819650,"The MUC1 protein is aberrantly expressed on an estimated 75% of all human solid tumor cancers. We recently reported that a transmembrane cleavage product, MUC1*, is the predominant form of the protein on cancer cells [1]. Further, our evidence indicated that MUC1* functions as a growth factor receptor on tumor cells, while the full-length protein appeared to have no growth promoting activity. Here, we report that MUC1* acts as a growth factor receptor on undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Cleavage of the full-length ectodomain to form MUC1*, a membrane receptor, appears to make binding to its ligand, NM23, possible. Unexpectedly, we found that newly differentiated cells no longer express the cleaved form, MUC1*, or its ligand, NM23. Newly differentiated stem cells exclusively present full-length MUC1. Antibody-induced dimerization of the MUC1* receptor on hESCs stimulated cell growth to a far greater degree than currently used methods that require the addition of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as well as factors secreted by fibroblast “feeder cells”. Further, MUC1* mediated growth was shown to be independent of growth stimulated by bFGF or the milieu of factors secreted by feeder cells. Stimulating the MUC1* receptor with either the cognate antibody or its ligand NM23 enabled hESC growth in a feeder cell-free system and produced pluripotent colonies that resisted spontaneous differentiation. These findings suggest that this primal growth mechanism could be utilized to propagate large numbers of pluripotent stem cells for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2126160095,"Epidemiological studies suggest a correlation between severity of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and selenium deficiency, indicating a protective role for this anti-oxidant during HIV infection. Here we demonstrate that thioredoxin reductase-1 (TR1), a selenium-containing pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase that reduces protein disulfides to free thiols, negatively regulates the activity of the HIV-1 encoded transcriptional activator, Tat, in human macrophages. We used a small interfering RNA approach as well as a high affinity substrate of TR1, ebselen, to demonstrate that Tat-dependent transcription and HIV-1 replication were significantly increased in human macrophages when TR1 activity was reduced. The increase in HIV-1 replication in TR1 small interfering RNA-treated cells was independent of the redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-κB. These studies indicate that TR-1 acts as a negative regulator of Tat-dependent transcription. Furthermore, in vitro biochemical assays with recombinant Tat protein confirmed that TR1 targets two disulfide bonds within the Cys-rich motif required for efficient HIV-1 transactivation. Increasing TR1 expression along with other selenoproteins by supplementing with selenium suggests a potential inexpensive adjuvant therapy for HIV/AIDS patients.

The physiological functions of the micronutrient selenium are mediated through a co-translational insertion of selenocysteine (Sec), 3The abbreviations used are: Sec, selenocysteine; TR, thioredoxin reductase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; Trx, thioredoxin; LTR, long terminal repeat; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophages; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; rTat, recombinant Tat. into specific proteins (1Mustacich D.

Commonly studied selenoproteins such as the glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases (TR), and deiodinases share a redox mechanism that is driven by Sec present in the active site making selenium a required vital nutrient. As a specific example, selenium deficiency has been strongly and independently associated with disease progression and mortality in HIV-infected individuals, increased genital shedding of HIV DNA, and increased risks of fetal and child mortality as well as intrapartum mother-to-child transmission (3Baum M.K.

Recent studies have demonstrated that daily selenium supplementation of HIV-1 positive individuals suppresses the progression of HIV-1 viral burden, provides improvement of CD4 counts (7Hurwitz B.E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TRs are enzymes belonging to the flavoprotein family of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases that includes lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and mercuric ion reductase (1Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 13Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Muller S. Eur. J.

Each monomer of TR includes a FAD prosthetic group, an NADPH binding site, and a selenneylsulfide active site. This active site is formed from the conserved Cys-Sec sequence, which is reduced to a selenolthiol by electrons from the redox-active disulfide of the other subunit (15Turanov A.A. Su D. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22953-22963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Zhong L. Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Electrons are transferred from NADPH to the active site of the disulfide of TR via FAD, which then reduces the substrate. TRs exhibit catalytic redox activity toward thioredoxin (Trx), a group of small redox active proteins in the mass range of 10–12 kDa, which in turn catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange to reduce key Cys residues in transcription factors (14Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Extracellular Trx inhibits the production of HIV-1, whereas its degradation product, eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor, promotes HIV-1 production (17Newman G.W. Balcewicz-Sablinska M.K. Guarnaccia J.R. Remold H.G. Silberstein D.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Apart from Trx, cytosolic TR (TR1) exhibits broad substrate specificity reducing cytotoxic protein NK-lysin, tumor suppressor protein p53, and non-protein substrates such as lipoic acid, lipid hydroperoxides, vitamin K3, dehydroascorbic acid, and the ascorbyl free radical (1Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 18Arner E.S. Nordberg J. Holmgren A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Tat is an HIV-encoded transactivating protein that is required for virus replication. Tat binds to a RNA stem loop structure (TAR) and recruits the positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb, to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), increasing RNA polymerase II processivity (19Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bourgeois C.F. Kim Y.K. Churcher M.J. West M.J. Karn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the absence of Tat, transcription is impaired, leading to the accumulation of prematurely terminated short transcripts (21Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 22Marciniak R.A. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4189-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The primary structure of Tat is made up of 101 amino acids. Based on mutagenesis studies, the Cys-rich region (amino acids 20–39) has been demonstrated to be necessary for Tat activity (23Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3551-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Koken et al. (25Koken S.E. Greijer A.E. Verhoef K. van Wamel J. Bukrinskaya A.G. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8366-8375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the transcriptionally active form of Tat is a monomer, and reducing agents strongly inhibit Tat activity, suggesting that Cys residues in Tat form intramolecular disulfide bonds. Similarly, increased transactivation activity was seen in bacterially expressed Tat that was subjected to slow-protein refolding, which permits the formation of disulfide bonds (26Kirsch T. Boehm M. Schuckert O. Metzger A.U. Willbold D. Frank R.W. Rosch P. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the activity of Tat is governed in part by Cys groups via the formation of disulfide bonds and that Tat is sensitive to the redox state of the cell. Here, we report that TR1 targets the disulfide bonds in Tat and functions as a negative regulator of Tat-dependent proviral transcription. Cell Culture—The human U937 promonocytic cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% defined fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 m l-glutamine. Peripheral blood macrophages were isolated from whole blood obtained from healthy HIV-1-seronegative donors. Mononuclear cells were obtained by differential centrifugation using a Ficol/Hystopaque (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient and adherence to plastic culture flasks as previously described (27Henderson A.J. Calame K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8714-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Macrophages were separated from other cells by an initial adherence to plastic culture flasks overnight. After removing nonadherent cells, monocytes were cultured for 5–10 days to mature into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). All protocols were preapproved by the IRB at Penn State University. Fetal calf serum lots containing low selenium were selected for the study. Selenium was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry. The basal media (containing 7 nm selenium) was supplemented with selenium in the form of sodium selenite. Jurkat CD4+ T-cells stably expressing HIV-1 Tat were obtained from Drs. Antonella Caputo, William Haseltine, and Joseph Sodorski through the NIH AIDS Research and Reagent Program. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% defined fetal calf serum and 800 μg/ml G418. Expression and Activity of TR—U937 cells were cultured in basal media with or without exogenously added selenium for 1 week with three media changes in between. The washed cell pellets were lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER; Pierce) and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates were used in immunoblot and enzymatic assays for TR. Assays for cytosolic TR activity in these lysates were performed as described by Holmgren and Bjornstedt (28Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), where recombinant Tat (rTat) was substituted for Trx in the assay. 0.1 μm purified rat liver TR1 from Sigma was used. Change in the absorbance at 314 nm was used to calculate the activity. Transient Transfections, siRNA, and Luciferase Assay—Replication competent HXB.2, bacterial and mammalian HIV-1 Tat expression vectors, pTat86R His (29Patki A.H. Lederman M.M. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 169: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and pCI-Tat1 (30Frankel A.D. Bredt D.S. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 240: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) were obtained from the AIDS Research Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. pCI vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an empty vector control. LTR reporter constructs, LTR-Luc (wild-type–205 LTR), ΔTARLTR-Luc (–205 LTR lacking the TAR region), and ΔκBLTR-Luc (–205 LTR lacking the NF-κB binding sites) were prepared as previously described (31Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA for transfections was prepared using plasmid purification systems from Marligen Biosciences (Ijamsville, MD) following protocols provided by the manufacturer. Transfection of U937 cells was performed using TransIT-Jurkat transfection reagent from Mirus (Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency was assessed by co-transfecting pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and monitoring enhanced green fluorescence protein expression by fluorescence microscopy. Cell viability was confirmed by trypan blue staining. siRNA for TR1 as well as siRNA control were reconstituted based on the manufacturer's guidelines (Dharmacon). Luciferase assays were performed using a commercial luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). U937 cells were infected with HIV-Luc virus (1 × 106 infectious particles/1 × 106 cells). The next day cells were transfected with TR1 or control siRNA using the Amaxa nucleofector system, and luciferase activity was measured 72 h post-infection. Generation of HIV Infectious Titers, Infections, and Transduction of Macrophages—Infectious HXB.2 virus was generated by cotransfecting 293T cells with 15 μg of HXB.2 cDNA, 3 μg of vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein, and 3 μg of RSV-Rev by calcium phosphate transfection (32Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was assessed by measuring p24 levels (p24 ELISA, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). We consistently generated titers of 1.0 ×106 infectious particles/ml. Supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.45-μm syringe filter (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). One ml of undiluted virus stock was added to 1.0 ×106 U937 cells or human MDMs (differentiated 10 days) for 24 h and then replaced with fresh media. Cells were then transfected with TR1 siRNA using the Amaxa nucleofector system and were subjected to luciferase assays 3–5 days post-infection. For some experiments transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ebselen (5 μm; Sigma) or DMSO. Supernatants were collected at 4 days post-infection and assayed for viral replication by p24 ELISA. To assess the effect of selenium supplementation on p24 levels, 1.0 ×106 U937 cells were cultured in a selenium-deficient media and infected with HXB.2 for 24 h followed by media changes containing selenium from 0.05 μm to 1 μm. After 3 days, the culture media supernatants were used to measure p24 levels. Immunoblots—MDMs and U937 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and protein extracts were prepared by treating cells with M-PER reagent (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer containing dithiothreitol and heated at 100 °C for 5 min before resolving by SDS-PAGE (%T = 4–20) followed by immunoblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TR1 and GPX1 (Abcam) were used to analyze expression of the two selenoproteins. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the secondary antibody. To normalize loading, membranes were treated with Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with anti-β-actin or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase followed by an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Expression, Purification, and Refolding of rTat—rTat was expressed in Escherichia coli transformed with pTat86RHis as a His-tagged fusion protein using the autoinduction system (Novagen). The purification of rTat was performed using the method of Kirsch et al. (26Kirsch T. Boehm M. Schuckert O. Metzger A.U. Willbold D. Frank R.W. Rosch P. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the E. coli pellet from a 24-h culture was lysed in 6 m guanidine-HCl for 12 h. All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise mentioned. The cleared cell lysate was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen) and developed as described by Kirsch et al. (26Kirsch T. Boehm M. Schuckert O. Metzger A.U. Willbold D. Frank R.W. Rosch P. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The eluate was dialyzed against 0.1 n HCl for 2 days at 4 °C followed by an overnight lyophilization. The lyophilized powder was reconstituted in 6 m urea followed by reduction of the thiols with tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (25 mol/mol of Tat) in the dark for 8 h at room temperature as per the instructions of the supplier (Pierce). The mixture was subjected to sequential dialysis in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) containing 4 m urea, 2 m urea, and finally in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 4.3) containing 200 mm NaCl. The dialysate was filtered through 0.45-μm filter and stored in small aliquots at –20 °C for further use. Typical yields from a liter of bacterial culture were ∼10 mg of pure Tat, based on SDS-PAGE (>95%). Analysis of rTat Activity—U937 cells were transfected with 2 μg of LTR-Luc or an irrelevant reporter plasmid (pSV2-Luc) as a control by transient transfection. Cells were then treated with 2 μg of rTat or buffer alone, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection as an indication of proviral transcription. After transfections, trypan blue staining was performed to control for cell viability. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as the % of luciferase with luciferase activity in the cells lacking Tat set at 100%. Quantifying Free Cys Thiols in rTat—Purified and refolded rTat, as described above, was used in the standard Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay as described by the supplier (Pierce). The concentration of rTat was 2 μm, whereas the concentration of rat liver TR1 (Sigma) was 100 nm in the reaction mixture containing 0.008% bovine serum albumin, 4.3 mm EDTA, 0.43 mm NADPH in a total of 1 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 37 °C. Additional controls included heat-denatured TR1 and TR1 without NADPH. Free thiol (SH) groups in rTat were estimated before and after reduction by TR, reaction with heat-denatured TR, and reaction on ice (2 °C) using the standard Ellman's reagent with freshly prepared l-cysteine solution as a calibration standard (0–80 μm). Redox Western Blot Analysis—rTat protein (20 μm) was reacted with TR1 (100 nm, from Sigma) in the presence of 0.5 mm NADPH, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 1 h at room temperature. The resultant mixture was then incubated with 25 mm AMS (4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; 250 mm stock in DMSO) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by 10 min at 37 °C. The mixture was subjected to a non-denaturing and nonreducing PAGE (%T = 18) followed by Western blotting with anti-Tat polyclonal antibodies. rTat (50 nm) reduced with 2.5 mm DTT and subsequently treated with AMS was used a positive control, whereas rTat (50 nm) oxidized with 2.5 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylazodicarboxamide (diamide; Sigma) was used as a negative control. Mechanism-based Affinity Chromatography—A Sepharose affinity matrix was prepared with two mutant forms of His-tagged human TR1 where the resolving Cys and Sec in the C terminus were replaced with Ser in one (denoted as SU) and both Cys and SeCys to Ser in the other (denoted as SS) as described earlier (15Turanov A.A. Su D. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22953-22963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The immobilized enzymes were initially incubated with 2 ml of 0.5 mm NADPH in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. 15 μg of rTat was applied to each column. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature on an end-over shaker, the resins were washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove nonspecifically bound rTat and then eluted with 500 μl of PBS containing 10 mm DTT. All the flow-through (wash) and eluate fractions were concentrated and analyzed for the presence of Tat using Western blots. Selenium Inhibits HIV-1 Transcription—An inverse correlation between selenium levels and HIV progression has been reported (7Hurwitz B.E. Klaus J.R. Llabre M.M. Gonzalez A. Lawrence P.J. Maher K.J. Greeson J.M. Baum M.K. Shor-Posner G. Skyler J.S. Schneiderman N. Arch. Intern. Med. 2007; 167: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To gain insight into mechanisms by which selenium inhibits HIV replication, we tested whether Tat-dependent HIV transcription was sensitive to changes in cellular selenium status. The human monocytic cell line U937, cultured under selenium-deficient conditions (containing 7 nm selenium), were supplemented with selenium at 0.05–1.0 μm. Cells were co-transfected with pCI-Tat and LTR-Luc reporter that contained the TAR element. Selenium at concentrations of 100 nm significantly reduced Tat-dependent transcription compared with the cells where no exogenous selenium was added (Fig. 1). Tat was required for selenium-dependent repression of LTR-Luc activity as selenium had negligible effect on basal LTR activity in the absence of Tat. Furthermore, selenium had no effect on the ΔTARLTR-Luc (data not shown). Similar repression of Tat-dependent LTR activity was observed in human MDMs, although the amount of selenium added was 500 nm (Fig. 1A, inset). Selenium also inhibited HIV-1 replication as determined by p24 ELISA (Fig. 1A). HIV-infected U937 cells cultured in the absence of selenium produced ∼6-fold more virus than infected cells cultured in the presence of selenium. Maximum suppression of HIV-1 replication was observed at ∼0.1 μm selenium, which was the concentration that repressed Tat-dependent LTR activity. To ensure that we were effectively depleting selenium, the expression of two selenoproteins, TR1 and GPX1, was monitored. We observed a decrease in TR1 and GPX1 expression in U937 cells (Fig. 1B) and primary MDM cells (data not shown) that were cultured under selenium-deficient conditions. Selenium supplementation rescued TR1 activity (Fig. 1A) and expression (Fig. 1B) in U937 cells. The enzymatic activity of TR1 and expression of TR1 and GPX1 were saturated at ∼100 nm selenium, which corresponded to the concentration that fully inhibited Tat-dependent LTR activity, suggesting an inverse relationship between HIV-1 transcription and selenoprotein activity. HIV-1 Infection of Macrophages Down-regulates TR1 Expression—Selenium is incorporated as Sec into enzymes such as the glutathione peroxidases and TRs that control cellular redox homeostasis. Based on cellular localization and function, we focused on the cytosolic TR1 form (also called TXNRD1 or TrxR1) rather than the thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TR2 or TrxR3) or the mitochondrial TR3 (TXNRD2 or TrxR2) (15Turanov A.A. Su D. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22953-22963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether HIV-1 infection led to changes in TR expression, as reported earlier in T-cells (12Gladyshev V.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D.L. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), primary MDM were infected with HIV-1 and TR1 levels were monitored by immunoblotting. There was >85% decrease in TR1 expression within 48 h of HIV-1 infection (Fig. 2), suggesting that HIV-1 could potentially target selenoproteins, including TR1, to ensure generation of oxidative stress for efficient replication. TR1 Negatively Regulates HIV-1 Transcription and Replication—The inverse correlation between TR1 activity and HIV-1 transcription and replication suggested that TR1 is a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription. To investigate the role of TR1 in regulating Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription, ebselen, a highly active substrate of TR (33Zhao R. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39456-39462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), was used to “hijack” TR activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, ebselen increased Tat-dependent transactivation of the HIV-LTR by ∼4-fold. The ability of ebselen to enhance transcription required Tat and the TAR element (Fig. 3A). In addition, we used siRNA to specifically diminish TR1 expression in U937 cells and MDM (Fig. 3B). TR1 siRNA depleted ∼80% of TR1 in MDMs and U937 cells as determined by immunoblots (Fig. 3C). In U937 cells and MDMs treated with TR1 siRNA, Tat-dependent LTR-Luc activity was increased by 8- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the decrease in TR1 did not ectopically activate NF-κB or enhance NF-κB-dependent transcription, as reducing TR1 expression and activity with siRNA or ebselen did not significantly alter activity of LTRs lacking NF-κB sites (Fig. 3D) or TAR (data not shown). To determine whether decreasing TR1 had an impact on HIV-1 provirus transcription and replication, we infected cells with HIV-Luc, a replication incompetent HIV-1 clone in which Env was replaced with a luciferase reporter gene (35Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Provirus transcription was monitored by measuring luciferase activity. Consistent with the transient transfection data, we observed a 3.5-fold increase in HIV-1 provirus transcription in U937 cells when TR1 was diminished by siRNA compared with the si-control (Fig. 4A). In addition, MDMs were infected with replication competent HIV-1, and virus replication was monitored by p24 ELISA (Fig. 4B). A 3.5-fold increase in HIV replication was observed in MDMs that were transfected with TR1 siRNA. A similar increase was also observed in HIV-1 replication in U937 cells that were treated with 5 μm ebselen (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that TR1 impacts HIV-1 transcription and replication by repressing the activity of Tat.FIGURE 4TR1 negatively regulates HIV-1 replication in primary monocyte-derived-macrophages. A, TR1 negatively regulates HIV-1 provirus transcription. U937 cells were infected with HIV-Luc virus. Cells (12–24 post-infection) were transfected with TR1 siRNA. Luciferase activity was measured 72 h post-infection. B, MDMs were infected with HXB.2. 12–24 h post-infection cells were transfected with TR1 siRNA or si-control using the Amaxa nucleofector system and subjected to luciferase assay 3–5 days post-infection. C, ebselen treatment increases HIV-1 replication. U937 cells were infected with HXB.2. The transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ebselen (5 μm) or DMSO (0.1% v/v). Supernatants were collected at 4 days post-infection and assayed for viral replication by p24 ELISA.

https://openalex.org/W2011666136,"The strength of the H α emission line, which is related to the presence of short-lived massive stars, is commonly used as a measure of the rate of star formation in a galaxy. The strong cutoff in H α radiation at a certain distance from the centre of the galaxy has been seen as an indication that there is little star formation in the outer regions of disc galaxies, but this is contradicted by recent observations in the ultraviolet. Jan Pflamm-Altenburg and Pavel Kroupa now show how this discrepancy can be resolved by developing a local formulation of the concept of clustered star formation. They conclude that the conversion of a locally observed H α luminosity into a local star formation rate is nonlinear, and that there is a continuous trend of gradually diminishing star-formation activity with increasing galactic radius. The rate of star formation in a galaxy is often determined by the observation of emission in the Hα line, which is related to the presence of short-lived massive stars. This paper shows that a local formulation of the concept of clustered star formation naturally leads to a steeper radial decrease of the Hα surface luminosity than the star-formation-rate surface density and that the observed Hα cutoff arises naturally. The rate of star formation in a galaxy is often determined by the observation of emission in the Hα line, which is related to the presence of short-lived massive stars. Disk galaxies show a strong cut-off in Hα radiation at a certain galactocentric distance, which has led to the conclusion that star formation is suppressed in the outer regions of disk galaxies. This is seemingly in contradiction to recent observations1 in the ultraviolet which imply that disk galaxies have star formation beyond the Hα cut-off, and that the star-formation-rate surface density is linearly related to the underlying gas surface density, which is a shallower relationship than that derived from Hα luminosities2. In a galaxy-wide formulation, the clustered nature of star formation has recently led to the insight that the total galactic Hα luminosity is nonlinearly related to the galaxy-wide star formation rate3. Here we show that a local formulation of the concept of clustered star formation naturally leads to a steeper radial decrease in the Hα surface luminosity than in the star-formation-rate surface density, in quantitative agreement with the observations, and that the observed Hα cut-off arises naturally."

In contrast, recent findings of a membrane-spanning Tat intermediate, which was not found in close proximity to any Tat component (3Cline K. McCaffery M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and of abolished transport for a Tat substrate protein exposing hydrophobic side chains on its surface (2Richter S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 33257-33264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) would support transmembrane passages occuring next to membrane lipids, with TatA possibly functioning by destabilizing the rigid lipid bilayer (27Brüser T. Sanders C. Microbiol. Res. 2003; 158: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Besides diverging views on the actual translocation event, quality control is another point of contention. To date, experimental evidence has been provided for both discrimination against, and tolerance toward, unfolded substrates by Tat translocases. The disulfide-harboring alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) when equipped with a Tat signal peptide is exported in a Tat-dependent manner exclusively from E. coli mutant strains that enable oxidative protein folding in the cytoplasm (28DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Likewise, Tat-mediated transport of cytochrome c into the periplasm was found to occur only when maturation and folding in the cytoplasm was possible (29Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results would be consistent with a quality-of-folding control directly carried out by the Tat translocon. This concept was, however, challenged by the finding that even reduced and unfolded PhoA associates with the TatBC complex via a Tat signal sequence (30Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). E. coli cells overexpressing such transport-incompatible substrate display a defective proton gradient, which the authors attributed to a faulty translocation of unfolded PhoA, seemingly excluding the existence of a quality control by TatABC (30Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A proofreading system involving the TatABC apparatus, which seems to be unique for defectively folded RR-dependent Fe/S proteins of E. coli, was recently described (31Matos C.F. Robinson C. Di Cola A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we have reproduced in vitro the Tat-dependent transport of PhoA fused to the RR-signal sequence of TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide) reductase (TorA). We find that much like in vivo, unfolded precursor specifically associates with the Tat translocase, but is not further translocated into cytoplasmic membrane vesicles of E. coli. Binding to TatBC differs however, between folded and unfolded precursors suggesting a discriminatory ability of TatBC. These studies also allowed some insights into the path of a Tat precursor following its recognition by TatBC up to a step where it is brought in close vicinity to TatA. Plasmids and E. coli Strains—For the synthesis of pSufI and TorA-PhoA, plasmids pKSMSufI-RR (13Alami M. Lüke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Müller M.

The final vector was confirmed to be correct by sequencing. Strain M15pRep4 (Quiagen) transformed with pQE60-TorD (33Hatzixanthis K. Clarke T.A. Oubrie A. Richardson D.J. Turner R.J. Sargent F. Proc.

Plasmid Construction—PCR-based site-specific mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instruction. Plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoA was used as template for the introduction of TAG stop codons at different amino acid positions. For position 15 (Phe) the two complementary oligonucleotides TorA-PhoAF15for (5′-CA TCA CGT CGG CGT TAG CTG GCA CAA CTC GGC GGC-3′) and TorA-PhoAF15rev(5′-GCCGCCGAGTTGTGCCAGCTAACG CCG ACG TGA TG-3′) were used to give the plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoAF15. Analogously, plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoAV24 was constructed using the complementary oligonucleotides TorA-PhoAV24for (5′-CAA CTC GGC GGC TTA ACC TAG GCC GGG ATG CTG G-3′) and TorA-PhoAV24rev (5′-C CAG CAT CCC GGC CTA GGT TTA GCC GCC GAG TTG-3′). For synthesis of mutant TorA-PhoA proteins having the arginine 12 and 13 replaced by lysines (TorA-PhoA-KK) stepwise site-specific mutations were performed as described above. In a first reaction the two complementary oligonucleotides TorA-PhoAR12KRfor (5′-CTC TTT CAG GCA TCA AAG CGG CGT TTT CTG GCA CAA CTC GGC-3′) and TorA-PhoAR12KRrev (5′-GCC GAG TTG TGC CAG AAA ACG CCG CTT TGA TGC CTG AAA GAG-3′) and plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoA as template were used to give the plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoAKR. Using this plasmid as template and the two complementary oligonucleotides TorA-PhoAKR13Kfor (5′-CTC TTT CAG GCA TCA AAG AAG CGT TTT CTG GCA CAA CTC GGC-3′) and TorA-PhoAKR13Krev (5′-GCC GAG TTG TGC CAG AAA ACG CTT CTT TGA TGC CTG AAA GAG-3′), plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoAKK was subsequently constructed. Similarly, the alanines 40 and 41 of TorA-PhoA were stepwise replaced by leucines using plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoA as template and the two complementary oligonucleotides TorA-PhoA40LAfor (5′-CCG CGA CGT GCG ACT CTG GCG CAA GCG GCG-3′) and TorA-PhoA40LArev (5′-CGC CGC TTG CGC CAG AGT CGC ACG TCG CGG-3′) to give pET28aTorA-PhoALA. This plasmid served as template in a second reaction with the two complementary oligonucleotides TorA-PhoLA41Lfor (5′-CCG CGA CGT GCG ACT CTG CTG CAA GCG GCG-3′) and TorA-PhoLA41Lrev (5′-CGC CGC TTG CAG CAG AGT CGC ACG TCG CGG-3′) to give the plasmid pET28aTorA-PhoAΔSP.

Oxidizing conditions were established by the addition of 5 mm GSSG at the start of the synthesis. Synthesis of stop codon mutants of TorA-PhoA was enabled by adding 40 μm pBpa from a 2 mm aqueous solution that had been diluted from a 1 m stock solution made in 1 m NaOH.

To assay transport of SufI and TorA-PhoA, membrane vesicles were added 10 min after starting the synthesis reaction and incubated for 25 min. To assay binding of TorA-PhoA, synthesis was stopped after 30 min, and membrane vesicles were added and incubated for 15 min.

Tat genes encoded by both plasmids were induced by 2 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Cross-linking of pBpa was induced by irradiating samples with UV light of 365-nm wave length for 20 min on ice.

Thiol Trapping of in Vitro Synthesized TorA-PhoA—TorA-PhoA was synthesized in a coupled transcription/translation reaction in the presence or absence of 5 mm GSSG. Synthesis was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% and incubated on ice for 30 min. For alkylation of free sulfhydryl groups the trichloroacetic acid pellet, obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, was washed with 100% acetone. For SDS-PAGE analysis, the washed pellet was dissolved in DTT-free sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm IAA for 30 min at 25 °C. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C were treated with AMS (Molecular Probes) as described (41Hoffmann J.H. Linke K. Graf P.C. Lilie H.

In Vitro Reconstruction of the Folding-dependent Export of TorA-PhoA by the Tat Machinery—We have analyzed in vitro the twin-arginine-dependent translocation of the fusion protein TorA-PhoA into inside-out inner membrane vesicles (INV) of E. coli. In TorA-PhoA (Fig. 1A) the RR motif-bearing signal sequence and the first seven amino acids of the mature part of TorA are fused to mature PhoA. The same construct was previously shown in vivo to be exported by the Tat pathway across the inner membrane of E. coli, provided that oxidizing conditions were implemented in the cytoplasm to allow prior folding of the PhoA moiety by disulfide bond formation (28DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The precursor of TorA-PhoA and, for comparison, that of a standard Tat substrate, SufI, were in vitro synthesized and radioactively labeled by a coupled transcription/translation system prepared from E. coli, separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 1, respectively). Translocation of SufI into INV is indicated by the accumulation of two discrete proteinase K (PK)-resistant species (compare lanes 2 and 4) that correspond in size to the precursor (p) and the signal sequence-less, mature form (m) of SufI. Consistent with having been processed by signal peptidase, the latter appeared only upon addition of INV (compare lanes 1 and 3). As shown previously Tat-dependent translocation of twinarginine substrates into INV requires overproduced amounts of TatA, -B, and -C in the vesicles (Tat+-INV). In contrast, no protease-protected TorA-PhoA could be obtained by the same membrane vesicles (lanes 5 and 6), unless synthesis of TorA-PhoA was performed under oxidizing conditions. Dependent on increasing amounts of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), three species of TorA-PhoA became increasingly protease-protected (lanes 8, 10, 12). These correspond in size to the precursor (p), the signal sequence-less form (m), and a smaller unexpected form (labeled i). The identities of the m- and i-forms are revealed below. To demonstrate that translocation of TorA-PhoA into Tat+-INV indeed required folding of the PhoA moiety, thiol-specific labeling of TorA-PhoA was performed (Fig. 1C). Alkylation by IAA preserves the reduced state of the PhoA-moiety causing a decreased electrophoretic mobility compared with the more tightly packed oxidized PhoA. Alkylation of TorA-PhoA by IAA was possible only when synthesis had occurred under reducing conditions (lane 3). TorA-PhoA synthesized in the presence of 5 mm GSSG, however, could not be modified indicating a lack of free thiols due to disulfide bridge formation. Likewise, an increase in size due to alkylation with the 490 Da compound AMS was only observed if TorA-PhoA retained its SH-groups by synthesis under reducing conditions (lanes 6 and 8). Much like the situation in vivo, oxidized TorA-PhoA was only translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane into the lumen of INV, and thereby acquired protease-resistance, if the vesicles contained an active Tat machinery (Fig. 1D). No PK-resistant material was obtained in the presence of INV prepared from a tatABCDE deletion mutant (ΔTat-INV) (compare lanes 8 and 12). These vesicles, however, produced a cleaved form of TorA-PhoA (marked with an asterisk). This form was suspicious of being the cleavage product of OmpT rather than that of signal peptidase, because the signal sequence of TorA contains a potential cleavage site of OmpT between two distal arginine residues (cf. Fig. 1A) and different from Tat+-INV, the ΔTat-INV had not been prepared from an ompT deletion strain. In fact, the ratio of pseudo-processed TorA-PhoA to precursor was decreased by the OmpT inhibitors DFP und Cu2+ ions (Fig. 1E). Collectively, the results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that similar to the situation in vivo, the Tat apparatus of INV is able to translocate TorA-PhoA only when the PhoA moiety is folded due to disulfide bond formation. The authenticity of this transport event is underscored by the finding that it was competitively inhibited by the TorA-specific chaperone TorD (Fig. 1F), the anti-targeting activity of which has been described (42Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3962-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The TatABC Translocase Senses the Folding State of TorA-PhoA—One obvious question arising from the above findings is, by which mechanism is translocation of reduced TorA-PhoA prevented. We first examined physical association of TorA-PhoA with the TatABC translocase of INV. As shown in Fig. 2A, TorA-PhoA synthesized under oxidizing conditions and in the absence of INV eluted from Sepharose CL-6B as a broad peak (fractions 10–15, Δ). Translocation of TorA-PhoA into Tat+-INV (cf. control lanes) coincided with the appearance of a second peak of TorA-PhoA eluting earlier (fractions 6–8, ▴). This peak was absent from a sample containing ΔTat-vesicles (□) and therefore must represent TorA-PhoA both targeted to and translocated by the TatABC translocase. The translocated material could be visualized when all fractions were treated with proteinase K (not shown). An identical TatABC-dependent membrane-association was also obtained for the reduced form of TorA-PhoA (Fig. 2B, fractions 6–8, ▴), consistent with a previous report (30Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Not even replacement of the essential twin-arginine pair by two consecutive lysines prevented the reduced form of TorA-PhoA from binding to Tat+-INV (Fig. 2C). Thus membrane association of TorA-PhoA mediated by TatABC seemed to be affected neither by a translocation-incompetent PhoA moiety nor by an inactive TorA signal sequence. We previously demonstrated by site-specific cross-linking that targeting of SufI to TatBC of E. coli was disturbed if the signal sequence was rendered transport-incompetent by introducing a KK mutation. We therefore wondered whether targeting of TorA-PhoA that was rendered transport-incompetent due to reductive unfolding would result in identical cross-links to TatC and TatB, i.e. molecular contacts, as the transportactive oxidized TorA-PhoA. To investigate this in detail, we replaced the codons for Phe-15 and Val-24 of the TorA-PhoA signal sequence (cf. Fig. 3A) by amber stop codons in the TorA-PhoA-encoding plasmid. To suppress these stop codons, in vitro synthesis of the mutant forms of TorA-PhoA was performed by a cell-free extract that had been prepared from an E. coli strain transformed with plasmid pDULE (34Farrell I.S. Toroney R. Hazen J.L. Mehl R.A. Chin J.W. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes the orthogonal pair of an amber suppressor tRNA, which specifically accepts the photoreactive derivative of Phe, p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa), as well as its cognate pBpa-specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (43Chin J.W. Martin A.B. King D.S. Wang L. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11020-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Under these conditions only by addition of pBpa can the stop codons present in the mutant torA-phoA mRNAs be suppressed, giving then rise to full-size translation products with the photoprobe pBpa incorporated at the respective positions (Fig. 3B, pF15-TorA-PhoA and pV24-TorA-PhoA). The pBpa-containing TorA-PhoA species were synthesized both under reducing and oxidizing conditions and subsequently irradiated with UV light. In the absence of membrane vesicles, a number of adducts were obtained (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 7, brackets). These cross-linking products faintly cross-reacted with antibodies against the chaperones FkpA and TorD (not shown) reflecting the free accessibility of the TorA signal sequence to chaperone-like proteins when it was not bound to TatABC. In the presence of Tat+-INV, however, oxidized TorA-PhoA yielded a 70-kDa adduct for the cross-linker positioned at residue Phe-15 (Fig. 3B, lane 8, open star), and a 75-kDa adduct (black star) when pBpa was incorporated at position Val-24 of the TorA signal sequence. The two cross-linking partners were identified by immunoprecipitation as TatC (lane 10) and TatB (lane 9; the weak signal in lane 9, upper panel is not due to cross-reactivity between the two antisera used, as demonstrated by an independent experiment shown in the inset). Thus the TorA signal sequence of oxidized TorA-PhoA displayed the same contacts to TatB and TatC as previously described for preSufI (13Alami M. Lüke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Müller M. Mol Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, the reduced form of TorA-PhoA yielded only faint TatB- and TatC-specific adducts (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–5) indicating that, although translocation-incompetent TorA-PhoA physically associates with TatABC of E. coli, its molecular contacts to TatB and TatC differ from those of the translocation-competent counterpart. Therefore, TatBC as the receptor site of the Tat transloc"

The present study aim to identify an efficacious treatment strategy for constipation by evaluating the secretion-promoting and laxative effect of a herbal compound, naringenin, on intestinal epithelial anion secretion and a rat constipation model, respectively.In isolated rat colonic crypts, mucosal addition of naringenin (100 microM) elicited a concentration-dependent and sustained increase in the short-circuit current (I(SC)), which could be inhibited in Cl- free solution or by bumetanide and DPC (diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid), but not by DIDS (4, 4'- diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid). Naringenin could increase intracellular cAMP content and PKA activity, consisted with that MDL-12330A (N-(Cis-2-phenyl-cyclopentyl) azacyclotridecan-2-imine-hydrochloride) pretreatment reduced the naringenin-induced I(SC). In addition, significant inhibition of the naringenin-induced I(SC) by quinidine indicated that basolateral K+ channels were involved in maintaining this cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion. Naringenin-evoked whole cell current which exhibited a linear I-V relationship and time-and voltage- independent characteristics was inhibited by DPC, indicating that the cAMP activated Cl- conductance most likely CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) was involved. In rat constipation model, administration of naringenin restored the level of fecal output, water content and mucus secretion compared to loperamide-administrated group.Taken together, our data suggest that naringenin could stimulate Cl- secretion in colonic epithelium via a signaling pathway involving cAMP and PKA, hence provide an osmotic force for subsequent colonic fluid secretion by which the laxative effect observed in the rat constipation model. Naringenin appears to be a novel alternative treatment strategy for constipation."
https://openalex.org/W1516450273,"The magnetic field that pervades our Galaxy is an important constituent of the interstellar medium. Similar fields, known as B fields, seem to be present in galaxies with redshifts of z > 1, though the strength remains uncertain. Wolfe et al. report a measurement of a magnetic field B ≈ 84 µG in a galaxy at z = 0.692, using the same Zeeman-splitting technique that revealed an average value of B = 6 µG in the neutral interstellar gas of our Galaxy. This is completely unexpected since the leading theory of magnetic field generation, the dynamo model, predicts large-scale B fields to be weaker rather than stronger in the past. The magnetic field pervading our Galaxy is a crucial constituent of the interstellar medium: it mediates the dynamics of interstellar clouds, the energy density of cosmic rays, and the formation of stars1. The field associated with ionized interstellar gas has been determined through observations of pulsars in our Galaxy. Radio-frequency measurements of pulse dispersion and the rotation of the plane of linear polarization, that is, Faraday rotation, yield an average value for the magnetic field of B ≈ 3 μG (ref. 2). The possible detection of Faraday rotation of linearly polarized photons emitted by high-redshift quasars3 suggests similar magnetic fields are present in foreground galaxies with redshifts z > 1. As Faraday rotation alone, however, determines neither the magnitude nor the redshift of the magnetic field, the strength of galactic magnetic fields at redshifts z > 0 remains uncertain. Here we report a measurement of a magnetic field of B ≈ 84 μG in a galaxy at z = 0.692, using the same Zeeman-splitting technique that revealed an average value of B = 6 μG in the neutral interstellar gas of our Galaxy4. This is unexpected, as the leading theory of magnetic field generation, the mean-field dynamo model, predicts large-scale magnetic fields to be weaker in the past rather than stronger5."

Romo1-derived ROS was found to originate in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Romo1 expression gradually increased in proportion to population doublings of IMR-90 human fibroblasts. An increase in ROS production in these cells with high population doubling was blocked by the Romo1 knockdown using Romo1 small interfering RNA.

The chromosomal ends of senescent cells are associated with DNA damage-response factors. Telomere shortening triggers a DNA damage checkpoint response, resulting in replicative senescence. Blocking of the DNA damage checkpoint response releases cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase of the cell (1d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. Von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N.P. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 426: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). One of the important mediators in telomere-dependent senescence is p53, and it plays an important role in DNA damage response as well as regulation of cellular senescence. The other main regulators of senescence are reported as p21WAF1/CIP1, p16INK4A, and retinoblastoma protein, and these have been classified into two major signaling pathways, the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 pathway and the p16INK4A/retinoblastoma protein pathway (2Shawi M.

Even though poor regulation of ROS production could lead to various pathological disorders, low levels of ROS are indispensable for many biological processes such as mitogenic proliferation (4Bedard K.

It was suggested that oxidative stress shortened the telomere length through DNA single strand breaks (10von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Increased oxidants trigger oxidative DNA damage, and such oxidants are sensed by the DNA damage-response pathway, which is a common mediator of senescence (6Chen J.H. Hales C.N. Ozanne S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 7417-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The oxidative DNA damage in promoters of genes that are down-regulated with age has been known to be associated with human brain aging (11Lu T. Pan Y. Kao S.Y. Li C. Kohane I. Chan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). ROS are generated from the electron transport chain in the mitochondria, which is the main source of ROS (3Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). Many studies have reported that ROS derived from the mitochondria are directly involved in replicative senescence. Intracellular ROS levels were increased with age, and this is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (12Singh K.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of genes related to mitochondrial function was also observed in the aging human brain (11Lu T. Pan Y. Kao S.Y. Li C. Kohane I. Chan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction was detected in hepatocytes from old rats, in which low mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS levels were observed (13Hagen T.M. Yowe D.L. Bartholomew J.C.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is correlated with an accumulation of mtDNA mutations, which contributes to aging and degenerative diseases (15Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Ozawa T. Tanaka M. Lancet. 1989; 1: 642-645Abstract PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Mutations and deletions of mtDNA were observed during aging (16Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Beal M.F.

There have been many reports that gene mutations in the mitochondrial electron transport chain produce high levels of oxidants and are correlated with aging.

A mutation in the succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b large subunit in complex II was reported to produce superoxide (20Ishii N. Cornea. 2007; 26: S3-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The increased ROS production resulting from this mtDNA mutation demonstrated a role in life span (21Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K.

Through further investigation, we reported that Romo1 was responsible for up-regulated ROS levels in cancer cells and that Romo1-derived ROS was required for cancer cell proliferation as well as normal cells such as IMR-90 human fibroblasts (5Na A.R. Chung Y.M. Lee S.B. Park S.H. Lee M.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because increased ROS levels and oxidative damage are both implicated as the major contributors toward senescence, this study was undertaken to investigate the expression of Romo1 in senescent cells and whether Romo1-derived ROS played a role in cellular senescence. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human lung fibroblast IMR-90 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media. Human lung cancer cells (H1299) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). All media contained 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), sodium bicarbonate (2 mg/ml; Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), H2O2, stigmatellin, myxothiazol, and rotenone were purchased from Sigma. MitoSOX, dihydrorhodamine 123, MitoTracker Red, and 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Senescence-associated (SA) β-Galactosidase Assay—Cellular senescence was examined using a senescent cell staining kit (Sigma). SA-β-galactosidase staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small Interfering RNA Assay—Romo1 siRNA designed to target Romo1 (30Hwang I.T. Chung Y.M. Kim J.J. Chung J.S. Kim B.S. Kim H.J. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was synthesized by Bioneer (Taejon, Republic of Korea) and was transfected into IMR-90 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from each sample using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After 10 μg of the total RNA was resolved on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, the RNA samples were transferred into a Nytran N nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The Romo1 cDNA probe (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was labeled with a random primer DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridization was performed overnight at 68 °C. Measurement of Intracellular ROS by Flow Cytometry—The fluorescence intensity of the DCF-DA-stained cells was measured by a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The cells were cultured for 2 days in the presence of control siRNA or Romo1 siRNA and then incubated with 50 μm DCF-DA at 37 °C for 30 min, and intracellular fluorescence of 5,000 cells was measured by flow cytometry using the green fluorescence emission parameter. ROS levels were also measured using dihydrorhodamine 123 (5 μm) and MitoSOX (5 μm). Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—To determine changes of mitochondrial membrane potential after Romo1 induction, H1299/pGene-Romo1 cells (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) treated with mifepristone (MFP) were incubated with JC-1 (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. JC-1 was excited at 490 nm, and emission fluorescence was filtered, and images were collected at fluorescein isothiocyanate (green, 530 nm) and TRITC channels (red, 590 nm) using the LSM510 (Zeiss). The images were analyzed using LSM 3.5 image analysis software (Zeiss). Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed using anti-p53 (DAKO, Denmark), anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p16INK4a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies as described previously (31Yoo Y.A. Kim M.J. Park J.K. Chung Y.M. Lee J.H. Chi S.G. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). ROS Assays—For ROS measurement using SpectraMax (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), 2 × 104 cells were plated onto 12-well plates. DCF-DA was added to cell culture media and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), intracellular ROS levels were measured at a 490 nm excitation wavelength and at a 535 nm emission wavelength using SpectraMax. ROS fluorescence intensity was normalized by the cell number, which was counted using trypan blue staining. Fluorescence Microscopy—MitoSOX (5 μm) was added to cell culture media, and excess probes were removed by rinsing with PBS. Coverslips were wet-mounted onto slides, and fluorescent images from multiple fields of view were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus LX71 microscope). Confocal Microscopy—After treatment, the cells grown on the chambered cover glass were washed twice with PBS and incubated with MitoTracker Red (50 nm). DCF-DA was added directly to the cell cultures and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to detect ROS. The fluorescence images from multiple fields of view were obtained using an Axioplan II microscope (Zeiss) and a confocal microscope (MRC-1024 MP, Bio-Rad, and LSM510, Zeiss), which were set at the designated exposure setting. For foci analyses, the cells were first fixed, permeabilized, and blocked. The foci were observed by immunolocalization using the anti-phospho-H2AX (1:200, Upstate Biotechnology) antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS/Triton X-100. The immune complexes were then stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes). After 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and mounting, fluorescence images were obtained using Zeiss Axioplan II and confocal microscopy. The images were analyzed using LSM 3.5 image analysis software (Zeiss) and Confocal Assistant software (version 4.02, Bio-Rad). Analysis of DNA Damage by Alkali Comet Assay—The cells were treated with either H2O2 (200 μm) or IR (10 Gy), and the H1299/pGene-Romo1 cells were induced by MFP. A Comet Assay kit (Trevigen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the comet assay, electrophoresis was performed at 1 V/cm and 30 mA for 60 min. The ratios of DNA in the head and tail of the comets were analyzed. Eighty randomly selected cells per sample were examined. Transmission Electron Microscopy—The cells were cultured until they reached 50% confluency and were then treated with MFP for 24 h with or without NAC (0.5 mm). The cells were washed twice with PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. The samples were fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 2 h, and stained en bloc with a uranyl acetate coloration solution for 90 min. After dehydration with increasing concentrations of ethanol and propylene oxide, thin sections were sliced using the Reichert ultracut and mounted on 200-mesh copper grids. These were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate for 12 min each. The grids were observed under a Hitachi H-7500 electron microscope, and images were captured at a final magnification of ×15,000. Statistical Analysis—Each assay was performed in triplicate and was independently repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Student's analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Means, S.E., and p values were calculated using GraphPad PRISM, version 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Romo1 Expression Was Increased in Senescent Cells—Romo1 was reported to generate ROS in the mitochondria (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were curious as to whether Romo1 expression was increased during the progression of senescence of IMR-90 cells. Northern hybridization was conducted to examine Romo1 expression in these cells. Interestingly, Romo1 expression was enhanced in the cells at PDL 51, and higher Romo1 expression was observed in the cells at PDL 75 (Fig. 1A). Increased ROS formation was observed in cultured endothelial cells with high PDL, and this was concurrent with other studies reporting elevated ROS levels with age (12Singh K.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Diehl J.F. Vasa M. Spyridopoulos I. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We examined ROS levels in old IMR-90 cells. IMR-90 cells that had been continuously cultured were stained with DCF-DA, and the ROS levels were examined by confocal microscopy. Increased DCF-DA staining was observed in the cells at PDL 55 (Fig. 1B), which corresponded to increased ROS levels. The increased ROS formation was quantified using a microfluorometer plate reader, and the relative ROS increase is shown in Fig. 1C. ROS levels were also measured by flow cytometry, and the same results were obtained, as shown in Fig. 1D. The shift to the right of the curve because of increased fluorescence indicated an increase in the intracellular ROS levels. Because p53, p21WAF/CIP1, and p16INK4a expression were enhanced in cells with high PDL (33Atadja P. Wong H. Garkavtsev I. Veillette C. Riabowol K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8348-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 34Webley K. Bond J.A. Jones C.J. Blaydes J.P. Craig A. Hupp T. Wynford-Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), this was examined by Western blot analysis. Fig. 1E showed that the expression of these proteins was gradually up-regulated during continuous culture of IMR-90 cells. Romo1 Expression Was Responsible for ROS Increase in Senescent Cells—We then tried to determine whether Romo1-induced ROS was responsible for ROS increase in cells with high PDL. As shown in Fig. 2A, enhanced ROS levels were observed in IMR-90 cells at PDL 54, and transfection with Romo1 siRNA blocked this increase in ROS formation. The production of mitochondrial ROS in the IMR-90 cells was quantified using the Metamorph software (Fig. 2B). ROS reduction by Romo1 siRNA was also observed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that Romo1 played a major role in the regulation of ROS in IMR-90 cells with high PDL. IMR-90 cells, which are human normal lung fibroblast cells, are quite difficult to transiently transfect with plasmids, and such experiments are usually conducted in the presence of a drug selection. To observe the transfection efficiency of IMR-90 cells, we examined Romo1 knockdown by RT-PCR (Fig. 2D) and measured transfection efficiency by flow cytometry (Fig. 2E). Romo1 knockdown was conducted by RT-PCR, but not by Northern blot techniques, because of the low expression of Romo1 expression (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 2E showed that Romo1 siRNA was efficiently transfected into IMR-90 cells and that the transfection efficiency of Romo1 siRNA was greater than 60%. Increased Romo1 Expression Induced Senescence—To test whether Romo1 expression triggered cellular senescence of IMR-90 cells, retrovirus expressing Romo1 was infected into the cells and treated with G418. Ten days later, SA-β-galactosidase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, Romo1 expression induced cellular senescence. H-Ras was used as a positive control. Fig. 3C shows that Romo1 expression enhanced intracellular ROS level, and H-Ras also increased the cellular ROS level. Fig. 3C, right column, shows the merged images of ROS and mitochondria stained with MitoTracker. A hybrid gene encoding Romo1 tagged with Myc (Romo1-myc) was used in this experiment, and Romo1-myc protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc antibody (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that Romo1 expression was increased during progression of cellular senescence, and increased Romo1 expression induced cellular senescence. Next, we examined whether the increase of Romo1-derived ROS formation was associated with replicative senescence of IMR-90 cells. The cells were transfected with 40 nm Romo1 siRNA because 100 nm Romo1 siRNA inhibited cell growth (5Na A.R. Chung Y.M. Lee S.B. Park S.H. Lee M.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Romo1 siRNA transfection delayed replicative senescence. As a positive control, the cells were treated with NAC. NAC treatment inhibited replicative senescence, and this result was consistent with previous reports (32Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Diehl J.F. Vasa M. Spyridopoulos I. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Romo1 Induced Nuclear DNA Damages—Because oxidative DNA damage is sensed by the DNA damage-response pathway and is known to be a common mediator of senescence (6Chen J.H. Hales C.N. Ozanne S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 7417-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we examined whether Romo1-triggered ROS induced DNA damage. Romo1-induced DNA damage was examined by observation of the formation of γ-H2AX foci. The production of γ-H2AX foci after irradiation was confirmed by irradiating the IMR-90 cells with 10 Gy and examining the foci using immunofluorescence microscopy after staining the cells with the anti-γ-H2AX antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, irradiation induced the formation of foci in the nuclei of the IMR-90 cells. A similar observation was made in the IMR-90 cells treated with H2O2. The IMR-90 cells were then transfected with Romo1 to determine whether Romo1 induced the formation of γ-H2AX foci. The introduction of Romo1 induced the formation of γ-H2AX foci, which was abolished by NAC treatment, demonstrating that the ROS generated by Romo1 caused DNA damage (Fig. 5B). The Romo1-induced formation of γ-H2AX foci formation was confirmed by treating the stably transfected H1299/pGene-Romo1 cells containing an MFP-inducible expression system (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with MFP and counting the number of foci. As shown in Fig. 5C, MFP treatment induced the formation of γ-H2AX foci. The γ-H2AX foci began to form after 12 h and reached a maximum of 48 h after the MFP treatment (Fig. 5D). The double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the Romo1-induced ROS were also examined using a comet assay. As a positive control, the IMR-90 cells were irradiated, and the tail moment was analyzed (Fig. 6A). The tail moment formed by Romo1-induced ROS was also observed in the H1299/pGene-Romo1 cells treated with MFP (Fig. 6B). The tail moment was detected from 12 h and increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6Comet assay. A, comet assay was performed in the IMR-90 cells infected with retrovirus expressing Romo1. As a positive control, the IMR-90 cells were irradiated with IR (10 Gy). B, comet assay was performed in the H1299/pGene-Romo1 cells treated with MFP (1 nm). The H1299/pGene-Romo1 cells were treated with MFP, and the time course analysis of the comet assay was analyzed. C, length of the comet tail per length of the comet head, which was defined as DNA damage, was measured in at least 80 cells per sample. The data represent the mean (±S.E.) of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Romo1-derived ROS Originated from the Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain—Because Romo1 localizes to the mitochondria (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we examined whether Romo1-enhanced ROS production originated from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The superoxide generation by Romo1 induction was observed by MitoSOX, a mitochondrial superoxide indicator, staining. A Romo1-inducible cell line (H1299/pGene-Romo1) was used in this study. The cells were induced by MFP and treated with specific inhibitors of the respiratory complexes. The levels of ROS production were quantified by incubating the mitochondria with MitoSOX. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, ROS levels were increased after Romo1 induction, and ROS production was blocked by stigmatellin or myxothiazol treatment, which inhibited ROS production at complex III. Rotenone, an inhibitor of the electron transport at complex I, and malonate, a complex II inhibitor, failed to inhibit ROS production, suggesting that the Romo1-induced production of ROS occurred within complex III of the electron transport chain. A previous study showed that morphological changes in the mitochondria, in the form of a round and swollen shape, were observed in some of the Romo1-GFP expressing H1299 cells (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These changes were also observed by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7C, the intermembrane spaces of many mitochondria appeared to be widened. This mitochondrial structural reorganization may be triggered by Romo1-induced ROS production because NAC treatment was shown to have blocked the Romo1-induced mitochondrial cristae remodeling. An increase in the levels of ROS in the mitochondria may cause the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulting in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (35Zorov D.B. Juhaszova M. Sollott S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). To test whether Romo1-triggered ROS production induced ΔΨm changes, the cells were treated with MFP and stained with the ΔΨm-sensitive dye JC-1. As a positive control, the cells were treated with H2O2. In H2O2-treated cells, the JC-1 dye remained in the cytoplasmic green fluorescence of the monomeric form, indicating a low ΔΨm (Fig. 7D). Fig. 7D also indicates the merged image of red fluorescence and green fluorescence, showing a yellow color. Increased Romo1 induction caused a ΔΨm, decrease and treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors blocked any changes in ΔΨm (Fig. 7D). These results demonstrated that enhanced ROS levels induced by increased Romo1 expression originated from complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and that this may cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Although ROS levels increased by various stresses could lead to various pathological disorders, an appropriate ROS level is indispensable for cell proliferation (4Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar). The concentration of H2O2 is intracellularly maintained from a low of ∼0.001 μm to a high of ∼0.7 μm (36Stone J.R. Yang S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 243-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Antioxidant treatment inhibited cell growth by decreasing endogenous ROS levels (37Arora-Kuruganti P. Lucchesi P.A. Wurster R.D. J. Neurooncol. 1999; 44: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This cell growth inhibition was because of the arrest of the cell in the G1 phase (38Martin V. Herrera F. Garcia-Santos G. Antolin I. Rodriguez-Blanco J. Rodriguez C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) resulting from the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21WAF/CIP1 and p16INK4a, and down-regulation of G1 cyclins (39Sekharam M. Trotti A. Cunnick J.M. Wu J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 149: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although treatment of the cells with a high dose of H2O2 induced cell growth inhibition or death, treatment of cells with a low dose of H2O2 increased cell proliferation by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (40Liu S.L. Lin X. Shi D.Y. Cheng J. Wu C.Q. Zhang Y.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 41Caporossi D. Ciafre S.A. Pittaluga M. Savini I. Farace M.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Sigaud S. Evelson P. Gonzalez-Flecha B. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we also showed that down-regulation of ROS by Romo1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and inhibition of cyclin D1 expression (5Na A.R. Chung Y.M. Lee S.B. Park S.H. Lee M.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Romo1 was first identified in 2006, and Romo1 expression was shown to be up-regulated in most cancer cell lines (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A recent publication (43Laurent A. Nicco C. Chereau C. Goulvestre C. Alexandre J. Alves A. Levy E. Goldwasser F. Panis Y. Soubrane O. Weill B. Batteux F. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 948-956PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a high level of ROS derived from the mitochondria was detected in cancer cells. Therefore, we were curious to test if the high levels of ROS observed in many cancer cells originated from Romo1 in our previous study and showed that Romo1 knockdown decreased ROS levels not only in various cancer cells but also in IMR-90 cells (5Na A.R. Chung Y.M. Lee S.B. Park S.H. Lee M.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that Romo1-derived ROS was needed for normal and cancer cell proliferation. However, the exact mechanism of ROS production remains to be elucidated. In subsequent experiments, we observed that Romo1 expression was increased in the IMR-90 cells with high PDL and that its expression was up-regulated in proportion to increasing PDL (Fig. 1A). We wondered if Romo1-induced ROS contributed to replicative senescence of IMR-90 cells. Because ROS are the major inducers of replicative senescence, and antioxidant treatment was shown to delay the senescence of endothelial cells (32Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Diehl J.F. Vasa M. Spyridopoulos I. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we tested whether Romo1-induced ROS affected replicative senescence. Even though the expression of Romo1 was undetectable in IMR-90 cells by Northern blot analysis (29Chung Y.M. Kim J.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we were able to analyze the level of Romo1 expression by RT-PCR (Fig. 2C). Romo1-derived ROS is indispensable for normal cell proliferation because Romo1 siRNA transfection inhibited IMR-90 cell growth (5Na A.R. Chung Y.M. Lee S.B. Park S.H. Lee M.S. Yoo Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It appeared that Romo1, which is expressed in low levels in normal cells, produced a small amount of ROS needed for cell proliferation. Therefore, we were unable to use a sufficient amount of Romo1 siRNA for Romo1 knockdown in this study. We also observed that transfection of 100 nm Romo1 siRNA twice for 10 days inhibited growth of the IMR-90 cells (data not shown). In this study, low amounts of Romo1 siRNA were transfected into IMR-90 cells, such that severe growth inhibition was not induced. Although replicative senescence of the cells transfected with 40 nm Romo1 siRNA was partially delayed in Fig. 4, we suggest that ROS derived from increased Romo1 expression plays an important role in replicative senescence of IMR-90 cells. It is known that ROS generated from the mitochondria are major determinants of cellular senescence and organismal aging (44Kregel K.C. Zhang H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: R18-R36Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial function declines with aging. Low ΔΨm and increased ROS levels were observed in hepatocytes from old rats (12Singh K.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Hagen T.M. Yowe D.L. Bartholomew J.C. Wehr C.M. Do K.L. Park J.Y. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that enforced Romo1 expression triggered cristae remodeling of mitochondria and induced ΔΨm down-regulation. Romo1 induced cristae remodeling of the mitochondria, and ΔΨm down-regulation was triggered by ROS generated from Romo1 because antioxidant treatment blocked Romo1-induced cristae remodeling of the mitochondria and ΔΨm down-regulation. From these results, we suggest that Romo1 expression is enhanced during aging and that ROS levels derived by Romo1 cause mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in replicative senescence. ROS levels, which cause single strand nicks and DSBs, are up-regulated with age and can cause an increase in 8-oxo-dG generation in various species (44Kregel K.C. Zhang H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: R18-R36Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). DSBs are often observed in senescent cells and aged mice. Sedelnikova et al. (45Sedelnikova O.A. Horikawa I. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Bonner W.M. Barrett J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) showed that many DNA lesions with DSBs in senescent cells, which are irreparable, were observed in nontelomeric regions and suggested that persistent DNA lesions with irreparable DSBs are an important factor that causes aging. This study showed that ROS produced by increased Romo1 expression induced nuclear DNA damage. To accomplish this, ROS should be released into the cytosol. Even though the majority of ROS in the mitochondria are produced at complexes I and III, it has been reported that complex III is a major source of ROS released into the cytosol (46Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that stigmatellin and myxothiazol, which inhibits the electron transport at complex III, blocked Romo1-induced production of ROS. An analysis of a hypothetical translation using the “Translate” program on the EXPASY website indicated that Romo1 is a transmembrane protein. Therefore, it is possible that Romo1 is located in the mitochondrial membrane and that Romo1 plays an important role in releasing ROS required for cell proliferation into the cytosol. It should be noted that ROS levels are increased from aging and various stresses and that they originate mainly from the mitochondria (3Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). We postulate that Romo1 expression is induced during aging, and this enhanced Romo1 expression disturbs the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in the excessive generation of ROS. However, further studies will be needed to clarify the exact mechanism by which Romo1 produces ROS and contributes to replicative senescence. In this study, we showed that increased Romo1 expression, which is up-regulated in senescing human cells, contributes to replicative senescence by producing ROS persistently and inducing oxidative DNA damage. From the results of this study, we suggest that Romo1 is one of the major molecular contributors toward ROS-associated aging. Further investigations will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which Romo1 produces ROS formation. The functional role of Romo1 in aging using an in vivo system also remains to be studied. Taken together, our present data demonstrate a new molecule involved in replicative senescence, which should be further studied to understand the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2081642281,"Background Preterm birth accounting approximate 10% of pregnancies in women is a tremendous social, clinical and economic burden. However, its underlying causes remain largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that endocannabinoid signaling via cannabinoid receptor CB1 play critical roles in multiple early pregnancy events in both animals and humans. Since our previous studies demonstrated that loss of CB1 defers the normal implantation window in mice, we surmised that CB1 deficiency would influence parturition events. Methods and Findings Exploiting mouse models with targeted deletion of Cnr1, Cnr2 and Ptgs1 encoding CB1, CB2 and cyclooxygenase-1, respectively, we examined consequences of CB1 or CB2 silencing on the onset of parturition. We observed that genetic or pharmacological inactivation of CB1, but not CB2, induced preterm labor in mice. Radioimmunoassay analysis of circulating levels of ovarian steroid hormones revealed that premature birth resulting from CB1 inactivation is correlated with altered progesterone/estrogen ratios prior to parturition. More strikingly, the phenotypic defects of prolonged pregnancy length and parturition failure in mice missing Ptgs1 were corrected by introducing CB1 deficiency into Ptgs1 null mice. In addition, loss of CB1 resulted in aberrant secretions of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and corticosterone during late gestation. The pathophysiological significance of this altered corticotrophin-releasing hormone-driven endocrine activity in the absence of CB1 was evident from our subsequent findings that a selective corticotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist was able to restore the normal parturition timing in Cnr1 deficient mice. In contrast, wild-type females receiving excessive levels of corticosterone induced preterm birth. Conclusions CB1 deficiency altering normal progesterone and estrogen levels induces preterm birth in mice. This defect is independent of prostaglandins produced by cyclooxygenase-1. Moreover, CB1 inactivation resulted in aberrant corticotrophin-releasing hormone and corticosterone activities prior to parturition, suggesting that CB1 regulates labor by interacting with the corticotrophin-releasing hormone-driven endocrine axis."
https://openalex.org/W2107926106,"Formin homology proteins are a highly conserved family of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins best known for their ability to induce the formation of long unbranched actin filaments. They accomplish this by nucleating the de novo polymerization of F-actin and also by acting as F-actin barbed end “leaky cappers” that allow filament elongation while antagonizing the function of capping proteins. More recently, it has been reported that the FH2 domains of FRL1 and mDia2 and the plant formin AFH1 are able to bind and bundle actin filaments via distinct mechanisms. We find that like FRL1, FRL2 and FRL3 are also able to bind and bundle actin filaments. In the case of FRL3, this activity is dependent upon a proximal DAD/WH2-like domain that is found C-terminal to the FH2 domain. In addition, we show that, like other Diaphanous-related formins, FRL3 activity is subject to autoregulation mediated by the interaction between its N-terminal DID and C-terminal DAD. In contrast, the DID and DAD of FRL2 also interact in vivo and in vitro but without inhibiting FRL2 activity. These data suggest that current models describing DID/DAD autoregulation via steric hindrance of FH2 activity must be revised. Finally, unlike other formins, we find that the FH2 and N-terminal dimerization domains of FRL2 and FRL3 are able to form hetero-oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1985572596,"Background The attentional blink (AB) refers to humans' impaired ability to detect the second of two targets (T2) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream of distractors if it appears within 200–600 ms of the first target (T1). Here we examined whether humans' ability to inhibit distractors in the RSVP stream is a key determinant of individual differences in T1 performance and AB magnitude. Methodology/Principal Findings We presented subjects with RSVP streams (93.3 ms/item) of letters containing white distractors, a red T1 and a green T2. Subjects' ability to suppress distractors was assessed by determining the extent to which their second target performance was primed by a preceding distractor that shared the same identity as T2. Individual subjects' magnitude of T2 priming from this distractor was found to be negatively correlated with their T1 accuracy and positively related to their AB magnitude. In particular, subjects with attenuated ABs showed negative priming (i.e., worse T2 performance when the priming distractor appeared in the RSVP stream compared to when it was absent), whereas those with large ABs displayed positive priming (i.e., better T2 performance when the priming distractor appeared in the RSVP stream compared to when it was absent). Thus, a subject's ability to suppress distractors, as assessed by T2 priming magnitude, predicted both their T1 performance and AB magnitude. Conclusions/Significance These results confirm that distractor suppression plays a key role in RSVP target selection and support the hypothesis that the AB results, at least in part, from a failure of distractor inhibition."

Here, we provide the first example that mucin-type O-linked glycosylation is involved in a developmentally regulated cell adhesion event in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in one member of the evolutionarily conserved family of enzymes that initiates O-linked glycosylation alter epithelial cell adhesion in the Drosophila wing blade. A transposon insertion mutation in pgant3 or RNA interference to pgant3 resulted in blistered wings, a phenotype characteristic of genes involved in integrin-mediated cell interactions. Expression of wild type pgant3 in the mutant background rescued the wing blistering phenotype, whereas expression of another family member (pgant35A) did not, revealing a unique requirement for pgant3. pgant3 mutants displayed reduced O-glycosylation along the basal surface of larval wing imaginal discs, which was restored with wild type pgant3 expression, suggesting that reduced glycosylation of basal proteins is responsible for disruption of adhesion in the adult wing blade. Glycosylation reactions demonstrated that PGANT3 glycosylates certain extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PGANT3 glycosylates tiggrin, an ECM protein known to bind integrin. We propose that this glycosyltransferase is uniquely responsible for glycosylating tiggrin in the wing disc, thus modulating proper cell adhesion through integrin-ECM interactions.

Cell surface, secreted, and ECM proteins undergo a number of post-translational modifications as they transit the secretory apparatus to their final destinations. Although the roles of classical N-linked glycans and proteoglycans are widely appreciated, recent studies have elucidated crucial roles for other types of glycans during development. The disaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3Fuc on the Notch receptor and its ligands has been shown to regulate receptor/ligand interactions and downstream signaling events (16Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H.

Taken together, these studies highlight the diversity of glycans found on proteins and the unique functional roles they play during development. Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated the abundant presence of another type of glycosylation, known as mucin-type O-linked glycosylation (referred to as O-linked glycosylation) throughout development in diverse species (24Kingsley P.D. Ten Hagen K.G. Maltby K.M. Zara J. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. Gerken T.A. Stein D.S. Zhang Z. J. Biol.

In contrast to the previously mentioned types of glycosylation, mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by a large family of enzymes known as the UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltranferases (PGANTs in Drosophila or ppGalNAcTs in mammals) that transfer N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine residues of proteins destined to be membrane-bound or secreted (28Hang H.C.

Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Members of this family have unique but overlapping developmental expression patterns, and many show distinct substrate preferences in vitro, suggesting that each enzyme may be responsible for glycosylating a unique subset of proteins in vivo (25Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. Gerken T.A. Stein D.S. Zhang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35039-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Hang H.C. Bertozzi C.R. Bioorg. Med.

In vitro data further indicate that there exists a hierarchy of activity within the family, with some members initiating the glycosylation of unmodified substrates and others acting only on previously glycosylated substrates, adding GalNAc at positions vicinal to sites previously modified by other family members (30Pratt M.R.

The unique spatial and temporal expression patterns, substrate preferences, and hierarchical action of members of this family suggest a highly regulated process governing the acquisition of this type of glycan. Mucin-type O-glycans on secreted and membrane-bound proteins are uniquely positioned to mediate many events regulating homeostasis and development. Indeed, mutations in ppGalNAc-T3 are thought to be responsible for familial tumoral calcinosis, a rare human disease characterized by hyperphosphatemia and the development of calcified “tumors” in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues (33Topaz O. Shurman D.L. Bergman R. Indelman M. Ratajczak P. Mizrachi M. Khamaysi Z. Behar D. Petronius D. Friedman V. Zelikovic I. Raimer S. Metzker A. Richard G. Sprecher E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in ppGalNAc-T1, although viable and fertile, display reduced lymphocyte homing and bleeding disorders (34Tenno M. Ohtsubo K. Hagen F.K. Ditto D. Zarbock A. Schaerli P. von Andrian U.H. Ley K. Le D. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8783-8796Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a role for another member of this family (pgant35A) in the proper formation of the embryonic tracheal system in Drosophila (35Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J.

Finally, mice deficient in the core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase, which adds a galactose to the O-GalNAc of mucin-type O-glycans, die embryonically from defective angiogenesis resulting in fatal brain hemorrhages (37Xia L. Ju T. Westmuckett A. An G. Ivanciu L. McDaniel J.M. Lupu F. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); hypomorphic mutations result in thrombocytopenia and kidney defects later in development (38Alexander W.S. Viney E.M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16442-16447Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies highlight the diverse consequences of alterations in O-glycosylation that have only recently been discovered due to the inherent complexity of the ppGalNAcT family. Here, we examine the developmental role of another member of this family, pgant3. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that PGANT3 is one of the initiating glycosyltransferases, transferring GalNAc to previously unmodified substrates (25Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. Gerken T.A. Stein D.S. Zhang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35039-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, pgant3 gene expression is highly regulated during development (27Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study we find that a transposon mutation in pgant3 or RNA interference (RNAi) to pgant3 results in wing blistering, implicating O-glycosylation in integrin-mediated cell adhesion occurring during wing blade formation. A reduction in O-glycoproteins was seen along the basal surface of the pgant3 mutant wing imaginal discs along with altered disc morphology. Based on our studies, we propose that O-glycosylation of specific ECM proteins known to bind integrin is required for proper epithelial cell adhesion in the wing disc. This finding provides the first direct evidence for the role of mucin type O-glycans in a developmentally regulated cell adhesion event and identifies a novel protein modification required for proper wing blade formation in the fly.

Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate a Gal4-inducible construct expressing wild type pgant3 cDNA that was then used to create transgenic flies. The complete coding region from the wild type pgant3 gene was excised from the GH09147 cDNA clone (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the same sites of pUAST to generate the plasmid pUAS-pgant3. To generate the Gal4-inducible pgant3IR construct, sense (taatacctaggAAGGTGAATGTTACGGAGCGTGTGG) and antisense (taatacctaggCTGCGCCAGCATTACATTCGAAGTG) primers were used to amplify a 500-bp fragment from the catalytic region of pgant3. The PCR product was then cloned stepwise into the AvrII and NheI sites on either side of the white intron in the vector pWIZ (41Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W.

To examine the effect of the transposon on pgant3 gene expression levels, pgant3c01318/pgant3c01318 homozygotes, wild type, and transposon excision lines were used to isolate RNA and perform real-time PCR. Briefly, RNA was isolated using the FastRNA Pro Green kit (Q-BIOgene). cDNA synthesis was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). PCR primers were designed using Beacon Designer software (Bio-Rad). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a MyiQ real time PCR thermocycler (Bio-Rad) using the SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to determine expression levels of all pgant family members was performed using the PCR primers listed in supplemental Table 1 with cDNA prepared from wild type, Tub>pgant3IR2#2, and Tub>pgant3IR2#9 larval wing discs. Wing Disc Fixation and Staining—Imaginal wing discs were stained according to standard procedures and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Mouse monoclonal anti-Tn antibody (Ca3638) (44Avichezer D.

Stained wing discs were analyzed using the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Images were processed using the LSM Imager Browser and Photoshop. Measurements of wing disc thickness and O-glycan staining in x-z cross sections were performed in the center of each disc. Values were averaged, and S.D. were calculated. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's t test. Glycosylation Assays in Vitro—Assays for glycosyltransferase activity were performed as described previously (25Ten Hagen K.G.

Reaction products were purified by anion exchange chromatography, and [14C]GalNAc incorporation was measured. Reactions using media from cells expressing empty vector alone yielded background values that were subtracted from each experimental value. Adjusted experimental values were then averaged, and S.D. were calculated. All assays were performed in duplicate.

Immunoprecipitation—Equivalent amounts of protein extracts were prepared from 3rd instar larval wing discs from wild type and pgant3c01318 homozygotes. 50 μl of immobilized protein L suspension (Thermo Scientific) was added to 500 μl of protein extract and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h to preclear. The mixtures were centrifuged, and the precleared supernatant was collected. 10 μl of the tiggrin antibody were added to the precleared supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The following day 50 μl of washed immobilized protein L suspension was added, and incubation was performed at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexed proteins were collected by pulse centrifugation. Pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in sample loading buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the Tn Ab as described. Transposon Insertion Decreases pgant3 Gene Expression and Causes Wing Blistering—pgant3 is one of 12 members of the Drosophila gene family encoding the polypeptide GalNAc glycosyltransferases that are responsible for initiating mucin-type O-linked glycosylation of secreted and membrane-bound proteins (25Ten Hagen K.G.

Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). pgant3 gene expression is highly regulated both spatially and temporally during development (27Tian E. Ten Hagen K.G. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We set out to examine the biological roles of O-glycosylation mediated by this glycosyltransferase using three putative transposon insertions in the pgant3 gene from the Exelixis Drosophila stock collection (39Thibault S.T. Singer M.A. Miyazaki W.Y. Milash B. Dompe N.A. Singh C.M. Buchholz R. Demsky M. Fawcett R. Francis-Lang H.L. Ryner L. Cheung L.M. Chong A. Erickson C. Fisher W.W. Greer K. Hartouni S.R. Howie E.

Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Genomic sequencing of the insertion sites revealed that only one transposon resided within the pgant3 gene (PBac{PB}pgant3c01318); the line containing this transposon is hereafter designated pgant3c01318. pgant3c01318 contains a piggyBac transposable element in the fourth intron of pgant3, separating exons that encode the conserved catalytic region of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). Quantitative PCR was performed on wild type and homozygous transposon insertion mutants to assess the effect of the transposon on the expression levels of pgant3 as well as the flanking tetraspanin genes (Tsp42Ep andTsp42Eq) (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, pgant3 gene expression 3′ to the transposon insertion site was significantly reduced in the transposon insertion line relative to wild type. Expression of the flanking tetraspanin genes was not affected. This result demonstrates that the transposon insertion specifically affects pgant3 gene expression, thus supporting the use of this line to invest"
https://openalex.org/W2066382194,"Macroautophagy, a tightly orchestrated intracellular process for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic proteins or organelles, is believed to be essential for cell survival or death in response to stress conditions. Recent observations indicate that autophagy is an adaptive response in cells subjected to prolonged hypoxia. However, the signaling mechanisms that activate autophagy under acute hypoxic stress are not clearly understood. In this study, we show that acute hypoxic stress by treatment with 1% O(2) or desferroxamine, a hypoxia-mimetic agent, of cells renders a rapid induction of LC3-II level changes and green fluorescent protein-LC3 puncta accumulation, hallmarks of autophagic processing, and that this process involves protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), and occurs prior to the induction of BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3). Interestingly, hypoxic stress leads to a rapid and transient activation of JNK in Pa-4 or mouse embryo fibroblast cells. Acute hypoxic stress-induced changes in LC3-II level and JNK activation are attenuated in Pa-4 cells by dominant negative PKCdeltaKD or in mouse embryo fibroblast/PKCdelta-null cells. Intriguingly, the requirement of PKCdelta is not apparent for starvation-induced autophagy. The importance of PKCdelta in hypoxic stress-induced adaptive responses is further supported by our findings that inhibition of PKCdelta-facilitated autophagy by 3-methyladenine or Atg5 knock-out renders a greater prevalence of cell death following prolonged desferroxamine treatment, whereas PKCdelta- or JNK1-deficient cells exhibit resistance to extended hypoxic exposure. These results uncover dual roles of PKCdelta-dependent signaling in the cell fate determination upon hypoxic exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2162413612,"Background Comparative morphology identifies the digits of the wing of birds as 1,2 and 3, but they develop at embryological positions that become digits 2, 3 and 4 in other amniotes. A hypothesis to explain this is that a homeotic frame shift of digital identity occurred in the evolution of the bird wing, such that digits 1,2 and 3 are developing from embryological positions 2, 3 and 4. Digit 1 of the mouse is the only digit that shows no late expression of HoxD-11. This is also true for the anterior digit of the bird wing, suggesting this digit is actually a digit 1. If this is the case, we can expect closer relatives of birds to show no HoxD-11 expression only in digit 1. To test this prediction we investigate HoxD-11 expression in crocodilians, the closest living relatives of birds. Methodology/Principal Findings Using degenerate primers we cloned a 606 nucleotide fragment of exon 1 of the alligator HoxD-11 gene and used it for whole-mount in-situ detection in alligator embryos. We found that in the pentadactyl forelimbs of alligator, as in the mouse, late expression of HoxD-11 is absent only in digit 1. Conclusions/Significance The ancestral condition for amniotes is that late-phase HoxD-11 expression is absent only in digit 1. The biphalangeal morphology and lack of HoxD-11 expression of the anterior digit of the wing is like digit 1 of alligator and mouse, but its embryological position as digit 2 is derived. HoxD-11 expression in alligator is consistent with the hypothesis that both digit morphology as well as HoxD-11 expression are shifted towards posterior in the bird wing."

They act as multiprotein nanomachines (injectisomes) that translocate a diverse repertoire of proteins (effectors) either to extracellular locations or directly into eukaryotic cells, in a Sec-independent manner (interkingdom protein transfer). The effectors modulate the function of crucial host regulatory molecules and trigger a range of highly dynamic cellular responses, which determine pathogen-host recognition, pathogen/symbiont accommodation and elicitation or suppression of defense responses by the eukaryotic hosts. T3SS have evolved into seven families distributed among Gram-negative proteobacteria by horizontal gene transfer (3Troisfontaines P. Cornelis G.R. Physiology. 2005; 20: 326-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The core of the T3SS apparatus is formed by a set of nine widely conserved proteins that share sequence and structural homologies that span the divide between flagellar and non-flagellar systems, as evidenced by the structural similarities between the homologous domains of HrcQB (4Fadouloglou V.E.

Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), many secreted T3SS components, exhibit sequence motifs strongly favoring coiled-coil formation, a property that they share with effectors and numerous other proteins involved in translocation and secretion regulation (8Delahay R.M.

Rev. 2005; 29: 201-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil tertiary motif in proteins consists of 2–5 amphipathic α-helices winding around each other to form a supercoil structure and is associated with specific sequence patterns (heptad repeats) that reflect repeating variations of physicochemical properties (10Paliakasis C.D. Kokkinidis M. Prot. Engineering. 1992; 5: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J.

The motif is highly versatile, serving a broad range of functions, and occurring both in monomeric form and a variety of oligomeric assemblies; its prevalence in T3SS suggests that it may contribute to fundamental requirements of their function in a manner that is not yet understood. In various biological systems, coiled-coils are frequently unfolded as monomers and fold only upon association and formation of quaternary complexes (12Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L.

Our interest in HrpO was provoked by recent insights into the function of soluble components of the export apparatus (16Paul K. Erhardt M. Hirano T. Blair D. Hughes K.T.

HrpO and FliJ have similar size, are encoded by genes located immediately downstream of the atpase gene of their respective gene clusters and despite the absence of significant sequence homology, are predicted to contain coiled-coil segments. FliJ participates in an interaction network involving FliH (regulator of the FliI ATPase), the core proteins FlhA (19Fraser G.M. Gonzalez-Pedrajo B. Tame J.R.H. Macnab R.M. J.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification—N-terminally His6-tagged HrpO was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells and purified using a Ni-NTA-agarose column and a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column. C-terminally His6-tagged HrpE was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (see supplemental data for details). Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration was performed at 20 °C using anÄKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) with a calibrated XK16/100 column packed with Sephacryl S100. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and elution was monitored at 280 nm. Sample solutions were prepared to a concentration of 5–30 mg/ml and loaded using a 2-ml loop. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)—Data were collected at 4 °C for three different HrpO concentrations (1.8, 3.6, and 7.3 mg/ml) at beamline X33 at EMBL/DESY using a MAR345 detector (21Roessle M.W.

Using PRIMUS (22Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar) the data were analyzed for radiation damage, averaged after normalization to the intensity of the incident beam, and corrected for the detector response. PRIMUS was also used for the buffer subtraction, data scaling, calculation of the radius of gyration Rg from the slope of the Guinier plot (lnI(s) versus s2) (23Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle X-ray Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar) and the radius of gyration of the cross section (Rg,CS) (24Ishimuro Y. Hamada F. Nakajima A. J. Polym. Sci. 1979; 17: 1811-1819Google Scholar), based on the Guinier approximation for a rod particle (scattering intensity: I; momentum transfer: s = 4πsin(θ)/λ;2θ: scattering angle; λ = 1.5 Å: wavelength of x-rays). The forward scattering intensity I(0) (proportional to the number of electrons of the particle) was estimated through extrapolation of the Guinier plot at 2θ = 0° and used to deduce molecular mass of HrpO in solution. MW calibration was based on scattering data from a 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin solution in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The GNOM package (25Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the pair distribution function P(r) and to estimate the maximum particle dimension (Lmax). Kratky plots were obtained by plotting I(s) × s2 versus s and used to judge the folding of the protein. EOM (26Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), was used to quantitatively characterize the disorder of HrpO by allowing for the coexistence of different conformations contributing to the experimental scattering pattern. These conformers were selected using a genetic algorithm (GAJOE) from a pool containing 10,000 models randomly generated by RanCh (26Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J.

Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were acquired using a J-815 CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) with a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette, at HrpO concentrations of 0.02–0.21 mg/ml, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 50 mm KF. Far-UV spectra were measured with 50 nm/min scanning speed, 1 min response time, and 3 accumulations. Far-UV CD spectra were also collected for the HrpE protein at concentrations 0.16 and 0.33 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 50 mm KF. The Spectra Manager program (Jasco Corp.) was used for buffer subtraction and unit conversions to molar residual ellipticities. Thermal denaturation data were collected monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm in the range of 0–90 °C with a temperature increase of 80 °C/h and a waiting time of 3 s for stabilization. Full far-UV CD spectra (260–195 nm) were also recorded in the range of 4–64 °C during the above procedure in steps of 4 °C. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (27Pérez J. Vachette P. Russo D. Desmadril M. Durand D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 721-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) of the thermal denaturation spectra using the program SVD1 was performed to determine significant independent states in the unfolding transition. The significant species needed to model the CD data as a function of temperature were determined on the basis of the characteristics of the SVD basis vectors ui[θ] and the temperature dependence of their associated coefficients vi. The thermal unfolding curve was fitted using SigmaPlot, assuming a two-state model (N → U) (28Greenfield N.J. Nat. Prot. 2006; 1: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra were also recorded at 4 °C after the sample was heated at 90 °C to verify the reversibility of the thermal unfolding transition. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System 2 (Clontech). The hrpO gene was inserted into the pAS2-1 plasmid to create an in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The hrpE gene was cloned in the pACT2 plasmid and fused in frame with the transcription activation domain of GAL4. The plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ69–4A carrying three different GAL4-responsive reporter genes (ade, his, and lacZ), each driven by a different GAL4-responsive promoter, to reduce the incidence of false positives. The interaction of hybrid proteins was examined by growing the transformed cells on complete minimal medium lacking Trp, Leu, Ade, and His for 3 days at 30 °C. Plasmids pVA3-1 and pTD1-1 are DNA-binding domain and activation domain fusion plasmids that provide a positive control for interacting proteins. Co-purification of HrpE and HrpO—Co-expressed His10-HrpE and HrpO were co-purified by metal affinity chromatography from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells co-expressing His10-HrpE and HrpO. Details are given in supplemental data. Sequence Analysis—T3SS gene clusters were retrieved from GenBank™. For all T3SS families products of genes located immediately downstream the T3SS atpase gene, and having a comparable size to HrpO were analyzed for the detection of intrinsic unfolding (program FoldIndex, Ref. 29Prilusky J.

Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) and MATCHER (30Fischetti V.A. Landau G.M. Schmidt J.P. Sellers P. Inform. Process Lett. 1993; 45: 11-18Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) and secondary structure (PSIPRED (31Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar)). Three-dimensional structural profile recognition from sequences was performed with PHYRE (32Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Homologues of HrpE were found using PSI-BLAST. Protein physicochemical parameters were calculated with ProtParam (33Gasteiger, E., Hoogland, C., Gattiker, A., Duvaud, S., Wilkins, M. R., Appel, R. D., and Bairoch, A. (2005) The Proteomics Protocols Handbook, Humana PressGoogle Scholar). HrpO Forms Heterogeneous Populations of Oligomers in Vitro— When subjected to size-exclusion chromatography at high protein concentrations, the 147-residue HrpO protein elutes with an asymmetric peak profile at an apparent molecular weight (MW) of ∼51 kDa (Fig. 1A), corresponding either to a dimer or trimer (assuming globularity) or to a highly extended non-globular conformation. The broadness of the peak indicates polydispersity. At lower concentrations the elution profiles shifts toward smaller apparent MW. SAXS was used to analyze the HrpO oligomerization. From the forward scattering intensity I(0) a MW of ∼23 kDa was determined at low concentrations (<2 mg/ml) suggesting a prevalence of the monomeric form (supplemental Table S1). The I(0) values are concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B) suggesting self-association effects. At 7 mg/ml the average MW is ∼77 kDa, corresponding to tetramers or higher order oligomers. Guinier plots of the scattering curves (Fig. 1C) show increasing deviations from linearity at higher concentrations, an indication of polydisperse oligomer populations and of self-association toward complexes of increasingly higher average size (Fig. 1C). HrpO Is Highly α-Helical and Undergoes a Two-state Thermal Unfolding with Very Low Melting Temperature—Far-UV CD spectra of HrpO show the characteristic minima of α-helical proteins at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 2). From the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm, an α-helical content of ≈60% is estimated (34Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) at 4 °C, which decreases to ≈50% at 20 °C and to ≈20% at 60 °C (HrpO concentration, 0.1 mg/ml). The α-helical content is concentration dependent and increases by ∼50% when concentration increases from 0.02 to 0.1 mg/ml (supplemental Fig. S1). An increase of the ionic strength of the solution from 25 to 250 mm Na2SO4 also increases α-helical content by ∼50% (Fig. 2D). The thermal unfolding of HrpO was monitored by the temperature dependence of the CD signal at 222 nm (Fig. 2A). The 1st derivative of the thermal unfolding data reveals an unusually low transition temperature of 21 °C. Fitting the thermal unfolding data by a curve under the assumption of a two-state transition (Fig. 2A, red line), yields a melting temperature of 21 ± 4 °C, in good agreement with the value obtained by the 1st derivative of the thermal unfolding data. The 203-nm isodichroic point of the CD spectra collected at different temperatures (Fig. 2B) is also consistent with a two-state unfolding via an α-helix to random coil transition (35Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1995; 36: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The SVD analysis (36Wall M.E. Rechtsteiner A. Rocha L.M. Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis. Kluwer, Norwell2003Crossref Google Scholar) of the far-UV CD spectra confirms the above transition, as it produces only two significant species of linearly independent CD spectra, all other SVD basis vectors being negligible (Fig. 2C). The first significant species corresponds to coiled-coil (37Lees J.G. Miles A.J. Wien F. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the second one to random coil (38Uversky V.N. FEBS J. 2002; 269: 2-12Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of the coefficients of the basis vectors is shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The double wavelength plot (39Uversky V.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1852-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) [θ]200 versus [θ]222 of molar residual ellipticities at 200 nm and 222 nm (Fig. 2E) reflects a propensity for structural disorder (see “Discussion”). HrpO Does Not Possess a Well Folded Structure in Vitro— Kratky plots (40Hagihara Y. Hoshino M. Hamada D. Kataoka M. Goto Y. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) from SAXS data were used to judge the folding of HrpO (Fig. 3C). The absence of a bell-shaped curve with a pronounced peak indicates the absence of globular structure, although the presence of some residual structure is suggested by the tail of the plot that reaches a plateau at higher s values. At 1.8 mg/ml an average radius of gyration (Rg) of 35 Å was calculated from the Guinier plot, which is considerably larger than the value expected (17 Å) for a monomeric, globular protein of 147 residues. On the other hand, a value of 41 Å is expected for HrpO in a completely unfolded state (27Pérez J. Vachette P. Russo D. Desmadril M. Durand D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 721-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 41Jha A.K. Colubri A. Freed K.F. Sosnick T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We interpret these results as being consistent with an unfolded molecule that retains some secondary structure. The radius of gyration of the cross section (Rg,CS), an estimate of the average transverse dimensions of the molecule, is 12.9 ± 0.1 Å (calculated for the angular range 0.5 > sRg,CS > 1.01), and is consistent with the presence of α-helices. Taking into account that high α-helical content was determined by CD even at lower HrpO concentrations compared with SAXS experiments, we assume that the Kratky plots reflect a highly disordered structure containing to a significant extent α-helical segments. To test this hypothesis, the Ensemble Optimization Method (EOM) (26Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) was used to characterize the HrpO disorder, under the constraint that all HrpO models include four α-helical segments (∼50% of the sequence) strongly predicted by the PHYRE (32Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) fold recognition techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”), the rest of the protein being random chain. An ensemble of 20 models shown in Fig. 3A was selected on the basis of the best fit to the experimental SAXS data (Fig. 3B). The quality of the fit (χ = 1.19) supports the model of a highly α-helical, highly disordered structure. The HrpO Sequence Exhibits Characteristics of an Intrinsically Disordered Coil-coil and Has Extensive Analogies to Proteins from Other T3SS and the Flagellum—Despite the absence of a significant homology (the residue identity is less than 18%), the HrpO and FliJ sequences share specific characteristics, which suggest similar properties: Based on their average hydrophobicity and net charge, both proteins are predicted (29Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Silman J.L.S. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) to be unfolded and highly α-helical with a pronounced coiled-coil propensity. For HrpO the predicted properties agree with the experimental observations. A set of 27 additional proteins (supplemental Table S2) also encoded by genes immediately downstream of the atpase gene in various T3SS gene clusters, possess similar sequence characteristics: They are small (145 ± 34 residues) and most probably extensively disordered due to a high content of disorder-promoting and a low content of order-promoting residues (42Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Prot. Funct. Biochem. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Google Scholar). High α-helical content and coiled-coil propensity is also strongly predicted for all. Despite these analogies, their sequences are diverse, lacking overall similarities. Some homologies can be detected if they are compared at the level of individual T3SS families (3Troisfontaines P. Cornelis G.R. Physiology. 2005; 20: 326-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar): Members of the Ysc and Hrc1 families show the highest similarities, although even in these cases the level residue identities does not exceed 12–18%. The conserved residues are overwhelmingly either disorder-promoting (Arg, Gln, Glu, Lys) or Leu and Ala, i.e. amino acids strongly associated with coiled-coil proteins (10Paliakasis C.D. Kokkinidis M. Prot. Engineering. 1992; 5: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). HrpO Interacts with the HrpE Protein in Vivo—HrpO was found to interact in vivo with the HrpE protein using yeast 2-hybrid system and co-purification assays (Fig. 4). Both proteins are coded by terminal ORFs of separate operons in the respective pathogenicity islands of P. syringae pathovars and are not translocated through the T3SS (43Ramos A.R. Morello J.E. Ravindran S. Deng W.-L. Huang H.-C. Collmer A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), being considered instead injectisome core components (44Pallen M.J. Bailey C.M. Beatson S.A. Prot. Sci. 2006; 15: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HrpE belongs to the FliH/YscL-like proteins that are homologous with the second-stalk components of the FoF1 and v ATPases (44Pallen M.J. Bailey C.M. Beatson S.A. Prot. Sci. 2006; 15: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). FliH regulates the activity of the FliI ATPase (45Lane M.C. O'Toole P.W. Moore S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 508-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, FliH interacts with FliJ (19Fraser G.M. Gonzalez-Pedrajo B. Tame J.R.H. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5546-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is the HrpO counterpart in the flagellum; this suggests analogous roles for the FliJ/FliH and HrpO/HrpE interactions in different systems. The sequences of HrpE, FliH, and YscL possess extensive heptad repeat patterns, comparable to those found for their respective HrpO-like interaction partners (supplemental Table S2). It is thus possible that association via intermolecular coiled-coil formation underlies the HrpO/HrpE and FliJ/FliH interactions. Using an approach that has been used for the study of flagellar protein interactions (46Muskotal A. Kiraly R. Sebestyen A. Gugolya Z. Vegh B.M. Vonderviszt F. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3916-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), far-UV CD spectra of HrpO, HrpE and the HrpO-HrpE complex were recorded and compared. They reveal possible conformational changes accompanying complex formation. Both HrpO and HrpE exhibit CD spectra that are characteristic for proteins with significant α-helical content, in accordance to secondary structure predictions and the presence of heptad patterns. Comparison of the sum of the HrpO and HrpE spectra with the spectrum of the HrpO-HrpE complex shows a decrease of the CD signal at 222 nm, indicating α-helical ordering as a result of interaction (supplemental Fig. S3). Similar α-helical ordering effects were observed for HrpO with increasing protein concentrations (supplemental Fig. S4). As these concentrations fall within the range that favors the monomeric form of HrpO, these effects are probably due to monomer-monomer interactions. This study shows that the HrpO protein forms low to high order oligomers at different concentrations. It is highly α-helical with coiled-coil characteristics, very low melting temperature, and does not posses a well folded structure. HrpO interacts with HrpE, another α-helical T3SS protein that is predicted to possess coiled-coils. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid data and confirmed by co-purification. Sequence analysis suggests that HrpO has characteristics of an intrinsically disordered coiled-coil with extensive analogies to FliJ and to several other proteins across all T3SS families, despite low levels of sequence similarities. Proteins span a continuum from totally disordered to well folded structures. The extreme flexibility of intrinsically disordered proteins, whose structures may alter dramatically as they bind to their cognate folded protein target, has been suggested to represent a strategy for optimizing the search and interaction with their targets (47Sugase K. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nature. 2007; 447: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). This strategy may also apply to the binding of HrpO to its protein targets, as suggested by its pronounced flexibility and the observed α-helical ordering effects associated with the HrpO/HrpE interaction. The observed properties of HrpO and the predicted properties of its analogues from other T3SS, su"

APTX is a member of the histidine triad superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases but is distinct from other family members in that it acts upon DNA. The target of APTX is 5′-adenylates at DNA nicks or breaks that result from abortive DNA ligation reactions. In this work, we show that APTX acts as a nick sensor, which provides a mechanism to assess the adenylation status of unsealed nicks. When an adenylated nick is encountered by APTX, base pairing at the 5′ terminus of the nick is disrupted as the adenylate is accepted into the active site of the enzyme. Adenylate removal occurs by a two-step process that proceeds through a transient AMP-APTX covalent intermediate. These results pinpoint APTX as the first protein to adopt canonical histidine triad-type reaction chemistry for the repair of DNA.

Human APTX is 342 amino acids in length and contains three functional domains: an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a central histidine triad (HIT) domain, and a C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) domain (see Fig. 1A). The FHA domain mediates complex formation with XRCC1-DNA ligase IIIα by interaction with phosphorylated residues in XRCC1 (4Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P.

Morimatsu M. Takahashi H. Makifuchi T. Fukuhara N. Tsuji S. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), supporting a role for APTX in DNA single strand break repair. The FHA domain of APTX also interacts with phosphorylated XRCC4, however, thereby mediating complex formation with XRCC4-DNA ligase IV, suggestive of an additional role in double strand break repair (4Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The actions of APTX are intimately linked to the mechanism by which DNA ligases promote break repair. Ligation occurs through a multistep process involving (i) the covalent binding of an adenylate (AMP) group to the active site lysine, (ii) transfer of the adenylate to the 5′-terminal phosphate group at the DNA break, and (iii) phosphodiester bond formation, which seals the DNA backbone and discharges the AMP moiety once again (10Ellenberger T. Tomkinson A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it has become apparent that 5′-DNA adenylates are not always resolved in the course of a ligation reaction. For example, it has been shown that human DNA ligase IIIα attempts futile ligation at “dirty” oxidative SSBs, which often have phosphates at both 3′ and 5′ termini, and aborts the reaction after adenylation of the DNA (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These dead-end adenylates appear to be the substrate for APTX as in vitro studies have shown that APTX can specifically remove 5′-adenylates, leading to the suggestion that APTX acts as a general proofreader for abortive DNA ligation reactions (3Rass U. Ahel I. West S.C. Cell. 2007; 130: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Rass U. Ahel I. West S.C. J. Biol.

DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1061-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This discovery of the DNA deadenylation reaction catalyzed by APTX provides a molecular rationale for AOA1 because abortive ligation events are inevitable in vivo given that oxidative damage causes many dirty breaks per cell each day. Normally these dead-end DNA adenylates would be resolved by APTX, but in AOA1 patients they may accumulate as a consequence of ATPX dysfunction, leading to impaired gene transcription and eventual cell death. The specific sensitivity of neuronal cells seen in AOA1 may be due to high levels of oxidative stress coupled with their postmitotic status, which might not permit alternative (replication-dependent) options for the removal and repair of DNA adenylates (3Rass U. Ahel I. West S.C. Cell. 2007; 130: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). APTX is a member of the HIT superfamily of proteins, which takes its name from the active site HϕHϕHϕϕ histidine triad sequence motif (where ϕ is a hydrophobic residue) (15Seraphin B. DNA Seq. 1992; 3: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HIT proteins catalyze nucleotide transfer from a number of specific substrates to water (hydrolase activity) or a second substrate (transferase activity) (16Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and it is the HIT domain that gives APTX the capacity to deadenylate DNA (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the mechanism by which APTX interacts with DNA and resolves DNA adenylates. Significantly APTX is the only HIT superfamily member to act on DNA, and we provide evidence that the specificity for DNA adenylates is reflected in its HIT-ZF domain structure, which we propose is a defining and conserved feature of Aprataxin orthologs. We show that APTX possesses nick sensor activity, which is ideally suited to locate and repair 5′-DNA adenylates. The DNA deadenylation reaction involves two-step chemistry that proceeds through transient formation of a covalent AMP-enzyme intermediate. Extracts and Proteins—Human APTX cDNA was PCR-amplified from a HeLa cDNA library (Invitrogen) and cloned into pET41 using the SpeI and BamHI restriction sites. This plasmid expressed recombinant APTX fused to an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag and a C-terminal His8 tag. The QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create mutant versions of APTX. Arabidopsis thaliana total RNA was kindly provided by Dr. Charles White. cDNA corresponding to a transcript starting at nucleotide 1146 to the end of APTX (AT5G01310) was cloned into pET41a using the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. The resulting protein, containing glutathione S-transferase/His6 tags at the N terminus, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The tags used here have been shown previously not to interfere with APTX activity (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C.

All oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma and purified by denaturing PAGE. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare), and 5′-phosphorylation was brought to completion by addition of excess cold ATP. SSB substrates (2 μm) were adenylated by abortive ligation with 400 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP for 12 h. The adenylated strand (oligo 1) was purified by 15% denaturing PAGE and reannealed with oligos 2 and 3 to form adenylated SSB substrates (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The duplex substrate comprised oligo 3 with its complement (oligo 4). Neutral PAGE was used to purify all annealed DNA substrates before use. For the permanganate experiments, oligo 2 was annealed with oligos 1T and 3T. Adenylated ϕX174 DNA was prepared as described previously (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In brief, 95 nm ϕX174 replicative form I DNA (New England Biolabs) was treated with 10 μm H2O2, 0.1 mm FeCl3, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm NADH for 30 min at room temperature. Resulting oxidative DNA breaks were adenylated with [α-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare) by abortive ligation using T4 DNA ligase. DNA Deadenylation Reactions—Synthetic SSB substrates (25 nm) and adenylated ϕX174 replication form I DNA (6 nm) were used in 10-μl reactions containing protein extract or recombinant APTX as indicated. Unless stated otherwise, incubation was for 1 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. Reactions were scaled up for time course experiments. The deadenylation of synthetic SSB substrates was stopped by addition of formamide loading buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Products were analyzed by 12% denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography. Deadenylation reactions containing the ϕX174 DNA were stopped by addition of SDS (2% final concentration) and analyzed by 0.6% agarose gel electrophoresis or 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Data were quantified using a Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (GE Healthcare). DNase I Footprinting—Reactions (5 μl) contained the DNA substrate (25 nm) in DNase I buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2). After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, 0.1 unit of DNase I (New England Biolabs) was added. DNase I digestion was stopped after 1 min by addition of formamide loading buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Reaction products were analyzed by 12% denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography. Chemical Cleavage of DNA—Reactions (10 μl) contained 25 nm DNA substrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 g/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and APTX as indicated. After preincubation for 20 min at 25 °C, KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. After 2 min β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 1 m. After ethanol precipitation in the presence of 1 mg/ml glycogen, the DNA was resuspended in 1 m piperidine and incubated at 95 °C for 30 min. After ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in formamide loading buffer and analyzed by 12% denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography. Molecular Architecture and Evolutionary Conservation of Aprataxin—Human APTX features a tripartite FHA-HIT-ZF domain structure (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Rass U. Ahel I. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9469-9474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether the co-occurrence of a ZF with a HIT domain might indicate authentic Aprataxins, we performed data base searches to identify potential orthologs in virtually all sequenced eukaryotic genomes (Fig. 1A). One exception was found in C. elegans where, despite the presence of several HIT superfamily proteins, we were unable to detect the presence of a ZF in any of these proteins. HIT-ZF domain proteins were also absent from prokaryotes. When cell-free extracts prepared from a variety of organisms were incubated with a synthetic 5′-adenylated nicked DNA substrate with a one-nucleotide gap and phosphates at both the 3′ and the 5′ termini (Fig. 1B; this substrate mimics the product of an abortive ligation event that would occur at an SSB induced by oxidative DNA damage), we observed a perfect correlation between our HIT-ZF predictions and DNA deadenylation activity (Fig. 1C). The HIT-ZF domain proteins identified in plants are characterized by a more elaborate domain structure including a number of additional modules (Fig. 1A). To determine whether these are true Aprataxins, we cloned recombinant A. thaliana basic helix-loop-helix family protein AT5G01310.1 and tested its ability to catalyze DNA deadenylation. The recombinant protein spanned the macro-, HIT, and ZF domains of the protein and was proficient for DNA deadenylation in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions, indicative of true APTX-like metal-independent DNA deadenylation activity (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3) (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data show that APTX is functionally conserved in animals, fungi, and plants but not in prokaryotes and establish the combination of a HIT domain and a ZF domain as the structural hallmark of the Aprataxins. Nick Sensor Activity of Aprataxin—Previous studies have shown that APTX binds linear double-stranded DNA and nicked DNA substrates with similar affinity and that adenylated DNA is bound more avidly than non-adenylated substrates (12Rass U. Ahel I. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9469-9474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Kijas A.W. Harris J.L. Harris J.M. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To define these interactions in more detail, we used DNase I protection assays to analyze complexes formed between APTX and DNA substrates containing 5′-adenylated nicks. To inhibit adenylate removal, it was necessary to use human APTX carrying the inactivating mutation H260A. Previous studies have shown that recombinant APTXH260A, with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag and a C-terminal His8 tag, exhibits wild-type substrate binding properties (12Rass U. Ahel I. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9469-9474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). APTXH260A was incubated with the adenylated SSB substrate (Fig. 2A; this contains a one-nucleotide gap and is composed of three oligonucleotides: an 18-mer with a 5′-adenylate (oligo 1), a 17-mer with a 3′-phosphate terminus at the 5′-side of the nick (oligo 2), and a continuous 36-mer (oligo 3)), and the resulting complexes were probed using DNase I. In the presence of APTX, regions of protection were observed over ∼12 nucleotides of oligo 1 and 14 nucleotides of oligo 3. In contrast, no significant changes were observed with oligo 2, indicating that Aprataxin binds asymmetrically to the DNA almost exclusively at the 3′-side of the adenylate (Fig. 2A and indicated schematically in Fig. 2B). When similar experiments were carried out with non-adenylated nicked DNA, we were surprised to find very similar protection patterns (Fig. 2, C and D) as again strong protection patterns were observed at the 3′-side of the nick. To ensure it was the nick that determined the specific positioning of APTX, we next analyzed complexes formed between APTXH260A and linear duplex DNA of the same length. In this case, we failed to see a clear protection pattern and instead observed weak protection over the entire DNA duplex (Fig. 2E; note that the apparent protection at the 5′ terminus of oligos 3 and 4 was due to the inhibition of multiple cleavage events in the presence of APTX). The nick sensor activity of APTX was disrupted when the ZF domain was inactivated by mutation of the critical zinc-coordinating residues Cys-319 and Cys-322 as the APTXH260A/C319A/C322A mutant protein failed to protect either adenylated or non-adenylated SSB substrates from DNase I digestion (data not shown). APTX Disrupts Watson-Crick Base Pairing at DNA Adenylates—Reasoning that to sample for and/or bind a 5′-AMP moiety, APTX might need to separate the Watson and Crick strands, we next determined whether the interaction of Aprataxin with 5′-adenylates results in base pair disruption. To do this, the formation of unpaired thymines close to the adenylate was monitored using potassium permanganate (KMnO4) as a specific probe. To enable these analyses, we incorporated thymine residues directly adjacent to the nick (T1) and at positions three (T2) and six (T3) nucleotides downstream of the nick on the continuous strand of the SSB substrate (oligo 3T), which was annealed with oligonucleotides 1T and 2 (Fig. 3B). Preliminary experiments using oligo 3T annealed with oligo 2 only (single-stranded/tailed duplex DNA) confirmed that thymine residues T1–T3 were readily accessible to the chemical probe when they were unpaired (Fig. 3A, lane 2). When oligo 3T was present in a non-adenylated SSB substrate, we observed that T1 remained sensitive to chemical cleavage in the absence of APTX, whereas all other thymine residues were protected (lane 5). These results indicate that the chemical probe retains access to the base adjacent to the nick possibly as a result of DNA breathing. In the presence of APTXH260A (lane 5) or wild-type APTX (lane 6), the degree of sensitivity at T1 was unchanged, and we did not find induced sensitivity at other thymine residues. These results show that although APTX binds the 3′-side of the nick (Fig. 2) binding per se does not lead to separation of the Watson and Crick strands (Fig. 3B, panel i). Parallel experiments were carried out with adenylated SSB substrates. Without APTX, we found that T1 was relatively insensitive to chemical cleavage (Fig. 3A, lane 8, and indicated schematically in Fig. 3B, panel ii), but the presence of APTXH260A resulted in a significant hypersensitivity of residue T1 to chemical attack (lane 9). In contrast, wild-type APTX failed to induce such a level of hypersensitivity as expected because the active protein will remove the adenylate under these reaction conditions (lane 10). These results show that the stable binding of APTX to its target lesion results in measurable base disruption to the nucleotide pair directly flanking the adenylated 5′-terminus of the nick (Fig. 3B, panel iii). No sensitivity was induced at T2 or T3, demonstrating that strand separation is limited to the immediate proximity of the adenylated base pair. These results demonstrate that the interaction of APTX with the DNA adenylate induces structural changes in the DNA that are a likely prerequisite for DNA deadenylation. A Covalent AMP-Enzyme Intermediate—Previously it was shown that DNA deadenylation by APTX results in the release of free AMP (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of adenylate hydrolysis remains unknown. The HIT hydrolases generally catalyze a two-step reaction, which includes (i) nucleotide transfer to the active site of the enzyme and (ii) hydrolysis of the resulting nucleotidylated enzyme intermediate (19Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To probe for a covalent AMP-APTX intermediate, we incubated APTX with plasmid DNA that contained 32P-labeled adenylates (Fig. 4A). This substrate was produced by treating plasmid DNA with hydrogen peroxide to produce dirty breaks and subsequent treatment of the damaged plasmid with DNA ligase in the presence of [α-32P]ATP (Fig. 4A) (11Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). As expected, incubation with APTX resulted in rapid deadenylation of the DNA such that all radioactive label was lost (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, when aliquots of the deadenylation reaction were taken 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 s after initiation of the reaction, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, we observed the formation of a discrete 32P-labeled product that comigrated with recombinant APTX (Fig. 4C, lane 2). The formation of 32P-labeled APTX was even more apparent when reactions were carried out on ice (lane 6). These results demonstrate that DNA deadenylation proceeds through a short lived covalent AMP-APTX intermediate. Catalytic Role of Four Conserved Histidine Residues—Next we assessed the significance of a conserved network of active site hydrogen-bonding interactions for the DNA deadenylation reaction. Structural analysis of the HIT hydrolases HINT and fragile histidine triad protein has pinpointed two histidine residues within the histidine triad that make direct contacts with the α-phosphate of the nucleotide ligand (19Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Lima C.D. D'Amico K.L. Naday I. Rosenbaum G. Westbrook E.M. Hendrickson W.A.

Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These residues are stabilized by two further histidine residues, one situated within the histidine triad and one positioned upstream in the primary sequence. By analogy, we predict that APTX His-260 contacts the α-phosphate of the adenylate group with its N∊ atom and is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the Nδ atom and the carbonyl oxygen atom of His-258, whereas His-262 contacts the α-phosphate and is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between its Nδ atom and the N∊ atom of the upstream residue His-201 (Fig. 5A). To test this model, we generated recombinant APTXH201A, APTXH258A, and APTXH262A mutant proteins and compared their activities with APTXH260A and the wild-type protein. First the activity of each protein was determined using the oligonucleotide-based adenylated SSB substrate (Fig. 5B). We observed substantial residual activity for APTXH258A (lane 4), weak activity for APTXH201A and APTXH262A (lanes 3 and 6), and no detectable activity with APTXH260A (lane 5). Similar catalytic activities were observed when we measured the loss of radiolabel from plasmid DNA that was adenylated with [32P]AMP (Fig. 5C). Interestingly when the products of the [32P]AMP plasmid reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after 5 min, we observed a long lived covalent AMP-enzyme intermediate with APTXH258A indicative of impaired enzyme-adenylate hydrolysis (Fig. 5D, lane 3). The last position of the histidine triad is not occupied by a histidine but by a glutamine residue in the HIT nucleotide transferases (e.g. galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase) (Fig. 5E). They also differ from the HIT nucleotide hydrolases by reacting with a second substrate rather than with water to resolve the nucleotidylated enzyme intermediate. To determine the effect of a glutamine residue at position 262 in APTX, we generated mutant APTXH262Q. In contrast to APTXH262A, this mutant showed significant residual DNA deadenylation activity without the need for a second substrate (Fig. 5F). Given that mutation of the four conserved histidine residues, His-201, His-258, His-260, and His-262, differentially affect the DNA deadenylation activity of APTX and that the H258A mutant exhibits a specific defect in the second reaction step, those mutants that retained substantial residual activity were examined more closely. We found that wild-type APTX deadenylated over 90% of the DNA substrate within the first 10 s of the reaction (Fig. 5G). In contrast, mutant APTXH262Q was defective in step 1 (90% DNA deadenylation was achieved only after 5 min of incubation), and yet the rate of release of the AMP from the AMP-APTXH262Q was not significantly affected. With APTXH258A, DNA deadenylation was only slightly slowed with 86% deadenylation taking place within 10 s. At the same time point, 30% of the 32P-labeled AMP was covalently linked to the protein compared with just 3% with the wild-type protein. Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 5 underline the importance of the hydrogen-bonding network that the four conserved histidines form among each other and with the substrate in HIT hydrolases. Consistent with the biochemical results, AOA1-related point mutations are found almost exclusively in the vicinity of the active site and particularly around the histidine triad and histidine residue 201 (Fig. 5A, panel ii) (3Rass U.

https://openalex.org/W2040661517,"As an extracellular bacterium, the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi resides primarily in the extracellular matrix and connective tissues and between host cells during mammalian infection, where decorin and glycosaminoglycans are abundantly found, so its interactions with these host ligands potentially affect various aspects of infection. Decorin-binding proteins (Dbps) A and B, encoded by a 2-gene operon, are outer surface lipoproteins with similar molecular weights and share approximately 40% identity, and both bind decorin and glycosaminoglycans. To investigate how DbpA and DbpB contribute differently to the overall virulence of B. burgdorferi, a dbpAB mutant was modified to overproduce the adhesins. Overproduction of either DbpA or DbpB resulted in restoration of the infectivity of the mutant to the control level, measured by 50% infectious dose (ID50), indicating that the two virulence factors are interchangeable in this regard. Overproduction of DbpA also allowed the mutant to disseminate to some but not all distal tissues slightly slower than the control, but the mutant with DbpB overproduction showed severely impaired dissemination to all tissues that were analyzed. The mutant with DbpA overproduction colonized all tissues, albeit generating bacterial loads significantly lower than the control in heart and joint, while the mutant overproducing DbpB remained severely defective in heart colonization and registered bacterial loads substantially lower than the control in joint. Taken together, the study indicated that DbpA and DbpB play a similar role in contribution to infectivity as measured by ID50 value but contribute differently to dissemination and tissue colonization."

A single point mutation (T4409C) in the gene for human mitochondrial tRNAMet (hmtRNAMet) has been found to cause mitochondrial myopathy.

The hmtRNAMet serves both in translational initiation and elongation in human mitochondria making this tRNA of particular interest in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

This work establishes a foundation for understanding the physiological consequences of the numerous mitochondrial tRNA mutations that result in disease in humans. Human mitochondria are subcellular organelles that produce more than 90% of the energy required by the cell. The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins necessary for energy production, two rRNAs and all of the 22 tRNAs required for the synthesis of these proteins (1Attardi G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 93: 93-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Anderson S. de Brujin M. Coulson A. Eperon I. Sanger F. Young I. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 683-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs have several unusual features that distinguish them from canonical tRNAs. In many cases, they lack a number of the conserved or semi-conserved nucleotides that play important roles in creating the L-shaped tertiary structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic tRNAs (3Dirheimer G. Keith G. Dumas P. Westhof E. RajBhandary U. Soll D. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 93-126Google Scholar). There is little detailed structural information on these tRNAs. No data are currently available that examine the structure of mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs with single nucleotide resolution. However, chemical and enzymatic probing has lead to the idea that these tRNAs have retained the basic cloverleaf structure of canonical tRNAs but that they lack several conserved tertiary interactions leading to a weaker three-dimensional structure (4Watanabe Y.-I.

In addition, Met-tRNAMet must interact with elongation factor EF-Tumt and bind to the A-site of the ribosome during translational elongation. Thus, this tRNAMet is of central importance in mitochondrial translation.Human tRNAMet has a number of interesting features (Fig. 1A). The D-loop is somewhat small and lacks the G residues at positions 18 and 19 that facilitate interactions with the T-loop in the tertiary structure. The first position of the anticodon contains the rare modified base 5-formylcytidine. This modification may play a role in the unusual codon recognition requirements of this tRNA, which must recognize both AUG and AUA codons. The minor loop is short lacking the usual G47, and the T-stem has two adjacent pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs (U-U and U-:). Furthermore, the T-loop lacks the T:C sequence and contains only six nucleotides instead of the normal seven. These unusual structural features suggest that human mitochondrial tRNAMet may have an intrinsically weak tertiary structure.Three interesting point mutations (T4409C, A4435G, and G4450A) occur in the gene for human tRNAMet (hmtRNAMet). The T4409C mutation (Fig. 1A) results in a U8 to C change at the corner of the acceptor stem and D-stem of hmtRNAMet. This mutation leads to mitochondrial myopathy resulting in dystrophic muscles and exercise intolerance (20Vissing J. Salamon M.B. Arlien-Soborg P. Norby S. Manta P. DiMauro S. Schmalbruch H. Neurology. 1998; 50: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The A4435G mutation leads to the change of A37 to G37 in the anticodon loop of the tRNA (21Qu J. Li R. Zhou X. Tong Y. Lu F. Qian Y. Hu Y. Mo J.Q. West C.E. Guan M.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This mutation acts as a modulator of Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy increasing the severity of this condition when it arises because of other mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. The G4450A mutation leads to loss of the final base pair in the T-stem (Fig. 1A). This mutation presents as splenic lymphoma, is largely confined to lymphocyte cells, and results in severely abnormal mitochondria leading to serious defects in energy production (22Lombes A. Bories D. Girodon E. Franchon P. Ngo M. Breton-Gorious J. Tulliez M. Goossens M. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 1: S175-S183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A systematic examination of the structural and biochemical consequences of these mutations is lacking. Here we examine the structure of human mitochondrial tRNAMet and probe the effects of the 8U→C mutation on the structure and function of this tRNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Synthesis—Human mitochondrial tRNAMet transcripts for aminoacylation experiments were prepared by in vitro transcription using the hammerhead ribozyme construct described previously (23Spencer A.C.

The cells were grown at 37 °C for 4 h (A600 = 0.6), induced with 50 ;m isopropyl ;-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then grown at 37 °C for 4 h post-induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and then re-collected by low speed centrifugation.

The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. E. coli MetRS was purified from the supernatant using 400 ;l of a 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) slurry in wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, 200 ;m PMSF, and 7 mm ;ME). The resin was washed with 200 ml of wash buffer. The protein was eluted with 4 ml of elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm imidazole, 200 ;m PMSF, and 7 mm ;ME). The protein sample was dialyzed against 2 volumes of 500 ml of dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and 7 mm ;ME) for 1 h.Cells carrying a plasmid encoding the His6-tagged human mitochondrial MetRS were grown as described (23Spencer A.C. Heck A.H. Takeuchi N. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9743-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Spremulli L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5464-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed as described for E. coli MetRS above. The protein was purified as described for the E. coli MetRS except that the buffers contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The purified protein sample was dialyzed against 2 volumes of 500 ml of MTF dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm ;ME) for 1 h, fast-frozen, and stored at -80 °C.Assay for the Aminoacylation of Human Mitochondrial tRNAMet—The aminoacylation reactions for both the normal and 8U→C mutated tRNAMet transcripts were performed essentially as described (23Spencer A.C. Heck A.H. Takeuchi N. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9743-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 ;l) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm spermine, 200 ;g/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 units/;l SUPERase·In RNase inhibitor, 40 ;m [35S]methionine (4,000 cpm/pmol), 50 nm human mitochondrial MetRS or 8 nm E. coli MetRS, and 1 ;m U8 or 8U→C hmtRNAMet. The amount of aminoacylated tRNA formed was determined by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts at the indicated times.Preparative Aminoacylation of [35S]Met-tRNAMet—Reaction mixtures (2 ml) were prepared as described above except that 20 ;m [35S]methionine (20,000 cpm/pmol), 0.5 ;m U8, or 8U→C hmtRNAMet, and saturating amounts of human mitochondrial MetRS were used. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The tRNAMet was collected by ethanol precipitation and then dissolved in 10 mm potassium succinate, pH 6.0, before use.Formylation of Human Mitochondrial Met-tRNAMet—Formylation reactions (5 ;l) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 ;m EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ;ME, 125 ;m folinic acid (Sigma), 100 nm normal or 8U→C mutated [35S]Met-hmtRNAMet and 8 nm MTFmt. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 0-8 min (0-min time point was taken in the absence of enzyme). At the indicated time, 83 mm NaOH (1 ;l of 500 mm) was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The [35S]Met and [35S]fMet in 5 ;l of each reaction were separated on Partisil LK5D TLC plates (Whatman) with a butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1) mixture. TLC plates were visualized by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare) and the spots were analyzed using the ImageQuant program.Binding of Human Mitochondrial Met-tRNAMet to Bovine Mitochondrial EF-Tu (EF-Tumt)—EF-Tumt was prepared as described (26Bullard J.M. Cai Y.-C. Zhang Y. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), except that the cells were lysed as described above for E. coli MetRS, and the high speed centrifugation step was omitted. Where indicated the normal U8 or 8U→C mutated hmtRNAs were phosphorylated with cold ATP using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) prior to large scale aminoacylation.To measure ternary complex formation, reaction mixtures (50 ;l) were prepared as reported (27Hunter S.E. Spremulli L.L. RNA Biol. 2004; 2: 95-102Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) except that 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7, and the indicated amounts of EF-Tumt were used. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 0 °C or 6 min at 37 °C as indicated. Free [35S]Met-hmtRNAMet was digested by a 30-s incubation with 10 ;g of RNase A, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the [35S]Met-hmtRNAMet precipitate was collected on nitrocellulose filters and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Determination of the Kd for ternary complex formation was carried out as described previously (28Cai Y.-C. Bullard J.M. Thompson N.L. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20308-20314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Degradation of hmtRNAMet in a Mitochondrial Extract—Bovine mitoplasts (0.2 g) were prepared as described (29Schwartzbach C. Farwell M. Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were lysed in buffer (2 ml) containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 6 mm ;ME, 0.8 mm EDTA, and 1.6% Triton X-100 by hand homogenization. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Normal U8 and 8U→C mutated hmtRNAMet were 32P-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction mixtures (10 ;l) contained 100 nm normal U8 or 8U→C mutated [32P]hmtRNAMet and the indicated amount of the extract in the lysis buffer above. Incubation was for 10 min at 37 °C, and cold trichloroacetic acid precipitation was used to quantitate the amount of [32P]hmtRNAMet remaining.Selective 2′-Hydroxyl Acylation Analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) Analysis of Normal U8 and 8U→C Mutated hmtRNAMet Transcripts—Normal U8 or 8U→C mutated hmtRNAMet (12 pmol, 0.33 ;m) in 36 ;l of nuclease-free water (Ambion) was incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and then cooled on ice for 2 min. The RNA was divided into 2 aliquots of 4 pmol (12 ;l) and 8 pmol (24 ;l). Folding buffer (6 ;l; 333 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 333 mm NaCl) was added to the 4 pmol of RNA, and folding buffer with 20 mm Mg2+ (12 ;l) was added to the 8 pmol of RNA, and the two samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. To 1 ;l of 100 mm 1-methyl-7-nitroisotoic anhydride (1M7) in anhydrous DMSO or 1 ;l of anhydrous DMSO (control), 9 ;l (2 pmol) of folded RNA was added and allowed to react at 37 °C for 70 s (5 half-lives). The balance of the RNA folded in the presence of Mg2+ (18 ;l) was divided into 2 aliquots of 2 pmol (9 ;l) each and stored at 37 °C for sequencing. MgCl2 (1 ;l; 64 mm) was added to the RNA treated with the folding buffer in the absence of Mg2+. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide (0.3 ;m;3 ;l; 5′-32P-GAACCGGACCGAAGCCCG, obtained from the Nucleic Acids Core Facility at University of North Carolina) was added to the 1M7-treated, DMSO-treated, or untreated RNA (2 pmol), and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then at 35 °C for 20 min for primer annealing. To each reaction, reverse transcription buffer (6 ;l; 250 mm KCl, 167 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 17 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.42 mm each dNTP) was added. Then either ddCTP or ddTTP (1 ;l; 5 mm; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the untreated RNA. After heating to 52 °C, reverse transcriptase (1 ;l; 200 units; Superscript III, Invitrogen) was added, and the primer extension reactions were performed at 52 °C for 5 min. Reactions were quenched with 4 m NaOH (1 ;l) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. For gel analysis, a gel loading solution (29 ;l; 138 mm unbuffered Tris-HCl, 73% (v/v) formamide, 2 mm Tris borate, 86 mm EDTA, pH 8, with xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for an additional 5 min. The cDNA products from the + and - 1M7 and sequencing reactions were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide). Samples on gels (21 cm × 40 cm × 0.4 mm) were subjected to electrophoresis at 1400 V for ∼2.5 h. Gels were visualized by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). The + and - 1M7 band intensities were quantified using SAFA (30Das R. Laederach A. Pearlman S.M. Herschlag D. Altman R.B. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and corrected for signal drop-off (31Badorrek C.S. Weeks K.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12664-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SHAPE reactivities were normalized by subtracting intensities for the -1M7 control from the +1M7 reaction and dividing each by the average reactivity of the most reactive 7% of the nucleotides. To facilitate comparison of the normal U8 and 8U→C mutant tRNAs, the two data sets were normalized to the reactivity of the -CCA end nucleotides. The reactivity of each nucleotide was assigned a value between 0 and 1. Nucleotides fall into one of four categories (32Wilkinson K.A. Merino E.J. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Merino E.J. Wilkinson K.A. Coughlan J.L. Weeks K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4223-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) as follows: unreactive (0.000-0.055), low reactivity (0.055-0.110), moderately reactive (0.110-0.220), or highly reactive (0.220-1.000).Structural Studies of hmtRNAMet Half-molecules—Reconstitution of hmtRNAMet from U8 and 8U→C D-half-molecules with T-half-molecules required Mg2+ and was assessed by gel mobility shift assays using native 15% PAGE in Tris borate buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.3) with and without 3 mm Mg2+ at 4 °C (25Jones C. Spencer A.C. Hsu J. Spremulli L.L. Martinis S.A. DeRider M. Agris P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The concentration of the D-half-molecule was held constant at 31.2 ;m, whereas the concentration of the T-half-molecule was varied from 4.2 to 112 ;m.UV-Monitored Thermodynamic Experiments—The half-molecule RNA samples were dissolved in the above Tris borate buffer used for the PAGE experiments to obtain an RNA concentration of 1.2 ;m. MgCl2 was added to a concentration of 3 mm. UV-monitored thermal denaturations and re-naturations were replicated 10 times and monitored by measuring UV absorbance (260 nm) using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer as published (34Ashraf S.S. Guenther R.H. Ansari G. Malkiewicz A. Sochacka E. Agris P.F. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Yarian C.S. Basti M.M. Cain R.J. Ansari G.

The data points were averaged over 20 s and recorded with a temperature change of 1 °C per min from 4 to 90 °C. The one most inconsistent of the 10 melting transitions (either a denaturation or renaturation) was discarded from each set, and the resulting data were averaged on a point-by-point basis.For UV melts of the hmtRNAMet transcripts, the normal U8 and the 8U→C hmtRNAMet were dialyzed against water using 10-kDa cutoff dialysis cups (Stratagene). The U8 and 8U→C hmtRNAMet transcripts were diluted to 0.5 ;m in a buffer containing 10 mm NaCl and 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0. The thermal denaturation of the tRNAs was monitored by UV absorbance at 260 nm using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. Data points were recorded once per min from 4 to 95 °C with a temperature change of 1 °C per min. Following thermal renaturation, 6 mm Mg2+ was added to the U8 and 8U→C transcripts, and the UV-monitored thermal denaturation experiments were repeated.RESULTSAminoacylation of the Normal and 8U→C Mutated tRNAMet—Previous studies (23Spencer A.C. Heck A.H. Takeuchi N. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9743-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that the transcript of mitochondrial tRNAMet has aminoacylation properties similar to those observed with the native tRNA. Thus, it was possible to use the normal transcript and a transcript containing the 8U→C mutation for studies on the effect of the mutation on the properties of the tRNA. The 8U→C mutation leads to a myopathy presumably arising from a reduction in translational activity in mitochondria. To determine the biochemical consequence of the 8U→C mutation, the abilities of the U8 and 8U→C hmtRNAMet transcripts to be aminoacylated by the human mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase (hmMetRS) were tested. Aminoacylation is an early step required for the tRNA to be used in either the elongation or initiation phase of protein synthesis and is thus of central importance for protein synthesis in mitochondria. The normal U8 transcript was aminoacylated as expected (23Spencer A.C. Heck A.H. Takeuchi N. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9743-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, the 8U→C mutation caused a significant reduction in the rate of aminoacylation of the tRNA by hmMetRS (Fig. 1B). This observation provides one clear rationale for the failure of this tRNA to function in mitochondrial protein biosynthesis.Not unexpectedly, the normal hmtRNAMet was aminoacylated by the E. coli MetRS (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, whereas the 8U→C hmtRNAMet was poorly aminoacylated by the hmMetRS, it was not aminoacylated at all by the E. coli MetRS (Fig. 1C) suggesting that the mutated tRNA had a significantly altered structure. The hmMetRS is believed to be both structurally and functionally homologous to its prokaryotic counter-part (23Spencer A.C. Heck A.H. Takeuchi N. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9743-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this work demonstrates that the hmMetRS is less discriminatory than E. coli MetRS for the structure of the tRNA. Because a major determinant in the recognition of tRNAMet by the MetRS is thought to lie in the anticodon sequence that is unchanged (36Schulman L.H. Pelka H. Science. 1988; 242: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the weak aminoacylation most likely reflects significant structural alterations in the tRNA as a result of the mutation.Formylation of Normal and 8U→C Mutated Met-tRNAMet—The defective aminoacylation of the 8U→C hmtRNAMet made it difficult to assess the effects of the mutation on additional steps in protein biosynthesis. However, small amounts of the aminoacylated 8U→C mutated hmtRNAMet could be isolated, permitting a limited investigation of additional steps in translation.In the mammalian mitochondrial system, the Met-tRNAMet must be formylated by the mitochondrial transformylase (MTFmt) to be used in initiation (19Spencer A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2130309697,"Background The epidermal cells of the C. elegans embryo undergo coordinated cell shape changes that result in the morphogenetic process of elongation. The cytoskeletal ankyrin repeat protein VAB-19 is required for cell shape changes and localizes to cell-matrix attachment structures. The molecular functions of VAB-19 in this process are obscure, as no previous interactors for VAB-19 have been described. Methodology/Principal Findings In screens for VAB-19 binding proteins we identified the signaling adaptor EPS-8. Within C. elegans epidermal cells, EPS-8 and VAB-19 colocalize at cell-matrix attachment structures. The central domain of EPS-8 is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with VAB-19. eps-8 null mutants, like vab-19 mutants, are defective in epidermal elongation and in epidermal-muscle attachment. The eps-8 locus encodes two isoforms, EPS-8A and EPS-8B, that appear to act redundantly in epidermal elongation. The function of EPS-8 in epidermal development involves its N-terminal PTB and central domains, and is independent of its C-terminal SH3 and actin-binding domains. VAB-19 appears to act earlier in the biogenesis of attachment structures and may recruit EPS-8 to these structures. Conclusions/Significance EPS-8 and VAB-19 define a novel pathway acting at cell-matrix attachments to regulate epithelial cell shape. This is the first report of a role for EPS-8 proteins in cell-matrix attachments. The existence of EPS-8B-like isoforms in Drosophila suggests this function of EPS-8 proteins could be conserved among other organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2085524754,"The field is healthy, says Bill Wakeham, but scientists need to reclaim the intellectual ownership of research at the margins of the discipline such as medical or atmospheric physics. A reorganization of the research councils, and government budget decisions announced last December, convinced some UK physicists that their field is losing out. This week sees the publication of an eagerly awaited review of physics research for Research Councils UK. Writing in a Commentary, review chairman Bill Wakeham explains that they found that physics remains a healthy discipline, but faces many challenges. Most pressing are poor physics education in schools, and a growing dependence on too few funding streams."
https://openalex.org/W2164025616,"Ion channels play a central role in setting gradients of ion concentration and electrostatic potentials, which in turn regulate sensory systems and other functions. Based on the structure of the open configuration of the Kv1.2 channel and the suggestion that the two ends of the N-terminal inactivating peptide form a bivalent complex that simultaneously blocks the channel pore and binds to the cytoplasmic T1 domain, we propose a six state kinetic model that for the first time reproduces the kinetics of recovery of the Drosophila Shaker over the full range of time scales and hyperpolarization potentials, including tail currents. The model is motivated by a normal mode analysis of the inactivated channel that suggests that a displacement consistent with models of the closed state propagates to the T1 domain via the S1-T1 linker. This motion stretches the bound (inactivating) peptide, hastening the unblocking of the pore. This pulling force is incorporated into the rates of the open to blocked states, capturing the fast recovery phase of the current for repolarization events shorter than 1 ms. If the membrane potential is hyperpolarized, essential dynamics further suggests that the T1 domain returns to a configuration where the peptide is unstretched and the S1-T1 linker is extended. Coupling this novel hyperpolarized substate to the closed, open and blocked pore states is enough to quantitatively estimate the number of open channels as a function of time and membrane potential. A straightforward prediction of the model is that a slow ramping of the potential leads to very small currents."
