https://openalex.org/W1514533495,"Is human life expectancy approaching its limit? Many--including individuals planning their retirement and officials responsible for health and social policy--believe it is, but the evidence presented in the
 Policy Forum
 suggests otherwise. For 160 years, best-performance life expectancy has steadily increased by a quarter of a year per year, an extraordinary constancy of human achievement. Mortality experts have repeatedly asserted that life expectancy is close to an ultimate ceiling; these experts have repeatedly been proven wrong. The apparent leveling off of life expectancy in various countries is an artifact of laggards catching up and leaders falling behind."
https://openalex.org/W2164435125,"The abundance of individuals in microbial species is so large that dispersal is rarely (if ever) restricted by geographical barriers. This ""ubiquitous"" dispersal requires an alternative view of the scale and dynamics of biodiversity at the microbial level, wherein global species number is relatively low and local species richness is always sufficient to drive ecosystem functions."

https://openalex.org/W2036389069,"There are probably millions of species in the microorganismal domains Bacteria and Archaea (the prokaryotes), and we are only just beginning to work out the basic principles governing their distribution and abundance in natural environments. One characteristic that has become clear is that prokaryote diversity in aquatic environments is orders of magnitude less than in sediments and soils. Hypotheses and models explaining such differences are under development and are beginning to offer promising insights into the mechanisms governing prokaryote diversity and ecosystem function."
https://openalex.org/W1987942547,"In the fruit fly Drosophila, four insulin genes are coexpressed in small clusters of cells [insulin-producing cells (IPCs)] in the brain. Here, we show that ablation of these IPCs causes developmental delay, growth retardation, and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph. All of the defects were reversed by ectopic expression of a Drosophila insulin transgene. On the basis of these functional data and the observation that IPCs release insulin into the circulatory system, we conclude that brain IPCs are the main systemic supply of insulin during larval growth. We propose that IPCs and pancreatic islet beta cells are functionally analogous and may have evolved from a common ancestral insulin-producing neuron. Interestingly, the phenotype of flies lacking IPCs includes certain features of diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1987641460,"The ABC transporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins that couple adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to the translocation of diverse substrates across cell membranes. Clinically relevant examples are associated with cystic fibrosis and with multidrug resistance of pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells. Here, we report the crystal structure at 3.2 angstrom resolution of the Escherichia coli BtuCD protein, an ABC transporter mediating vitamin B12 uptake. The two ATP-binding cassettes (BtuD) are in close contact with each other, as are the two membrane-spanning subunits (BtuC); this arrangement is distinct from that observed for the E. coli lipid flippase MsbA. The BtuC subunits provide 20 transmembrane helices grouped around a translocation pathway that is closed to the cytoplasm by a gate region whereas the dimer arrangement of the BtuD subunits resembles the ATP-bound form of the Rad50 DNA repair enzyme. A prominent cytoplasmic loop of BtuC forms the contact region with the ATP-binding cassette and appears to represent a conserved motif among the ABC transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2053925793,"Light-powered molecular machines are conjectured to be essential constituents of future nanoscale devices. As a model for such systems, we have synthesized a polymer of bistable photosensitive azobenzenes. Individual polymers were investigated by single-molecule force spectroscopy in combination with optical excitation in total internal reflection. We were able to optically lengthen and contract individual polymers by switching the azo groups between their trans and cis configurations. The polymer was found to contract against an external force acting along the polymer backbone, thus delivering mechanical work. As a proof of principle, the polymer was operated in a periodic mode, demonstrating for the first time optomechanical energy conversion in a single-molecule device."

https://openalex.org/W1972753341,"Increasing evidence that the strengths of interactions among populations in biological communities form patterns that are crucial for system stability requires clarification of the precise form of these patterns, how they come about, and why they influence stability. We show that in real food webs, interaction strengths are organized in trophic loops in such a way that long loops contain relatively many weak links. We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum ""loop weight"" and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities."
https://openalex.org/W2139993630,"A two-photon-activatable photoacid generator, based on a bis[(diarylamino) styryl]benzene core with covalently attached sulfonium moieties, has been synthesized. The photoacid generator has both a large two-photon absorption cross section (delta = 690 x 10(-50) centimeter(4) second per photon) and a high quantum yield for the photochemical generation of acid (phiH+ = 0.5). Under near-infrared laser irradiation, the molecule produces acid after two-photon excitation and initiates the polymerization of epoxides at an incident intensity that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that needed for conventional ultraviolet-sensitive initiators. This photoacid generator was used in conjunction with a positive-tone chemically amplified resist for the fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) microchannel structure."
https://openalex.org/W2596045242,"The ubiquitination of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) plays a central role in the cellular response to changes in oxygen availability. pVHL binds to HIF only when a conserved proline in HIF is hydroxylated, a modification that is oxygen-dependent. The 1.85 angstrom structure of a 20-residue HIF-1alpha peptide-pVHL-ElonginB-ElonginC complex shows that HIF-1alpha binds to pVHL in an extended beta strand-like conformation. The hydroxyproline inserts into a gap in the pVHL hydrophobic core, at a site that is a hotspot for tumorigenic mutations, with its 4-hydroxyl group recognized by buried serine and histidine residues. Although the beta sheet-like interactions contribute to the stability of the complex, the hydroxyproline contacts are central to the strict specificity characteristic of signaling."

In addition to being fully translatable in three dimensions, the trapped structure can be rotated controllably and continuously by introducing a frequency difference between the two laser beams. These interference patterns could play an important role in the creation of extended 3D crystalline structures."
https://openalex.org/W2168699578,"Harvesting light to produce energy and oxygen (photosynthesis) is the signature of all land plants. This ability was co-opted from a precocious and ancient form of life known as cyanobacteria. Today these bacteria, as well as microscopic algae, supply oxygen to the atmosphere and churn out fixed nitrogen in Earth's vast oceans. Microorganisms may also have played a major role in atmosphere evolution before the rise of oxygen. Under the more dim light of a young sun cooler than today's, certain groups of anaerobic bacteria may have been pumping out large amounts of methane, thereby keeping the early climate warm and inviting. The evolution of Earth's atmosphere is linked tightly to the evolution of its biota."
https://openalex.org/W2050644059,"A known host-guest assembly, organized only by means of relatively weak dispersive forces, exhibits hitherto unappreciated thermal stability. The hexagonal close-packed arrangement of calix[4]arene contains lattice voids that can occlude small, highly volatile molecules. This host-guest system can be exploited to retain a range of freons, as well as methane, not only well above their normal boiling points, but also at relatively high temperatures and low pressures. The usually overlooked van der Waals interactions in organic crystals can indeed be used in a highly stable supramolecular system for gas storage."

https://openalex.org/W1639816383,"Aneuploidy (trisomy or monosomy) is the leading genetic cause of pregnancy loss in humans and results from errors in meiotic chromosome segregation. Here, we show that the absence of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3) promotes aneuploidy in murine oocytes by inducing defective meiotic chromosome segregation. The abnormal oocyte karyotype is inherited by embryos, which die in utero at an early stage of development. In addition, embryo death in SCP3-deficient females increases with advancing maternal age. We found that SCP3 is required for chiasmata formation and for the structural integrity of meiotic chromosomes, suggesting that altered chromosomal structure triggers nondisjunction. SCP3 is thus linked to inherited aneuploidy in female germ cells and provides a model system for studying age-dependent degeneration in oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2090362564,"The bacterium Wolbachia manipulates reproduction in millions of insects worldwide; the most common effect is cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). We found that CI resulted from delayed nuclear envelope breakdown of the male pronucleus in Nasonia vitripennis. This caused asynchrony between the male and female pronuclei and, ultimately, loss of paternal chromosomes at the first mitosis. When Wolbachia were present in the egg, synchrony was restored, which explains suppression of CI in these crosses. These results suggest that Wolbachia target cell cycle regulatory proteins. A striking consequence of CI is that it alters the normal pattern of reciprocal centrosome inheritance in Nasonia."
https://openalex.org/W2070786188,"An atomic force microscope was used to study single-electron motion in nanotube quantum dots. By applying a voltage to the microscope tip, the number of electrons occupying the quantum dot could be changed, causing Coulomb oscillations in the nanotube conductance. Spatial maps of these oscillations were used to locate individual dots and to study the electrostatic coupling between the dot and the tip. The electrostatic forces associated with single electrons hopping on and off the quantum dot were also measured. These forces changed the amplitude, frequency, and quality factor of the cantilever oscillation, demonstrating how single-electron motion can interact with a mechanical oscillator."

The various disks have previously been linked to the Ediacaran biota, younger than 600 million years old. From this unit, we report U-Th-Pb geochronology of detrital zircon and monazite, as well as low-grade metamorphic monazite, constraining the depositional age to between 2016 +/- 6 and 1215 +/- 20 million years old. Although nonbiological origins for the discoidal impressions cannot be completely discounted, the structures resembling trace fossils clearly have a biological origin and suggest the presence of vermiform, mucus-producing, motile organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1973361899,"Nerve terminals release neurotransmitters from vesicles into the synaptic cleft upon transient increases in intracellular Ca2+. This exocytotic process requires the formation of trans SNARE complexes and is regulated by accessory proteins including the complexins. Here we report the crystal structure of a squid core complexin-SNARE complex at 2.95-Å resolution. A helical segment of complexin binds in anti-parallel fashion to the four-helix bundle of the core SNARE complex and interacts at its C terminus with syntaxin and synaptobrevin around the ionic zero layer of the SNARE complex. We propose that this structure is part of a multiprotein fusion machinery that regulates vesicle fusion at a late pre-fusion stage. Accordingly, Ca2+ may initiate membrane fusion by acting directly or indirectly on complexin, thus allowing the conformational transitions of the trans SNARE complex that are thought to drive membrane fusion.

This exocytotic process requires members of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)1 protein family, which are essential for the fusion of vesicle (v) and target (t) membranes in many subcellular compartments and transport processes (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar,2Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). v- and t-SNAREs must be positioned on opposing membranes to be functional in membrane fusion (3Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). SNAREs exist in different conformational states, which may selectively interact with regulatory proteins such as nSec1 (4Misura K.M. May A.P. Weis W.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Neuronal exocytosis depends on the formation of a binary complex composed of the t-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP25, which then recruits synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane by interacting with the v-SNARE synaptobrevin to form the ternary SNARE complex (5Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollack E. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural and crystallographic data have shown that the core of the SNARE complex consists of a twisted, parallel four-helix bundle, where all transmembrane domains extend from the same end of the rodlike structure (6Hanson P.I.

Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Therefore, assembly of trans SNARE complexes from v- and t-SNAREs is thought to bring opposing membranes into close apposition (6Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Upon bilayer fusion, cis complexes result, and are subsequently disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment protein (α-SNAP) for further rounds of membrane fusion (9Söllner T.

Although core complex formation is promiscuous in vitro (12Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), only compartment-specific SNAREs form fusogenic complexes (13McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that neurotransmitter secretion involves two distinct pools of exocytosis-competent vesicles, which differ in their release kinetics (14Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This difference has been attributed to different extents of SNARE interaction prior to Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion (15Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that fusion-competent SNARE complexes may not be fully assembled (15Xu T.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structural differences discriminating fusogenic from inactive SNARE complexes remained, however, unknown. Complexins are associated with the neuronal SNARE complex in membrane extracts (17McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to act as negative regulators of exocytosis (18Ono S. Baux G. Sekiguchi M. Fossier P. Morel N.F. Nihonmatsu I. Hirata K. Awaji T. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In mammals, two complexin genes exist that exhibit distinct expression patterns (19Eastwood S.L. Cotter D. Harrison P.J. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A reduced expression of complexin II has been found in the cerebellum of schizophrenic patients (19Eastwood S.L. Cotter D. Harrison P.J. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and a selective loss of complexin II is observed in mice transgenic for the Huntington's disease mutation (20Morton A.J. Edwardson J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Single gene knockouts of complexin I and II show no dramatic phenotype in mice (21Takahashi S. Ujihara H. Huang G.Z. Yagyu K.I. Sanbo M. Kaba H. Yagi T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), but deletion of both complexin genes causes rapid postnatal death (22Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies on the doubly deficient neurons have revealed defects in excitation-release coupling that are accompanied by reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of transmitter exocytosis (22Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This suggests that complexins may act as, or in concert with, a Ca2+ sensor such as synaptotagmin (23Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Complexins may also induce oligomerization of full-length trans SNARE complexes (24Tokumaru H. Umayahara K. Pellegrini L.L. Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Abe T. Cell. 2001; 104: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the recruitment of multiple SNARE complexes at sites of membrane fusion (25Hua Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8065-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses have identified a minimal helical domain of complexins that interacts with syntaxin in the SNARE complex (26Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we present the crystal structure of a core complexin-SNARE complex from the squid Loligo pealei, which shows interactions that are highly conserved between species, as deduced by comparison with the structure of a mammalian complexin-SNARE complex that was published after completion of this study (28Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Complexin binds in anti-parallel orientation to the assembled core SNARE complex, contacting both syntaxin and synaptobrevin. Interestingly, the complexin-SNARE complex interaction is not a typical coiled coil interaction. Only four layers of interactions are observed, whereas the rest of the complexin helix points away from the core complex into the solvent toward the C-terminal membrane proximal part of the SNARE complex. We suggest that the interaction of complexin with the assembled SNARE complex constitutes part of a multiprotein complex that keeps vesicles in a pre-fusion stage, before a Ca2+ signal arrives. A truncated form of squid cpx (residues 25–98) was expressed in Escherichia coli cells BL21/pUBS as a maltose-binding fusion protein (MBP) using a pMal expression vector (New England Biolabs), which was modified to contain an N-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Cells were lysed at 4 °C by ultrasonication in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cleared lysate was applied to an amylose column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) and further purified following standard procedures. Complexin was released from MBP by TEV protease cleavage at a 1:200 (w/w) ratio overnight at 4 °C. Complexin was then separated from MBP by ion exchange chromatography using a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C equilibrated in lysis buffer. The components of the squid SNARE core complex were cloned into expression vectors pRSET (Invitrogen) (Sb residues 25–104, Sn1 residues 4–86, and Sn2 residues 126–212) and pMal modified to contain a TEV protease cleavage site (Sx residues 183–265). All four chains were expressed separately in E. coli BL21/pUBS cells, and cultures were grown in parallel to yield an approximate stoichiometric ratio of SNARE components at the time of harvesting. Cell pellets were then mixed and lysed together by ultrasonication in the same lysis buffer as described above. Supernatants were cleared by centrifugation and MBP-Sx-containing complexes were purified on an amylose column in lysis buffer. An excess of MBP-Sx and noncanonical SNARE complexes were removed by Mono-Q (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange chromatography in lysis buffer. MBP was then cleaved off from Sx by TEV protease treatment at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) overnight. The SNARE complex was then further purified using a Mono-P chromatofocusing column (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 25 mmimidazole HCl, pH 7.4, and applying Polybuffer 74 (AmershamBiosciences). The SNARE complex was mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of cpx for 1 h at 4 °C, and the complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA. The final complex was concentrated to 12 mg/ml and crystallized by the hanging drop method from 4–5.5% MPD (v/v), 7–8% PEG-550 monomethyl ether (w/v), and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Crystals grew within 10 days at 20 °C. For cryotreatment of the crystals, the drops were equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 10% (w/v) MPD and 16% (w/v) PEG-550 monomethyl ether over a period of 24–48 h and crystals were flash-cooled in a gaseous nitrogen stream. For mercury derivatization, crystals were washed with 5% (w/v) MPD and 8% (w/v) PEG-550 monomethyl ether and equilibrated with 1 mm4-(hydroxymercury)benzoate for 24 h (Table I, HMBT data set). Data were collected at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) beam lines ID-29 and ID14-EH1.

The structure of the neuronal squid cpx·SNARE complex was solved by molecular replacement employing the coordinates published for the neuronal rat SNARE complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1sfc; Ref. 7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) as a search model. The three complexes from rat were superimposed and employed in all searches. The program BEAST (31Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) was used to perform rotation function calculations including all data to high resolution (2.95-Å resolution), and a solution was obtained with a log-likelihood-gain score of 185 (3 ς above average; second highest peak LLG = 144; as defined; Ref. 31Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). With the stand-alone version of the program AmoRe (32Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and data from 10 to 4 Å, an equivalent solution was obtained. As this program rotates the input coordinates of a search model to fit into a minimal box and translates it to superimpose its center of mass with the origin prior to calculations, the following model position was obtained: α = 96.9°, β = 76.8°, γ = 353.0° with a correlation coefficient of 27.5% and a crystallographicR factor = 57.1%, which was calculated after data expansion to P1 (Table I). The translation search was then performed employing the correlation-coefficient translation function with AMoRe, confirmingP212121 as the correct space group, which resulted in a clear peak with a correlation coefficient of 39.5% and R factor of 55.6%. A final rigid-body refinement with FITING (32Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) improved the correlation coefficient to 41.2% and the R factor to 53.5%. The input coordinates were then rotated and translated according to this solution and submitted to a simulated annealing step and positional/temperature factor refinement against the diffraction data from the mercury derivative (Table I), employing maximum likelihood as criteria, after performing bulk solvent correction and anisotropic temperature factor refinement (R factor = 37.5%; free R factor = 49.1%) using the program CNS (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Two mercury heavy atom positions were then located employing the program Shake-and-Bake (34Miller R. Gallo S.M. Khalak H.G. Weeks C.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 613-621Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar) in the HMBT data set (Table I). The preliminarily refined model coordinates were employed to calculate difference-Fourier electron density maps (anomalous and dispersive) that confirmed these heavy atom sites and permitted finding of the correct handedness. The positions of the sites were independently confirmed by employing the program SHELXS (35Sheldrick G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), after data preparation with XPREP. One site locates next to Sn1 Cys-21 and the other site is positioned next to Sn1 Cys-39 (Fig. 2 A). These two heavy atom positions were refined and experimental phases (SIRAS) were calculated using data to 3.3-Å resolution with MLPHARE (30CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The SIRAS phases (mean-figure-of-merit of 0.262 for all centric data) were merged with the phases obtained by molecular replacement (the latter computed to lower resolution (3.5 Å) to avoid excessive model bias) following ςA weighting and submitted to a density modification step with DM (30CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with phase extension up to 2.95-Å resolution. Subsequently calculated ςA-weighted (2F obs − F calc) type electron density maps permitted improvement of the initial model. The Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients obtained after the DM calculations where then employed to perform phase-restrained crystallographic refinement using the program CNS (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and the native data set (TableI). Model building was done interactively with the program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) interspersed with conjugated gradient minimization, restrained individual B factor refinement as implemented in CNS (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The model was refined against the MLHL maximum likelihood target with the combined phases of the initial molecular replacement model and the mercury derivative as phase constraint. To detect model bias, composite annealed omit maps (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) were calculated at successive model building steps. A randomly chosen test set comprising 7% of the available data was used for R free calculation and isotropic bulk solvent correction was used during refinement. Water molecules were built into positive difference density peaks (>3 ς) that showed reasonable protein-solvent hydrogen bonding distances. In the final stage of refinement, a maximum likelihood target and model phases alone were used. The final model contains residues, Sb 33–98, Sx 183–259 plus the peptide GKSAS at the N terminus, Sn1 11–83, Sn2 136–210, and cpx 49–76, and 23 water molecules. The model exhibits good stereochemistry with one Ramachandran plot (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar) outlier (Ala-4 in the extra pentapeptide of Sx) (Table I) and was refined to anR factor = 29.7 and R free= 34.4. The final R factors are higher than expected because of the following reasons: (i) the model lacks 88 residues of 407 (22%); (ii) the best data set used for the refinement is anisotropic and has a Wilson plot B factor of 79.04 Å2. (iii) the C-terminal half of the SNARE complex beyond layer +1 is poorly defined with clear main chain density, although lacking defined density for a number of side chains as evident in omit maps (59 residues were modeled as Ala); (iv) the increased flexibility of the C-terminal half of the SNARE complex (beyond layer +1) is also evident in the higher average B factor for this region (108 Å2) compared with the other half of the molecule, which shows an average B factor of 64 Å2.

Units were converted to residue ellipticity. The measurements were performed in a 1-mm cell on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric controller. We expressed and purified a heterotrimeric complex formed by the soluble fragments of the squid neuronal proteins syntaxin (Sx), the N- and C-terminal SNARE motifs of SNAP-25 (Sn), and synaptobrevin (Sb), which correspond to the previously defined rat SNARE sequences involved in core SNARE complex formation (42Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric squid SNARE complex was then bound to a minimal squid cpx construct, which is similar to one defined previously (26Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and crystallized in space groupP212121. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the rat SNARE complex coordinates as a search model and a native data set collected to 2.95-Å resolution (Table I). Subsequently, SIRAS phases from a mercury derivative were combined with phases obtained by molecular replacement to minimize the model bias (Table I). Diffraction data from native and mercury-derivatized crystals showed considerable anisotropy, which is also reflected in the high overall Wilson plot B factor (Table I). Extra electron density in Fo − Fc maps could be unambiguously attributed to cpx (Fig.1 B). The final model comprises Sb residues 33–98, Sx residues 183–259, and SNAP-25 residues 11–83 (Sn1) and 136–210 (Sn2) as well as cpx residues 49–76. Because of the expression of Sx as a fusion protein, an extra N-terminal pentapeptide (GKSAS) is well defined and involved in crystal packing. 42 SNARE protein residues as well as 46 cpx residues from their respective N- and C-terminal ends could not be modeled because of local disorder in the crystal. The overall structure of the squid neuronal SNARE complex shows a parallel 117-Å four-helix bundle with a left-handed superhelical twist, similar to the neuronal rat core complex (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). C-terminal residues from Sn1 (residues 76–83) and Sx (residues 250–259) are not in an ideal helical conformation (Fig.1 A). Complexin residues 49–73 form a 36-Å α helix oriented anti-parallel to the four-helix bundle of the SNARE complex. Its C terminus contacts both Sx and Sb (Figs. 1 A and 3), whereas the remaining part of the helix is positioned next to the Sb helix and points into the solvent with increasingly"

Emerging evidence indicates that MT1-MMP is regulated by a process of ectodomain shedding. Active MT1-MMP undergoes autocatalytic processing on the cell surface, leading to the formation of an inactive 44-kDa fragment and release of the entire catalytic domain. Analysis of the released MT1-MMP forms in various cell types revealed a complex pattern of shedding involving two major fragments of 50 and 18 kDa and two minor species of 56 and 31–35 kDa. Protease inhibitor studies and a catalytically inactive MT1-MMP mutant revealed both autocatalytic (18 kDa) and non-autocatalytic (56, 50, and 31–35 kDa) shedding mechanisms. Purification and sequencing of the 18-kDa fragment indicated that it extends from Tyr112 to Ala255. Structural and sequencing data indicate that shedding of the 18-kDa fragment is initiated at the Gly284-Gly285 site, followed by cleavage between the conserved Ala255 and Ile256residues near the conserved methionine turn, a structural feature of the catalytic domain of all MMPs. Consistently, a recombinant 18-kDa fragment had no catalytic activity and did not bind TIMP-2. Thus, autocatalytic shedding evolved as a specific mechanism to terminate MT1-MMP activity on the cell surface by disrupting enzyme integrity at a vital structural site. In contrast, functional data suggest that the non-autocatalytic shedding generates soluble active MT1-MMP species capable of binding TIMP-2.

Recent evidence suggests that ectodomain shedding is also characteristic of the membrane type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs),1 a subfamily of membrane-anchored MMPs by means of a transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (2Seiki M.

To control the extent of pericellular activity, the MT-MMPs are inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of natural protein MMP inhibitors. In addition, MT-MMPs have a unique regulatory mechanism in which the active enzyme undergoes a series of processing steps, either autocatalytic (15Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35953-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), that regulate the activity and nature of the enzyme species at the cell surface and at the pericellular space. Previous studies have shown that active MT1-MMP is autocatalytically processed on the cell surface to an inactive membrane-tethered ∼44-kDa species lacking the entire catalytic domain (17Hernandez-Barrantes S.

This processing is inhibited by TIMP-2, TIMP-4, and synthetic MMP inhibitors consistent with being an intermolecular autocatalytic event (19Hernandez-Barrantes S. Shimura Y. Soloway P.D. Sang Q.A.

Inhibition of MT1-MMP processing induces accumulation of the active enzyme on the cell surface, and, as a consequence, net MT1-MMP-dependent proteolysis is enhanced. Indeed, we have shown that, under certain conditions, inhibition of MT1-MMP autocatalysis by synthetic MMP inhibitors enhances pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP in the presence of TIMP-2 (20Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M.L. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Thus, although the presence of inhibitors will stabilize MT1-MMP on the cell surface, the absence or reduced levels of inhibitors will facilitate autocatalysis. As a membrane-anchored protein, the autocatalytic processing of active MT1-MMP on the cell surface raises questions as to the fate of the ectodomain and its functional consequences. Accumulating evidence suggests that catalytic domain shedding may represent a general characteristic of several members of the MT-MMP family, and both autocatalytic and non-autocatalytic mechanisms of shedding have been described, e.g. autocatalysis was implicated in the shedding of MT1-MMP in cells transfected to overexpress MT1-MMP (22Lehti K. Valtanen H. Wickstrom S. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15006-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other studies reported shedding of MT1-MMP from a breast carcinoma cell line after treatment with concanavalin A (ConA) (23Harayama T. Ohuchi E. Aoki T. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Jpn. J.

Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); therefore, autocatalysis could not be involved. MT5-MMP sheds its catalytic domain in a process that appears to be mediated by a pro-convertase that removes the ectodomain intracellularly (26Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing was reported to be involved in the generation of a soluble form of MT3-MMP, which retained catalytic activity and sensitivity to TIMP-2 inhibition (27Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Saito S. Watanabe T. Masuho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, although different mechanisms of shedding may exist, collectively, these data suggest a unique property of MT-MMPs: the ability to generate soluble fragments by a process of ectodomain shedding, which may possess important functional consequences for pericellular proteolysis in normal and malignant processes. Here we have identified the major soluble forms of MT1-MMP and characterized the major autocatalytic fragment. We demonstrated that the autocatalytic shedding mechanism of MT1-MMP is likely to have evolved to terminate MT1-MMP-dependent proteolysis by hydrolyzing the enzyme at specific and vital sites.

HT1080, MDA-MB-231, U-87 and HFL1 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 150-mm tissue culture dishes and then incubated (16 h, 37 °C) with serum-free DMEM (15 ml/dish) supplemented with or without 100 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 10 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) (Sigma). In some experiments, these cell lines and the Timp2 (−/−)-MT1 cells were metabolically labeled (6–16 h, 37 °C) with 70–100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in starving medium (DMEM without methionine supplemented with 25 mm HEPES). HT1080 cells in six-well plates were untreated or treated with 100 nm TPA or 10 μg/ml ConA in 1 ml of serum-free medium overnight. The cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and then biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin as described (38Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with 0.5 ml/well harvest buffer (0.5% SDS, 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA) and boiled. The lysates were supplemented with 2.5% Triton X-100 (final concentration) followed by addition of either pAb 437 or pAb 160/Protein A-agarose beads. After a 12-h incubation period (4 °C), the beads were washed three times with harvest buffer supplemented with 2.5% Triton X-100 (final concentration) followed by one wash with collagenase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij-35). The immunoprecipitates were eluted with Laemmli SDS sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), boiled, and resolved by reducing 8–16% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The biotinylated MT1-MMP forms were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and ECL. To express full-length human MT1-MMP, confluent cultures of BS-C-1 orTimp2 (−/−) mutant cells in six-well plates were co-infected with 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell each of vTF7–3 and vT7-MT1 viruses for 45 min in infection medium (DMEM + 2.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) at 37 °C. As a control, the cells were infected only with the vTF7–3 virus. After infection, the cultures were incubated (12 h, 37 °C) with serum-free DMEM supplemented with various protease inhibitors: TIMP-2, TIMP-4, and TIMP-1 (0–100 nm); marimastat (0–500 nm); SB-3CT (0–100 nm); aprotinin (20 and 40 μg/ml); leupeptin (40 μg/ml); or E64 (10 μm) overnight, as described (20Toth M.

TPA-treated HT1080 cells, as described above, received 100 μg/ml aprotinin or 100 nm human recombinant TIMP-2. The serum-free conditioned media were collected and processed for immunoblot analysis, as described below. A catalytically inactive mutant of MT1-MMP was generated by replacing Glu240 with Ala (E240A-MT1) using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A cytosolic domain (CD) deletion mutant (ΔCD-MT1) was constructed by introducing a termination codon at Arg563 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers and wild-type MT1-MMP cDNA as the template. The amplified E240A-MT1 and ΔCD-MT1 cDNA fragments were cloned into the pTF7EMCV-1 vaccinia expression vector using appropriate restriction sites to generate the respective expression vectors pTF7-E240A-MT1 and pTF7-ΔCD-MT1, as described (28Fridman R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Komarek D. Liang C.M. Berman M.L. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Fuerst T.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,33Fridman R.

The sequence of the inserts was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression of the MT1-MMP mutants was carried out in BS-C-1 cells by the infection/transfection procedure (28Fridman R. Bird R.E.

Briefly, BS-C-1 cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes to 80% confluence and infected with 5 plaque-forming units/cell vTF7–3 virus in infection medium for 45 min, as described (32Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then transfected with 2 μg/dish pTF7-MT1 (wild type MT1-MMP), pTF7-E240A-MT1, or pTF7-ΔCD-MT1 DNA plasmids using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as described by the manufacturer. Control cells were infected but received no plasmid DNA. Four h after transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled (12 h, 37 °C) with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The media were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and concentrated to ∼0.5 ml followed by immunoprecipitation, as described below. To express the 21-kDa (Tyr112–Gly284) and 18-kDa (Tyr112–Ala255) fragments of MT1-MMP, we utilized high fidelity PCR to amplify the respective cDNA fragments, which were cloned into the NdeI andHindIII restriction sites of the pET-24a(+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The recombinant plasmid vectors were introduced into recipient Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by transformation. For protein expression, 5 ml of the bacterial cultures were induced overnight at 37 °C with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of collagenase buffer, and sonicated. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation and dissolved in collagenase buffer containing 8 m urea. The solubilized proteins were diluted 10-fold in collagenase buffer supplemented with 50% glycerol and dialyzed overnight against collagenase buffer with 10% glycerol. The MT1-MMP fragments were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The same samples were also analyzed for enzymatic activity and ability to bind TIMP-2 as described below. BS-C-1 cells in 150-mm tissue culture dishes were infected to express MT1-MMP as described (17Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Three h after infection, the cells were rinsed with serum-free media and incubated overnight with 15 ml/dish serum-free DMEM. The media (∼300 ml) were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and concentrated ∼15–20-fold with Centricon Plus-80. The concentrated medium was incubated (12 h, 4 °C) with pAb 160/Protein A-agarose beads to immunoprecipitate the MT1-MMP forms. The beads were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and twice with HNTG buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with reducing sample buffer, boiled and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. As reference, an aliquot of the eluate was also subjected to immunoblot analysis using pAb 160. The Coomassie Blue-stained 18-kDa protein was cut out from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and was submitted for N-terminal microsequencing by Edman-based chemistry to ProSeq (Boxford, MA). The amino acid sequence of the 18-kDa protein was also determined by mass spectrometry. To this end, the 18-kDa form bound to pAb 160/Protein A-agarose beads was eluted with 100 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.5, and the collected fractions were neutralized with 1.88 m Tris, pH 8.8. An aliquot of each fraction was subjected to immunoblot analysis using pAb 160 to identify the 18-kDa protein. The fractions with the 18-kDa fragment were concentrated and subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The protein was cut out from the gel and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for sequence analysis by microcapillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. A full computational model (minus the hinge region) for the ectodomain of pro-MT1-MMP was developed for the studies of the various aspects of the biochemistry of this enzyme. The primary sequence of MT1-MMP was obtained from Swiss-Prot data bank (code MM14_HUMAN). An initial model of MT1-MMP was generated by homology modeling with the aid of COMPOSER software, implemented in the SYBYL package version 6.7, and it was further refined with energy minimization procedures. The catalytic and propeptide domains were constructed based on the structure of stromelysin-1 (Protein Data Bank identification code 1slm) (41Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M. Cameron P.M. Esser C.K. Hagmann W.K. Hermes J.D. Springer J.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) following similar procedures that were used for construction of the hemopexin-like domain (42Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Individual domains of MT1-MMP were thus constructed using homology modeling and three-dimensional structure alignment, except for the catalytic domain, which was based on the published x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (Protein Data Bank identification code 1bqq) (43Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The hinge region of MT1-MMP was not modeled because of the lack of any homologous protein that could serve as a three-dimensional template. Energy minimization of the complete MT1-MMP complex was carried out using the SANDER module of the AMBER 5.0 suite of programs (44Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 5.0 Computer Program.

Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) was used to model the enzyme. The parameters for bonds, angles, and van der Waals interactions involving zinc atoms were taken from Massova et al. (46Massova I. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Mol. Model. 1997; 3: 17-30Crossref Google Scholar). The enzyme was immersed in a 97 × 96 × 98-Å3 box of TIP3P-water (47Jorgensen W.L. Chandraseklar J. Maduar J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28676) Google Scholar). Water molecules present in the x-ray crystallographic structure were retained in the model. A 10-Å cutoff was applied to the model, and the nonbonded list was updated every 50 cycles. A total of 20,000 energy minimization cycles were carried out, which consisted of 300 steepest descent steps, followed by conjugate gradient minimization. All enzymatic assays were carried out using the fluorescence substrate MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)ARNH2 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) in a buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, and 1% Me2SO (buffer R). Substrate hydrolysis was monitored with a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively. The synthetic peptide MOCAcPLG (Peptides International) was used to calibrate the assays as described by Knight (48Knight C.G.

When expressed in CHO cells stably transfected with the FLAG-tagged hkor (FLAG-hkor), EBP50/NHERF co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-hkor, and the PDZ domain I, but not the PDZ domain II, of EBP50/NHERF was involved in the interaction. Treatment with the agonist (−)-(trans)-3,4- dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidiny)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (U50,488H) enhanced the association of EBP50/NHERF with FLAG-hkor. Expression of EBP50/NHERF, but not a truncated form lacking the ERM-binding domain, abolished U50,488H-induced down-regulation of FLAG-hkor, which was apparently due to an increase in the recycling rate of internalized receptors. However, expression of EBP50/NHERF did not affect U50,488H binding affinity and U50,488H-stimulated [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding and p42/p44 MAP kinase activation, nor did it affect U50,488H-induced desensitization and internalization of FLAG-hkor. To determine the motif of FLAG-hkor involved in EBP50/NHERF binding, we generated two mutants, FLAG-hkor-A and FLAG-hkor-EE, in which one Ala or two Glu residues were added to the C terminus, respectively. Neither FLAG-hkor-A nor FLAG-hkor-EE co-immunoprecipitated with EBP50/NHERF, and U50,488H-induced down-regulation of FLAG-hkor-A and FLAG-hkor-EE were not affected by expression of EBP50/NHERF. Thus, EBP50/NHERF binds to the C terminus of FLAG-hkor and blocks the down-regulation of FLAG-hkor. The C-terminal sequence of the hkor, NKPV, is distinctly different from the sequence D(S/T)XL, the optimal C-terminal motif in the β2-adrenergic receptor for EBP50/NHERF binding. EBP50/NHERF may have a broader binding specificity and may interact with a subset of G protein-coupled receptors to serve as a recycling signal for these receptors.

Three temporally distinct processes have been characterized: desensitization (seconds to hours), internalization (minutes to hours), and down-regulation (hours to days) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G.

Activation of a GPCR by agonists initiates adaptive responses by enhancing phosphorylation of the receptor, in most cases by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, which facilitates binding of arrestins, leading to uncoupling of the GPCR from G proteins. Binding of arrestins also results in internalization of the receptor, which is a movement of the receptor from plasma membranes to endocytic vesicles and endosomes, many via clathrin-coated vesicles. Internalized receptors have two different fates. Receptors are recycled back to plasma membranes, resulting in resensitization. Alternatively, receptors are trafficked to lysosomes or proteasomes where proteolytic degradation of the receptor occurs, leading to down-regulation. Following internalization, some GPCRs, such as β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and substance P receptor, are predominantly recycled to plasma membranes (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

The signals that direct the trafficking of internalized receptors to the recycling or the down-regulation pathway have not been fully elucidated. It has been shown by use of chimeric and mutant receptors that the C-terminal domains of many GPCRs contain domains that direct the internalized receptors to the lysosomal pathway for degradation (6Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34488-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Presumably, the C-terminal domains contain specific sequences that bind factors regulating trafficking and sorting of the internalized receptors. On the other hand, it is generally accepted that trafficking of membrane proteins from the sorting endosomes to the recycling compartment and from the recycling compartment back to plasma membranes do not require specific sequence signals (11Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The recycling pathway appears to be the default pathway for membrane proteins that are not trafficked to the lysosomal pathway (11Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Although this view is generally true for the constitutively internalized and recycled molecules, such as transferrin, recent studies have indicated that recycling of internalized GPCRs is regulated (12Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein-50 (EBP50)/Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) is a PDZ domain-containing protein. Rabbit NHERF was first purified and cloned (16Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the human NHERF was cloned, termed EBP50 (17Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) or hNHERF (18Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this report, the term EBP50/NHERF is used throughout. PDZ domains were originally identified in the postsynaptic density protein-95 as three repeats of about 90 residues containing the conserved motif Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe. EBP50/NHERF is widely distributed in tissues and is particularly enriched in those containing polarized epithelia. Hall et al. (19Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) have shown that EBP50/NHERF is associated with the β2-AR and mediates β2-AR-induced stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger independent of G proteins. EBP50/NHERF contains two PDZ domains, the first of which is required for its interaction with the β2-AR, and the optimal C-terminal motif in the receptor is D(S/T)XL (19Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). EBP50/NHERF through an ERM-binding domain binds to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Disrupting the interaction of EBP50/NHERF with the β2-AR within the PDZ domain or the ERM-binding domain causes sorting of endocytosed β2-AR to the lysosomal pathway instead of the recycling pathway without affecting the recycling of transferrin receptors (12Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), indicating that the recycling of β2-AR may be regulated by specific mechanisms. This action may be a direct consequence of β2-AR-EBP50/NHERF interaction or a secondary effect stemming from other important roles of EBP50/NHERF. Gage et al. (21Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that when DSLL, the β2-AR C terminus sequence interacting with EBP50/NHERF, was added to the δ receptor, the internalized mutant δ receptors were predominantly recycled back to plasma membranes instead of being primarily sorted to the lysosomes for degradation. PDZ domains recently have been identified in a variety of proteins that are often found in structures at the plasma membrane and play important roles in the synaptic localization of ion channels, receptors, signaling enzymes, and cell adhesion molecules (for reviews, see Refs.22Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 23Craven S.E. Bredt D.S.

PDZ domains mediate protein-protein interactions by interacting with the last few C-terminal residues of their target proteins (24Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 25Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the sequences of peptides interacting with different PDZ domains, the only conserved feature is a valine, leucine, or isoleucine residue at the C-terminal position (24Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 25Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). An attractive model is that PDZ domains recognize a C-terminal hydrophobic residue and that the specificity of the interaction is determined by the adjacent three or four residues (24Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 25Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs have also been shown to interact with other PDZ domain-containing proteins, which play important roles in signal transduction and receptor regulation (for a review, see Ref. 26Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). κ opioid receptors belong to the rhodopsin subfamily of the GPCR family (for a review, see Ref. 27Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Collins N. Fang L. Wang J.Y. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Activation of κ opioid receptors produces many effects including analgesia (28von Voigtlander P.F. Lahti R.A. Ludens J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 224: 7-12PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dykstra L.A.

Ther. 1987; 242: 413-420PubMed Google Scholar). κ opioid receptors are coupled through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins to affect a variety of effectors, which include adenylate cyclase, potassium channels and calcium channels, and the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (for a review, see Ref. 31Law P.-Y. Wong Y.H. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the human κ opioid receptor (hkor) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells undergoes U50,488H-induced internalization and down-regulation via a G protein-coupled receptor kinase-, β-arrestin-, and dynamin-dependent process that probably involves clathrin-coated vesicles (32Zhu J. Luo L.Y. Mao G.F. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar, 33Li J.-G. Luo L.-Y. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Following a 4- or 24-h pretreatment, the hkor is down-regulated by about 30%, and receptor internalization is required for down-regulation (32Zhu J. Luo L.Y. Mao G.F. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J.

The degree of down-regulation is intermediate between those of the β2-AR and the δ opioid receptor (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we examined whether the FLAG-tagged hkor (FLAG-hkor) interacts with EBP50/NHERF, since the C terminus of the hkor is Val. We have found that FLAG-hkor interacts with EBP50/NHERF. We then determined the site of interaction in the hkor and examined whether the trafficking and signaling of the hkor was regulated by expression of EBP50/NHERF. [35S]GTPγS (∼1,250 Ci/mmol) and [3H]diprenorphine (58 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. U50,488H was provided by The Upjohn Co. (Kalamazoo, MI), and naloxone was a gift from DuPont. Agarose gel conjugated with M2 anti-FLAG (sequence DYKDDDD) monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Sigma. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated companies: polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody, Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA); ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences; dynorphin A-(1–17), Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Belmont, CA); PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAP kinase antibody kit, New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). LipofectAMINE, enzymes, and chemicals used in molecular biology and mutagenesis experiments were purchased from Invitrogen, Promega (Madison, WI), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Expression constructs of hemagglutinin epitope (HA) (sequence YPYDVPDYA)-tagged human EBP50/NHERF (HA-EBP50/NHERF) and a truncated form of human EBP50/NHERF tagged with HA (amino acids 1–298, with last 60 residues truncated) (HA- EBP50Δ/NHERFΔ) in pcDNA3 (12Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Mark von Zastrow (University of California, San Francisco). The human EBP50/NHERF cDNA was originally cloned by Dr. Anthony Bretcher's group (17Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) with an accession number of AF015926. HA-tagged fragments 1–151 and 152–358 of the rabbit EBP50/NHERF (16Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) in the vector pBK/CMV were obtained from Dr. Randy Hall of Emory University (Atlanta, GA). The human and rabbit EBP50/NHERF have ∼90% identity. PDZ domain I (amino acids 16–90) and domain II (amino acids 157–230) of EBP50/NHERF of the human and rabbit clones are ∼99% identical. The hkor cDNA clone used was the one we had cloned previously (36Zhu J. Chen C. Xue J.-C. Kunapuli S. de Riel J.K. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Life Sci. 1995; 56: PL201-PL207Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DNA sequence determination was performed to ensure correct generations of all constructs. The FLAG tag fragment was inserted 5′ to the Met start codon, and FLAG-hkor inserted in Hind III and XbaI sites of vector pcDNA3 was generated previously (37Xu W. Chen C. Huang P., Li, J. de Riel J.K. Javitch J.A. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13904-13915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fragments of FLAG-hkor-A was generated by PCR using CTG GCT AAC TAG AGA ACC (the pcDNA3 5′ primer) and HK-A(−) (TAT GCG GCC GCT CAT GCT ACT GGT TTA TTC ATC CC) as primers and FLAG-hkor in pcDNA3 (37Xu W. Chen C. Huang P., Li, J. de Riel J.K. Javitch J.A. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13904-13915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as the template. The resulting PCR product was treated with HindIII and NotI. TheHindIII/NotI-treated PCR product was ligated intoHindIII and NotI sites of the vector pcDNA3 to generate FLAG-hkor-A. The fragments of FLAG-hkor-EE were generated by PCR using CTG GCT AAC TAG AGA ACC (the pcDNA3 5′ primer) and HK-EE(−) (TAT GCG GCC GCT CAC TCT TCT ACT GGT TTA TTC ATC CC) as primers and FLAG-hkor in pcDNA3 (37Xu W. Chen C. Huang P., Li, J. de Riel J.K. Javitch J.A. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13904-13915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as the template. The resulting PCR product was treated with HindIII and NotI. The HindIII/NotI-treated PCR product was ligated into HindIII and NotI sites of the vector pcDNA3 to generate FLAG-hkor-EE. Clonal CHO cells stably transfected with FLAG-hkor, FLAG-hkor-A, or FLAG-hkor-EE were established according to procedures described previously (33Li J.-G. Luo L.-Y. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12087-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CHO-FLAG-hkor, CHO-FLAG-hkor-A, or CHO-FLAG-hkor-EE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/ F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mg/ml geneticin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. CHO-FLAG-hkor was transiently transfected with 8 μg/100-mm dish of HA-EBP50/NHERF in pcDNA3, HA-EBP50Δ/NHERFΔ in pcDNA3, HA-EBP50/NHERF-(1–151) in pBK/CMV, or HA-EBP50/NHERF-(152–358) in pBK/CMV or the vector pcDNA3 (control) by use of LipofectAMINE (50 μl) following the manufacturer's instructions. CHO-FLAG-hkor-A and CHO-FLAG-hkor-EE cells were similarly transfected with HA-EBP50/NHERF in pcDNA3 or the vector pcDNA3 (control). About 60 h after transfection, cells were used for experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-hkor or its mutant and HA-EBP50/NHERF or its fragment were performed according to the procedure of Cao et al. (12Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-FLAG-hkor, CHO-FLAG-hkor-A, and CHO-FLAG-hkor-EE cells transiently transfected with HA-EBP50/NHERF, its fragment, or the vector pcDNA3. About 60 h later, cells were lysed and solubilized with solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Solubilized materials were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2-agarose to immunoprecipitate FLAG-hkor or a monoclonal antibody against HA to immunoprecipitate HA-EBP50/NHERF or its fragment. The immunoprecipitates were washed, and Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol was added. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were treated with blocking solution, incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against HA or rabbit anti-EBP50 antibody and then goat anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, reacted with ECL Western blotting detection reagents, and exposed to x-ray films. [3H]Diprenorphine binding to the wild type and mutants of the κ opioid receptor in membrane preparations and in intact cells was performed to assess U50,488H-induced down-regulation. Cells were treated with or without 1 μm U50,488H at 37 °C for 4 h and washed extensively. Cell membranes were prepared at 4 °C, and [3H]diprenorphine binding on membranes was conducted in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and 5 μm leupeptin (pH 7.4) (32Zhu J. Luo L.Y. Mao G.F. Ashby B. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, receptor binding on intact cells was conducted in Krebs Ringer HEPES buffer solution (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). Saturation [3H]diprenorphine binding was performed with various concentrations of [3H]diprenorphine (ranging from 0.02 to 2 nm) at room temperature for 60 min. (−)-Naloxone (10 μm) was used to define nonspecific binding. For ∼1 nm[3H]diprenorphine, the concentration that just reached saturation in membrane and intact cell binding, total and nonspecific binding levels in membranes were about 5,000 and 500 dpm per tube, respectively, and in intact cells binding levels were about 6,000 and 600 dpm per tube, respectively. Thus, nonspecific binding represented ∼10% of total binding for both membrane binding and intact cell binding. Binding data were analyzed with the EBDA program (38McPherson G.A. Comput. Prog. Biomed. 1983; 17: 107-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), and Kd and Bmax values were determined. The κ opioid receptor internalization was conducted according to the procedure described by Li et al. (33Li J.-G. Luo L.-Y. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12087-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-hkor cells cultured in 24-well plates were treated without or with U50,488H at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed three times on ice with ice-cold PBS buffer. Receptor binding on intact cells was performed at room temperature for 60 min. Total receptor levels were assessed by binding with 2 nm[3H]diprenorphine in the presence or absence of 1 μm diprenorphine (a hydrophobic ligand), whereas surface receptors were measured by binding with 2 nm[3H]diprenorphine in the presence or absence of 1 μm dynorphin A-(1–17), a hydrophilic ligand. Thus, the difference between total receptor binding and cell surface receptor binding represents binding to the intracellular receptor pool. For receptor recycling, cells were treated without or with 1 μm U50,488H at 37 °C for 30 min, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and added to fresh warm medium for the indicated intervals at 37 °C (from 5 to 60 min). Medium was removed, and cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS buffer. The intracellular receptors were determined as described above. Nonspecific binding defined by 1 μm diprenorphine was 10–15%. Competitive inhibition of [3H]diprenorphine binding to the κ opioid receptor in intact cells by U50,488H was performed with a fixed concentration of [3H]diprenorphine (∼0.2 nm) and various concentrations of U50,488H in Krebs Ringer HEPES buffer at room temperature. Ki values were determined. Membrane preparations and [35S]GTPγS binding were performed according to Li et al. (39Li J., Li, J.-G. Chen C. Zhang F. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated without or with 1 μm U50,488H for 30 min and washed three times with cold PBS buffer. Then the cells were pelleted and ice-cold lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.4) was added. Cell suspension was passed through a 1-ml 29G38-gauge syringe needle five times and centrifuged. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), passed through the syringe needle, and centrifuged, and the processes were repeated one more time. Membranes were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), protein contents were determined, and membranes were frozen at −80 °C until use. About 10 μg of membrane protein was incubated without or with different concentrations of U50,488H, 15 μm GDP, and 0.2 nm [35S]GTPγS in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After a 60-min incubation at 30 °C, bound and free [35S]GTPγS were separated by filtration with GF/B filters. Radioactivity on filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. CHO-FLAG-hkor cells transfected with HA-EBP50/NHERF or the vector pcDNA3 were transferred to 24-well plates and changed to serum-free medium for 2 h to reduce basal MAP kinase phosphorylation. Cells were treated with or without U50,488H at 37 °C for 10 min and then lysed by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Aliquots of the lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Phosphorylated MAP kinase was detected by Western blot using phosphospecific MAP kinase antibodies and enzyme-linked chemiluminescence with the PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAP kinase"

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PKA modulates cellular physiology is by covalent modification of polypeptide substrates via reversible enzymatic transfer of a phosphate moiety to a consensus phosphorylation motif in the target protein (5Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The number and range of protein substrates phosphorylated by PKA is as varied as the cell physiological processes which it is known to regulate. These substrates occur in all cellular compartments, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane (6Walsh D.A. Glass D.B. Mitchell R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PKA holoenzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two N-terminally dimerized regulatory (R) subunits combined with two catalytic (C) subunits (5Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). PKA is unique in that the regulatory domain of the enzyme is encoded by separate genes located on different chromosomes. PKA is also unique in that the mechanism of activation involves simple subunit dissociation upon binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits, thereby liberating catalytically active C subunits that diffuse throughout the cell, phosphorylating protein substrates containing appropriate consensus phosphorylation motifs. Four regulatory (RIα, RIIα, RIβ, and RIIβ) and two catalytic (Cα and Cβ) isoform genes have been described in the mouse (7Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. Creighton T. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002: 2637-2640Google Scholar). Messenger RNA and protein for the α isoforms of PKA (RIα, RIIα, and Cα) are found ubiquitously in the mouse and are expressed during early embryogenesis, whereas the β isoforms (RIβ, RIIβ, and Cβ) have more tissue-specific patterns of expression. RIβ expression is restricted to neurons, whereas RIIβ expression is highest in brain and brown and white adipose tissues (8Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Clegg C.H. Haugen H.S. Boring L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1638-1644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Expression of Cβ is highest in brain with lower levels in all tissues (10Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of R and C isoforms has been examined at day 14 of embryogenesis in the mouse (11Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, a more detailed study of the expression and function of PKA isoforms during early stages of mammalian development is lacking. The cAMP/PKA signaling system is likely to play an important role in early development, and several lines of experimentation have suggested important pathways that are modified by PKA activity. A potential requirement for PKA activity in the regulation of zygotic gene activation in the preimplantation mouse embryo has been documented (12Poueymirou W.T. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,13Schwartz D.A. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 32: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Studies of Drosophila imaginal disks demonstrate that imaginal disk cells lacking PKA activity behave as if they have received an excessive sonic hedgehog signal, resulting in dramatic pattern re-specifications (14Jiang J. Struhl G. Cell. 1995; 80: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 15Lepage T. Cohen S.M. Diaz B.F.J. Parkhurst S.M.

Wiersdorf V. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1995; 373: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that PKA acts to antagonize sonic hedgehogsignaling and thus repress hedgehog-responsive genes such asdecapentaplegic, patched, andwingless. By using constitutively active and dominant negative forms of PKA, two independent studies have shown that PKA acts as a common negative regulator of sonic hedgehog signaling in the zebrafish embryo (19Concordet J.P.

Apart from the role of PKA as a general negative regulator of sonic hedgehog signaling, research to date has not uncovered any other specific roles for PKA in vertebrate development. One recent report (22Joore J. van de Water S. Betist M. van den Eijenden-van Raaij A. Zivkovic D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) has implicated PKA in even earlier stages of vertebrate embryogenesis. In this study it was demonstrated that dissociated zebrafish blastula cells required PKA activity for activin induction of the early mesoderm marker genesgoosecoid and no tail. However, only mild effects were observed in vivo by injection of a dominant negative regulatory subunit of PKA on goosecoid and no tail expression. Furthermore, when Joore et al. (22Joore J. van de Water S. Betist M. van den Eijenden-van Raaij A. Zivkovic D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) injected 2–4 cell stage zebrafish embryos with a constitutively active form of the catalytic subunit of PKA, it had no effect. This is in direct contrast to injections of a similar construct into 2–4 cell stage zebrafish embryos made by Hammerschmidt and McMahon (20Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), who observed that blastula stage zebrafish embryos were exquisitely sensitive to a constitutively active form of the catalytic subunit of PKA, resulting in failure of a large fraction of these embryos. Recent evidence in our laboratory has confirmed the sensitivity of vertebrate embryos to a constitutively active form of PKA catalytic subunit. 2C. M. Niswender and G. S. McKnight, personal communication. In this study we present evidence that increased basal PKA activity resulting from targeted disruption of the RIα isoform of PKA affects signaling in the primitive streak, causing profound deficits in the production of all mesoderm derivatives including the heart. The mouse RIα genomic sequences were isolated from a Charon 4A λ phage library containing partialHaeIII/AluI fragments of BALB/c mouse genomic DNA. The promoter sites for the mouse RIα gene were determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping. In order to make a targeted disruption in the RIα gene, a 5.0-kb genomic HindIII fragment was isolated from a 129svJ mouse λ phage library using plaque hybridization screening with a 514-bpXhoI-EcoRI [32P]cDNA probe from RIα. A genomic fragment was isolated that contains a 5′ 3.2-kb intron, the 170-bp exon 3, and 1.5-kb of 3′ sequence including exons 4 and 5. This genomic fragment was then subcloned into a pUC18 vector. The vector was linearized at the XhoI site in exon 3 corresponding to amino acid 77 in the RIα coding sequence. A neomycin resistance cassette containing the SV40 promoter, the neomycin phosphotransferase cDNA, and poly(A) sequence was blunt end-ligated into the XhoI site. A thymidine kinase cassette containing the HSVtk promoter, the thymidine kinase cDNA, and poly(A) sequence was inserted 5′ to the genomic sequence using EcoRI andBamHI sites in the pUC18 polylinker. This replacement type targeting vector was designated RIαREC3 and was linearized at theBamHI site before electroporation into ES cells. The generation of germ line-competent ES cells in our laboratory has been described (23Brandon E.P. Zhuo M. Huang Y.Y., Qi, M. Gerhold K.A. Burton K.A. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8851-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). REK2 or REK3 ES cells were electroporated with 25 μg of BamHI-linearized RIαREC3 per 107 cells using a ProgenitorTM II PG200 electroporator (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) and subsequently grown under double selection in G418 (280 μg/ml) and ganciclovir (2 μm). DNA from ES cell clones was analyzed by Southern blot using a 1-kb SacI/HindIII RIα genomic probe located 3′ to the targeting construct. Positively targeted clones were expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts that were subsequently implanted into BL6/CBAF1 pseudopregnant females. The resulting male chimeras were mated with C57BL/6 females, and agouti offspring were genotyped by Southern blot analysis. Both REK2- and REK3-derived male chimeras passed the mutation through the germ line resulting in heterozygous agouti offspring. Heterozygous agouti mice were then interbred and thus maintained on the mixed (129svJ × C57BL/6) background for all subsequent analyses. Targeting of the Cα gene and creation of Cα null mutant mice are the subject of a separate study (24Skalhegg B.S. Huang Y., Su, T. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Burton K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 630-639PubMed Google Scholar). In order to generate RIα+/−Cα+/− mice, RIα heterozygous female mice were crossed to Cα heterozygous male mice, which are both on the 129svJ-C57BL/6 mixed background. Genotyping of offspring for RIα was carried out using the Southern blot strategy described above. Genotyping of offspring for Cα was carried out using a Southern blot strategy in which a 315-bpHindIII/EcoRI probe located outside the Cα targeting construct was hybridized to BamHI-digested genomic tail DNA. The targeted Cα allele yields a 1.4-kb band, whereas the wild type allele yields a 4.1-kb band. Individual yolk sacs were dissected away from the embryos in M2 media (Sigma) and transferred to 1× SET buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) followed by overnight digestion with 300 μg/ml proteinase K in a 45 °C water bath. Yolk sac DNA was then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. DNA was resuspended in a total volume of 25 and 1 μl of the resuspended yolk sac DNA was used for PCR analysis with TaqDNA polymerase (PEC) using the following oligos at 1 μm final concentration: (A) RIα 5′ exon 3, 5′-GAGGAGGCAAGACAGAT-3′; (B) RIα 3′ exon 3, 5′-CTTTCTAACGTAGGAGG-3′; (C) Neo 5′-oligo, 5′-TCGCATGATTGAACAAG-3′; (D) Neo 3′-oligo, 5′-AAGCACGAGGAAGCGGT-3′. Reaction conditions for RIα exon 3 oligos were 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for 35 cycles. Reaction conditions for the neomycin oligos were 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for 35 cycles. Reaction conditions were optimized using the PCR OptimizerTM Kit (Invitrogen). In order to genotype embryos from RIα+/−/Cα+/− × RIα+/−/Cα+/− intercrosses, yolk sac DNA was isolated as described above, and the following two sets of Cα-specific primers were used to genotype for Cα: (A) Cα 5′ exon 6, 5′-CTGACCTTTGAGTATCTGCAC-3′; (B) Cα 3′ exon 7, 5′-GTCCCACACAAGGTCCAAGTA-3′; (C) Neo 5′-oligo, 5′-GTGGTTTGTCCAAACTCATCAATGT-3′; (D) Cα 3′ intron 7, 5′-AGACTACTGCTCTATCACTGA-3′. Reaction conditions for the Cα exon 6 and 7 oligos were 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles. Reaction conditions for the Neo and Cα intron 7 oligos were 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. For Western analysis only, E8.5 embryos were isolated in M2 media, rinsed through several changes of ice-cold PBS, and placed directly into 20 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Lysates were loaded directly onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked overnight, probed with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to RIα, and visualized using the Amersham Biosciences ECLTM system. Kinase assays were performed as described previously (8Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, E8.5 embryos were isolated in M2 media, rinsed through several changes of ice-cold PBS, and subsequently homogenized on ice in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) in a Dounce homogenizer followed by sonication using a Branson Sonifier 250 (5 pulses: output 3, duty cycle 50%). Homogenates were then snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Homogenates were thawed on wet ice and kinase assays performed in triplicate in the presence and absence of 5 μm cAMP with Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) as the substrate. Assays were also performed in the presence of 40 μg/ml protein kinase inhibitor peptide-(5–24) to demonstrate that the kinase activity was PKA-specific (25Walsh D.A. Ashby C.D. Gonzalez C. Calkins D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1977-1985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bradford assays (Bio-Rad) were performed to determine protein concentration, and kinase activity was normalized to milligrams of protein. HPLC analysis of RIα wild type and knockout E8.5 primary embryonic fibroblasts was performed as described (26Clegg C.H. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3703-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts were grown on gelatin-coated 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS/DMEM and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in homogenization buffer and stored at −80 °C until the day of the assay. The sample was diluted with homogenization buffer to a final concentration of 1–2 mg/ml, loaded onto a DEAE/HPLC column, and eluted using a linear salt gradient from 0 to 250 mm. Immediately following the HPLC separation, fractions were collected and assayed for kinase activity in the presence and absence of 5 μm cAMP with Kemptide as a substrate (8Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were isolated in M2 media and fixed in Methacarnoys fixative (3:1.5:0.5 methanol/chloroform/glacial acetic acid) at room temperature. After fixation, embryos were processed through methanol (3 times for 15 min), methyl benzoate (1 times for 30 min), and xylenes (2 times for 15 min) and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 8 μm on a Reichert-Jung microtome, and histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were subsequently dehydrated through graded ethanols into xylenes and coverslipped with PermountTM. Embryo sections were photographed on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope. Whole mount in situanalysis was performed as described (27Rosen B. Beddington R.S. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The following cRNA probes were generated as runoff transcripts using T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerase to generate sense and antisense probes: (A)Brachyury (gift from Virginia Papaioannou) linearized with BamHI (antisense) or HindIII (sense) and (B) Pax3 (gift from Peter Gruss) linearized withHindIII (antisense) or PstI (sense). Whole mounts were photographed on a Nikon SMZ-U Dissecting Scope. The derivation of primary embryonic fibroblasts has been described (28Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Briefly, E8.5 mouse embryos were dissected out from the decidua, and all decidual tissues were removed from the yolk sacs, including Reichardt's membrane. Yolk sacs were removed from each individual embryo and kept for PCR analysis, and the amniotic membrane and allantois were removed and discarded. RIα mutant E8.5 embryos were easily identified by their morphology. Mutant or wild type embryos were pooled and placed in the tip of a 1-ml syringe in PBS and then triturated several times with a 20-gauge needle into a 96-well plate containing 10% FBS/DMEM and subsequently incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Primary embryonic fibroblasts were expanded from 96- to 24-well to 60-mm dishes over several weeks. The genotype of RIα mutant primary embryonic fibroblasts was confirmed by yolk sac PCR and Western analysis. Analysis of cell cycle using DAPI staining has been described (29Rabinovitch P.S. Reid B.J. Haggitt R.C. Norwood T.H. Rubin C.E. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 65-71PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rabinovitch P.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 263-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent RIα mutant or wild type primary embryonic fibroblasts growing in 10% FBS/DMEM in 5% CO2 at 37 °C were gently trypsinized and subsequently washed twice through PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml DAPI, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The suspensions were triturated with a 26-gauge needle and analyzed using a Coulter ELITE cytometer with ultraviolet excitation and DAPI emission collected at >450 nm. DNA content and cell cycle were analyzed using the software program Multicycle. Wild type and RIα mutant primary embryonic fibroblasts were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in 12-well tissue culture dishes in 10% FBS/DMEM and grown to confluency in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. By using a p200 pipette tip, a wound was incised across the central area of the coverslip, and a line perpendicular to the incision was made on the bottom of the 12-well plate to mark the location for image collection. Images were collected at 4-h intervals using a Leica inverted scope interfaced with a Kodak 290 Digital camera and the Kodak Capture DC290 software. For actin cytoskeletal visualization, fibroblasts grown in 10% FBS/DMEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator were seeded onto 1% gelatin-coated coverslips in 12-well plates. At the time of staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed, delipidated with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min, and subsequently stained for 20 min with Texas Red phalloidin (Amersham Biosciences). After staining, cells were washed again and coverslipped in phosphate-buffered glycerol containing m-phenylenediamine (Sigma) to counterstain the nuclei. Slides were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope using standard excitation filters for Texas Red and fluorescein isothiocyanate labels. For RIα and Cα visualization, wild type and RIα knockout fibroblasts were seeded onto gelatin-coated coverslips in 12-well plates as above. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and then blocked in a 2% biotin solution, a 2% avidin solution, and 10% normal goat serum, Tris-buffered saline, 0.015% Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight. The following day cells were incubated in a 1:500 dilution of either rabbit polyclonal anti-Cα or rabbit polyclonal anti-RIα in 10% normal goat serum, Tris-buffered saline, 0.015% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. The next day cells were washed, incubated in a 1:300 dilution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 2 h, followed by a 1:300 dilution of avidin-fluorescein for 2 h. Cells were washed a final time and coverslipped with vectashield containing 1.5 μm propidium iodide to visualize nuclei. Staining was visualized as mentioned above using the Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal microscope using the Texas Red filter for nuclei and the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter for Cα or RIα. Mapping and sequencing of λ clones generated a map of the RIα locus showing that the gene contains 11 exons and spans about 18 kb in the mouse genome. The position of intronic sequences within the coding region corresponds to the genomic structure of the closely related mouse RIβ gene (31Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A previous mapping of the human RIα gene showed only 10 exons (32Solberg R. Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Torjesen P.A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but a recent report demonstrates 11 exons (33Casey M. Vaughan C.J., He, J. Hatcher C.J. Winter J.M. Weremowicz S. Montgomery K. Kucherlapati R. Morton C.C. Basson C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R31-R38Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) indicating conservation between the human and mouse RIα genes. The promoter site for the mouse RIα gene was mapped by primer extension and S1 mapping and revealed multiple start sites within a GC-rich 5′-flanking region with no recognizable TATA or CCAAT box homologies. This promoter and first non-coding exon corresponds to promoter 1a as characterized for the human RIα gene. Other promoter regions are used in humans (32Solberg R. Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Torjesen P.A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but all of these first exons are non-coding and splice to the first coding exon, exon 2, to give identical protein products. Fig.1A shows a diagram of the mouse RIα gene and the overlapping λ clones that were analyzed, and Fig. 1B contains the sequence of the exons and exon/intron boundaries as well as the sequence of the 1a promoter region. In order to address the role of the RIα isoform of PKA in mouse development, we generated a targeted disruption of the gene. The targeting vector, RIαREK3, contained a neomycin resistance cassette inserted into exon 3 of a 5-kb 129svJ genomic fragment of the RIα gene (Fig. 2A) and a thymidine kinase cassette flanking the RIα genomic coding sequence. This targeting vector was electroporated into REK2 and REK3 ES cell lines (34Brandon E.P. Gerhold K.A., Qi, M. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 403-408PubMed Google Scholar), and Southern blot analysis identified clones from both REK2 and REK3 ES cells that had homologously recombined the replacement vector sequence into the RIα gene (Fig. 2B). The targeting efficiency observed for the construct over several electroporations was ∼1 in 30. Targeted REK2 and REK3 ES cell lines were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting male chimeric offspring were bred to C57BL/6 females. Chimeras generated from the two independently derived targeted ES cell lines transmitted the mutation through the germ line. The analysis of RIα mutant embryos in this study are derived from mice generated from REK2- and REK3-targeted ES cell clones on the mixed (129svJ × C57BL/6) background. Mice carrying a heterozygous mutation in RIα were viable, fertile, and morphologically indistinguishable from wild type littermates; however, interbreeding of RIα heterozygotes to generate RIα homozygotes resulted only in wild type and heterozygous offspring in a 1:2 ratio. To determine the point at which RIα homozygous embryos were no longer viable, embryos from heterozygous intercross matings were analyzed at successive stages of development. Only resorption sites were found upon initial inspection of embryos at E11.5; however, RIα mutant embryos were found in Mendelian ratios from E7.5 up to E10.5 (Table I). PCR genotyping of yolk sac DNA using 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides to RIα exon 3 confirmed that the mutant embryos do indeed carry the disruption in exon 3 (Fig.2C). To confirm the absence of RIα protein in homozygous mutant embryos, mutant and wild type or heterozygote embryos were homogenized directly in sample buffer and run on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by probing with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to RIα (Fig. 2D). Western blot analysis confirms that RIα protein is indeed absent in the phenotypically mutant embryos.Table IDistribution of genotypes in embryos and adult mice from RIα heterozygous matingsAge+/++/−−/−7.5 dpc11 (33%)19 (58%)3 (9%)8.5 dpc7 (21%)20 (59%)7 (21%)9.5 dpc8 (27%)13 (43%)9 (30%)10.5 dpc1-aHistology on E10.5 mutants revealed extensive necrosis of tissues. dpc, days post-coitum.5 (15%)19 (58%)9 (27%)Postnatal66 (33%)124 (66%)0 (0%)1-a Histology on E10.5 mutants revealed extensive necrosis of tissues. dpc, days post-coitum. Open table in a new tab To determine whether loss of the RIα regulatory subunit results in increased or decreased PKA activity, we performed kinase assays on pooled E8.5 mutant and wild type or heterozygote embryos (Fig.3E). Although the total PKA activity is decreased by ∼40%, basal PKA activity is increased substantially in RIα mutant embryos. The reduction in total PKA activity in the absence of the RIα subunit is consistent with previous research in cell culture that has demonstrated that the PKA catalytic subunit is unstable when not complexed to regulatory subunits (35Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is an increase in free C subunit in RIα mutant embryos that is also more rapidly degraded. Approximately 52% of the kinase activity in RIα mutant embryos is still cAMP-regulated, and Western blots confirm the presence of RIIα in RIα mutant embryos (Fig. 3E, inset). Interestingly, up-regulation of RIIα is not observed in RIα mutants, which is con"

It has been shown that the erythrocytic stages of the parasites, which are responsible for the pathology of the disease in humans, are under enhanced oxidative stress and are particularly vulnerable to exogenous challenges by reactive oxygen species. Therefore it is postulated that the disruption of the antioxidant and/or redox systems of the parasite is a feasible way to interfere with their development during erythrocytic schizogony. In order to test this suggestion thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), an enzyme heavily involved in maintenance of redox homeostasis and antioxidant defense, was knocked out in P. falciparum. It was impossible to generate parasites with a disrupted trxR gene suggesting that TrxR is essential for P. falciparumerythrocytic stages. Technical problems were excluded by transfecting a 3′ replacement construct, which recombined correctly and transfectants did not show any phenotypic alterations. In order to prove that thetrxR knockout was responsible for the lethal phenotype of the null mutants, a co-transfection with both the knockout construct and a construct containing the trxR coding region under the control of the calmodulin promoter was conducted. Despite the disruption of the trxR gene, parasites were viable. In a Southern blot analysis a complicated restriction pattern was obtained, but it was shown by pulse field gel electrophoresis and field inverse gel electrophoreses that only the trxR gene locus on chromosome 9 was targeted by the constructs. It was found that the co-transfected constructs form concatemeric structures prior to integration into the trxR gene locus, which is further supported by plasmid rescue followed by restriction analyses of the plasmids. Northern and Western blot analyses proved that the co-transfectants highly overexpress TrxR from the introduced gene.

ROS are combated by the organism with antioxidative systems, which include enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants like glutathione and vitamins E and C (1Sies H. Angew. Chem. 1986; 98: 1061-1075Crossref Google Scholar). These antioxidants prevent damage of nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane integrity and are crucial for the survival in an aerobic environment (1Sies H. Angew. Chem. 1986; 98: 1061-1075Crossref Google Scholar, 2Sies H. Naturwissenschaften. 1989; 76: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Parasites have not only to cope with the oxidative stress generated by their own metabolic reactions but also have to fight ROS generated by the host immune system. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is one of the major threats to human health in the tropical regions of the world. The parasites have developed resistance to most commonly used drugs, and it is of great interest to identify, validate, and assess new potential targets suitable for the design of novel chemotherapeutics. The fact that Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes are under enhanced oxidative stress together with their susceptibility to exogenous oxidative challenge is a reason to believe that the antioxidant systems of the parasite are important for the survival of the parasite during their erythrocytic life stages (3Ginsburg H.

Thus these systems are heavily involved in the redox regulation of the cell and are thought to contribute greatly to the antioxidant capacity of the cell. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a flavo oxidoreductase, which exists in two different types in nature. The low molecular weight type occurs in bacteria, plants, and fungi, whereas mammalian cells, the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster, the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, and the malaria parasite P. falciparum contain the high molecular weight type of reductase (20Kanzok S.M.

Plasmodium TrxR has been investigated intensively and by employing mutagenesis and kinetic studies showed that it differs significantly from its mammalian counterpart (10Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D.

Both proteins belong to the family of high molecular weight TrxR, but due to different active site residues they are distinct in their substrate and inhibitor profiles that may be exploitable for the design of antimalarials (21Williams C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To establish the significance of the protein for the survival of P. falciparum, we have genetically modified blood stage forms of parasites and have demonstrated that TrxR is indeed essential for their survival. [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and the ECL Western blot detection system were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Albumax II and RPMI 1640 were from Invitrogen. Pyrimethamine was purchased from Sigma. WR 99120 was a kind gift of Dr. Jacobus, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals. The TrxR knockout construct was generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase with P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA as a template and the specific oligonucleotides 5′-GGAAGATCTGTTTTATTGTTTGATTATGTAAAGCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATCCACATGCACCATATTCAATAGG-3′ to obtain a 1028-bp fragment. The fragment starts at position 196 of thetrxR open reading frame and ends at position 1224 where an artificial stop codon was introduced into the oligonucleotide (Fig.1 A). The sense oligonucleotide contains a BglII restriction site (boldface), and the antisense oligonucleotide contains an XhoI restriction site (boldface) in order to allow directional cloning into the previously cut transfection plasmid pHH1 (31Reed M.B. Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A) resulting in construct pHH1TrxR-ko. The 3′ replacement control fragment was amplified from genomic DNA with the oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCGAGATCTCATATACCAGATGATGTTGAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCGCGCTCGAGTTATCCACATTTTCCACCCCCAC-3′ also containing the restriction sites required for cloning into pHH1. The fragment represents 1037 bp, starts at position 589 of the coding region of trxR and includes the genuine stop-codon at its 3′-end. The resulting construct is called pHH1TrxR-3′R (Fig.1 B). In order to be able to clone the txrR coding region into the overexpression plasmid pHC1, an XhoI site was mutated according to Gilberger et al. (10Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29584-29589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides sense 5′- GCTGCAGCACATGGTGCCCGGGTTTTATTGTTTGATTATG-3′, antisense 5′-CATAATCAAACAATAAAACCCGGGCACCATGTGCTGCAGC-3′, Pfupolymerase, and the expression plasmid pJC40-TrxR (10Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29584-29589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as a template in a PCR-based protocol. The PCR fragment was cloned into the TOPO T/A vector (Invitrogen), and the mutation was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Subsequently, trxR was amplified from the TOPO clone with the specific oligonucleotides sense 5′-GCGCGCTCGAGAAAAACATGTGTAAAGATAAAAACG-3′ and antisense 5′-GCGCGCTCGAGTTATCCACATTTTCCACCCCCAC-3′. Both oligonucleotides possess an XhoI site (boldface) to allow subcloning of the PCR fragment into the P. falciparumoverexpression plasmid pHC1 (32Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) resulting in plasmid pHC1TrxR-Ex (Fig.1 C). The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified by automated sequencing on an ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen). P. falciparum D10 was cultivated according to Trager and Jensen (33Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% human serum O+ and 0.05% Albumax II in human erythrocytes blood group O+under a reduced oxygen atmosphere. Prior to transfection parasites were synchronized by sorbitol lysis (34Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out as described previously (35Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Lei H.H., Su, X.Z. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 36Wu Y. Kirkman L.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) with 100 μg of circular DNA of either pHH1TrxR-ko, pHH1TrxR-3′R, or both pHH1TrxR-ko and pHC1TrxR-Ex. Transfected parasites were cultured in 90-mm Petri dishes for 48 h without drug pressure before the medium was supplemented with 0.2 μm pyrimethamine for 2 days followed by selection with 0.1 μm pyrimethamine until 5% parasitemia was reached. The first parasites were observed after 21–32 days of selection. In order to select for homologous recombination of the constructs and loss of episomal DNA, transfectants were cultivated for 3 weeks without drug pressure followed by 2 weeks with pyrimethamine pressure. This selection cycle was repeated for several rounds, and at different stages parasite DNA was isolated and subjected to Southern blotting and PCR analyses to determine whether episomal DNA was present and whether integration into the trxR gene locus had occurred. After 3 rounds of selection, parasites were cloned by limiting dilution (38Kirkman L.A., Su, X.Z. Wellems T.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and used for genotypic and phenotypic analyses. In the case of the co-transfection of knockout and overexpression constructs, clones were generated using selection with pyrimethamine (0.1 μm) and WR 99120 (5 nm). PCR analyses of transfectants were performed with AccuPrimeTM Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using genomic DNA of parasites as template. PCR was performed with trxR sense oligonucleotides 5′-ATAGCAACAGGATGTAGACC-3′ or 5′-ATAGGAGGAGGTCCAGCTGG-3′, respectively and the pHH1-specific antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CAGTTATAAATACAATCAATTGG-3′. The PCR conditions are as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C (3 min) and 35 cycles of 95 (1 min), 46 (1 min), and 60 °C (1.5 min). DNA and RNA were isolated from wild type parasites and transfectants as described elsewhere (39Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). 15 μg of genomic DNA were digested withNotI and DraIII, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Subsequently the membranes were hybridized with either the trxR knockout fragment or the 3′-UTR ofPbDT specific for pHH1TrxR-ko in order to identify the genotype of the respective parasite clone. Northern blots were performed according to Kyes et al. (40Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and probed with the coding region of trxR. In order to analyze the genotype of co-transfected parasite clones in addition to Southern blot analyses, a pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed. The chromosomes were separated by using contour clamped homogenous field apparatus at 4.2 V cm−1 and a pulse time of 225 s for 72 h (41Chu G. Vollrath D. Davis R.W. Science. 1986; 234: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with three different probes (trxR knockout fragment, pGEM vector backbone, and PbDT-3′ region). Furthermore, a field inverse gel electrophoreses (FIGE) was carried out. Genomic DNA of co-transfectants was digested with ClaI, a restriction enzyme that cuts rarely in the P. falciparumgenome, and the fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel in a FIGE (at 200 V and a pulse time of 0.8–1.5 s for 16 h). The DNA was blotted onto positively charged nylon membrane and hybridized with thetrxR-coding region and PbDT-3′ region according to standard methods (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA from co-transfected parasites was isolated as described above and subsequently used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α. Bacterial clones were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and plasmid DNA was isolated according to Sambrook et al. (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was restricted withBglII and XhoI in single digests and double digests and subsequently separated on a 1% agarose gel. Proteins of wild type and transfected parasite clones were isolated after saponin lysis (43Umlas J. Fallon J.N. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1971; 20: 527-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses 5-μl aliquots of parasite pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose according to Sambrook et al. (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blots were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and subsequently incubated with the primary rabbit anti-TrxR antiserum (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. As a loading control the blots were probed with antibodies raised against 1-Cys peroxiredoxin ofP. falciparum (1:2000) (14Krnajski Z. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Afterward the blots were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), and the secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was applied (1:10,000) for 1 h before the blot was washed in TBS-Tween and developed using the ECL detection system and exposed to BioMax MR-1 films (Eastman Kodak). In order to elucidate the significance of TrxR in P. falciparum, it was attempted to generate trxR null mutants transfecting them with pHH1TrxR-ko (Fig. 1 A). However, it proved difficult to obtain viable parasites, and there are a number of possible explanations as follows: (i) problems with the transfection technique, (ii) occurrence of an antisense effect (44Trenholme K.R. Gardiner D.L. Holt D.C. Thomas E.A. Cowman A.F. Kemp D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 45Patankar S. Munasinghe A. Shoaibi A. Cummings L.M. Wirth D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3114-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or (iii)trxR knockout has a lethal effect. In order to exclude that the failure to obtain stable trxRnull mutants is due to technical problems, a control construct was transfected that replaces the 3′ region of the gene upon homologous recombination without disrupting it (see Fig. 1 B) (46Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). By using this construct, parasites grew normally, and it was shown by Southern blot analyses that recombination events into thetrxR locus already started to occur during the 1st cycle of pyrimethamine selection (Fig. 2). The transfectants were cloned, and Southern blot analyses were performed. Fig. 2 shows that clone 3 contains pHH1TrxR-3′R integrated in thetrxR locus. Importantly, the transfectants did not show any phenotypic changes, and their growth was comparable with wild typeP. falciparum D10. These results demonstrate that thetrxR gene locus is targeted by the constructs transfected and supports the suggestion that the difficulty in obtainingtrxR null mutants was due to the disruption of thetrxR gene. To confirm that we could target the trxR gene and disrupt its expression, we made transfection constructs that would disrupt the gene and complement lack of expression with an introducedtrxR transgene (46Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Parasites were concomitantly transfected with the knockout construct pHH1TrxR-ko and the overexpression construct pHC1TrxR-Ex (Fig. 1 C), and the transfectants survived several selection cycles. In order to verify that the parasites contained both constructs, a plasmid rescue experiment was performed. 10 independent bacterial clones were analyzed. Interestingly, the restriction pattern obtained show that the knockout and overexpression plasmids have recombined after transfection. Furthermore, only two different variants of clones could be isolated, implicating that “hot spots” exist where the plasmids prefer to recombine (Fig. 3) (47Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P.

The clones 7D and 11E were chosen for further analyses because they were shown to carry both plasmid constructs in some form. To prove the assumption that the clones no longer possess episomal DNA but have integrated the recombined plasmids into the trxRlocus, they were analyzed by PCR, Southern blotting, PFGE, and FIGE. Southern blot analyses of both clones showed a complicated hybridization pattern when probed with the trxR-ko fragment as shown in Fig. 4 A. The new band at 1.85 kb, however, strongly indicates that the endogenoustrxR gene has been disrupted by pHH1TrxR-ko (see Fig.1 A). Disruption of the endogenous trxR by pHH1TrxR-ko was verified by PCR analysis using primers that specifically bind upstream of the trxR knockout fragment and within the PbDT-3′ region of pHH1TrxR-ko knockout construct (Fig. 5). In addition numerous other bands are found in the Southern blot, and we analyzed this genotype further by probing it with PbDT-3′. The 1.85-kb band diagnostic for the disruption of the endogenous trxR gene was also obtained with this probe, and a second band at 3.2 kb appears on the blot, indicating that at least two copies of pHH1TrxR-ko are present in the transfectants. The fact that DraIII only cuts pHC1TrxR-Ex once and NotI only cuts pHH1TrxR-ko once and there are no endogenous DraIII or NotI sites near the trxR gene locus, the appearance of several bands in the Southern blot indicates that they originate from recombined episomes and not from recombination events into other gene loci of thePlasmodium genome.Figure 5PCR analyses of co-transfectants. Clones Co-7D and Co-11E were used as template for the PCR-based analysis of the disruption of the endogenous trxR gene. Co-7Dand Co-11E, sense primer binds upstream of the TrxR knockout fragment; the antisense primer is specific for pHH1 (seearrows in Fig. 1 A for exact location of primers).+, positive control PCR using primers specific for pHH1TrxR-ko; −, negative control without DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This interpretation was confirmed by PFGE, using chromosomes from wild type Plasmodium and the transfectants (Fig.6). Hybridization of the blot with thetrxR-ko fragment resulted in a single signal on chromosome 9. In clones 7D and 11E the bands have shifted slightly and also the intensities of the signal appear to be higher. The shift in size of the chromosome may be attributable to the integration of a concatamer of pHH1TrxR-ko and pHC1TrxR-Ex which leads to quite a considerable increase of size but also may have structural implications on the chromosome. It has been suggested by O′Donnel et al.(48O'Donnell R. Preiser P.R. Williamson D.H. Moore P.W. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that the formation of concatamers (namely trimers) during replication of the parasites is essential for correct segregation and maintenance of the episomes during schizogony, and therefore our results are not surprising. The formation of such concatameric structures was established by a FIGE with subsequent blotting. As shown in Fig. 7, after ClaI restriction of P. falciparum D10 genomic DNA, a band of 30 kb was detectable using the trxR probe. This band shifts by at least 20 kb to a size ranging between 50 and 90 kb in clone 11E indicating that several copies of the transfection constructs were integrated into the trxR locus. Another important finding of this experiment is that the pHH1TrxR-ko-specific probePbDT-3′ also hybridized to the same band, further supporting our suggestion that the endogenous txrR gene of these clones is disrupted. Presumably, the survival of the parasites is ensured by overexpression of TrxR from the co-transfected plasmid. These findings strongly suggest that TrxR is essential for the survival of P. falciparum during the erythrocytic development and validate this protein as a target for chemotherapy of malaria.Figure 7FIGE of co-transfected parasite clone 11E (Co-11E) in comparison with D10. DNA was digested with ClaI and separated by FIGE. The blot was hybridized with two different probes (trxR-ko fragment andPbDT-3′). The hybridizing fragment of Co-11E is at least 20 kb larger than the fragment of D10. This demonstrates that at least three copies of plasmids are integrated with one of them being the knockout construct as the probe PbDT-3′, which is specific for pHH1TrxR-ko, hybridizes with this fragment. Sizes were estimated using Yeast Chromosome PFG Marker and Lambda DNA-HindIII Digest Standards (New England Biolabs). The abbreviations used are as follows: trxR, thioredoxin reductase; pGEM, pGEM vector backbone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Total RNA of wild type D10 and the transfectants (TrxR-3′R, Co-7D, and Co-11E) was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 5 mm guanidine thiocyanate, transferred to nylon membranes, and subsequently hybridized with atrxR probe. Fig. 8 shows that the message of trxR (3.2 kb) in wild type and control clone TrxR-3′R is present in equal amounts, whereas in clones 11E and 7D the message was greatly increased. These results are consistent with the fact that several copies of pHC1TrxR-Ex are present in both clones and that transcription of the recombinant gene is driven by the strong calmodulin promoter (32Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To determine whether the level of expression of TrxR was also increased in the Co-7D and Co-11E parasites, we used Western blot analyses of parasite lysates. These were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with antibodies raised against TrxR. Consistent with the elevated TrxR mRNA observed in the Northern blot analyses, the wild type and the TrxR-3′R clone clearly show a weak band at 60 kDa, whereas a strong overexpression was found in clones 7D and 11E (Fig. 9). As a loading control antibodies raised against the 1-Cys peroxiredoxin fromP. falciparum were used (14Krnajski Z. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the integration of pHH1TrxR-3′R into the trxR gene locus has no deleterious effect on the expression of the protein. This result was not surprising, because we had already shown that the transfectants do not show any detectable phenotypic differences. Furthermore, using 1-Cys peroxiredoxin as a loading control in the Western blot experiment implies that the expression of proteins involved in the antioxidative defense mechanism and possibly interacting directly with the Trx system was not affected either. Most importantly the results presented here show that co-transfection of knockout and overexpression constructs is a possibility to complement loss of function of a lethal knockout in P. falciparum. The thioredoxin redox system is involved in a variety of important cellular functions, which include the maintenance of the intracellular reducing environment, the reduction of ribonucleotides and hence DNA synthesis, and the regulation of transcription of certain genes by interaction with transcription factors (15Hirota K.

Furthermore, it has been shown that TrxR/Trx are components of an efficient antioxidant system in the cell (7Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Rahlfs S. Becker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1404-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Kawazu S. Komaki K.

Despite these important roles, a functional thioredoxin redox system is dispensable in bacteria and yeast, and it was shown that there appears to be a high degree of redundancy for almost all proteins of the thioredoxin redox cascade, as long as there is a second system present in the cell that can compensate for the loss of function of the Trx system (50Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Knockout studies of the Trx system in mice and D. melanogaster impair embryonic and larval development, and it is presumed that the reduced capacity to adequately protect cells from cytotoxic damage is the cause for the deleterious effect (51Missirlis F. Phillips J.P. Jäckle H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1272-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 52Matsui M. Oshima M. Oshima H. Takaku K. Maruyama T. Yodoi J. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that trxR null mutants were not viable, we postulate that in P. falciparum blood stage forms the Trx system is not dispensable and cannot be replaced by, for instance, the glutathione redox system despite their overlapping functions. Thus the level of redundancy between both systems appears to be not as profound as in yeast or bacterial systems and is more similar to the situation in higher eukaryotes. In order to prove that the trxR locus was indeed targeted, a control experiment was performed that leads to the replacement of the 3′ region of the trxR gene upon homologous recombination of the construct pHH1TrxR-3′R. Parasites obtained after integration of the control construct did not show any phenotypic alterations when compared with the wild type strain. To rescue trxR null mutants, a co-transfection of both pHH1-TrxR-ko and pHC1-TrxR was conducted. This was mainly done because currently there are only limited numbers of selectable markers available for the transfection of P. falciparum. Both constructs possess DHFR as selectable markers and confer resistance to pyrimethamine; however, the human DHFR also confers resistance to WR 99120 (31Reed M.B. Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 32Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem.

Therefore, parasite clones were selected by using both drugs, and it was shown that indeed both plasmids reside in the trxR gene locus of clones 7D and 11E. These results indicate that the lethal effect of thetrxR knockout can be compensated by overexpressing the gene from a recombinant source. The genotype of the co-transfected parasites was investigated in more detail, and it was shown that the co-transfected plasmids form complexes via homologous recombination prior to integration into thetrxR gene locus. The plasmid rescue as well as the subsequent Southern blot, PFGE, and FIGE experiments strongly support this hypothesis. It has been shown previously that recombination events lead to the formation of concatameric complexes (unstable replicating forms) between episomal copies of the constructs transfected into P. falciparum (47Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Catron D., Ji, D.D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48O'Donnell R. Preiser P.R. Williamson D.H. Moore P.W. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is presumed that transfected plasmids need to form unstable replicating forms to be maintained within the parasite, because they are essential for correct segregation to daughter cells during the erythrocytic cycle of the parasites (48O'Donnell R. Preiser P.R. Williamson D.H. Moore P.W. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PFGE shows that both constructs were present on chromosome 9, and FIGE shows that at least three copies of the constructs were integrated into the trxR gene locus. The hypothesis that the concomitant transfection of the overexpression construct led to a compensation of trxR loss of function is shown by the normal growth of clones 7D and 11E. Northern blot analyses confirmed that trxR was expressed at high levels, which is also reflected by the elevated protein levels found in those clones. The amplified expression on mRNA and protein level in comparison with wild type or control parasites is mainly attributable to the calmodulin promoter that drives the expression of the recombinantly introduced trxR gene from pHC1 (32Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,46Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In conclusion the results presented here show that a co-transfection of knockout and overexpression constructs is a suitable method to complement a lethal disruption of an essential gene in P. falciparum. By using this method our study validates P. falciparum thioredoxin reductase as a potential target for the development of new antimalarials and highlights the importance of functional antioxidant and redox systems for the survival of the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W1991719301,"Isomerization of disulfide bonds is vital for the proper folding of proteins that possess multiple disulfides. In prokaryotes, the catalytic pathway responsible for disulfide isomerization involves thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and the DsbC, DsbG, and DsbD proteins. To be active as isomerases, DsbC and DsbG must be kept reduced. This task is performed by the cytoplasmic membrane protein DsbD. DsbD in turn is reduced by the cytoplasmic thioredoxin and is composed of three domains. The β domain is membrane-embedded, whereas the α and γ domains are localized to the periplasm. It had been proposed that electrons are transferred within DsbD by a succession of disulfide exchange reactions between the three domains. To test this model using biochemical methods, we purified to homogeneity different polypeptides corresponding to the α, β, γ, and βγ domains. Using these domains, we could reconstitute a DsbD activity and, for the first time, reconstitute in vitro the electron transport pathway from NADPH and thioredoxin to DsbC and DsbG. We showed that electrons are transferred from thioredoxin to the β domain then successively to the γ domain, the α domain, and finally on to DsbC or DsbG. We also determined the redox potential of the γ domain to be −241 mV, and that of the α domain was found to be −229 mV. This shows that the direction of electron flow within DsbD is thermodynamically driven. Isomerization of disulfide bonds is vital for the proper folding of proteins that possess multiple disulfides.

This shows that the direction of electron flow within DsbD is thermodynamically driven. disulfide bond 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid high performance liquid chromatography A critical step in the folding of newly synthesized proteins is the formation of native disulfide bonds between the thiol groups of two cysteine residues (for a review, see Ref. 1Collet J.F. Bardwell J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, this disulfide formation occurs in the periplasm and is catalyzed by a protein called DsbA1 (DsbA stands for disulfide bond) (2Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). DsbA is a powerful (3Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and rather nonspecific oxidant that has the dangerous potential of introducing non-native disulfides into proteins with multiple cysteines, an event that, if uncorrected, can lead to protein inactivation. To correct for these mistakes, the cell needs a disulfide isomerization system. The isomerization system in Escherichia coli involves three additional Dsb proteins: DsbC, DsbG, and DsbD. DsbC and DsbG are periplasmically localized proteins that have disulfide isomerase activity in vitro. The three-dimensional structure of DsbC solved recently by McCarthy et al. (4McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) showed that DsbC is a V-shaped dimer of two thioredoxin-like folds. The active site CXXC motifs, one from each monomer, face into the interior of the V. It appears that dimerization of DsbC is required for its isomerase activity (5Sun X.X. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22743-22749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To be able to correct non-native disulfides, the cysteines of the CXXC motif within DsbC and DsbG need to be kept reduced in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. In the isomerization reaction, the first cysteine of the CXXC motif, present in the reduced form, is thought to attack a non-native disulfide in a misfolded protein. This results in the formation of a mixed-disulfide between the isomerase and the target protein. This mixed disulfide is resolved either by the attack of the second cysteine of the CXXC motif or by another cysteine contained in the misfolded protein. If the isomerase becomes oxidized, it needs to be re-reduced before it can carry out a second catalytic cycle. The protein responsible for the reduction of DsbC and DsbG is the inner-membrane protein DsbD (6Missiakas D. Schwager F. Raina S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DsbD is a 59-kDa protein that is synthesized as a precursor with a cleavable signal peptide (7Gordon E.H. Page M.D. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DsbD has three different domains. Two domains (α and γ) are located in the periplasm. They are connected by the membranous β domain. Sequence analysis suggests that the γ domain has a thioredoxin-like fold, like DsbA, DsbC, and DsbG. Each domain of DsbD possesses a conserved pair of cysteine residues, which have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis experiments to be required for activity (7Gordon E.H. Page M.D. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that DsbD receives its electrons from thioredoxin, a cytoplasmic protein that keeps ribonucleotide reductase and other cytoplasmic proteins in the reduced state (10Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin itself is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. A model has been proposed for the direction of electron flow within DsbD. This model relies on two types of in vivo experiments: first, the identification of mixed disulfide bonds between thioredoxin and the β domain and between the α domain and DsbC (11Krupp R. Chan C. Missiakas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3696-3701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and second, the demonstration that, when the γ domain is removed from the system, the β domain is found reduced and the α domain is found oxidized (12Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This suggests that electrons are successively transferred from thioredoxin to the β domain, to the γ and α domains, and finally on to DsbC or DsbG. In addition, in vitro 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate trapping experiments also suggested that the α domain and DsbC interact (13Goldstone D. Haebel P.W. Katzen F. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Metcalf P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There are a number of reasons to suspect that this pathway may be incorrect or incomplete. One significant problem with the model is that the evidence for it is based largely on two difficult techniques:in vivo thiol trapping and isolation of reaction intermediates from whole cells. Quantitative thiol trapping is difficult to achieve even in vitro, where the availability of extraneous thiols can be rigorously controlled. Effective quenching is expected to be an especially severe problem when dealing with proteins such as DsbD that are designed to undergo very rapid thiol exchange reactions as part of their enzymatic mechanism. Removal of cysteines within DsbD by mutagenesis results in the accumulation of stable mixed disulfides between proteins and between domains for some of these mutants. These cross-linking experiments have interpreted the presence of these stable disulfide bonds as an indication that these bonds are a normal intermediate in the reaction mechanism. Unfortunately, cross-linking experiments are especially difficult to interpret when studying disulfide exchange reactions within a multicysteine protein. Here, removal of one cysteine may not stop the reaction in its tracks leading to accumulation of the intermediate normally present prior to the block. Rather, the unstable reaction intermediates may rapidly rearrange to a more stable configuration. The cross-linking of DsbC with cysteine mutants of DsbD's α domain was taken as an indication that the two interact in DsbD's catalytic cycle. It may, however, have another explanation. It has been reported that mutations that alter the cysteines 103 or 109 of the α subunit destabilize this subunit (12Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The role of DsbC in vivo is to form mixed disulfides with partially unfolded miss-oxidized proteins. DsbC will be expected to interact with any cysteine-containing misfolded protein, including destabilized mutants of DsbD. Thus DsbC may be treating DsbD mutants that lack these cysteines as isomerization targets. For these reasons we decided that it would be appropriate to test the current model of DsbD function using a biochemical approach. To test this model, we produced and purified separately the three domains of DsbD. Using the purified domains, we could reconstitute a DsbD activity in vitro. We showed that thioredoxin is able to reduce the β domain and that electrons are then successively transferred to the γ domain, the α domain, and DsbC or DsbG. These results are consistent with the direction that electron flow has been previously proposed. We also determined the kinetic parameters of the reaction between the α domain and DsbC and DsbG and the redox potentials of the α and γ domains. We also showed that DsbA cannot effectively oxidize the α domain of DsbD. This result helps explain how the DsbA-dependent disulfide oxidation system fails to oxidize and thus inactivate the DsbD-dependent isomerization system. Glucose and MES were from Acros.n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Antrace. All other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co., Fisher, or ICN.

Beckwith (Harvard), and purified thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase were provided by Charles Williams, Jr. The coding DNA sequence of DsbD was amplified by PCR using primers DsbD1 and DsbD2 (TableI). The amplified DNA was first inserted into a pCR2.1 vector, cut with NcoI and BamHI, and introduced into a pQE60 plasmid to generate pMB87. Primer pairs DsbD3/DsbD4 and DsbD5/DsbD6 were amplified to generate deletion derivatives of pMB87 that only contained the portion of DsbD that corresponded to the α or γ domains of DsbD. The amplification products were re-circularized to generate pJFC1 (DsbD α) and pJFC2 (DsbD γ), respectively. Primers DsbD7/DsbD8 were used to amplify pJFC1 to generate a derivative of the α domain that lacks the sequence of DsbD's signal peptide, for cytoplasmic expression. Re-ligation of the amplification product generated pJFC3.Table IPrimers used in this study Open table in a new tab The coding sequence for the β domain of DsbD was amplified with primers DsbD9 and DsbD10. The PCR product was cut with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into a pQE60 plasmid to generate pJFC4 (DsbD β). A thrombin site was introduced between the α and β domains using “back to back” primers DsbD11/DsbD12 to PCR amplify pMB87. The PCR product was re-ligated to generate pJFC5. pJFC5 was used in a PCR reaction with primers DsbD13 and DsbD14 to introduce a thrombin site between the β and γ domains. Re-ligation of the PCR product generated pJFC6. The two thrombin sites were inserted after residues 145 and 452, respectively. Plasmid pJFC6 and primers DsbD17 and DsbD18 were used to replace the two cysteine residues present in the γ domain by alanine residues generating pJFC7. The β-MalF sequence was inserted in front of the β domain by PCR amplification of pFK053 with primers DsbD15 and DsbD16. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET11 to generate pJFC7. PCR reactions were performed using Pfu DNA polymerase. That the desired sequence was obtained was verified by Sanger sequencing performed at the University of Michigan core facilities. BL21(DE3) harboring the various DsbD domain expression plasmids were grown aerobically in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C until anA600 of 0.8–1.0 was reached. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and shaking was continued for 5 h to allow protein expression. Cultures were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min. From this point on, all the steps were performed at 4 °C. Bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA. For the preparation of the more protease-sensitive species, DsbD with thrombin sites, the β domain, and MalF-β, a tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was also added. Cells were disrupted by two passes through a French Press at 1200 p.s.i. Two different purification protocols were followed, one for soluble domains and the other for membrane-associated domains. Bacterial extracts containing the soluble α or γ domains were centrifuged for 40 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The resulting supernatant (∼20 ml) was diluted 2-fold with buffer A and applied onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap nickel-affinity column. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer A. The His-tagged DsbD derivatives were eluted with buffer A containing 60 and 300 mm imidazole, successively. Both the α and γ domains were found to elute at 300 mm imidazole. Bacterial extracts containing the membrane-associated proteins, DsbD with thrombin sites, the β domain, and MalF-β, were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min in a Beckman type 50.2Ti rotor. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A, and membranes were solubilized in 1.5%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The His-tagged proteins were then bound to a 5-ml Hi-Trap nickel-affinity column that had been equilibrated with 3 volumes of buffer A, containing 0.02%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The column was washed with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with various concentrations of imidazole (15, 30, 45, 60, and 300 mm). DsbD with thrombin sites eluted with 300 mm imidazole. All purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration and desalted by gel filtration on PD-10 columns in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. For membrane proteins, 0.02%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was added to the buffer. After gel filtration, 3 ml of DsbD with thrombin sites containing 15 mg of protein was incubated with 6 thrombin units in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 0.02%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. A thrombin unit is the amount of enzyme required to cleave 1 mg of a test protein when incubated in the above conditions at 20 °C for 16 h. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, DsbD with thrombin sites was completely cut between the α domain and βγ. The digestion mixture was then loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap nickel-affinity column, and proteins were eluted in two steps with buffer A containing 60 and 300 mm imidazole, respectively. The fraction that eluted with 60 mm imidazole contained the α domain; those that eluted with 300 mm imidazole contained the βγ polypeptide. This polypeptide was concentrated to 3 mg/ml and desalted by gel filtration on PD-10 columns. 400 μg of the βγ polypeptide was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 20 thrombin units to cleave at the thrombin site that had been engineered between the β and γ domains. The digestion mixture was then loaded onto a column containing 200 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer A. The β domain was found in the flow-through fraction, while the γ domain was eluted with 3 volumes of buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. The domains were desalted by PD-10 chromatography. DsbC, DsbG, and DsbA were expressed and purified as previously described (14Bader M.W. Hiniker A. Regeimbal J. Goldstone D. Haebel P.W. Riemer J. Metcalf P. Bardwell J.C.

DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, thioredoxin, and both the α and γ domains were oxidized by incubation in 20 mm oxidized glutathione for 30 min at 4 °C. Oxidized glutathione was then removed by gel filtration on PD-10 Sephadex columns, and the proteins were concentrated using an Amicon 50-ml ultrafiltration unit (YM10 filters). The thiol content was measured using the Ellman assay (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21232) Google Scholar), and the proteins were shown to be >95% oxidized. Proteins were stored in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, whereas proteins used in redox equilibria were in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA. Thioredoxin and the α and γ domains were reduced by incubation in 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 4 °C. Dithiothreitol was then removed by gel filtration on PD-10 Sephadex columns. Gel filtration was performed using a solution purged of N2 of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA. For the determination of redox potential, reduced proteins were prepared immediately before use. The thiol content was measured using the Ellman assay (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21232) Google Scholar), and the proteins were shown to be >95% reduced. Redox potentials of the γ and α domains of DsbD were determined by redox equilibria with thioredoxin (E 0′ = −270 mV) as described in a previous study (17Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). 50 μm of either the γ or the α domain was incubated separately with 50 μm thioredoxin in 200 μl of an argon-purged solution of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA. One protein of the pair was added in the oxidized state, and the other was added in the reduced state. After 4 and 14 h, 50-μl aliquots were quenched by addition of 50 μl of 1% H3PO4 and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Waters, 2695 Separations Module). The oxidized and reduced forms of each protein were separated on a C18 column (Phenomenex Primesphere, 250 × 4.60 mm). The oxidized and reduced forms of both thioredoxin and the γ domain were separated using a linear aqueous 39–51% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The oxidized and reduced forms of the α domain were separated using an isocratic elution with 15% methanol and 28% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was recorded at 214 and 280 nm. Integration of the chromatograms allowed us to calculate the amounts of the oxidized and reduced forms of the different proteins. Similar results were obtained from integration of chromatograms recorded at 214 and 280 nm. The equilibrium constant of the reactions and the redox potentials were calculated as in a previous study (17Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of DsbA and DsbG was monitored in a Hitachi F-4800 spectrofluorometer. The wavelength used for tryptophan excitation was 295 nm, and the emission was monitored at 330 nm. The α domain activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by coupling its reduction to NADPH consumption via thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. The assay was performed at 30 °C in 1 ml of a mixture containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 μmNADPH, 40 nm α domain, 2 μm thioredoxin, 20 nm thioredoxin reductase, and various amounts of the substrate protein (DsbC or DsbG). The β domain activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The assay was performed at 30 °C in 0.4 ml of a mixture containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.02%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 20 μmNADPH, ∼200 nm β domain, 10 μm oxidized γ domain, 2 μm thioredoxin, and 20 nmthioredoxin reductase. Protein concentrations were calculated using the following extinction coefficient (ε280, in m−1cm−1): 20,340 for the α domain, 8,370 for the γ domain, 62,730 for the βγ domain, and 83,470 for DsbD with thrombin sites. These extinction coefficients were calculated using the ProtParam program of the ExPASy website (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.htm). It has previously been shown that DsbD consists of three domains, the α, the β, and the γ domains. These domains of DsbD, when expressed separately, can assemble in vivo into a functional enzyme that is capable of transferring electrons from thioredoxin to the disulfide isomerases DsbC and DsbG (12Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that electron flow within DsbD occurs via a succession of disulfide exchange reactions, where disulfides are transferred from DsbC to the α domain, then on to the γ domain, and finally on to the β domain. The β domain is then reduced by thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in an NADPH-dependent reaction (Fig.1). To test this model of electron flow within DsbD, our experimental strategy was to first purify all the components of the reaction, including the individual domains of DsbD. Then we determined which of the individual components when mixed together are capable of rapid electron transfer reactions. By this means we postulated that we should be able to determine the direction of electron flow within DsbD. The α domain of DsbD (residues 1–145) was first overexpressed with the signal peptide targeting the domain into the periplasm and flanked by a C-terminal His tag to allow rapid purification. Unfortunately, SDS-PAGE analysis of periplasmic extracts revealed that only minor amounts of the α domain were produced (data not shown). We then attempted cytoplasmic expression by expressing a version of the α domain from which the signal sequence (residues 1–19) had been removed. In this case, much higher amounts of the α domain were produced. 30 mg of the α domain could be purified from 1 liter of culture. The γ domain (residues 440–565) flanked by a C-terminal His tag was also highly overexpressed in the cytoplasm. 100 mg of this domain could be purified from 1 liter of culture. The two proteins were >95% pure (Fig.2A). There are at least two reasons to suspect that the β domain is key to transport of disulfides across the membrane. First, the β domain is the only membrane-embedded domain within DsbD, and it contains two strictly conserved cysteines. Second, many organisms do not have DsbD but only the β domain. For these reasons, we decided that it was worth some considerable effort to purify the β domain in an active form. Efforts to express the isolated β domain of DsbD on its own failed (data not shown). This was not surprising because the β domain is entirely membrane-embedded, and membrane proteins are notoriously hard to purify. We also attempted, but failed, to express a variant of the β domain that had its N-terminal end fused to the first transmembrane segment of the membrane protein MalF. We picked this construct because it had been shown to be expressed in vivo in at least sufficient quantities to complement a DsbD deletion when coexpressed with the α domain and the γ domain (12Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This MalF-β fusion, however, did not express in sufficient quantities to allow purification. We knew that the intact DsbD protein could be expressed, solubilized, and purified in high quantities. 2J.-F. Collet, J. Riemer, M. W. Bader, and J. C. A. Bardwell, unpublished data. Thus, we decided to construct a variant of DsbD that contained two thrombin cleavage sites (LVPRGS) introduced at the N- and C-terminal ends of the β domain. We called this variant “DsbD with thrombin sites.” We then purified this variant by using a His tag and then cleaved out and purified the β domain. A membrane fraction was prepared from cells overexpressing this variant and solubilized, and the DsbD thrombin construct was purified by nickel-agarose chromatography. About 16 mg of ∼92% pure DsbD with thrombin sites could be obtained from 6 liters of culture (Fig. 2B). The incubation of 15 mg of DsbD with thrombin sites with 6 units of thrombin cleaved the protein mainly into two polypeptides of 15 and 45 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B). This indicated that only one thrombin site had been completely cleaved. A band of ∼30 kDa (the molecular mass of the β domain) could also be seen but was very faint. The digestion mixture was then loaded onto a nickel-agarose column, and proteins were eluted with imidazole. The 15-kDa polypeptide was found in the fraction that eluted with 60 mm imidazole, and the 45-kDa polypeptide in the fraction eluted with 300 mm imidazole (Fig. 2B). The presence of the His tag at the C terminus of DsbD with thrombin sites (at the C terminus of the γ domain) indicated that the 15-kDa protein corresponded to the α domain, and the 45-kDa fragment corresponded to a protein that contained the β and γ domains still linked together (βγ). The polypeptide corresponding to the β domain was also found in the fraction containing 300 mm imidazole. The absence of a His tag in the β domain suggested that the β domain has a high affinity for the γ and/or βγ domains. About 7 mg of the βγ polypeptide was then concentrated and desalted by gel filtration. A small amount of the βγ polypeptide (∼0.4 mg) was then incubated with 20 units of thrombin. After 16 h of incubation, the βγ polypeptide was ∼60% cleaved into two polypeptides of 30 and 15 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C), corresponding to the molecular masses of the β and γ domains. The digestion products were loaded onto a 0.2-ml nickel-agarose column. The 30-kDa β domain was found in the flow-through and in the fraction eluted with 300 mmimidazole. This fraction also contained the 15-kDa polypeptide (the γ domain). Using this approach, about 0.1 mg of the β domain could be obtained from 0.4 mg of βγ polypeptide. In another approach to obtain a domain that had similar redox properties to the isolated β domain but that might be easier to purify, we prepared a βγ polypeptide in which the cysteines of the CXXC motif in the γ domain were replaced by alanine residues (βγC-A). Because this protein only contains the two cysteines from the β domain, it should have similar thiol disulfide exchange properties to that of the isolated β domain. Using the approach described above for the βγ polypeptide, 6 mg of βγC-A could be purified from 6 liters of culture. The reaction that we chose to follow is the reduction of the disulfide isomerases DsbC and DsbG by NADPH in a DsbD-catalyzed reaction (Fig. 1). Ideally, our goal was to monitor both products of the reaction, the oxidation of NADPH and the reduction of the isomerases. The oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ can be monitored at 340 nm. The reduction of DsbG can be monitored by the 1.3-fold increase in tryptophan fluorescence that accompanies its reduction. This provides a convenient way to measure the oxidation state of DsbG and measure how it changes in real-time. To be able to determine which of the domains of DsbD can directly reduce DsbG, we decided to mix stoichiometric quantities of oxidized DsbG with reduced versions of the periplasmic domains of DsbD. For this experiment to be unambiguous, it was first important to determine how the tryptophan fluorescence of the isolated α and γ domains of DsbD changed with their oxidation status. The α domain does not exhibit a change in fluorescence upon oxidation or reduction, and the isolated γ domain exhibits almost undetectable levels of fluorescence at 340 nm in either the oxidized or reduced forms (not shown). This lack of fluorescence change in the domains of DsbD is fortunate, because it allows us to directly monitor the oxidation status of DsbG in the presence of various mixtures of the DsbD periplasmic domains,"

In the current study we have compared the transport of purine nucleobase analogues by the H2 transporter of bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei bruceiand the equilibrative nucleobase transporter of human erythrocytes. The H2 transporter forms hydrogen bonds with hypoxanthine at positions N3, N7, N(1)H, and N(9)H of the purine ring, with apparent ΔG 0 of 7.7–12.6 kJ/mol.

The potential for selective uptake of antimetabolites by the parasite transporter was demonstrated. human facilitative nucleobase transporter 1 adenine-9-β-d-arabinoside Purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites are widely used to combat a variety of infectious diseases and other pathologies. However, many therapies suffer from a lack of selectivity, leading to severe side effects. The selectivity and efficacy of purine antimetabolites is achieved at two levels: the cell-surface transporters that mediate access to the cell, and the enzymes of the purine metabolic pathways that convert the pro-drug to the cytotoxic metabolite, usually a nucleotide analogue. This report elucidates the mechanisms of selectivity at the transporter level. We have chosen Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of sleeping sickness, as a model organism, because it lives freely in the host bloodstream rather than within a host cell. Therefore, the accumulation of most nucleobase and nucleoside drugs depends exclusively on the transporters expressed by the parasite itself. In addition, African trypanosomes are entirely dependent on purine salvage because they lack the capacity for de novosynthesis (1Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and they consequently express several proton symporters that actively accumulate nucleosides (2Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 3De Koning H.P. Watson C.J. Jarvis S.M. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 853-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For trypanosomes, nucleobases may make more efficient drugs than their corresponding nucleosides, because purine ribonucleosides are rapidly hydrolyzed in bloodstream form T. brucei, limiting their incorporation into the nucleotide pool (7Fish W.R. Looker D.L. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, nucleobases are efficiently assimilated by one-step reactions of phosphoribosyltransferases for adenine, hypoxanthine-guanine, and xanthine (8Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press Ltd., New York1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar). The current study therefore focuses on the mainT. brucei brucei and human nucleobase transporters. This approach will allow the identification of groups that determine high affinity uptake by either the trypanosome or the cells of its mammalian host. The escalating epidemic of African trypanosomiasis (9Barrett M.P. Lancet. 1999; 353: 1113-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the onset of drug resistance (10Kaminsky R. Mäser P. Curr. Opin. Anti-infect. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 2: 76-82Google Scholar) necessitate the development of a new generation of trypanocides, and the purine salvage pathways are potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. Purine nucleobase transport in bloodstream T. b. brucei has been previously characterized, and two distinct carriers, H2 and H3, were identified. The H2 displayed a much higher affinity and a broader specificity than H3 (4De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The almost 100-fold difference inK m for these transporters allows the study of the H2 transporter separately at a very low [3H]hypoxanthine concentration. We have now determined the substrate recognition motif for H2 and compared it with that of the human facilitative diffusion nucleobase transporter (hFNT1),1 which is the only nucleobase transporter in erythrocytes (11Griffith D.A.

This approach to comparing transporters is all the more relevant because molecular approaches are unavailable: no protozoan or metazoan nucleobase transporters have yet been cloned. Substrate recognition motifs have been shown to accurately predict the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents by T. b. brucei. Such models were developed for the T. b. brucei P1 and P2 adenosine transporters (21De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and showed that the recognition motif of P2, but not of P1, was present in trypanocides as different as diamidines, melaminophenyl arsenicals, and isometamidium (a phenanthridine-amidine hybrid). All these have now been shown to be transported by P2 or at least to bind to the transporter with sub-micromolar affinity (2Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22De Koning H.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23De Koning H.P. Mol.

We now show, on the basis of the H2 and hFNT1 substrate recognition motifs, that selective uptake of subversive nucleobase analogues by trypanosomes is possible and provide a structural rationale for the selection of such compounds. We also show that selective uptake alone is an insufficient requirement for trypanocidal action and that further studies of purine metabolism in trypanosomes will be required for rational design of antimetabolites.

Adult female Wistar rats were infected withT. b. brucei strain 427 by intra-peritoneal injection. At peak parasitemia, blood was collected by cardiac puncture under terminal anesthesia. The parasites were separated from the blood cells using a DE52 (Whatman) anion exchange column (26Lanham S.M. Nature. 1968; 218: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), washed twice in the assay buffer (33 mm HEPES, 98 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 0.55 mm CaCl2, 0.07 mm MgSO4, 5.8 mmNaH2PO4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 23 mm NaHCO3, 14 mm glucose, pH 7.3), and resuspended at 108 cells/ml. Cell viability and motility were checked under a phase-contrast microscope at the conclusion of each experiment. Whole blood from healthy human volunteers was centrifuged, and red cells were washed twice in erythrocyte buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and resuspended at a hematocrit ratio of ∼25%; the typical density was 2–3 × 109cells/ml. Uptake of 0.1 μm radiolabeled hypoxanthine in T. b. brucei was determined as previously described (3De Koning H.P. Watson C.J. Jarvis S.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, 100 μl of the trypanosome suspension (∼107 cells) was mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer containing [3H]hypoxanthine and test inhibitor. Uptake was stopped after 30 s by addition of an ice-cold 4 mm solution of unlabeled hypoxanthine and centrifugation through an oil layer (7:1 (v/v) mix of di-n-butylphthalate and light mineral oil (Sigma)). The microcentrifuge tubes were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the bottom containing the cell pellet was cut off. The cells were then solubilized in 2% SDS and mixed with scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Uptake of 1 μm [2,8-3H]adenine by human erythrocytes was similarly measured by an oil-stop method, using 100% dibutylphthalate for the oil layer and 2–3 × 108erythrocytes per assay point. Cells were solubilized in 250 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and hemoglobin was precipitated with 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (10 min, 13,000 rpm) the supernatant was transferred to scintillation vials and mixed with 3 ml of scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was counted. All uptake data presented are presumed to represent “mediated uptake,” defined as total uptake minus diffusion, taken to be uptake in the presence of saturating concentrations of unlabeled permeant. Some test compounds were used from stock solutions in 100% Me2SO. Final Me2SO concentrations in the assays never exceeded 1%, which did not affect uptake kinetics by either erythrocytes or trypanosomes. In a few cases, complete inhibition curves could not be obtained due to limited solubility of the test compound, necessitating extrapolation to 100% inhibition, defined as being equal to transport in the presence of saturating concentrations of unlabeled permeant. Only when >50% inhibition was achieved at the maximum test concentration, was an IC50 value estimated, assuming a Hill coefficient of −1.

Use of extrapolation of incomplete inhibition curves is indicated and was performed only when >50% inhibition was achieved at the highest inhibitor concentration and full inhibition and a Hill coefficient of −1 were assumed. This has been necessary because of limited solubility of some compounds. IC50 values (minimum of six points in triplicate) were determined from the inhibition profiles for the various inhibitors using the Fig.P. software package (Biosoft). The Cheng-Prusoff equation (27Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar) was then used to give theK i values for the analogues, Ki=IC50/[1+(L+Km)]Equation 1 in which L is the permeant concentration. Gibbs free energy, ΔG 0, was calculated from,ΔG0=−RTln(Ki)Equation 2 in which R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. It should to be pointed out that these equations are only valid for competitive inhibition. The observation that inhibition profiles for both H2 and hFNT1 were consistently near −1 is consistent with competitive inhibition of a single transporter. Whereas bloodstream trypanosomes do express two distinct purine nucleobase transporters, the chosen [3H]hypoxanthine concentration allows for >95% uptake by H2 (4De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To date, inhibition of T. b. brucei purine transporters by analogues has always been shown to be competitive (2Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 5De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23De Koning H.P.

Acta Trop. 2001; 80: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and hypoxanthine and adenine were shown to use the same transporter in human erythrocytes (28Kraupp M. Marz R. Prager G. Kommer W. Razavi M. Baghestanian M. Chiba P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All the available evidence therefore suggests that a simple model of competition with the radiolabeled permeant for interaction with the transporter binding site is applicable. Drug sensitivity in cultured bloodstream trypanosomes was performed using the method of Räz et al. (29Räz B. Iten M. Kaminsky R. Brun R. Acta Trop. 1997; 68: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of test compounds were made in 96-well plates by serial passage of 100 μl of test compound (usually at 250 μm) to 100 μl of HMI9 medium (730 ml/liter Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (product number 31980; Invitrogen) 1 mm adenosine, 50 μm bathocuprione disulfonic acid, 160 mmthymidine, 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm cysteine (all from Sigma), 50,000 units/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter streptomycin, 30 mg/liter kanamycin, 20% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen)) (30Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Negative control values were obtained from wells with 100 μl of medium without test compound, whereas positive controls included dilution series of known trypanocides such as diminazene aceturate (Sigma). To each well, 100 μl of medium, containing 104 culture-adapted bloodstream T. b. brucei, was added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h after which 20 μl of alamarBlue reagent (Bio-Source, Camarillo, CA) was added. After a further 24-h incubation, fluorescence was determined in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55B fluorometer (λexc = 480 nm, λem = 530 nm). Natural purines and a variety of purine analogues were assayed for their ability to inhibit trypanosome or human erythrocyte nucleobase transport activities. By calculating the free energies involved in the interaction between the transporters and the different molecules, structure-activity relationships can be modeled and compared. The K i values were determined from dose-response curves, and ΔG 0 values for the interaction between transporter and permeant were calculated, subject to the assumptions outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Table I lists theK i values and binding energies for both transporters. The kinetic parameters of the H2 hypoxanthine transporter have been described previously: hypoxanthine uptake is saturable, rapid, and linear over at least 50 s, with a K m of 123 ± 15 nm and a V max of 1.1 ± 0.2 pmol (107 cells)−1 s−1 (4De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we describe its substrate recognition profile and present a model for the interactions between purine ring and transporter binding site. The T. b. brucei H2 transporter has some preference for oxopurines, as illustrated by the 30-fold lower K i value for hypoxanthine than for adenine (Fig.1 A). Yet, there is an apparent interaction between the H2 binding pocket and the position 6 amino group, as indicated by the difference of 4.3 kJ/mol in ΔG 0 between adenine and purine (Fig.1 A). This indicates that, at position 6, a hydrogen bond donor is favored. Consistent with this notion, the 6-keto group of oxopurines does not contribute to their high affinity: theK i values for guanine and 6-thioguanine are identical (Table I), although the thio group would be a far less effective hydrogen bond acceptor. It follows that the protonation of N1, being the only other difference between hypoxanthine and purine, is responsible for the 12.5 kJ/mol difference in ΔG 0 (Fig. 1 A). The same change in binding energy was observed upon methylation of the 6-keto group of hypoxanthine (Fig. 1 C), which similarly changes the protonation state of N1, and the apparent loss of a strong hydrogen bond in that position. The observed δ(ΔG 0) of 8.1 kJ/mol between hypoxanthine and adenine is thus explained by a gain of 12.5 kJ/mol from N1(H) minus 4.3 kJ/mol from the loss of the interaction with 6-NH2. The unprotonated N1 does not contribute to binding to the H2 transporter, becauseK i values for purine and 1-deazapurine (Fig. 1,A and C) were virtually identical (Table I). The slightly lower affinity for guanine than for hypoxanthine (δ(ΔG 0) = 2.7 kJ/mol) shows that substitutions at position 2 may be unfavorable for binding to H2. Two other comparisons (2,6-diaminopurine versus adenine and 6-thioguanine versus 6-thiopurine) give an estimate of 3.5 ± 0.6 kJ/mol loss of binding energy from the 2-NH2 substitution (Table I). The slightly bulkier chloride substitution was even more detrimental to binding (δ(ΔG 0) = 6.1 kJ/mol, 2.6-dichloropurine versus 6-chloropurine, Table I), suggesting the lower affinity could be the result of steric effects, although these substitutions would also reduce the partial negative charge on N3, making this residue a less effective hydrogen bond acceptor. Evidence that N3 does act in this way is provided by the 8.3 kJ/mol energy difference between guanine and 3-deazaguanine (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, methylation of N3 leads to a dramatic loss in affinity, because 250 μm 3-methyladenine completely failed to inhibit H2-mediated [3H]hypoxanthine uptake (Table I). Alternatively, the methylation of N3 could physically prevent optimal positioning of the substrate in the binding pocket. The pyrimidine ring thus contributes 20.8 kJ/mol to the total of 39.4 kJ/mol Gibbs free energy for the interactions between the hypoxanthine molecule and the transporter, indicating a similar contribution from the imidazole half of this purine. Consistent with this prediction, 4-(3H)-pyrimidone, consisting only of the pyrimidine half of hypoxanthine (for structure, see Fig. 2), displayed a δ(ΔG 0) of 22.1 kJ/mol compared with hypoxanthine (Fig. 1 D). Similarly, the δ(ΔG 0) of NS20635, which is equivalent to adenine but with a saturated 5-membered hydrocarbon ring instead of imidazole (Fig. 2), was 17.8 kJ/mol with adenine (Fig.1 D). The involvement of N7 in binding, most probably as a hydrogen bond acceptor, follows most directly from the δ(ΔG 0) between 7-deazaguanine and guanine (12.5 kJ/mol). In addition, the affinity for allopurinol (Fig. 2) is significantly reduced compared with hypoxanthine, although its δ(ΔG 0) of 8.7 kJ/mol (Table I) suggests that a minor interaction is still possible with the nitrogen residue that has shifted from position 7 to 8. Uric acid (for structure, see Fig. 2) had no effect on [3H]hypoxanthine uptake at 250 μm, probably due to the protonation of N7 in the dominant tautomeric form of uric acid. Even if the 8-keto group does not cause steric hindrance, this would suffice to increase the theoreticalK i value for uric acid to ∼1.5 mm, but an experimental value could not be obtained due to limitations of solubility. The preference of the H2 transporter for nucleobases over nucleosides suggests that N(9)H may be involved in interactions with the transporter binding pocket or that the bulky ribose moiety interferes with the proper positioning of the purine ring. The δ(ΔG 0) of both 9-deazaguanine (Fig.1 D) and 9-deazaadenine was 7.7 kJ/mol compared with their respective parent molecules (Table I), indicating that N(9)H most likely acts as a hydrogen bond donor. Given the higher difference in ΔG 0 between most nucleobases and their respective nucleosides (adenine-adenosine, 12.9 kJ/mol; hypoxanthine-inosine, 15.8 kJ/mol), it is likely that steric factors equally contribute to the low affinity for nucleosides. The H2 transporter therefore employs four interactions to bind either oxopurines or aminopurines. The observed ΔG 0values of hypoxanthine (−39.5 kJ/mol) and adenine (−31.3 kJ/mol), based on their K m values (Table I), are in close agreement of the total of the four predicted interactions (−41.1 and −32.8 kJ/mol, respectively). Transport of 1 μm[3H]adenine by human erythrocytes was rapid and linear over 20 s (Fig. 3) with a rate of 0.056 pmol (107 cells)−1 s−1. This rate was reduced by 92% in the presence of 1 mmunlabeled permeant (Fig. 3 and inset), showing that transport was saturable. In all experiments, [3H]adenine uptake in human erythrocytes was monophasic, with a Hill coefficient near −1, consistent with a single transport entity for adenine, as reported by previous investigators (12De Koning H.P. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 75: 75-94Google Scholar, 28Kraupp M. Marz R. Prager G. Kommer W. Razavi M. Baghestanian M. Chiba P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The transport conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.4 A) with an apparentK m of 16.2 ± 4.5 μm and aV max of 1.92 ± 0.89 pmol (107cells)−1 s−1 (n = 3). Subsequent inhibition profiles were obtained using a [3H]adenine concentration of 1 μm and an incubation time of either 3 or 5 s, which produced highly reproducible results.Figure 4Transport of [3H]adenine by human erythrocytes.

This probably underlies many biological processes controlled by these factors. The ability of the domain to interact with other key regulatory proteins such as corepressor proteins and other transcription factors appears to be important for repression (11Dong S. Zhu J. Reid A.

In particular, the POZ domains of human Plzf (promyelocyticleukemia zinc finger transcription factor) and Bcl-6 (Bcell lymphoma transcription factor-6) were shown to interact with SMRT/N-CoR, mSin3A, B-CoR, and histone deacetylase (12Dhordain P.

By referring to the molecular mechanisms proposed for the nuclear receptors, “chromatin compaction” by histone deacetylase complex recruited by the POZ domain was suggested to repress transcription (13Lin R.J.

Sp1 (specificity protein 1) is a sequence-specific transcription factor that binds GC box and activates a wide range of viral and cellular genes (19Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar, 20Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp1 belongs to the Krüppel-like C2H2-type zinc finger superfamily (20Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The protein is composed of several modules, N terminus-inhibitory domain (aa1 1–82), serine/threonine-rich domains (aa 87–143; aa 243–350), glutamine-rich domains (aa 138–232; aa 351–500) important in transcription activation, zinc finger DNA binding domain (aa 622–720), and C terminus D domain (aa 721–788) (19Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar, 20Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Because almost all genes contain Sp1-binding GC box in their promoters and Sp1 often plays a critical role in the transcription activation of many genes, there must be a mechanism regulating the activity of Sp1. Murata et al.(21Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Sp1 activity may be negatively regulated by the cellular proteins that interact with the amino terminus of Sp1. Also, the zinc finger DNA binding domain of Sp1 was shown to interact with histone deacetylase and protein kinase Cζ, and Sp1 activity is regulated by them (22Doetzlhoefer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G.

However, the molecular and biochemical nature of interactions with histone deacetylase and protein kinase Cζ is unknown (22Doetzlhoefer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G.

Koivusalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7653-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene is also believed to be the ancestral ADH gene (27Jornvall H. Danielsson O. Hjelmgvist L. Persson B. Shafgat J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 372: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is important in the oxidation of various alcohols and of formaldehyde in the presence of glutathione (see Refs. 25Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and 28Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and references therein). The gene is ubiquitously expressed, although to different levels in different cells (28Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1984; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Duley J.A. Harris O. Holmes R.S. Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res. 1985; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ADH5/FDH promoter is very different from those of other ADH genes, which are expressed in a different tissue-specific pattern. It is very rich in GC base pairs (75% up to −200 bp) and does not contain TATA or CCAAT box and thus has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene (24Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 32Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-28226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). Previously, we investigated how the expression of the gene is regulated both at the transcription and translation levels (25Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol.

Biophys. 2001; 386: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We found that the Sp1 multigene family recognizes the core cis-elements (bp −22 to +22) and regulates transcription of theADH5/FDH minimal promoter (33Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sp1 is important both in transcription initiation and activation. Sp3 and Sp4 compete with Sp1 for the core cis-elements and repress transcription. DNase I footprinting assays showed that an unknown protein binds to the cis-element (bp −38 to −22 bp) just upstream of the Sp1-binding core elements (bp −22 to +22) of theADH5/FDH minimal promoter. Recently, we cloned a POZ domain transcription factor, FBI-1 (factorbinds to the inducer of short transcript of human immunodeficiency virus-1), recognizing thecis-element (−38 to −22 bp). The POZ domain transcription factor potently represses transcription of theADH5/FDH promoter. We investigated and discovered a novel molecular mechanism of transcription repression by the POZ domain of FBI-1 on the human ADH5/FDH promoter and the Gal4 UAS-Sp1-AdML promoter. The POZ domain interacts with the Sp1 zinc finger DNA binding domain, and represses transcription by interfering with GC box recognition by Sp1. Six clones, all encoding FBI-1, were isolated by screening a human spleen Matchmaker® cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the yeast one-hybrid assay (35Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A trimer of the transcription factor binding site (5′-ATTGCAAGCCCCCCC-3′) located between bp −38 and −22 of theADH5/FDH gene was used as a bait by cloning into yeast one-hybrid reporter constructs (pHisi, pHisi-1, and pLacZi) (25Hur M.-W.

Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). pCAT-ADH5 reporter plasmids was reported elsewhere (25Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). FBI-1 and its deleted cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). pG5-Sp1-AdML promoter-luciferase plasmid was prepared by subcloning five copies of Sp1 consensus sequence (sense, 5′-CTAGCTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGCG; antisense, 5′-CTAGCGCTCGCCCCGCCCCGATCGAG) into pG5-AdML-luciferase plasmid/NheI (Promega). Three Gal4 DBD-POZ domain (aa 1–120 of Plzf and Bcl-6 and aa 1–130 of FBI-1) fusion protein expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning the POZ domain cDNAs into pBind vector (Promega). The GST fusions of various proteins were prepared by cloning cDNAs into the pGEX4T series vectors (AmershamBiosciences) and tagged with FLAG at the C-terminal in the case of various Sp1-derived polypeptides. The aa 1–621 polypeptide, serine/threonine-rich region (aa 244–350), Q-rich region (aa 351–500), and zinc fingers of Sp1 (aa 622–720 or aa 622–788) were expressed in GST fusion form and cleaved from the GST portion when needed in in vitro pull-down assays. The His-tagged POZ domain of FBI-1 was prepared by cloning the cDNA sequence (aa 1–130) into pQE30 (Qiagen) and by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. All of the plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. The mouse nuclear extract was prepared according to the method developed by Shapiro et al. (36Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Sp1 was purchased from Promega. Anti-FLAG and anti-His antibodies were obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. and Qiagen, respectively. Rabbit anti-FBI-1 POZ domain and Sp1 antibodies were produced with purified recombinant GST fusion proteins. FBI-1 polypeptide was prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation using mMessage and a mMachine® kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and a Flexi® rabbit reticulocyte translation system (Promega). EMSA was carried out as described previously usingin vitro translated FBI-1 and the following32P-labeled oligonucleotides (only the top strand is shown): C-1 (bp −38 to +1), 5′-CATTGCAAGCCCCCCCCACGCCCCGCCCCCCTCGCTAGG; C-2 (bp −38 to −19), 5′-CATTGCAAGCCCCCCCCACG; and B (bp +1 to +22), 5′-GCGCTCGCCACGCCCATGCCTC (33Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We investigatedin vivo molecular interaction between FBI-1 and thecis-element on the ADH5/FDH promoter using ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (37Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 38Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Confluent 1 × 106 HeLa cells on a 10-mm dish was treated with formaldehyde (final 1%) to cross-link FBI-1 to the human genomic DNA. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The lysate was sonicated to shear DNA to a length between 200 and 1000 bp. The sonicated supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mmNaCl) and incubated with either antibody against FBI-1 or preimmune serum overnight at 4 °C with rotation. To collect DNA-FBI-1-antibody complex, a salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added to the mixture. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation and pelleted DNA/protein A agarose complex by brief centrifugation (700–1000 rpm) at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the pellet with various washing buffers recommended by the manufacturer, the pellet was dissolved with 250 μl of elution buffer and spun to remove agarose. Supernatant was treated with 20 μl of 5m NaCl and heated to 65 °C for 4 h to reverse FBI-1-DNA cross-link. After treatment with EDTA and proteinase K, the supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol to recover DNA. For PCR of the ADH5/FDH promoter region using the chromatin-immunoprecipitated genomic DNA, one-tenth of the DNA was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-GGAAGCCTTTCCCGACAAAAA (bp −195 −175 bp) and reverse primer 5′-GAGGCATGGGCGTGGCGAGCGC (bp +22 to +1) relative to the transcription start. Ten cycles of PCR at 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s were followed by 25 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. As a negative control, PCR was performed to amplify the human glucose transporter 2 promoter (GLUT2) with no apparent FBI-1 binding site using a primer set: forward, 5′-TCCTAGTGGAACAAAGGTAT (bp +48 to +67); reverse, 5′-GGGAGTCCTGTCAATTCCAG (bp +282 to +301) (39Cha J.Y.

The PCR cycling conditions were the same as described above. To investigate Sp1-POZ domain interactions, mouse liver nuclear extract (250 μg) and various GST-POZ domains agarose (2 μg) were incubated in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 6 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, protein complexes were resolved by 10 or 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-Sp1 antibody and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To map the interacting domain of Sp1, 2 μg each of various Sp1 polypeptides tagged with FLAG were incubated with various GST-POZ domains agarose (2 μg) in binding buffer overnight at 4 °C and analyzed by Western blotting as described above using anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak). To fine map the Sp1 domain involved in the interaction with the POZ domain, GST-Sp1 polypeptide-agarose (2 μg each of aa 622–788, 622–720, and 695–788) was incubated with His-tagged POZ domain polypeptide (aa 1–130) of FBI-1 (10 μg) in binding buffer and analyzed as described above using anti-His antibody (Qiagen). African green monkey kidney cells (CV-1) were cultured on six-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). At 50–60% confluence, the cells were transfected with a mixture of 0.6 μg of pCAT-ADH5, and expression plasmids encoding FBI-1 (0.4 μg) or its deletion mutant forms were introduced into the cells using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured for 40 h. The cell extracts representing the same quantity of protein were assayed for reporter CAT activity. Data are presented as relative CAT activity compared with the control and are the average of four independent assays. To analyze the inhibition of Sp1 activity by the Gal4-POZ domain fusions, a mixture of the reporter plasmids, pG5-luciferase or pG5-Sp1-AdML-luciferase (0.3 μg, Promega, WI), various Gal4 POZ domain fusion expression vectors (0.3 μg, pGal4-FBI-POZ or pGal4-Plzf-POZ, pGal4-Bcl6-POZ), and the control vector pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.1 μg) were cotransfected into CV-1 cells and assayed as described above. Cell extracts representing the same β-galactosidase activity were assayed for reporter luciferase activity. Data are presented as relative luciferase activity compared with the control and are the average of three independent assays. Sp1 (0.25 footprint unit) was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with bovine serum albumin, FBI-1, and the POZ domain of FBI-1 (300 ng of FBI-1 or molar equivalents of the other).32P-labeled ADH51FDH promoter probe was mixed with a preincubated mixture containing Sp1 and incubated further for 15 min at room temperature. The mixtures were digested with DNase I as previously described (25Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol.

In a yeast one-hybrid screen for factors that bind to the cis-acting element located between bp −38 and −22 of the humanADH5/FDH promoter, six cDNAs that encode a human POZ domain, Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor were isolated. The cDNA encodes a 584-amino acid polypeptide that is identical to FBI-1 (GenBankTM number NM-015898), a potential human immunodeficiency virus-1 transcription regulator (40Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cDNA is very rich in GC bases (71% in the coding sequence) and forms a CpG island (CpG/GpC ratio = 0.96). FBI-1 is nearly identical to TIP21 (transcription termination factor-I-interacting peptide 21;AF000561), which extends further to the N terminus. FBI-1 is the human ortholog of murine Lrf (leukemia/lymphoma-rrelated factor) and rat OCZF (osteoclast-derived zinc finger protein), with perfect matches in three functionally important domains (Fig.1): the N-terminal POZ domain (aa 1–130), four Cys2-His2 zinc fingers (aa 381–493), and a nuclear localization sequence (aa 494–507; CXXVXXRXXRKXXX) (41Davies J.M.

Western blot analysis using anti FBI-1 antibody shows that mLRF, a mouse homologue of FBI-1, is expressed ubiquitously in various mouse tissues (data not shown) and is in line with ubiquitous expression of mLRF mRNA (41Davies J.M. Hawe N. Kabarowski J. Huang Q.H. Zhu J. Brand N.J. Leprince D. Dhordain P. Cook M. Morriss-Kay G. Zelent A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thein vitro translated FBI-1 polypeptide binds specifically to the C-2 probe (bp −38 to −22) used as a one-hybrid bait and the C-1 probe (bp −38 to −1 bp) (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 1,3, and 6), and the retarded bands (a) are supershifted by the antibody raised against the POZ domain of FBI-1 (b in Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4, and 7). The excess cold C-1 probe competes successfully, but the excess cold B probe (bp −2 to +22) of the ADH5/FDH, Sp1, NFY, and HNF3 consensus oligonucleotide probes does not compete for binding (Fig.2B, compare lane 8 withlanes 9–12). The C-2 site occupied by the FBI-1 is immediately upstream of the two strong core cis-acting elements (bp −22 to +22) that bind Sp1 and are critical in theADH5/FDH transcription (25Hur M.-W.

After cross-linking of the chromatin with protein using formaldehyde, sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with purified polyclonal anti-FBI-1 antibody and Sepharose A. PCR amplifications of unsheared input genomic DNA and anti-FBI-1 antibody-mediated immunoprecipitant gave PCR products of the expected size (217 bp), but the same reaction with preimmune serum-mediated precipitant did not give amplified product (Fig.3, B and C).

The large and discontinuous genomes of eukaryotes require a large number of origins that are distributed throughout the genome to guarantee a complete replication within the limited time of the S phase in a cell division cycle (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bielinsky A.K.

The best characterized eukaryotic origins are those of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae because they function as sites of replication initiation in extrachromosomal plasmid DNA and are, therefore, amenable to detailed molecular analyses (10Brewer B.J.

DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 873-914Google Scholar). Prototypic budding yeast origin (autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs)1) are composed of 100–200 base pairs and contain several essential sequence elements including a domain A with the AT-rich ARS consensus sequence and three short stimulatory elements, B1-B3, which are functionally important but divergent in sequence (12Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The ARS consensus sequence and the adjacent B1 domain element constitute a binding site for proteins of the origin recognition complex (ORC), whereas the B3 domain element forms a binding site for the transcription factor Abf1 in some, but not all yeast origins (13Diffley J.F. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ORC is a multimeric protein complex composed of six essential subunits (Orc1p-Orc6p) that associate in an ATP-dependent manner with ARSs (13Diffley J.F. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 15Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The major known function of ORC appears to be the recruitment of factors such as Cdc6, Mcm proteins, and others for the formation of functional pre-replication complexes (16Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 17Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A.

Therefore, biochemical procedures such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (20Gencheva M. Anachkova B. Russev G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2608-2614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21DePamphilis M.L. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were established to determine the sites where bidirectional genome replication initiates. Using these experimental strategies, a small number of mammalian origins have been identified. One major conclusion of these experiments is that, whereas the replication of genomes in differentiated mammalian and other metazoan cells begins at specific genomic loci that are quite stably inherited from one cell division cycle to the next, individual origins of a given organism differ greatly in size and sequence and are clearly less uniform and more complex in structure than budding yeast origins (3DePamphilis M.L.

Many known mammalian origins are found to be located between transcribed regions and frequently in the vicinity of active transcriptional start sites (25Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Ramchandani S.

One reason for a preferred location of origins at transcriptional start sites might be the more loosely organized chromatin structure, allowing initiator replication proteins better access to their target DNA binding sites (for a recent review, see Ref. 29Mechali M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been shown by footprinting analyses that the well studied lamin B2 origin is protected in a cell cycle-specific manner; however, it has not been directly demonstrated whether these or related sequence elements in differentiated metazoan cells are binding sites for ORC (30Abdurashidova G. Riva S. Biamonti G. Giacca M. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Dimitrova D.S. Giacca M. Demarchi F. Biamonti G. Riva S. Falaschi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A Drosophila melanogaster ORC localizes in vivoto the chorion gene amplification control element, which is active in ovarian follicle cells and determines the amplification of chorion gene clusters by repeatedly initiating DNA replication (32Austin R.J. Orr-Weaver T.L. Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2639-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, amplification control element-bound ORC is in close contact with transcription factor E2F, which together with the Rb protein, regulates the initiation of replication (33Bosco G., Du, W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). An ORC binding site has also been identified in the Epstein-Barr virus genome. The 165-kbp viral chromosome replicates as an episome in latently infected human cells in a regulated once-per-cell cycle manner dependent upon a functional bipartite viral origin. This origin binds the viral initiator protein, EBNA-1, in addition to proteins of the human ORC, which appear to be essential for viral genome replication (34Chaudhuri B., Xu, H. Todorov I. Dutta A. Yates J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10085-10089Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 35Schepers A. Ritzi M. Bousset K. Kremmer E. Yates J.L. Harwood J. Diffley J.F. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4588-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Using a modified version of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol in combination with quantitative real-time PCR, we have recently identified an ORC binding site between two divergently transcribed human genes in a region that coincides with a start site for bidirectional DNA synthesis (36Ladenburger E.-M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have now used the ChIP technique to investigate another transcription unit in the human genome, the TOP1 gene, which occupies ∼100 kbp of the chromosome 20 sequence (37Kunze N. Yang G.C. Dolberg M. Sundarp R. Knippers R. Richter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9610-9616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TOP1 gene promoter co-localizes with a CpG island and contains an A+T-rich element (38Kunze N. Klein M. Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the gene has two well characterized matrix attachment regions (MARs; Ref. 39Romig H. Ruff J. Fackelmayer F.O. Patil M.S. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MARs are believed to connect chromatin loops to the non-chromatin ribonucleoprotein network known as the nuclear matrix (recently reviewed in Ref. 40Nickerson J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 463-474PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports suggested that sites of DNA synthesis may be linked to the nuclear matrix (41Hozak P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 42Zink D. Bornfleth H. Visser A. Cremer C. Cremer T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, TOP1 offers an interesting opportunity to determine whether MARs are binding sites for ORC proteins and whether they function as replication origins. We have also used the ChIP assay to isolate and clone DNA sequences from immunoprecipitated ORC protein-bearing chromatin fragments and identified ORC binding regions in heterochromatic parts of the human genome. Asynchronous HeLa-S3 cells were cultivated on 145-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Formaldehyde (Merck) was diluted to 1% in prewarmed medium (37 °C) and added to monolayers of 108cells for 4 min if not otherwise indicated. After removal of the medium, cells were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped off, washed twice in PBS and resuspended in hypotonic RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, pH 8.0) for 10 min on ice. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 600 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization (15 strikes). After centrifugation, nuclear material was washed twice in RSB buffer and once in high salt SNSB buffer (1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, pH 8.0) and subsequently incubated on ice for 5 min. Finally, the nuclear material was resuspended at physiological salt concentration in NSB buffer (0.1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, pH 8.0) and loaded onto gradients consisting of 1.3, 1.5, and 1.75 mg/ml CsCl diluted in gradient buffer (0.5% sarcosyl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Ultracentrifugation was carried out at 37,000 rpm for 24 h at 18 °C. The nucleoprotein fraction was collected from the gradients followed by overnight dialysis against Tris-EDTA (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 10 mm sodium bisulfite, pH 8. Nucleoprotein complexes were sonicated by a total number of 100 short pulses on ice. The concentration of nucleoproteins was determined (A260) and adjusted to 2 μg/μl with Tris-EDTA buffer. Nucleoprotein fragments <1 kb were obtained by treatment with micrococcal nuclease (MBI Fermentas) at 10 units/mg of nucleoprotein in the presence of 3 mm CaCl2for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 20 mm EDTA and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 1 mg of nucleoprotein in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Affinity-purified antibodies were added at 15 μg (α-ORC1, IgG) and 10 μg (α-ORC2, α-SP1, α-p60/CAF-1) followed by 2-h incubation at 20 °C on a rolling platform. Immunocomplexes were collected by adding 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose and further incubated for 2 h. Coupled protein A-Sepharose beads were washed 8× with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), 3× in LiCl2washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mmLiCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), and 5× in Tris-EDTA buffer. All buffers were supplemented with 10 mm sodium bisulfite, pH 8.0, as protease inhibitor. Beads were transferred to fresh tubes after each buffer change to reduce contamination of unspecific DNA sticking to the tube walls. The washed beads were divided for protein and DNA extraction, respectively. For Western blotting experiments, proteins were eluted with 2% SDS, H2O for 10 min at 37 °C. For a reversal of cross-links, nucleoproteins were incubated for 30 min at 65 °C and extracted with methanol/chloroform (43Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar). Input and supernatant samples were treated accordingly. Proteins were separated by SDS page, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and treated with specific antibodies. Antibodies against human ORC1 and ORC2 have already been described (44Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies against human ORC3-ORC6 were raised in rabbits using the N-terminal part of the ORC3 protein and the full-length ORC4 protein recombinant expressed in bacteria. Human ORC5 and ORC6 were expressed full-length in insect cells. Antibodies were characterized by immunoblotting using recombinant expressed proteins. To minimize the signal to noise ratio in the PCR, further extensive washing of the coupled protein A-Sepharose beads was crucial. Therefore, the whole washing procedure was repeated as described above. Finally, nucleoproteins were eluted with 1% SDS, Tris-EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min, and proteins were digested with 200 μg/ml proteinase K overnight at 37 °C. DNA was extracted by the standard phenol-chloroform procedure, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 40 μl of Tris-EDTA. Precipitated and extracted DNA was amplified by ligation-mediated-PCR (see Mueller and Wold (45Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar)) using two overlapping linker oligonucleotides (5 pmol/μl/oligonucleotide) 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′, which were first annealed to double-stranded DNA by stepwise cooling from 90 °C. For blunt-end ligation, purified DNA fragments were first exposed to the exonuclease activity of the Klenow enzyme (2 units, 5 min, 37 °C). DNA synthesis reactions were started by adding a nucleotide mix (2.5 mmol each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP) and further incubated for 30 min. The Klenow enzyme was inactivated at 70 °C for 20 min. DNA fragments were dephosphorylated with 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h. Linker ligations were performed at 18 °C for 15 h using 1 unit of T4-DNA ligase and 2 μl of the double-stranded linker oligonucleotides. PCR reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mm each dideoxynucleotide, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 3 units of Pfu DNA polymerase, 6% glycerol, and 25 pmol of each oligonucleotide. The PCR was performed in a thermocycler at 30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 63 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. Amplified DNA fragments were directly cloned in the pCR-BluntII-TOPO cloning system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Plasmid DNA was extracted from bacteria, purified, and analyzed by sequencing and PCR methods. Approximately 1 × 108 HeLa S3 cells were trypsinized and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once in RBS (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2). Centrifugations were carried out at 600 ×g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in RBS on ice at about 5 × 106 cells/ml for 5 min. The same volume of 1% Nonidet P-40, RBS was added, and cells were further incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted, washed twice in RBS, and resuspended at 5 × 107 nuclei/ml. The same volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 500 μg/ml proteinase K) was added and incubated overnight at 56 °C. Total genomic DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, and dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer at 2 μg/μl. DNA was denatured at 85 °C for 10 min followed by rapid cooling on ice and loaded on 5–30% (w/v) linear neutral sucrose gradients in Tris-EDTA buffer (plus 0.1 m NaCl). In a parallel tube, double-stranded size marker DNA (1-kb latter, MBI Fermentas) was loaded as a reference. Gradients were centrifuged at 20 °C in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 20 h at 26,000 rpm. Fractions of 1 ml were collected from top to bottom. The distribution of size markers in the gradient fractions was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fractions corresponding to an average of 1-kb size (nascent DNA strands) and 2–10 kb were collected and precipitated with ethanol. The abundance of nascent DNA strands in the preparation was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed with the Light Cycler instrument (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a ready-to-use “hot start” reaction mix. The mix containsTaq DNA polymerase and a fluorescent dye, SYBR Green I, for real-time detection of double-stranded DNA. Reactions were set up in 10 μl including 0.5 mm each primer. PCR reactions were performed at 50 cycles routinely, using the standard settings recommended by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Annealing temperatures of individual primers are indicated in Table I. Standard DNA samples (human genomic DNA) were serially diluted to 30 ng, 3 ng, 300 pg, 30 pg, and 3 pg. After PCR, the x axis crossing point of each standard sample was plotted against the logarithm of concentration to produce a standard curve. Genomic equivalents of DNA samples were determined by extrapolation from the standard curve (36Ladenburger E.-M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Table IOligonucleotides used for quantitative real-time PCR assays Covalent cross-linking of chromatin proteins to DNAin vivo, and the isolation of cross-linked chromatin was performed as described (46Crane-Robinson C. Myers F.A. Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47Orlando V. Trends Biochem.

Isolated chromatin was sonicated and further trimmed by micrococcal nuclease to produce fragments with DNA of 0.2–1-kbp lengths (Fig.1A). Chromatin fragments were either directly prepared for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (input, Fig. 1) or first immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies (precipitate, Fig. 1) and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots showed that a cross-linking time of 4 min was sufficient to covalently link hOrc2p to DNA (44Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This was also an optimal cross-linking time for other proteins such as the chromatin-associated fraction of the single strand-specific DNA-binding protein RPA and the scaffold attachment factor scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), an abundant nuclear protein that is bound to MAR elements in vivo (Ref. 49Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Fig. 1B, input). Orc2-specific antibodies efficiently precipitated chromatin fragments with covalently bound hOrc2p, but these precipitates contained little if any RPA and no detectable SAF-A (Fig. 1B, precipitate), indicating that hOrc2p and SAF-A were not cross-linked to the same chromatin fragments and, therefore, do most probably not reside at closely adjacent chromatin sites in vivo. Fig. 1C shows the cross-linking to DNA of other nuclear proteins such as the p60 subunit of the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 (50Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and transcription factor Sp1 (51Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations with Orc2-specific antibodies indicate that the p60 subunit was not present in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, a fraction of transcription factor Sp1 always co-precipitated with hOrc2p-bearing chromatin (Fig. 1C), probably indicating that Sp1 and hOrc2p were occasionally cross-linked to the same chromatin fragments (see below). Vashee et al. (53Vashee S. Simancek P. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Dhar et al. (52Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) show that human ORCs including subunits Orc1p-Orc5p can be extracted at high salt from HeLa cell chromatin and that human proteins Orc2p-Orc5p form a core complex to which proteins hOrc1p and hOrc6p are more loosely bound. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether the other ORC proteins could be immunoprecipitated together with hOrc2p by Orc2-specific antibodies. We first determined whether the six ORC proteins in asynchronously proliferating human cells could be identified by the available antibodies. For that purpose, HeLa cells were fractionated to yield cytosol (Cy), soluble nuclear proteins (Nu), and chromatin, which was treated with increasing salt (Fig.2A). The six ORC proteins were detected on chromatin and could be mobilized with 0.1–0.25m NaCl. However, a fraction of hOrc1p appeared to be more stably bound to chromatin since higher salt concentrations were required for an efficient elution. We also detected significant amounts of hOrc6p in soluble protein fractions (Fig. 2A). Next we investigated whether the ORC subunits could be cross-linked to DNA. On isolated chromatin we detected significant amounts of subunits hOrc1p (Fig. 1) as well as hOrc2p–hOrc5p but reduced amounts of hOrc6p (Fig. 2B, input), which is in agreement with published data, suggesting that hOrc6p may not be a regular component of human ORC (52Dhar S.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cross-linked chromatin was then immunoprecipitated with Orc2p-specific antibodies. The precipitates clearly contained hOrc1 as well as hOrc2p–hOrc4p (Fig. 2B) but very little, if any, hOrc6p (Fig. 2B). The Orc5p band overlapped to a significant extent with the IgG heavy chain band in the experiment. However, in independent experiment we clearly detected an Orc5p band in the immunoprecipitate. Comparing the input and supernatant, we estimate that between 30 and 50% of the cross-linked input sample could be immunoprecipitated. No ORC proteins were precipitated with unspecific IgGs (Fig. 2B) or with p60-specific antibodies (not shown). We have also tested antibodies against Orc3p, Orc4p, and Orc5p and found that the antibodies did not efficiently precipitate cross-linked proteins (not shown). Therefore, we used the Orc1p- and Orc2p-specific antibodies for the experiments reported below. Thus, ORC proteins could be covalently linked to chromatin and most likely occurred at the same chromatin sites either as one large complex or, alternatively, as subcomplexes. Next we addressed the question of whether ORC binds to particular genomic regions. The well characterized TOP1 gene locus appeared to be a interesting region because it contains several features that have frequently been found in known origins such as A+T-rich elements, MARs, nuclease hypersensitive sites, and a higher than average G+C content in the gene promoter. The TOP1 gene is composed of 21 exons (37Kunze N. Yang G.C. Dolberg M. Sundarp R. Knippers R. Richter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9610-9616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contains MAR I, located at an intronic site immediately after exon 2, and MAR II, which occurs further downstream, between exons 13 and 14 (Ref. 39Romig H. Ruff J. Fackelmayer F.O. Patil M.S. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Fig.3). MAR I and MAR II specifically attach to components of the nuclear matrix and exhibit specific binding sites for the SAF-A both in vitro and in vivo (39Romig H. Ruff J. Fackelmayer F.O. Patil M.S. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,49Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The TOP1 promoter is composed of several elements that function as binding sites for transcription factors including the ubiquitous Sp1 protein (54Heiland S. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6623-6631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter has a G+C content of 67% and co-localizes with a CpG island. This is of interest because it is assumed that origins of DNA replications are predominantly located in the vicinity of CpG islands (55Antequera F. Bird A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google"
https://openalex.org/W2007729873,"The rabbit reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase is capable of oxygenating biomembranes and lipoproteins without the preceding action of ester lipid cleaving enzymes. This reaction requires an efficient membrane binding, and the N-terminal β-barrel domain of the enzyme has been implicated in this process. To obtain detailed information on the structural requirements for membrane oxygenation, we expressed the rabbit wild-type 15-lipoxygenase, its β-barrel deletion mutant (catalytic domain), and several lipoxygenase point mutations as His-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and tested their membrane binding characteristics. We found that: (i) the β-barrel deletion mutant was catalytically active and its enzymatic properties (KM,Vmax, pH optimum, substrate specificity) were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme; (ii) when compared with the wild-type lipoxygenase, the membrane binding properties of the N-terminal truncation mutant were impaired but not abolished, suggesting a role of the catalytic domain in membrane binding; and (iii) Phe-70 and Leu-71 (constituents of the β-barrel domain) but also Trp-181, which is located in the catalytic domain, were identified as sequence determinants for membrane binding. Mutation of these amino acids to more polar residues (F70H, L71K, W181E) impaired the membrane binding capacity of the recombinant enzyme. These data indicate that the C-terminal catalytic domain of the rabbit 15-lipoxygenase is enzymatically active and that the membrane binding properties of the enzyme are determined by a concerted action of the N-terminal β-barrel and the C-terminal catalytic domain.

Plant and mammalian LOXs constitute single polypeptide chains that are folded into a two-domain structure (4Boyington J.C. Gaffney BJ Amzel L, M.

The large C-terminal domain may be considered as catalytic subunit because it contains the catalytically active non-heme iron and the substrate-binding cavity. In contrast, the function of the N-terminal β-barrel domain has been elusive for several years. From the structural point of view, there is no obvious reason to believe that the N-terminal domain may interfere with the catalytic process except for modifying its efficiency. On the other hand, truncation studies on two mammalian LOX species revealed a loss of enzyme functionality when the N-terminal β-barrel domain was deleted completely or in part (8Chen X.S. Funk C.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37345-37350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent proteolysis studies in which the N-terminal β-barrel domain of the soybean-LOX-1 was cleaved off by limited trypsinization led to a catalytically active mini-enzyme (10Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van-Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F. Finazzi-Agro A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of this truncated enzyme species were similar to those of the native LOX, indicating that the N-terminal domain may not be essential for the oxygenation of free polyenoic fatty acids and for membrane binding. In cellular systems LOX isoforms are localized in different compartments. Mammalian 15-LOXs are cytosolic enzymes that translocate to various types of intracellular membranes following cell activation (11Watson A. Doherty F.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kühn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian 5-LOXs show a more complex distribution pattern (13Peters-Golden M. Broc k T.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 227-231Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In resting cells they are located either in the cytosol (14Pueringer R.J. Bahns C.C. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L454-L458PubMed Google Scholar) or in the nucleus (15Brock T.G. Paine R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell stimulation that leads to an increased cytosolic calcium concentration induces translocation of the enzyme to the nuclear envelope (16Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), where it complexes with other constituents of the leukotriene synthesizing cascade (17Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J..Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Experiments with detergent-solubilized inclusion bodies containing a fusion protein that consists of the human 5-LOX N-terminal β-barrel domain and the glutathione S-transferase suggested that the β-barrel domain is capable of binding calcium and, thus, may be important for calcium-dependent membrane association (18Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When cells transfected with a green fluorescence protein construct containing the 5-LOX β-barrel domain were stimulated with calcium ionophore, a strong fluorescence signal was observed at the nuclear envelope. Thus, the 5-LOX β-barrel domain may drive the calcium-dependent membrane association observed in vivo (19Chen X.S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine the structural determinants for the translocation process, molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the human 5-LOX. These studies revealed that the first 130 amino acids might form a calcium-binding C2 domain (20Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which is a structural motif that has been identified before in many proteins involved in membrane trafficking and transmembrane signaling (21Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 4: 2375-2390Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 22Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

In addition the 5-LOX C2-domain contains three solvent-exposed tryptophans (Trp-13, Trp-75, Trp-102) that have been implicated in membrane binding (20Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the human 5-LOX effectively binds to biomembranes in the presence of calcium, it does not oxygenate polyenoic fatty acids esterified to the membrane lipids. In contrast, the reticulocyte-type 15-LOXs are capable of oxygenating complex ester lipids (24Murray J.J. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Belkner J. Wiesner R. Kühn H. Lankin V.Z.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30067-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact, the oxygenation of membrane lipids was implicated in membrane degradation and/or remodeling during erythropoiesis (30Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Thiele BJ. Harris J.R. Blood Cell Biochemistry. 1. Plenum Press, New York1990: 151-194Google Scholar, 31van Leyen K. Duvoisin R.M. Engelhardt H. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and LOX-induced oxidation of low density lipoprotein was suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (32Cathcart M.K. Folcik V.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1726-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As 5-LOXs the mammalian 15-LOXs are capable of binding to biomembranes in the presence of micromolar calcium concentrations, and this membrane translocation can be reversed by calcium removal (12Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kühn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the 5-LOXs that preferentially translocate to the nuclear envelope, the reticulocyte-type 15-LOX associates with different types of biomembranes (endoplasmic membranes, mitochondrial membranes) and this membrane binding does not require a special docking protein (33Kühn H. Belkner J. Wiesner R. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 18351-18361Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The x-ray coordinates of the rabbit 15-LOX suggested structural similarities of the N-terminal LOX domain with a C-terminal β-barrel of mammalian lipases (6Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Because this lipase domain was implicated in membrane association (34Winkler F.W. D'Arcy A. Hunzicker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), a similar function has been proposed for the N-terminal β-barrel domains of mammalian 15-LOXs, but for the time being there are no experimental data supporting this hypothesis. To study the significance of the N-terminal β-barrel domain of the rabbit 15-LOX for fatty acid oxygenation and membrane binding, we expressed the native enzyme and its β-barrel truncation mutant as His-tagged fusion proteins and tested the purified enzyme species in membrane binding and activity assays. The results obtained indicate that the N-terminal β-barrel domain is not essential for fatty acid oxygenation but contains at least two sequence determinants for membrane binding (Phe-70, Leu-71). In addition, mutagenesis studies identified a further membrane binding determinant (Trp-181) that, in contrast to Phe-70 and Leu-71, is located at the surface of the catalytic domain. The chemicals used were from the following sources: (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid (arachidonic acid), (9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid (linoleic acid), EDTA, imidazole, and sodium borohydride from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); ampicillin from Invitrogen (Eggenstein, Germany); kanamycin, glycerol, DTT (dithiothreitol), trichloroacetic acid, and sucrose from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany); (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid (α-linolenic acid), (6Z,9Z,12Z)-octadeca-6,9,12-trienoic acid (γ-linolenic acid), and HPLC reference compounds ((12S,5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-12-hydroxy-5,8,10, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE), (15S,5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15S-HETE), (13S,9Z,11E)-13-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid (13S-HODE)) from Cayman Chemical Co. (distributed by Alexis GmbH, Grünberg, Germany); and HPLC solvents from Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Phage T4 ligase,Pwo polymerase, and sequencing kits were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), and the Escherichia coli strain M15[prep4] was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Oligonucleotide synthesis was carried out by TiB-Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). The recombinant wild-type 15-LOX and the various mutants were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged fusion proteins. For this purpose the 15-LOX cDNA was cloned into the pQE-9 expression plasmid (Qiagen) between the SalI and HindIII restriction sites. Bacteria were transformed with the recombinant plasmids, and, routinely, 3 liters of LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter kanamycin were inoculated with a 15-ml overnight preculture. The bacteria were allowed to grow at 37 °C for 16 h, and then expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration). The cultures were kept for additional 2 h at 30 °C, and then the bacteria were pelleted, washed (PBS), and resuspended in 30 ml of PBS. Cells were disrupted by sonication with a Labsonic U tip-sonifier on ice (Braun, Melsungen, Germany), and the debris was spun down. The clear lysis supernatant was applied to a 0.5-ml nickel-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and the adherent proteins were removed rinsing the column with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mmNaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Five 0.25-ml fractions were collected, and the LOX activity was assayed in each of them. Routinely, more than 90% of the activity was recovered in fractions 2–4. These fractions were pooled, diluted 1:50 with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (gel bed volume, 250 μl; Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) for further purification by anion exchange chromatography. After loading the column was washed twice with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and then the enzyme was eluted with 100 mm KCl dissolved in the same buffer. Fractions of 0.125 ml were collected, activity was assayed, and the active fractions were pooled. For storage the enzyme preparation was supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. Starting from a 3-liter culture, this procedure yielded approximately 1 mg of electrophoretically pure protein. Site directed mutagenesis was performed by the PCR-overlap extension technique using mismatching synthetic oligonucleotides. The PCR products containing the nucleotide exchanges were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into the pQE-9-expression plasmid containing the wild-type 15-LOX as His-tagged fusion protein. For each mutant, 10–20 clones were screened by restriction mapping and activity assays to identify LOX-positive clones, and all mutants were confirmed by sequencing. For deletion of the N-terminal β-barrel domain, a SalI restriction site was introduced in front of Cys-115 by PCR. The PCR fragment was digested with SalI and KpnI, ligated into the pQE-9 expression plasmid containing the wild-type 15-LOX, andE. coli (M15[prep4]) were transformed with this plasmid. This procedure led to a N-terminal truncation mutant that lacked the first 114 amino acids (β-barrel truncation mutant). Expression and purification of this truncation mutant was performed as described for the other mutants. In addition to this β-barrel truncation, further truncation mutants were created starting with the following amino acids: Gly-155, Glu-165, Phe-175, and Pro-197. The Pro-197 mutant lacked the entire helix 2 (6Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) that contains Trp-181 (see Fig. 7). Unfortunately, all these mutants turned out to be enzymatically inactive. The fatty acid oxygenase activity of the various enzyme species was assayed either spectrophotometrically measuring the increase in absorbance at 235 nm or by HPLC quantification of the oxygenation products. For the spectrophotometric measurements, the assay mixture consisted of a 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm fatty acid substrate. Before the reaction was started by enzyme addition, the mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold methanol, hydroperoxides formed were reduced to the more stable hydroxy compounds with sodium borohydride, and the sample was acidified to pH 3 (acetic acid). After removing the precipitate by centrifugation, aliquots of the clear supernatant were injected to RP-HPLC for product analysis. For calculation of the kinetic parameters (KM and Vmax), the substrate concentration was varied in the range of 5–50 μm. For Lineweaver-Burk analysis, the linear parts of the kinetic progress curves were used. To test the enzymatic activity of the mutants created, 5 ml of bacterial liquid cultures were grown and expression of the recombinant enzyme species was induced as described above. The bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and after cell lysis the homogenates were incubated with 0.1 mm arachidonic acid for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol, and hydroperoxy fatty acids formed were reduced with sodium borohydride. After acidification to pH 3, precipitates were spun down and aliquots were injected to RP-HPLC. To determine the membrane oxygenase capacity of wild-type and mutant 15-LOX species, we used beef heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) or dog pancreas EDTA-high salt-stripped rough microsomes (EKRM) as model membranes. For the measurements of the membrane oxygenase activity, the enzyme species were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mg of SMP protein. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of methanol, and hydroperoxides formed were reduced with sodium borohydride. Then 0.2 ml of 40% KOH were added, and the ester lipids were hydrolyzed at 60 °C for 30 min under argon atmosphere. The mixture was acidified to pH 3, precipitates were removed by centrifugation, and aliquots of the clear supernatant were injected to RP-HPLC for quantification of the lipid oxygenation products. In our standard membrane binding assay, 200 μg of SMP were incubated at room temperature with 2.5 μg of recombinant 15-LOX (wild-type or mutant enzyme species) in 50 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4 (total assay volume 25 μl). After a 5-min incubation period, the samples were underlaid with a 0.1-ml sucrose cushion (500 mm sucrose in the same buffer) and centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckmann tabletop centrifuge (4 °C). The pellet of this centrifugation step represented LOX-loaded SMPs. The supernatant was carefully removed and transferred to a separate tube, and ovalbumin was added to reach a final concentration of 60 μg/ml. The supernatant proteins were then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, reaching a final concentration of 10%, and the precipitate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant of the centrifugation step was discarded, and the two pellets (100,000 × g pellet and 20,000 × g pellet) were reconstituted in 25 μl of 2-fold concentrated electrophoresis loading buffer (0.58 msucrose, 280 mm Tris base, 211 mm Tris-HCl, 139 mm SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.44 mm Serva Blue G250, and 200 mm DTT). After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, aliquots (10 μl) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane by a semi-dry blotting technique and the blots were probed with a mouse anti-RGS-His tag antibody (Qiagen). As secondary antibody a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) was used. The blots were visualized by treating them with the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified densitometrically using the Phoretix 1D software package (Phoretix International, Newcastle, UK). HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu system connected to a Hewlett Packard diode array detector 1040A. Reverse phase-HPLC was carried out on a Nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel, KS system, 250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) coupled with an appropriate guard column (30 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size). For analysis of the hydroxylated fatty acids, a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (80/20/0.1, v/v/v) was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The chromatographic scale was calibrated for conjugated dienes by injecting known amounts of 15-HETE (5-point calibrations). The chromatogram was followed simultaneously at 235 nm (quantification of hydroxy fatty acids) and 210 nm (quantification of non-oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids). To judge the degree of membrane oxygenation, we calculated the hydroxy fatty acid/polyenoic fatty acid ratio (OH-FA/FA ratio), which relates the lipid oxygenation products to the parent fatty acids. Reference compounds (mixture of 15S-, 12S-, and 5S-HETE) were injected and chromatographed under our experimental conditions with retention times between 8 and 13 min. Straight phase-HPLC (SP-HPLC) was performed on a Zorbax-SIL column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size) using a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100/2/0.1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For enantiomer separation of 15-HETE and 13-HODE, chiral phase-HPLC was performed on a Chiralcel OD column (250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) with the solvent system n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100/5/0.1, v/v/v) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 9S-HODE(E,Z) and 13S-HODE(Z,E) were assigned by co-injections with authentic standards. The chemical identity of the all-E isomers was concluded from their UV spectra, which exhibited a maximal absorbance at 231 nm (theZ,E-diene chromophore of 13S- and 9S-HODE shows a λmax of 235 nm). Protein concentration was determined with the Roti-Quant detection system (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), which is based on the Bradford method. SMPs, which mainly constitute inside-out vesicles of the inner mitochondrial membrane, were prepared as described previously (35Crane F.L. Glenn J.L. Green D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The missing amino acids in the crystal structure of the rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX were modeled in using the Swiss-PdbViewer (www.expasy.ch/spdbv; Ref. 40Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar), followed by energy minimization of the side chains. The rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX consists of a N-terminal β-barrel domain with a molecular mass of approximately 12 kDa and a C-terminal catalytic domain of approximately 63 kDa. Both domains share a 1600-Å2 interface, and the C-terminal domain contains the catalytic non-heme iron and the entire substrate-binding pocket. These structural properties suggested that the C-terminal domain by its own may be catalytically active, but detailed truncation studies on mammalian LOXs (9Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37345-37350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) led to inactive enzyme species. To confirm these data and to test the relevance of the N-terminal β-barrel domain for membrane binding, we constructed His tag bacterial expression vectors for the wild-type rabbit 15-LOX and its β-barrel truncation mutant (C-terminal domain). The recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli were purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig.1) from bacterial lysis supernatants and tested in appropriate assay systems. Surprisingly, we found that the β-barrel truncation mutant was enzymatically active and converted arachidonic acid predominantly to (15S,5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-15-hydro(pero)xyeicosa-5,8,11,13-tetraenoic acid (15S-H(p)ETE). This product pattern was almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.2) and did not reveal major differences when compared with the native LOX (36Bryant R.W. Bailey J.M. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 257: 6050-6055Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, we observed some differences when we compared the substrate specificity and the kinetic properties of the β-barrel truncation mutant with the recombinant wild-type enzyme (see below). The progress curves of arachidonic acid oxygenation (Fig. 3) indicate two kinetic peculiarities of the β-barrel truncation mutant (C terminus), which were observed consistently in all measurements. (i) The β-barrel truncation mutant does not exhibit a kinetic lag phase, indicating that peroxide activation kinetics may be different. (ii) It rapidly loses activity during arachidonic acid oxygenation. Because the activity could not be restored by substrate addition, one may conclude that the mutant may undergo suicidal inactivation more rapidly than the wild-type enzyme. Comparison of the basic kinetic parameters indicated that the catalytic activity (Vmax) of the truncation mutant was approximately 5-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I), suggesting that the rate-limiting step of the catalytic process, the initial hydrogen abstraction, may be hindered. On the other hand, the comparable KM values suggested that substrate binding is only minimally impacted by truncation. These data and the highly specific product pattern of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid oxygenation suggest that the N-terminal β-barrel of mammalian 15-LOXs may not be of major importance for substrate binding if free fatty acids are offered as oxidizable substrates in the absence of biomembranes.Figure 2HPLC analysis of arachidonic acid oxygenation products. The wild-type rabbit 15-LOX and its β-barrel truncation mutant were expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Aliquots (2 μg of the wild-type enzyme and 10 μg of the truncation mutant) were assayed for fatty acid oxygenase activity in the standard photometric system (0.5-ml reaction volume, 100 μm substrate concentration). The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol, the hydroperoxy fatty acids formed were reduced with sodium borohydride, and aliquots were injected to RP-HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”). Inset, the 15-HETE peak in RP-HPLC was collected and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was reconstituted in hexane and analyzed for enantiomer composition by chiral phase HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”).

In this report, we show that the massive expression and activation of MMP-9 in skin tissue from patients with chronically unhealed wounds could be reconstituted in vitro with cultured normal human skin by stimulation with transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. We dissected the mechanistic pathway for TNF-α induced activation of pro-MMP-9 in human skin. We found that proteolytic activation of pro-MMP-9 was mediated by a tissue-associated chymotrypsin-like proteinase, designated here as pro-MMP-9 activator (pM9A). This unidentified activator specifically converted pro-MMP-9 but not pro-MMP-2, another member of the gelatinase family. The tissue-bound pM9A was steadily expressed and not regulated by TNF-α, which indicated that the cytokine-mediated activation of pro-MMP-9 might be regulated at the inhibitor level. Indeed, the skin constantly secreted tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 at the basal state. TNF-α, but not transforming growth factor-β, down-regulated this inhibitor. The TNF-α-mediated activation of pro-MMP-9 was tightly associated with down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in a dose-dependent manner. To establish this linkage, we demonstrate that the recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 could block the activation of pro-MMP-9 by either the intact skin or skin fractions. Thus, these studies suggest a novel regulation for the proteolytic activation of MMP-9 in human tissue, which is mediated by tissue-bound activator and controlled by down-regulation of a specific inhibitor.

Within the MMP family, MMP-9 (gelatinase B; EC3.4.24.35) is particularly important, because it has a documented role in many human diseases. Like most MMPs, MMP-9 is secreted as a latent zymogen that is maintained by the interaction between a cysteine in the N-terminal pro-domain and the active-site zinc atom. Proteolytic cleavage of the pro-domain is a common control mechanism for MMP activation, which triggers a conformational change of the enzyme and is termed the “cysteine switch” (3Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The conversion of pro-MMP-9 with an apparent molecular mass of 92-kDa to the 82-kDa active MMP-9 has been commonly observed in the pathogenesis of many diseases (4Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Metastasis is a multistep process, including detachment of cancer cells from a primary site, invasion into surrounding tissue through breakdown matrix, spreading through circulation, and proliferation in distant organs. Breakdown of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) is necessary to allow malignant cells to migrate from the primary location. MMP-9 is not normally expressed in developed tissues, yet it is highly expressed in many cancers (5Sier C.F. Kubben F.J. Ganesh S. Heerding M.M. Griffioen G. Hanemaaijer R. van Krieken J.H.

Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 167-181PubMed Google Scholar). During the early phase of breast cancer, only pro-MMP-9 is increased. As the cancer stage increases, evidenced by skin invasion or lymphovascular permeation, active MMP-9 is found (8Rha S.Y. Kim J.H. Roh J.K. Lee K.S. Min J.S. Kim B.S. Chung H.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 43: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, sequential expression and activation of pro-MMP-9 has been observed in liver metastasis (9Zeng Z.S. Guillem J.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An interesting pattern of MMP-9 expression has also been documented in wound healing. In the normal repair of acute trauma or burn wound, pro-MMP-9 is transiently expressed and declines with the progress of healing (10Tarlton J.F. Vickery C.J. Leaper D.J. Bailey A.J. Br. J. Dermatol. 1997; 137: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Young P.K. Grinnell F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 660-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, persistent expression of a larger amount of MMP-9, especially the active 82-kDa MMP-9, has been repeatedly documented in chronic wounds (12Wysocki A.B. Staiano-Coico L. Grinnell F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 64-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wysocki A.B. Kusakabe A.O. Chang S. Tuan T.L.

Dermatol. 1996; 107: 743-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Given the proteolytic function of MMP-9 in the digestion of BMZ components such as type IV collagen, the pathogenesis of these diseases could be due to the activity of MMP-9. A critical unanswered question regarding MMP-associated disease pathogenesis is the identification of specific factors controlling the expression and activation of the proteinase. MMP activities are regulated at multiple levels from their expression to activation by cleavage of the inhibitory domain as well as blockage by tissue inhibitors. Although the proteolytic activation of MMP-9 has been well documented in many diseases, the mechanism for the proteolytic conversion is not established. In this report, we show for the first time that the increased expression and activation of MMP-9 found in patients with chronic wounds could be reconstituted in cultured normal human skin by treatment with specific cytokines. Furthermore, we found that activation of pro-MMP-9 was mediated by a tissue-associated chymotrypsin-like proteinase. The TNF-α-mediated activation of pro-MMP-9 is controlled by down-regulation of the MMP inhibitor, TIMP-1. These findings provide a novel model to explain the MMP-9 activation in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds and tumor metastasis through the action of specific proinflammatory cytokines. Cytokines were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies against TIMP-1 (MAB13437) and the purified recombinant TIMP-1 protein (CC3328) were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The antibody for mast cell chymase (MS-1217) was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Aprotinin,l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone-HCl (TLCK), and l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone (TPCK) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

ECL was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The gelatin was from Sigma. Gelatin-Sepharose 4B was purchased fromAmersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Normal human skin was obtained as discarded tissue from patients undergoing reconstructive or aesthetic surgery (University of Southern California Internal Review Board no. 999061). The full thickness skin was decontaminated by incubation in DMEM containing 2× antibiotic (200 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 200 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.5 mg/ml amphotericin B) at 4 °C overnight before all subsequent procedures. Then the skin was cut into squares of equal sizes with 0.5 cm in each side and incubated in DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6 h. To decrease the effects of endogenous soluble factors in the skin induced by the harvesting process, the medium was changed three times during the 6-h incubation. Finally, the explant was floated in 2 ml of DMEM with specific cytokines and was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from normal full thickness or partial thickness human skin (15Garner W.L. Karmiol S. Rodriguez J.L. Smith D.J., Jr. Phan S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tuan T.L. Keller L.C. Sun D. Nimni M.E. Cheung D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2285-2289PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated fibroblasts were cultivated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). The keratinocytes were cultivated with complete keratinocyte growth medium. Before exposure to cytokines, the medium was replaced with serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM for fibroblasts and keratinocyte basal medium for keratinocytes. The transformed human keratinocytes (kindly provided by Dr. David T. Woodley at USC) were grown in keratinocyte growth medium to confluence. The cells were treated by 2 ng/ml TNF-α in keratinocyte basal medium for 72 h in standard culture condition. In this condition, most of the gelatinase secreted in the medium is the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9. The conditioned medium from 20 10-cm dishes was collected and cleared by centrifugation at 4000 × g. The conditioned medium was then passed to a 5-ml gelatin-Sepharose 4B column followed by washing with 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5. The bound gelatinase was eluted by 6 m urea followed by dialysis against buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5. The identity of pro-MMP-9 was confirmed by Western blot with antibody against MMP-9 as reported previously (17Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Hughes M.W., Wu, H. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 273: 22341-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Human dermal fibroblasts were grown as monolayers in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate pro-MMP-2, the medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM. After culturing for 74 h, the conditioned medium was cleared by centrifugation. The gelatinase was purified by gelatin-Sepharose 4B as described above. In this preparation, most of the gelatinase is pro-MMP-2 (18Han Y.P. Tuan T.L., Wu, H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). The identity was confirmed by Western blot with antibody against MMP-2. 6-mm punch biopsies were taken from each patient at the site of an unhealed burn wound, healed wound, and normal skin (University of Southern California Internal Review Board no. 999061). The skin biopsies were briefly washed by phosphate-buffered saline and immersed in 0.5 ml of DMEM with proper antibiotics. The tissues were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 18 h. The conditioned medium and tissue were stored at −80 °C before assay. Bioactivity of TNF-α was determined as previously described (15Garner W.L. Karmiol S. Rodriguez J.L. Smith D.J., Jr. Phan S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Remick D.G. DeForge L.E. Sullivan J.F. Showell H.J. Immunol. Invest. 1992; 21: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The skin tissue was minced and ground in liquid nitrogen by a mechanic miller. The skin powder was washed by NT buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5. Then the tissue powder was extracted by 2.5% Triton X-100, 2 mNaCl, and 6 m urea, respectively. The extracts were subjected to dialysis against NT buffer, and the insoluble fractions were washed using the same buffer. For each assay, 80 μl of tissue extracts were incubated with 15 μl of pro-MMP-9 together with 5 μl of 100 mm CaCl2. The reaction was carried at 37 °C for 16 h followed by gelatinolytic zymogram analysis. For the inhibition experiments, 2.5 μl of inhibitors and 2.5 μl of 200 mm CaCl2 were added to the system before incubation. The conditioned medium was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of reducing agent and electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C with 120 V for 16 h. After electrophoresis, SDS in the gel was removed by incubation with 2.5% Triton X-100. Gelatinolytic activities were developed in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5 for 16 h at 37 °C. The gelatinolytic activities were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The conditioned medium or skin extracts were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE (15%). The protein was transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was exposed to antibodies against human TIMP-1 or mast cell chymase followed by blot with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, which were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Massive expression and activation of MMP-9 have been extensively reported in the tissue fluid of chronic wounds (12Wysocki A.B. Staiano-Coico L. Grinnell F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 64-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wysocki A.B. Kusakabe A.O. Chang S. Tuan T.L.

Dermatol. 1996; 107: 743-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To find the causal factors that induce expression and activation of MMP-9, we measured the gelatinase profile and cytokine concentration from the tissue of patients' unhealed wounds, and then we attempted to reconstitute the results in vitro by using cultured normal human skin. Here we show a typical gelatinase profile from a patient with a chronic wound. Biopsies from the unhealed wound, healed wound, and the surrounding normal skin were taken from a 19-year-old patient 60 days after partial graft loss during treatment for a thermal burn. The unhealed wound was a small area of graft loss (<2 cm2) that would normally be expected to heal within 2–3 weeks. The biopsies were immersed in DMEM with antibiotics and incubated at culture condition for 6 h. This short term culture was designed to allow the diffusion of the soluble factors produced by the tissue. The conditioned medium was resolved by a gelatinolytic zymogram. As shown in Fig.1, substantial gelatinase activities with apparent molecular masses of 92 and 82 kDa, representing the pro-MMP-9 and active MMP-9, respectively, were found. Conversely, little gelatinase activities were secreted from the normal skin and healed wound. To identify the potential factors that cause the expression and activation of MMPs in human skin, we initially tested a panel of cytokines that have been found elevated in chronic wounds and at metastatic tumor sites. Single or combinations of cytokines were added to normal human full thickness skin floating in DMEM (1 ng/ml for TGF-β and 10 ng/ml for the other cytokines). After culture for 64 h, the conditioned media were resolved by zymogram. As shown in Fig. 1, among this panel of cytokines only TGF-β induces the expression of 92-kDa pro-MMP-9, and only TNF-α promotes the formation of 82-kDa MMP-9. The TNF-α-mediated formation of 82-kDa MMP-9 is sequentially processed by induction of the 92-kDa form followed by conversion to the 82-kDa form (17Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Hughes M.W., Wu, H. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 273: 22341-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As expected, combination of TNF-α with TGF-β leads to greater expression and activation of MMP-9 than either factor alone. Other cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 (data not shown), were without effect alone or in combination. The identity of 92- and 82-kDa MMP-9 were confirmed by Western blot as demonstrated in our previous report (17Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Hughes M.W., Wu, H. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 273: 22341-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To confirm this result, we measured the cytokine levels produced by biopsies of chronically unhealed wound, healed wound, and normal skin tissues. In a comparison of unhealed, healed, and normal skin in nine patients, the TNF-α level was found to be significantly higher in chronic wound tissue (Fig. 1). The concentration of TNF-α found in chronic wound tissue (6 ± 2 ng/ml) is comparable with the cytokine concentration necessary to promote the proteolytic conversion of pro-MMP-9 in normal skin. Taken together, we identified TGF-β and TNF-α as causal factors for induction and activation of MMP-9, respectively in chronic wounds. These results indicate that the induction and activation of MMP-9 observed in chronic wounds and tumors are probably mediated through these cytokines. Initially, we thought that the TNF-α-mediated activation of pro-MMP-9 might be regulated through the increase of pM9A activity, perhaps through an increase in synthesis of pM9A. To address this question, we performed the following two experiments. In the first experiment, we examined whether pM9A activity was enhanced by cytokines. Normal human skin was stimulated with TNF-α and TGF-β individually or simultaneously. After culturing for 64 h, the conditioned medium and skin tissue were separated. The skin tissues were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and ground in liquid nitrogen. The tissue powder was then extracted by 2% Triton X-100 for 16 h, and the resulting insoluble fractions were further washed to remove the detergent. To assay pM9A activities, purified pro-MMP-9 was incubated with the skin fractions for 16 h followed by zymogram analysis. As shown in Fig.2A, 92-kDa pro-MMP-9 was converted to the 82-kDa form by the tissue fractions under all conditions. Notably, TNF-α did not increase the pM9A activity. We also tested whether pM9A activity was secreted into the conditioned medium. We measured the pM9A activities in the original conditioned medium as well as the conditioned medium that had been depleted of gelatinase in order to lower the background. In the untreated conditioned media, there was cytokine-induced MMP-9 that came from the organ culture, and the exogenous added pro-MMP-9 was not converted (Fig. 2B). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2C, the added pro-MMP-9 failed to be converted into the 82-kDa form in the depleted conditioned media. Thus, either the tissue-bound pM9A is not secreted or there is a specific inhibitor that is also secreted with the activator. Because the organ culture technique utilized in our experiments might lead to the expression of pM9A, we performed a time course experiment. Normal human skin was cut into small pieces. Some were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, as day 0 samples. Other pieces were cultured in DMEM for 24 and 72 h. Then the skin tissues were ground, followed by Triton X-100 extraction. Purified pro-MMP-9 was added to these tissue fractions for pM9A assay. The data show that the tissue-associated pM9A activity is clearly detectable in the day 0 sample and increased slightly during the subsequent 3-day culturing (Fig. 3A). We then asked whether de novo protein synthesis in the skin was required for the expression of pM9A. Normal human skin was cultured in DMEM with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (40 μg/ml). Then skin tissue was extracted with Triton X-100, and the insoluble fractions were assayed for pM9A activities by incubation with purified pro-MMP-9. The reaction was resolved by zymogram (Fig. 3B). The results show that cycloheximide treatment decreases the pM9A activities in the skin tissue. Again, TNF-α did not alter the cycloheximide-induced inhibition. The remaining pM9A activities from the cycloheximide-treated skin were probably derived from the skin prior to the treatment. Thus, pM9A is constitutively synthesized in skin, and its level is not regulated by TNF-α. We then characterized this unidentified proteinase by its sensitivity to various proteinase inhibitors. The Triton-insoluble fractions of human skin and purified pro-MMP-9 were incubated with pepstatin (aspartic proteinase inhibitor), aprotinin (serine proteinase inhibitor), and MMP-3 inhibitor II. The results show that aprotinin but not other inhibitors can block the skin tissue-mediated conversion of pro-MMP-9. This indicates that pM9A is a serine proteinase (Fig.4A). We further investigated the inhibition specificity of pM9A through a pair of serine proteinase inhibitors, TLCK, a specific inhibitor for trypsin-like proteinase and TPCK, a specific inhibitor for chymotrypsin-like proteinase. The results show that the tissue-associated pM9A activity is inhibited by TPCK at 50 μm and completely blocked by the inhibitor at 250 μm, which is within the normal concentration to block typical chymotrypsin (Fig. 4B). In contrast, TLCK has no inhibitory effect, even at 500 μm. Thus, the tissue-associated pM9A represents an as yet unidentified chymotrypsin-like proteinase. Our next aim was to extract pM9A from the skin tissue for identification. For this purpose, a serial extraction was performed. As shown previously, Triton X-100 was inefficient to extract the pM9A even at quite high concentration (17Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Hughes M.W., Wu, H. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 273: 22341-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We then tried salt extraction. The full thickness skin was ground in liquid nitrogen followed by extraction with either 2 mNaCl or 6 m urea. The extracts were subsequently dialyzed and assayed for pM9A activities by incubation with purified pro-MMP-9. As shown in Fig. 5A, 2m NaCl efficiently extracted pM9A activity, whereas urea at 6 m failed to do so. In analysis of the debris, 2m NaCl removed almost all pM9A activities, leaving no significant pro-MMP9-converting activity in the insoluble fraction. Conversely, most pM9A activity remained in the urea-insoluble fractions. In addition, the pM9A could also be extracted by SDS and retained its activity (data not shown). We conclude that the failure of extraction of pM9A by either urea or Triton X-100 was not due to denaturation or inactivation of pM9A but rather the incapability of these agents to dissociate the proteinase from the skin tissue. Mast cells play important roles in skin inflammation by secretion of histamine and proteinases, including a chymotrypsin-like proteinase, α-chymase. Whether α-chymase can convert pro-MMP-9 is a subject of debate. Mast cell α-chymase prepared from dog mastocytoma cells was shown to be unable to activate human pro-MMP-9 (20Lees M. Taylor D.J. Woolley D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas another group showed that the dog mast cell chymase could activate the dog pro-MMP-9 by cleaving at the Phe88-Gln89and Phe91-Glu92 (21Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25628-25635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To clarify whether the human skin mast α-chymase is pM9A, we compared the extraction behavior of α-chymase versus pM9A activities. Results show that NaCl at 2 m could extract pM9A activity but failed to extract the mast cell chymase as measured by Western blot (Fig.5B). Conversely, urea at 6 m failed to extract pM9A activity but could extract α-chymase. Thus, these two lines of evidence indicate that the mast cell α-chymase is not likely to be pM9A in human skin. Based on in vitro constitution experiments, MMP-3 has been previously suggested as a potential activator for pro-MMP-9 (22Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the mice with homozygous knockout of MMP-3 (MMP-3−/−), the activation of MMP-9 was found to be normal, which suggests an MMP-3-independent pathway (23Lijnen H.R. Silence J. Van Hoef B. Collen D. Blood. 1998; 91: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we examined whether TNF-α can regulate MMP-3. Normal human skin and primary dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were stimulated by TNF-α and TGF-β. After culture for 64 h, the conditioned medium was analyzed by zymogram for MMP-9 activation and Western blot for MMP-3 protein (Fig.6). As expected, the 92-kDa MMP-9 was induced by TGF-β, and the active 82-kDa was generated by TNF-α stimulation in human skin, whereas pro-MMP-9 was induced but no activation was observed in either dermal fibroblasts or epidermal keratinocytes. A small amount of MMP-3 was found expressed by human skin at basal state, and the protein level was significantly increased by TNF-α stimulation. Similarly, MMP-3 protein was induced by TNF-α in dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, where no activation of pro-MMP-9 was found. In addition, most of the MMP-3 is secreted as a soluble factor, whereas pM9A is tissue-bound. As shown in Fig.4A, the specific inhibitor for MMP-3 failed to inhibit the activation of pro-MMP-9. All of these results suggest that expression of MMP-3 is not sufficient to activate pro-MMP-9. The specificity of pM9A as an activator was determined by testing its ability to activate MMP-2, another member of the gelatinase family. Pro-MMP-2 activation is generally thought to be mediated through the membrane type MMP with the participation of TIMP-2 (24Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). We asked whether the tissue-associated pM9A could also activate pro-MMP-2. The Triton X-100-insoluble and NaCl-soluble fractions from normal human skin were incubated with purified pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9, respectively, and the products were resolved by zymogram. As shown, pro-MMP-9 but not the pro-MMP-2 is converted by the skin fractions (Fig. 7). Note that some 62-kDa active MMP-2 was derived from the original preparation, and that amount was not increased by incubation with the skin fractions, whereas most of the pro-MMP-9 was converted to the 82-kDa form. Therefore, pM9A is specific for pro-MMP-9 activation. As shown in Figs. 2 and3, pM9A activity is steadily expressed in human skin, and TNF-α seemingly has no additional regulatory effect on it. On the other hand, TNF-α can induce the conversion of pro-MMP-9. Since the activator was not regulated by TNF-α, we hypothesized that the regulation might be at the inhibitor level. An important hint came from the effects of TGF-β, as shown in Fig. 1. TGF-β induced expression of pro-MMP-9 in normal skin but has little effect on conversion of pro-MMP-9. However, the TGF-β-primed skin was capable of proteolytically processing the pro-MMP-9 once the soluble factors were removed (Fig. 2). This suggests that skin secrets a pM9A inhibitor and that TNF-α, but not TGF-β, may down-regulate it, resulting in the activation of pro-MMP-9. Initially, we considered TIMP-1, because it has been demonstrated that TIMP-1 can form a complex with pro-MMP-9 through their carboxyl terminus (25Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z.

Its endonuclease activity is essential and well suited to remove RNA-DNA primers of Okazaki fragments. In contrast, its helicase activity, although required for optimal growth, is not essential when the rate of cell growth is reduced. These findings suggest that DNA unwinding activity of Dna2 plays an auxiliary role in Okazaki fragment processing. To address this issue, we examined whether the Dna2 helicase activity influenced its intrinsic endonuclease activity using two mutant proteins, Dna2D657A and Dna2K1080E, which contain only helicase or endonuclease activity, respectively. Experiments performed with a mixture of Dna2D657A and Dna2K1080E enzymes revealed that cleavage of a single-stranded DNA by endonuclease activity of Dna2 occurs while the enzyme translocates along the substrate. In addition, DNA unwinding activity efficiently removed the secondary structure formed in the flap structure, which was further aided by replication protein A.

Polymerase α, tightly complexed with DNA primase, plays a role in the initiation of DNA synthesis by providing RNA-DNA primers for both leading and lagging strands. Okazaki fragments, after removal of primer RNAs, are ligated together through a process called Okazaki fragment maturation. This process requires the combined action of Fen-1, RNase HI, and DNA ligase I (3Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Hendericksen L.A. J. Biol.

Genetic studies revealed that Dna2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe is likely to be involved in Okazaki fragment maturation by virtue of its genetic and physical association with several enzymes involved in Okazaki fragment maturation (9Kang H.Y.

The essential DNA2 gene of S. cerevisiae encodes a 172-kDa protein with characteristic DNA helicase motifs, and the Dna2 enzyme possesses DNA helicase activity (12Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells harboring temperature-sensitive alleles of DNA2 arrested at either G2/M with a duplicated DNA content at the restrictive temperature (9Kang H.Y. Choi E. Bae S.H. Lee K.H. Gim B.S. Kim H.D.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2519-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The recombinant S. cerevisiae Dna2 protein purified from insect cells intrinsically contained strong single-stranded DNA specific endonuclease activity in addition to helicase activity (14Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the endonuclease activity of Dna2 revealed that Dna2 is not a structure-specific endonuclease, unlike Rad27, a yeast homolog of mammalian Fen1, but prefers to cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1 with free ends (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Importantly, the endonuclease activity of Dna2 is stimulated by the presence of a terminal RNA segment at the 5′ end of ssDNA (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, cleavage of the 5′ end of Okazaki fragments by Dna2 was readily observed in conjunction with DNA polymerases capable of displacement DNA synthesis. This unique property of Dna2 appears to ensure the complete removal of the initiator RNA segment on Okazaki fragments, providing a biochemical role of Dna2 endonuclease activity in Okazaki fragment processing (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently, we discovered that replication protein A (RPA) suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the mutant dna2Δ405N allele that lacked the N-terminal 405-amino acid region of DNA2 (16Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Choi E. Lee K.H. Kang H.Y. Kim H.D. Kim J.H. Bae K.H. Cho Y. Park C. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3069-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Bae S.H. Bae K, H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Subsequently we showed that RPA promotes the endonuclease, switching between Dna2 and Fen1 in the following manner (17Bae S.H. Bae K, H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). RPA initially binds to the 5′ end region containing RNA primers displaced by polymerase δ and then recruits Dna2, resulting in increase in Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of the primer RNAs. The cleavage reaction causes RPA to dissociate from the shortened flap, permitting Fen1 to access the remaining flap (17Bae S.H. Bae K, H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These findings suggested a new model for Okazaki fragment processing in which the endonuclease activity of Dna2, in collaboration with Fen1, plays a direct role in Okazaki fragment maturation (17Bae S.H. Bae K, H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In support of this critical role of the endonuclease activity of Dna2, the endonuclease-deficient Dna2 did not support cell growth (18Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast to the important role of the Dna2 endonuclease activity in Okazaki fragment processing, the properties of the Dna2 helicase activity are not well characterized. A point mutation in the ATP binding motif (K1080E) of DNA2 led to inactivation of its ATPase and helicase activities and rendered mutant cells not viable (14Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), indicating the critical role of the unwinding activityin vivo. However, mutant cells expressing Dna2K1080T were capable of growth in media when lactate and glycerol were used as the carbon source instead of glucose, suggesting that Dna2 appears to act in lagging strand metabolism in a role that is optimal with, but does not require, full helicase activity (21Formosa T. Nittis T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the helicase activity of Dna2 may play a supportive role that becomes essential in rapidly growing cells. In this paper, we have characterized the biochemical properties of the Dna2 helicase activity in an attempt to understand the role of its DNA unwinding activity during Okazaki fragment processing. We present evidence that the helicase activity of Dna2 facilitates its intrinsic endonuclease activity by resolving secondary structures present in the primer-RNA-containing flap during Okazaki fragment maturation. All oligonucleotides used for the construction of various DNA and RNA substrates were synthesized commercially and gel-purified before use. The sequences of all oligonucleotide used in this study are listed in Table I. Oligonucleotides used to prepare substrates, the positions of radioisotope labels in the substrates, and the substrate structures were as described in each figure. The oligonucleotides 1, 2, and 4 (Table I) were complementary to ΦX174 single-stranded circular DNA (sscDNA) (New England Biolabs Inc.) at nucleotides 702–731, 702–753, and 702–792, respectively. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP (>6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences.Table IOligonucleotides used in this study1-a The numbers in parentheses indicate the length of each oligonucleotide.1-b The bold type indicates ribonucleotides.1-c The regions underlined indicate the inverted repeat sequence involved in the formation of a hairpin structure.

The dna2Δ haploid strain harboring pRS316-DNA2 as an episome (YKH12) and the plasmids pRS314-DNA2 and pRS325-RFA1 were as described previously (16Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Choi E. Lee K.H. Kang H.Y. Kim H.D.

Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The plasmids pRS315-DNA2D657A and pRS314-DNA2K1080E that contain the indicated mutations are derivatives of pRS314-DNA2. Expression of mutant Dna2 enzymes in these plasmids is driven by its native promoter. T4 polynucleotide kinase, the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and terminal transferase were from New England Biolabs. The recombinant Dna2 and a mutant Dna2K1080E protein (devoid of both ATPase and helicase activities) were prepared as described previously (14Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A mutant Dna2D657A protein devoid of endonuclease activity was prepared as described previously (18Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RPA was purified from a protease-deficient yeast strain BJ2168 (MATa, ura3-52,trp1-Δ63, leu2-Δ,prb1-1122, pep4-3,prc1- 407, gal2) as described (22Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The DNA substrates used to examine the DNA unwinding activity of Dna2 protein were constructed by hybridizing the oligonucleotides listed in Table Ito ΦX174 sscDNA as described (23Park J.S. Choi E.

The various partial duplex substrates used to characterize the helicase and endonuclease activities of Dna2 were prepared as described previously (14Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using the synthetic oligonucleotides listed in Table I. Labeling of the 5′-or 3′ ends of the oligonucleotides in the substrates was as described (14Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis was measured in reaction mixtures (20-μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 μm cold ATP, 20 nm[γ-32P]ATP, and the indicated amounts of cofactor DNAs. After incubation with 2 ng (10 fmol) of Dna2 at 37 °C for 10 min, aliquots (2 μl) were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate (J. T. Baker Inc.), which was then developed in a solution containing 0.5 m LiCl and 1.0 m formic acid. The products were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Helicase assays were performed with the endonuclease-deficient mutant enzyme, Dna2D657A, unless otherwise indicated. The standard reaction mixture (40 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and 15 fmol of helicase substrate. When necessary, the concentrations of ATP and/or Mg2+ were varied as indicated in the individual experiments. The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min and initiated by the addition of enzyme. Reactions were stopped with 6× stop solution (8 μl; 60 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.6% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol). The reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 150 V through 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried on DEAE-cellulose paper and subjected to autoradiography. Labeled DNA products were quantitated with the use of a PhosphorImager. The reaction conditions used to examine Dna2 endonuclease activity were the same as those used for the DNA unwinding reaction except that ATP was omitted. Endonuclease assays were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min with either wild type Dna2 or Dna2K1080E, an ATPase/helicase-deficient mutant enzyme. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The nucleolytic products were boiled for 1 min and subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 35 W in 1× TBE through 12 or 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea as described previously (14Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of ATP on the endonuclease activity of Dna2, ATP (2 mm) was included as indicated. In all of the above reactions, Dna2 was diluted to the appropriate concentrations before use with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Nonidet P-40 stabilizes Dna2 especially at low protein levels. Because the potent endonuclease activity associated with Dna2 interfered with the measurement of its helicase activity, all of the experiments described below are carried out with the mutant Dna2D657A, an enzyme devoid of detectable endonuclease activity (18Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To ensure that the point mutation in Dna2D657A did not alter its ability to hydrolyze ATP, we compared the requirements for ATP hydrolysis by the mutant Dna2D657A and wild type Dna2 enzymes (TableII). The mutant Dna2 had a slight decrease (∼6%) in ATPase activity as compared with wild type enzyme. This difference, however, appears insignificant and within an error range of measurement since several other mutations that affected the endonuclease activity did not affect ATPase activity noticeably (18Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both wild type and mutant enzymes were inhibited similarly by increasing the concentrations of NaCl; both enzymes were dependent on Mg2+, whereas Mn2+ was less effective than Mg2+, and Ca2+ was inactive. The DNA effectors that supported ATP hydrolysis included M13 sscDNA, poly(dT), poly(dA), and poly(dG) with M13 sscDNA the most effective and poly(dG) the least effective. Both wild type and mutant enzymes did not hydrolyze ATP in the presence of synthetic single-stranded RNAs such as poly(U), poly(A), and poly(G). The synthetic double-stranded DNA ((poly(dI·dC)·(poly(dI·dC)) supported ATP hydrolysis similarly (44–56%, wild type; 48–59%, Dna2D657A). However, this activity is most likely due to the presence of free ssDNA regions that did not form a duplex region (see below). Supercoiled double-stranded plasmid DNA supported ATP hydrolysis but with a lower efficiency than M13 sscDNA. Linearized plasmid DNA did not support ATP hydrolysis with either enzymes (Table II). Therefore, we conclude that Dna2 requires single-stranded DNA for the hydrolysis of ATP. In support of this, the addition of salt (50 mm NaCl), which stabilizes duplex structures, markedly reduced the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of supercoiled DNA by both enzymes (data not shown). These results suggest that the D657A mutation did not alter the ATPase activity of Dna2 nor, most likely, the helicase activity.Table IIComparison of the requirements for the hydrolysis of ATP by wild type and mutant Dna2 enzymesAdditions or omissionsAmount addedRelative activityWild type Dna2Dna2D657A %Add NaCl0, 25, 50, 100, 200 mm100,2-aThe amount of ATP hydrolyzed by wild type Dna2 with 50 ng of M13 sscDNA (2004 pmol) represented 100%. 82, 78, 41, 494, 69, 64, 26, 4Omit MgCl2<1<1 Add EDTA2 mm<1<1 Add MnCl22 mm2518 Add CaCl22 mm<1<1Omit M13 sscDNA Add poly(dT)50 ng8286 Add poly(dA)50 ng4548 Add poly(dG)50 ng88 Add poly(U)50 ng<1<1 Add poly(A)50 ng<1<1 Add poly(G)50 ng<1<1 Add poly(dl · dC)100, 50 ng56, 4455, 45 Add pUC19 RFI100, 50 ng21, 1723, 17 Add pUC19 RFIII100, 50 ng<1<12-a The amount of ATP hydrolyzed by wild type Dna2 with 50 ng of M13 sscDNA (2004 pmol) represented 100%. Open table in a new tab To optimize the unwinding reaction catalyzed by Dna2D657A, we determined the ratio of Mg2+ to ATP. The helicase activity of Dna2D657A was measured at various concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ (Fig.1 A). Maximal unwinding activity was observed when the concentrations of Mg2+ were equimolar to those of ATP (Fig. 1 A). The optimal concentrations of Mg2+ increased in proportion to increasing concentrations of ATP (Fig. 1 A). Based upon these results, all subsequent unwinding reactions were carried out at 2 mm of ATP and 2 mm MgCl2. We have shown previously that wild type Dna2 translocated in the 5′ to 3′ direction using reaction conditions in which the nuclease activity was suppressed substantially by lowering the ratio of ATP/MgCl2 (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We reexamined the polarity of Dna2 helicase activity under the above optimized helicase condition (2 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2) using Dna2D657A and oligonucleotide substrates containing either 5′- or 3′-oligo(dT) tails (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with our previous results (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), Dna2D657A unwound the substrate with a 5′-ssDNA tail only, indicating that Dna2 translocates in the 5′ to 3′ direction (Fig. 1 B). In previous studies, the influence of a fork structure on the Dna2 helicase activity could not be evaluated due to the presence of endonuclease activity, which preferentially cleaved the ssDNA tail in the forked substrate (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The availability of the Dna2D657A enzyme containing helicase activity only permitted us to examine this question. For this purpose, a substrate containing a 25-nt 3′-ssDNA tail was prepared. Theoretically Dna2 can interact with this fork structure when it translocates in the 5′ to 3′ direction along the template sscDNA as illustrated in Fig.2 A. The fork structure containing a 3′-ssDNA tail, however, was displaced at the same rate by Dna2D657A as was a flush structure lacking a fork structure (Fig. 2). This result demonstrates that Dna2 is neither dependent on nor stimulated by the fork structure per se. Next we examined the effect of substrates containing 5′-ssDNA tails on the helicase activity of Dna2. For this purpose, several ΦX174-based substrates with preformed fork structures were constructed as shown in Fig.3 A. The substrates shown are identical except for the different lengths (0, 10, 25, and 40 nt) of the 5′-ssDNA tail. DNA unwinding activity of Dna2D657A was significantly (2–4-fold) stimulated by the presence of a 5′-ssDNA tail (Fig. 3, A and B). The amounts of unwound products increased when the length of the 5′-ssDNA tail was increased (Fig. 3, A and B). Unwinding was stimulated significantly (∼2-fold) by a 10-nt tail, and a 5′ tail longer than 25-mer resulted in a 4-fold stimulation. Further increase of the 5′ tail length did not stimulate the unwinding activity of Dna2D657A. When we used a substrate with a 5-nt tail, the unwinding activity of Dna2D657A was hardly stimulated compared with helicase substrates with longer (>10 nt) 5′ tails (data not shown). These results indicate that the stimulation is most likely due to the ability of Dna2 to utilize the 5′-ssDNA tail as an efficient entry site. As illustrated to the right side of Fig. 3 A, substrates with a 5′ tail can be unwound by two different mechanisms; one mechanism includes unwinding by Dna2 bound to the ΦX174 sscDNA strand, and the other includes unwinding by Dna2 bound to the 5′ tail. Because the amount of ssDNA present as the 5′ tail (10–40 nt) and the amount of ssDNA of ΦX174 (∼5200 nt) markedly differ, the unwinding occurring through the short ssDNA 5′ tail is remarkably efficient (Fig. 3 C). It should be noted that Dna2 hardly unwound the oligonucleotide substrate with partial duplexes at both ends (data not shown), consistent with the notion that Dna2 requires free 5′-ssDNA ends to be loaded effectively before acting as helicase.Figure 3Effects of 5′ tails on duplex unwinding by Dna2. A, unwinding of different substrates. ΦX174 DNA substrates with a 30-bp duplex region and varying lengths of a 5′ tail (0, 10, 25, or 40 nt) were prepared by annealing either the oligonucleotides 1, 5, 8, or 9 to ΦX174 sscDNA, respectively. Theasterisks indicate 32P-labeled ends. The reactions were performed with 80 ng (450 fmol) of Dna2D657A as described in Fig. 2. B denotes boiled substrate controls.

Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This could be due to the associated endonuclease activity that degraded the template ssDNA or to its inherently weak helicase activity of Dna2. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated the unwinding activity of the endonuclease-deficient Dna2 using DNA substrates containing increasing duplex regions. The DNA substrates were prepared by annealing oligonucleotides of 30, 52, and 91 nt to ΦX174 sscDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.4 A, Dna2 was able to unwind all three substrates, but the rate of unwinding became significantly inefficient as the length of duplex DNA increased. During the 10-min incubation period, Dna2D657A displaced the 30-bp duplex DNA more efficiently (2-fold) than the 52-bp duplex DNA (Fig. 4, Aand B). When the duplex DNA was 91 bp in length, unwinding efficiency decreased dramatically (15-fold less than that observed with the 30-bp duplex). The addition of E. coli SSB inhibited Dna2-catalyzed unwinding (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1–5), and the addition of RPA did not affect unwinding efficiency of the 91-bp duplex substrate (Fig. 4 C, lanes 6–8). Therefore, the result that longer primers are displaced less efficiently than shorter ones is not due to the rewinding of displaced DNA after the unwinding action of the enzyme. To examine whether Dna2 acts in a processive manner, we carried out substrate-challenge experiments by adding a 10-fold molar excess of the ΦX174 template to the reactions at different time points (0, 2, and 5 min) after initiation of the unwinding reaction. As shown in Fig.4 D, the unwinding activity of Dna2D657A was immediately blocked by the addition of excess template ssDNA at any time point after initiation. This result demonstrates that Dna2 is a weak helicase and unwinds duplex DNA in a highly distributive manner. Because RNA did not support ATPase activity of Dna2 (Table II), whereas a terminal RNA segment on a ssDNA tail stimulated the endonuclease activity (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we examined whether the 5′-terminal RNA could also stimulate unwinding activity of Dna2 using flap-structured substrates (shown in Fig. 5 A). The terminal 12-mer oligo(U) RNA segment in the chimeric flap (total, 25 nt) neither stimulated nor inhibited helicase activity compared with that obtained with a flap of 25-nt DNA (Fig. 5 A). This contrasts with the finding that the same terminal RNA segment stimulated the endonuclease activity of Dna2 (Fig. 5 B; see also Ref. 15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) when the overall length of the 5′ flap remained constant. It is noteworthy that the 25-nt chimeric flap substrate was unwound more efficiently (3-fold) than the 13-nt DNA flap substrate (Fig.5 A), suggesting that the overall length of the 5′ tail is important in acting as an entry site for Dna2. In the presence of lower concentrations (0.1–0.5 mm) of MgCl2, the stimulatory effects of the terminal RNA on the endonuclease activity of Dna2 was more dramatic (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Under this condition, however, the unwinding activity of Dna2D657A was too weak to be reliably measured (Fig. 1 A). To analyze the effect of RPA on the unwinding activity of Dna2, we examined the rate of unwinding in the presence and absence of RPA. The stimulatory effect of RPA was salt-dependent as shown in Fig.6 A. In the presence of low concentrations of NaCl (25 mm), RPA neither stimulated nor inhibited the unwinding activity of Dna2D657A (Fig. 6 A,lanes 2–5). In contrast, RPA stimulated unwinding activity of Dna2D657A in the presence of 125 mm NaCl (Fig.6 A, lanes 8–11). The addition of 125 mm NaCl nearly completely inhibited the unwinding ac"

It is known that human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis, is more sensitive to bile acid suppression. In addition, hepatic bile acid export in humans is more dependent on the bile salt export pump (BSEP). To explore the molecular basis for these species differences, we analyzed the function of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of human and murine farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor for bile acids. We observed a strong interspecies difference in bile acid-mediated FXR function; in the coactivator association assay, chenodeoxycholate (CDCA) activated human FXR-LBD with 10-fold higher affinity and 3-fold higher maximum response than murine FXR-LBD. Consistently, in HepG2 cells human FXR-LBD increased reporter expression more robustly in the presence of CDCA. The basis for these differences was investigated by preparing chimeric receptors and by site-directed mutagenesis. Remarkably, the double replacements of Lys366 and Val384 in murine FXR (corresponding to Asn354 and Ile372in human FXR) with Asn366 and Ile384 explained the difference in both potency and maximum activation; compared with the wild-type murine FXR-LBD, the double mutant gained 8-fold affinity and more than 250% maximum response to CDCA in vitro. This mutant also increased reporter expression to an extent comparable with that of human FXR-LBD in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrate that Asn354 and Ile372 are critically important for FXR function and that murine FXR can be “humanized” by substituting with the two corresponding residues of human FXR. Consistent with the difference in FXR-LBD transactivation, CDCA induced endogenous expression of human BSEP by 10–12-fold and murine BSEP by 2–3-fold in primary hepatocytes.

Currently, the molecular basis for the above species differences is unclear. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor for bile acids (13Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J., Tu, H.

Previous studies suggest that amino acid residues in helices 3, 4, 5, and 12 play important roles for interaction with coactivators (27Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H.

However, it was not known that amino acids in helices 7 and 8 also have a critical role for nuclear receptor function. In this study, we first observed species differences in the function of murine and human FXR-LBD, and we then identified the critical residues responsible for the difference. We demonstrate that Asn354 and Ile372 in helices 7 and 8 of human FXR-LBD confer on the receptor a robust response to CDCA. Murine FXR-LBD with Lys and Val at these two positions was less robustly activated by CDCA. The double substitution of Lys → Asn and Val → Ile in murine FXR “humanized” the murine receptor. Consistent with the difference in FXR-LBD transactivation, the expression of human BSEP was greatly induced by CDCA compared with murine BSEP in primary hepatocytes.

The expression vector pcDNA3.1-Gal4-FXR-LBD was constructed by inserting the same cDNA fragment (as above) of human or murine FXR-LBD into pcDNA3.1Gal4, which contains the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD). In both constructs, the N terminus of FXR-LBD was fused to the C terminus of GST or Gal4-DBD. The integrity of the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vectors of pUAS(5X)-tk-LUC and pCMV-lacZ were described previously (29Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Adams A. Berger J. Griffin P. Klatt T. Zhang B. Menke J. Zhou G. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J.

The chimera chi-1 was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment containing the N-terminal one-third of murine FXR-LBD and the two EcoRI fragments containing the C-terminal two-thirds of human FXR-LBD into pGEX-KG (see Fig. 3 A). Similarly, the chimera chi-2 was made by inserting the two EcoRI fragments containing the N-terminal two-thirds of murine FXR-LBD and the oneEcoRI fragment containing the C-terminal one-third of human FXR-LBD into pGEX-KG (see Fig. 3 A). All mutants were made on pGEX-KG or pcDNA3.1-Gal4 containing murine FXR-LBD using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21 harboring pGST-hFXR-LBD or pGST-mFXR-LBD or various mutations was cultured in LB medium to a density of OD600 0.7–1.0 and induced for overexpression by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cultures were grown at 25 °C for an additional 2–5 h. The cells were harvested, and the cell pellet was used for purification of GST-fusion proteins according to the recommended procedure from AmershamBiosciences using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The purification of all of the GST fusion proteins that were used in this study did not involve denaturation/renaturation steps. A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based FXR and coactivator SRC-1 interaction assay was used to examine the interaction of FXR-LBD with various ligands according to methods described previously for other nuclear receptors (28Zhou G. Cummings R., Li, Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol.

Briefly, 198 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm HEPES, 125 mm KF, 0.125% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.05% dry milk, 4 nm GST-FXR-LBD (human, murine, or mutants), 2 nm anti-GST-(Eu)K, 10 nmbiotin-SRC-1 fragment (human SRC-1, animo acids NSPSRLNIQP to VKVKVEKKEQ; murine SRC-1, animo acids NSPSRLSMQP to VKVKVEKKEQ), and 20 nm SA/XL665 (streptavidin-labeled allophycocyanin)) were added to each well, followed by 2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide or various concentrations of CDCA into appropriate wells. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by measurement of fluorescence reading on a Packard Discovery instrument. Data were expressed as the ratio of the emission intensity at 665 nm to that at 620 nm, multiplied by a factor of 104. HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line obtained from ATCC, were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate of 10-cm plates in DMEM 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with transfection mixes in serum-free Opti-MEM I using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, transfection mixes for each plate contained 18 μl of FuGENE 6, 3 μg of pcDNA3.1-Gal4-FXR-LBD (human, murine, or mutant) expression vector, and 3 μg of pcDNA3.1-hRXRα expression construct. Cells were incubated in the transfection mixture for 4 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. The cells were then incubated for ∼40–48 h in fresh DMEM containing 5% CS-FBS with 25 μm CDCA. At the end of the incubation, nuclear extraction was prepared using a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 30 μg of total nuclear protein was separated by electrophoresis on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Western blotting was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (AmershamBiosciences) using the polyclonal rabbit anti-Gal4-DBD antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescence kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with transfection mixes in serum-free Opti-MEM I using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described above. Transfection mixes for each well contained 0.405 μl of FuGENE 6, 3 ng of pcDNA3.1-Gal4-FXR-LBD (human, murine, or mutant) expression vector, 3 ng of pcDNA3.1-hRXRα expression construct, 60 ng of pUAS(5X)-tk-LUC reporter vector, and 60 ng of pCMV-lacZ. Cells were incubated in the transfection mixture for 4 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. The cells were then incubated for ∼40–48 h in a fresh DMEM containing 5% CS-FBS with or without various concentrations of ligands. Cell lysates were produced using reporter lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's directions. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in cell extracts were determined as described previously (29Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Adams A. Berger J. Griffin P. Klatt T. Zhang B. Menke J. Zhou G. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7913-7922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities individually for each well. Plated primary human hepatocytes were obtained from In Vitro Technologies (Baltimore, MD). Plated murine hepatocytes were prepared according to the protocol described previously (30Pollard J.W. Walker J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1992; 75: 145-150Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well of six-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 25 mm HEPES and cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with various concentrations of CDCA in phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 mm HEPES for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using the TRIZOL reagent according the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions and TaqMan-PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of FAM (reporter dye) during the amplification cycles. Amplification of human 18 S RNA was used in the same reaction of all samples as an internal control. Gene-specific mRNA was subsequently normalized to 18 S mRNA. Levels of human and murine BSEP mRNA were expressed as -fold difference of CDCA-treated cells against dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for human and murine BSEP were designed using Primer Express program and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems. These sequences (5′ to 3′) are as follows. The human BSEP forward primer was GGGCCATTGTACGAGATCCTAA. The probe was 6FAM-TCTTGCTACTAGATGAAGCCACTTCTGCCTTAGA-TAMRA. The reverse primer was TGCACCGTCTTTT- CACTTTCTG. The murine BSEP forward primer was GCTCTCAAGTTGGGATGATGGT. The probe was 6FAM-TTCCTTCACTAACATCTTTGTGGCCGTGC-TAMRA. The reverse primer was TTCCAGTTAAAGAGGA- AGGCGA. Primers and probe for human 18 S RNA were also purchased from Applied Biosystems. Human and murine FXR (accession number for human FXR is NP_005114; for murine FXR, NP_033134) have a high degree of conservation. The full-length receptor is 93% identical, and the LBD is 95% identical. Murine FXR is 12 amino acids longer than human FXR, 10 in the N terminus, 1 in the DBD, and 1 in the LBD (31Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the position numbers of corresponding amino acids pertinent to this study differ by 12 between the two receptors. Despite the strong conservation, we asked whether the functionality of human and murine FXR is different. Previous studies demonstrated that bile acids were endogenous ligands of FXR, and CDCA was the most potent agonist among naturally existing bile acids (13Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J., Tu, H.

Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). To study transactivation of LBD, human or murine FXR-LBD was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells and evaluated for CDCA-induced transactivation. CDCA dramatically activated human FXR-LBD, evidenced by the great induction of reporter gene expression (Fig.1). However, murine FXR-LBD was much less robustly activated with a maximal induction of luciferase activity of 30% that induced by human FXR-LBD (Fig. 1). This result indicates that murine FXR-LBD only possesses 30–40% functionality of human FXR-LBD. This experiment employed constructs in which the human and murine FXR-LBD was coupled to an identical Gal4-DBD, and it employed an identical reporter construct for both human and murine studies. The differences observed are therefore likely to derive from the LBD of FXR. The species difference in FXR-LBD function was also investigated in anin vitro coactivator association assay. This assay measures CDCA-induced interaction between FXR-LBD and the coactivator SRC-1 in a cell-free environment. This interaction often reflects the transactivation ability of nuclear receptors in vivo (28Zhou G. Cummings R., Li, Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similar to the transactivation in HepG2 cells, the murine FXR-LBD displayed a 30–40% maximal response to CDCA compared with human FXR-LBD (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the half-maximal stimulation (EC50) of CDCA on the murine receptor was 10-fold higher than that on the human receptor, with an EC50 value of 49.8 μm and 5.2 μm on the two receptors, respectively (Fig.2 A). This result demonstrates again that human FXR-LBD is more sensitive to CDCA, resulting in high functionality compared with murine FXR-LBD. The human SRC-1 protein was used in the coactivator association assay. To eliminate the possibility that the low functionality observed for murine FXR in coactivator association resulted from the use of human SRC-1, analysis was also performed in a similar assay using murine SRC-1. Nearly identical results were obtained from the assay using murine SCR-1. Murine FXR-LBD also showed much less robust activation by CDCA than did human FXR-LBD; the EC50 value of CDCA on murine FXR-LBD (47.9 μm) was 8-fold higher than that on the human receptor (6.1 μm) (Fig. 2 B). This result suggests that the differential response to CDCA displayed by human and murine FXR-LBD was not caused by a species difference of SRC-1, it is rather an intrinsic property of FXR. To identify the amino acid residues critical for CDCA-mediated FXR function, two chimeric receptors were constructed between human and murine FXR-LBD using two EcoRI sites commonly occurring in both receptors (Fig.3 A). The first chimera (chi-1) consists of one-third murine and two-thirds human FXR-LBD, and the second chimera (chi-2) contains approximate two-thirds murine and one-third human FXR-LBD (Fig. 3 A). In the coactivator association assay, both chi-1 and chi-2 displayed robust activation by CDCA with a maximum activation of 80 and 75% of human FXR-LBD, respectively (Fig. 3 B). CDCA had an EC50 value of 7.2 and 11.9 μm, respectively, on chi-1 and chi-2. These EC50 values are similar to the EC50 of 6.8 μm on the human receptor (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the C terminus of human FXR contains residues critical for CDCA-mediated FXR function. The C-terminal fragment of human and murine FXR (residues 353–472 of human FXR) differs at four residues, at positions 354, 372, 421, and 422 (Fig.4, according to human FXR). Each of the four residues (Asn354, Ile372, Ile421, and His422) in human FXR was introduced individually into the murine receptor (mFXR366N-LBD, mFXR384I-LBD, mFXR433I-LBD, and mFXR434H-LBD), and the mutant receptors were characterized in a coactivator association assay for the responsiveness to CDCA. Two of the single mutants, GST-mFXR433I-LBD and GST-mFXR434H-LBD, were indistinguishable from the wild-type murine FXR in both EC50 and the maximal response of CDCA (Fig. 5), indicating that the two residues may not be critical for CDCA-induced activation and may not contribute significantly to the species difference in FXR function. In contrast, the other two single mutants, GST-mFXR366N-LBD and GST-mFXR384I-LBD, showed a significant increase in responsiveness to CDCA compared with the wild-type murine FXR-LBD, with an EC50 of 18.4 and 37.8 μm, respectively, and a maximal response of 2–3-fold higher than murine FXR. However, none of the single mutants had activity comparable with that of the wild-type human receptor (Fig. 5).Figure 5Characterization of single mutants of murine FXR-LBD in coactivator association. The FXR coactivator association assay was performed as described in Fig. 2. The GST-FXR-LBD fusion proteins used here were GST-hFXR-LBD (▪), GST-mFXR-LBD (●), GST-mFXR366N-LBD (▿), GST-mFXR384I-LBD (■), GST-mFXR433I-LBD (○), and GST-mFXR434H-LBD (×). Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The double substitutions (Asn366 and Ile384) were introduced to murine FXR to determine whether these two residues together would humanize the murine receptor. Indeed, this double mutant (GST-mFXRD-LBD) showed a dramatic increase in responsiveness to CDCA compared with the wild-type murine receptor (Fig. 6). In the coactivator association assay, GST-mFXRD-LBD had a maximal response of 75% that for human FXR-LBD. The EC50 of CDCA on GST-mFXRD-LBD was 9.2 μm, which was also comparable with the EC50 value of 6.8 μm on human FXR-LBD (GST-hFXR-LBD). In both maximal stimulation and EC50 of CDCA, GST-mFXRD-LBD closely resembled chi-2, which contains four amino acid alterations in the C terminus of murine FXR-LBD (Fig. 6). These data suggest that alterations at these two positions of murine FXR account for the difference in FXR function, and that Asn354 and Ile372 are critically important for CDCA-mediated FXR activation function. The important role of Asn354 and Ile372 in human FXR-LBD was also confirmed in Gal4-FXR transactivation in HepG2 cells. Consistent with the results in the coactivator association assay, Gal4-mFXRD-LBD increased luciferase activity in HepG2 cells in a CDCA dose-dependent manner with a maximal induction of more than 250% that induced by wild-type murine Gal4-FXR-LBD (Fig. 7 A). This value was approximately 75% of the maximal induction displayed by human Gal4-FXR-LBD (Fig. 7 A). The receptor expression was detected by Western blotting. The expression level of Gal4-mFXRD-LBD was approximately as same as that of wild-type Gal4-mFXR-LBD, and the expression of human FXR-LBD (Gal4-hFXR-LBD) was slightly lower than the murine receptor (Fig.7 B). These data confirm the critical role of Asn354 and Ile372 residues in FXR function and indicate that the murine receptor was humanized by the introduction of the two amino acid substitutions. BSEP is a direct target gene of FXR (22Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol.

Hepatology. 2002; 35: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The induction of BSEP mRNA correlates well with FXR transactivation (32Plass J.R. Mol O. Heegsma J. Geuken M. Faber K.N. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To compare the functionality of human and murine FXR further, primary hepatocytes of humans and mice were prepared and treated with various concentrations of CDCA, and the endogenous expression of BSEP was analyzed by real time PCR (TaqMan). CDCA robustly increased BSEP mRNA in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal induction of 10–12-fold (Fig. 8) in human cells. However, CDCA only increased murine BSEP mRNA by 2–3-fold (Fig. 8). This result is consistent with the observed difference in FXR-LBD function between the two species and supports the conclusion that human FXR has high sensitivity to bile acids such as chenodeoxycholate. Bile acid metabolism has profound differences between humans and mice. To seek the molecular basis for the species difference, we investigated the CDCA-mediated FXR function using human and murine FXR-LBD. We observed that human FXR-LBD was much more robustly activated by CDCA than murine FXR-LBD. In addition, the affinity of CDCA on human FXR-LBD was 10-fold higher than that on murine FXR-LBD in the coactivator association assay. These results suggest that human FXR is more sensitive and susceptible to CDCA. Indeed, in primary human hepatocytes, BSEP expression was induced more robustly by CDCA. These results provide strong evidence for explaining the species difference in bile acid/cholesterol metabolism. Transactivation data reported by Parks et al. (14Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar) showed a smaller difference between the full-length human and murine FXR, although the difference was also observed. There are three potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, the data by Parks et al. had a relatively large error bar, which may mask the real difference between human and murine FXR. Second, a high concentration of CDCA (100 μm) was used by Parks et al. CDCA is a hydrophobic bile acid and has profound cell toxicity at 100 μm. Fig. 9 shows that the difference between human and murine FXR-LBD transactivation was much smaller at 100 μm CDCA. Thus, it is possible that their data were consistent with ours if appropriate CDCA concentrations were used. Third, the cell line used by Parks et al. was CV-1, and in this study we used HepG2 cells. HepG2 is a human hepatic cell line and may contain appropriate cofactors needed for function of liver-specific nuclear receptors such as FXR. We identified the critical amino acid residues that cause the species differences in FXR function by preparing chimeric receptors and by site-directed mutagenesis. Remarkably, two amino acid differences in helices 7 and 8 appear to explain the dramatic differences in human and murine FXR function. Substitutions of Lys → Asn and Val → Ile, respectively, at the two corresponding positions of murine FXR humanized the murine receptor. We conclude that it is Asn354 and Ile372 that confer human FXR with high sensitivity to CDCA. Helix 12 (or AF-2) of nuclear receptors plays an essential role for nuclear receptor transactivation. Deletion or mutation of helix 12 completely destroyed the activation function of PPARγ (33Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O.

Replacement with Val at this position in murine FXR may therefore decrease the binding affinity for CDCA. A classical receptor-binding assay would determine whether this residue is critical for ligand binding or for coactivator recruiting. The coactivator association assay used in this study could not distinguish these two processes. Ile372 of human FXR is conserved among several nuclear receptors (PPARγ, TRβ2, RARγ, and LXRα). Although computer modeling does not predict a critical role for this residue, it may contribute to the formation of coactivator binding pocket with its hydrophobic side chain. Ile372 may also be involved in ligand binding through the interaction of its hydrophobic side chain with the sterol core of bile acids. In any event, evolution may select these two natural alterations in FXR to adapt specific needs in mice. The discovery of species differences in FXR function further supports the notion of FXR as a bile acid sensor. Given the fact that human FXR is more sensitive to bile acids, it is likely that FXR plays more important roles in humans than in rodents, and FXR ligands may have potential as therapeutic drugs for intrahepatic cholestasis and lipid disorders. This study provides the first identification of critical residues in helices 7 and 8 and reinforces cautious extrapolation of ligand activity across highly conserved receptors. We thank Ralph Mosley for providing the sequence alignment across the nuclear receptors, PPARγ, TRβ2, RARγ, LXRα, and FXR."

This cleavage of PTB separated the N-terminal region, containing NLS-RRM1, from the C-terminal region, containing RRM2-3-4. Our data indicate that there are three noncanonical caspase-3 target sites in PTBs, namely Ile-Val-Pro-Asp7↓Ile, Leu-Tyr-Thr-Asp139↓Ser, and Ala-Ala-Val-Asp172↓Ala. The C-terminal PTB fragments localized to the cytoplasm, as opposed to the nucleus where most intact PTBs are found. Moreover, these C-terminal PTB fragments inhibited translation of polioviral mRNA, which contains an IRES element requiring PTB for its activation. This suggests that translation of some IRES-containing mRNAs is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of PTB during apoptosis.

Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 5Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar, 6Martin S.J.

Cytological changes include cytoplasmic and nuclear shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and chromatin condensation. At the molecular level, a family of cysteine proteases, termed caspases, selectively cleaves a series of protein substrates. Initiator caspases, such as caspases 8 and 9, trigger a proteolytic cascade that culminates in the cleavage and activation of downstream caspases such as caspases 3, 6, and 7. These downstream or execution caspases then cleave specific target proteins (7Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 8Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). Ultimately, a caspase-activated DNase I cleaves genomic DNA (10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar), at which point cell death is imminent. Understanding the mechanisms of cell death requires the identification of caspase targets and the elucidation of the consequences of their proteolytic cleavage. Thus far, more than 70 proteins have been found to be cleaved by caspases (11Stroh C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), and new substrates are continually being identified. For most proteins, the consequences of cleavage are poorly understood. However, in a few cases proteolysis of certain components can be linked to discrete morphological changes associated with cell death. Because apoptosis is an ordered sequence of rather stereotypical alternations in every cell type, one would predict that caspase substrates should be ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved, at least in their aspartate cleavage site. The known substrates of caspases can be loosely categorized into a few functional groups, which include cytoskeletal and structural proteins, cell cycle proteins, signal transduction-regulatory proteins, transcription or translation-regulatory proteins, and cytokine precursors (11Stroh C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). In addition, the recent use of proteomic approaches has found several apoptosis-associated RNA-binding proteins such as splicing factors p54nrb, SRp30c, and ASF-2, as well as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)1such as hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP C1/C2, hnRNP K, and hnRNP R (13Thiede B.

Lavin M. Watters D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29335-29341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). HnRNPs have been shown to participate in a wide variety of processes in the nucleus, including transcriptional regulation, maintenance of telomere length, immunoglobulin class-switch recombination, alternative pre-mRNA splicing, and pre-mRNA 3′-end processing (16Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The view that hnRNPs function only in the nucleus was challenged by findings that some hnRNPs shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (see Ref. 16Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar and references therein). Several studies have provided evidence that hnRNPs not only accompany mRNA into cytoplasm but also control the activities of mRNA in the cytoplasm. These studies show that hnRNPs can regulate at least three distinct cytoplasmic events as follows: mRNA localization, mRNA translation, and mRNA turnover. A number of apoptosis-associated hnRNP proteins have been identified. HnRNPA2 regulates cytoplasmic mRNA localization and translation of myelin basic protein (17Ainger K. Avossa D. Diana A.S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HnRNP C increases amyloid precursor protein production by stabilizing amyloid precursor protein mRNA (21Rajagopalan L.E. Westmark C.J. Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3418-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and differentiation-linked binding of hnRNP C on c-sismRNA may regulate IRES-dependent translation (22Sella O. Gerlitz G., Le, S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5429-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HnRNP K and hnRNP E1 silence the translation of 15-lipoxygenase mRNA by inhibiting 80 S ribosome assembly (23Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of mRNA localization, translation, and mRNA turnover by hnRNPs is a powerful means to regulate protein expression. The regulation of apoptosis may require a fast response, which could be provided by modifying protein expression rather than by de novosynthesis of mRNA. Therefore, post-translational modifications of hnRNPs, such as phosphorylation and proteolysis, might be used to regulate their functions in apoptotic cells. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB also known as p57 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I (hnRNP I)) is a member of the hnRNP family and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a transcription-sensitive manner (24Michael W.M.

Three isoforms of PTB have been reported (25Ghetti A. Pinol-Roma S. Michael W.M. Morandi C. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3671-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 26Gil A.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The prototype of PTB (PTB1) consists of 531 amino acids with a molecular mass of 57 kDa. PTB2 and PTB4 have insertions of 19 and 26 amino acids, respectively, after the amino acid at position 298 of PTB1 (25Ghetti A. Pinol-Roma S. Michael W.M. Morandi C. Dreyfuss G.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Four loosely conserved RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) are distributed throughout the PTB molecule (see Fig.3A) (28Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). PTB exists in oligomeric as well as monomeric forms, and the central region of PTB, including RRM2, plays a key role in its oligomerization (29Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PTB contains several RNA-binding domains, among which the C-terminal region of PTB spanning RRM3–4 exerts the strongest RNA binding activity (29Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3132-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of PTB is responsible for the enhancement of RNA binding activity by HeLa cell cytoplasmic factor(s) (29Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kohara M. Nomoto A. Jang S.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PTB was originally identified as a protein binding to the polypyrimidine tracts of adenoviral major late and α-tropomyosin pre-mRNAs and was proposed as a splicing factor (25Ghetti A. Pinol-Roma S. Michael W.M. Morandi C. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3671-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 27Patton J.G. Mayer S.A. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Binding of PTB to the polypyrimidine tracts near the branch point of an intron was shown to modulate the alternative splicing of certain pre-mRNAs (32Lin C.H. Patton J.G.

The proteolytic cleavage of RNA-binding proteins was analyzed by Western blotting, which revealed that PTB was cleaved by caspase-3 in vivo and in vitro, even though only loosely conserved caspase recognition sequences exist in the primary structure of the protein. Caspase-3 cleavage sites in PTB were identified using Edman degradation and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The C-terminal PTB cleavage products yielded by apoptosis were redistributed to the cytoplasm, away from the nucleus where intact PTBs are mainly located. Moreover, the C-terminal region of PTB inhibited translation of polioviral mRNA containing a PTB-dependent IRES element. This indicates that proteolytic cleavage of PTB, an RNA-binding protein that augments IRES-dependent translation, can contribute to drastic changes in gene expression during apoptosis. Mouse anti-PTB monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) DH3 and DH17 were provided by Dr. E. Wimmer (State University of New York, Stony Brook). The epitopes recognized by these antibodies are between amino acids 1–159 and 292–532, respectively. Anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody, anti-hnRNP A1 polyclonal antibody, and anti-hnRNP C1/C2 mAb were provided by Dr. P. Suh (POSTECH, Korea) (55Bae S.S. Perry D.K., Oh, Y.S. Choi J.H. Galadari S.H.

HeLa-S3 and 293T cells were transfected with DNA by electroporation. HeLa-E cells were seeded on glass coverslips 12 h before transfection with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For induction of apoptosis, cells were incubated in medium for 4–12 h in the presence of the following agents: 20 μm etoposide (Sigma) for Molt-4 and Jurkat, 50 μm etoposide for HeLa-S3, 5 μm camptothecin (Sigma) for Jurkat and HeLa-S3, 2 μm staurosporine for Jurkat and HeLa-S3, 100 ng/ml TRAIL in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml potentiator (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for Jurkat and HeLa-S3, and 100 ng/ml TNF-α (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for HeLa-E.

In order to detect changes in RNA-binding proteins during apoptosis, apoptosis inducer-treated cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −70 °C. Cell pellets were thawed on ice, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Thirty micrograms of cell lysate was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting of hnRNP I (PTB), hnRNP A1, hnRNP C1/C2, PARP, and caspase-3.

Transcription reactions were performed with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 90 min, as recommended by the manufacturer. The concentration of RNA transcripts was determined using a UV spectrophotometer. Plasmids pTM1H/PTB1, pTM1H/PTB2, pTM1H/PTB4, pTM1H/PTB4(Δ2) (D7A), pTM1H/PTB4(Δ2) (D139A), pTM1H/PTB4(Δ2) (D172A), pTM1H/PTB4(Δ2) (D139A/D172A), and pTM1H/PTB4(Δ2) (D7A/D139A/D172A) digested with SalI were used to generate mRNAs encoding PTB1, PTB2, PTB4, and PTB4 derivatives, respectively. In vitro translations in micrococcal nuclease-treated RRL (Promega) were performed in reaction mixtures containing 30 nm mRNA. Translation reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Translation reactions were stopped by adding 0.6 mg/ml cycloheximide and 1 mm “cold” methionine. Purified PTB4 (5 μg) and 250 ng of caspase-3 were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time in buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) with or without 10 μm DEVD-CHO (Calbiochem). The reactions were stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were resolved on 15 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. PTB-related bands were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-PTB mAbs (DH3 or DH17). To investigate the caspase-3 activity against PTBs translated in vitro, the radioactive translation mixture (10 μl) was incubated with purified caspase-3 (160 ng) resuspended in buffer D for 2 h (or indicated time) at 37 °C. The caspase reactions were stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For N-terminal amino acid sequencing of PTB cleavage products, purified PTB4 (40 μg) was incubated with caspase-3 (2 μg) at 37 °C for 30 min or 10 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved by 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were subjected to microsequencing by an automatic protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) at Korea Basic Science Institute. The microscopic observations of endogenous PTB and GFP-fused proteins were accomplished as described previously (57Back S.H. Kim Y.K. Kim W.J. Cho S., Oh, H.R. Kim J.E. Jang S.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2529-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dual-luciferase assay was carried out as described previously (57Back S.H. Kim Y.K. Kim W.J. Cho S., Oh, H.R. Kim J.E. Jang S.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2529-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Modification of hnRNPs during apoptosis was investigated by Western blot analysis using antibodies against hnRNP I/PTB, hnRNP A1, hnRNP C1/C2, PARP, and caspase-3. Two different monoclonal antibodies were used, DH17 and DH3, that recognize the C- and N-terminal regions of PTB, respectively. Total cell lysates of Molt-4 cells were prepared at various times after induction of apoptosis by etoposide. After 4 h of treatment with etoposide, three ∼41-kDa fragments of PTBs were identified by monoclonal antibody DH17 (Fig.1A, lane 2), and these fragments were more apparent 6 h post-treatment (Fig.1A, lanes 2 and 3). Intact PTBs almost disappeared 12 h post-treatment with etoposide (Fig.1A, lane 4). Monoclonal antibody DH3 detected two or three N-terminal fragments of PTBs (∼15 kDa). Kinetics of the N-terminal fragment generation was similar to that of the C-terminal fragment (compare A with B in Fig. 1). The cleavage of PTBs was inhibited when apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (Fig.1, A and B, lane 7). Thus, it is very likely that the PTB cleavage is mediated by a caspase. As a control marker of caspase activity, the cleavage of the well characterized caspase-3 and -7 target protein PARP was also measured (Fig.1E) (7Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Similar to PTBs, cleavage of PARP with apparent molecular mass of ∼85 kDa was observed 4 h after etoposide treatment. PARP was completely cleaved 6 h after etoposide treatment, by which time about half the PTBs were cleaved. The amount of full-length caspase-3 decreased gradually as apoptosis proceeded.

The basic isozyme, which predominates in muscle, participates in the purine nucleotide cycle, has an active site conformation different from that of the Escherichia coli enzyme, and exhibits significant differences in ligand recognition. Crystalline complexes presented here of the recombinant basic isozyme from mouse show the following. GTP alone binds to the active site without inducing a conformational change. IMP in combination with an acetate anion induces major conformational changes and organizes the active site for catalysis. IMP, in the absence of GTP, binds to the GTP pocket of the synthetase. The combination of GTP and IMP results in the formation of a stable complex of 6-phosphoryl-IMP and GDP in the presence or absence of hadacidin. The response of the basic isozyme to GTP alone differs from that of synthetases from plants, and yet the conformation of the mouse basic and E. coli synthetases in their complexes with GDP, 6-phosphoryl-IMP, and hadacidin are nearly identical. Hence, reported differences in ligand recognition among synthetases probably arise from conformational variations observed in partially ligated enzymes.

Because of its critical role in purine biosynthesis, the synthetase is a target for antibiotics, herbicides, and antitumor drugs (1Schmitzer P.R. Graupner P.R. Chapin E.L. Fields S.C. Gilbert J.R.

In contrast to other organisms that have only one adenylosuccinate synthetase, vertebrates possess two isozymes of the synthetase that differ in their isoelectric points, kinetic properties, tissue distribution, and in vivo regulation (5Stayton M.M.

The basic (often called the muscle synthetase or AdSS1) and the acidic (often called the liver synthetase or AdSS2) isozymes may participate exclusively in the purine nucleotide cycle and de novo biosynthesis of AMP, respectively (7Lowenstein J.M.

But hard evidence in support of distinct physiological roles for the two vertebrate isozymes remains elusive (10Baugher B.W. Montonaro L. Welch M.M. Rudolph F.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The reaction begins with the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP to the 6-keto group of IMP to form 6-phosphoryl-IMP (6PIMP)1 followed by the displacement of Pi from the intermediate byl-aspartate to form adenylosuccinate (15Honzatko R.B.

Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5970-5976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Evidently, IMP alone can induce long range ordering of the active site of the E. colisynthetase, presumably through the formation of a hydrogen-bond between its 5′-phosphoryl group and Asn38 (26Hou Z.

The most significant of the conformational changes is a 9-Å movement of loop 40−53 (now called the Switch loop). In contrast, crystal structures of synthetases from plants reveal organized active sites in the presence of GDP alone (27Prade L. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Chemla P. Potter S. Ward E. Fonné-Pfister R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the ligand-free conformations for these enzymes are not available.The pre-Switch loops of the E. coli synthetase and the mouse basic isozyme, segments that include the critical asparagine at the IMP pocket, have decidedly different conformations in their ligand-free states (28Iancu C.V.

To better understand determinants of substrate recognition, we examine here crystalline complexes of the mouse basic isozyme formed in the presence of GTP alone, IMP alone, GTP/IMP, and GTP/IMP/hadacidin (hadacidin, N-formyl N-hydroxyglycine, is a tight binding, competitive inhibitor with respect tol-aspartate). In contrast to the plant synthetases, guanine nucleotides alone cannot organize the active site of the mouse basic isozyme. Furthermore, consistent with reports of 6-phosphoryl-IMP at the active site of the E. coli synthetase, the mouse basic isozyme also stabilizes the intermediate in the presence and absence of hadacidin. In fact, structural complexes of the mouse basic isozyme andE. coli synthetase suggest that anions at the 5′-phosphoryl site of IMP and the β-phosphoryl site of GTP synergistically trigger organization of the active site. Evidently, the mouse basic isozyme and the E. coli synthetase differ in their ligand-free conformations but are nearly identical in their states of complete ligation. Finally, the complexes above provide a structural basis for IMP inhibition of the mouse basic isozyme at high concentrations of IMP.RESULTSAll ligand complexes crystallize from solutions containing 200 mm magnesium acetate and Hepes buffer, pH 7, and provide data to 2.1−2.2 Å resolution. Crystals of the ligandfree basic isozyme, the GTP(GDP) complex, and the 6PIMP·GDP·hadacidin complex are isomorphous (space group P43212), having one subunit of a synthetase dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. 6PIMP·GDP and IMP complexes are also isomorphous (space group C2) but have a complete dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Statistics of data collection and refinement are in TableI. The stereochemistry of the refined models, as defined by the program PROCHECK, exceeds that usually observed for protein structures of comparable resolution. No residues lie in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and at least 88% of all residues for any given structure are in the most favored regions. The average uncertainty in coordinates is ∼0.25 Å. Thermal parameters vary from 17 to 100, 10 to 67, 18 to 78, and 17 to 81 Å2 for the GTP(GDP), IMP, 6PIMP·GDP, and 6PIMP·GDP·hadacidin complexes, respectively. Regions of weak or absent electron density correspond to short segments of specific loops, described more completely below, and to residues preceding Ala28. The presence or absence of a polyhistidyl tag at the N terminus has no effect on the formation of crystals or on the structures of the resulting complexes (data not provided).Table IStatistics of data collection and refinementGTP(GDP) complexIMP complex6PIMP · GDP complex6PIMP · GDP · hadacidin complexData reductionSpace groupP43212C2C2P43212Unit cell parameters a(Å)70.06129.98128.5070.78 b (Å)70.0669.9970.1270.78 c (Å)198.09105.33105.13195.63 β (°)95.2890.46 Resolution limits (Å)65.9–2.240.8–2.140.5–2.250.0–2.1 No. of reflections126,081183,394175,127266,913 No. of unique reflections25,71552,71848,64632,291Completeness of data (%) Overall89.59592.398.5 Last shell1-aResolution range is approximately 2.3–2.2 Å for the GTP(GDP) and 6PIMP · GDP complexes and 2.2–2.1 Å for the IMP and 6PIMP · GDP · hadacidin complexes.98.56886.599.5Rmerge1-bRmerge = ΣjΣi‖Iij-〈Ij〉‖/ΣiΣjIij, where i runs over multiple observations of the same intensity and j runs over crystallographically unique intensities.

Open table in a new tab Dynamic structural elements of adenylosuccinate synthetase, recognized from previous work, are the Switch, IMP, GTP, and Asp loops (Fig.1). Work here reveals two additional dynamic elements, the pre-Switch and the Val loops. The later name originates from the invariance of Val305 among sequences of the synthetase family. Mutations of Val273 in the E. coli enzyme (the residue corresponding to Val305 of the mouse basic isozyme) seriously impair synthetase ability to discriminate between l-aspartate and other physiologically relevant dicarboxylic acids (40Gorell A. Wang W. Underbakke E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8817-8821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Removing the six dynamic loops from consideration, all structures of the mouse basic isozyme, including the ligand-free structure, superimpose with an overall root-mean-square deviation in Cα coordinates of less than 1.3 Å. The structural elements named above, however, exhibit different conformational states (ligated, ligand-free, or disordered), which are the focus of this investigation and are summarized in TableII. The 6PIMP·GDP·hadacidin complex of the mouse basic isozyme defines the ligated conformation for each of the structural elements in Table II, whereas the ligand-free crystal structure reported by Iancu et al.

Open table in a new tab GTP(GDP) Complex (Accession Label 1LOO)All active site loops in the GTP(GDP) complex, with the exception of the GTP loop, have conformations similar to those seen in the ligand-free basic isozyme (Table II). Strong electron density within the guanine nucleotide pocket is consistent with mutually exclusive binding of GDP and GTP, each at 50% occupancy (Fig. 2). The base of GTP(GDP) lies between the guanine recognition element (residues 362−365), which matches the consensus sequence (N/T)KXD common to G-proteins (42Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), and the GTP loop (Fig. 1). The base of the guanine nucleotide makes several hydrogen-bonds with the protein; atom N-1 and the 2-amino group hydrogen-bond with Asp365, and atom O-6 hydrogen-bonds with backbone amides 363 and 447 (Fig. 2). The side chains of Lys363 and Lys448 pack against opposite faces of the base moiety. Only Lys363 hydrogen-bonds with the ribose moiety (with atom O-4′), but as noted below, other interactions between protein and ribose are evident in the fully ligated system. The P-loop (residues 38−46) hydrogen-bonds extensively with the phosphoryl moiety of GTP(GDP). Backbone amides 45 and 46 interact with the β-phosphoryl group, and backbone amide 43 and the side chains of Asp43 and Lys46 interact with the γ-phosphoryl group. Spheres of electron density, modeled as four separate water molecules, extend from the phosphoryl moiety of GTP (Fig. 2). The assigned water molecules could represent sites of Mg2+ coordination and/or density from conformational disorder in the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP. Unlike the fully ligated synthetase (see below), the GTP(GDP) complex does not define a specific binding site for Mg2+.Figure 2Stereoview of GTP bound to the active site.

Chain A binds one molecule of IMP and two molecules of acetate, whereas chain B binds two molecules of IMP and one molecule of Mg2+ (Fig.3). The Asp loop of each subunit makes different lattice contacts. In chain A, backbone carbonyl 333A hydrogen-bonds with the side chain of Lys336A#, and the side chain of Trp329A hydrogen-bonds with backbone carbonyl 334A# and stacks with the side chain of Trp329A# (the # symbol designates a residue from a lattice contact). In chain B, backbone carbonyls 332B, 333B, and 334B hydrogen-bond with the side chains of Ser428B#, Arg431B#, and Asn435B#, respectively. The Asp loop of chain A packs against the active site (ligated conformation), whereas that of chain B stands off from the active site by a rigid-body motion of ∼5 Å (ligand-free conformation, Fig.4). The Val and pre-Switch loops also exhibit different conformations in chains A and B; the Val loop and Asn68 (of the pre-Switch loop) move ∼2 and 1.5 Å, respectively, away from the active site in chain B relative to their positions in chain A (Fig. 4).Figure 3Stereoview of different modes of IMP ligation. Interactions at the two subunits of the asymmetric unit of this crystal form differ. One IMP molecule and two acetate anions (labeled ACT) bind at chain A (top) and two IMP molecules and Mg2+ bind at chain B (bottom).

See “Results” for further details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, the Switch and IMP loops of chains A and B adopt the same conformation, that of the fully ligated active site of the basic isozyme. Relative to the ligand-free structure, the Cα atoms of the Switch loop have moved by as much as 5 Å. The IMP loop has no electron density associated with it in crystal structures of the ligand-free and GTP(GDP)-ligated structures, but in the IMP complex it is in a well defined conformation with distinct electron density. Residues 147−156 complete helix H3; positions 154−156, which are insertions with respect to sequences of the E. coli and plant synthetases, just extend helix H3 by an additional turn. The side chain of Glu149 (helix H3) hydrogen-bonds with backbone amides 160, 161, and 162, stabilizing an ordered conformation for the IMP loop.The side chains of Asn68, Thr163, Thr271, and Arg177 (from the symmetry-related subunit of the dimer) and backbone amide 163 hydrogen-bond with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP in both chains A and B, but beyond this the recognition of IMP in each subunit differs substantially (Figs. 3 and4). In chains A and B, the ribosyl moiety of IMP is C2′-endoand C3′-endo, respectively, and the torsion angles of the glycosidic bonds (χ) are 23° and 80°. The 2′-hydroxyl group of IMP at chain A hydrogen-bonds with the side chain of Arg335A (Asp loop) and backbone carbonyl 305A (Val loop), and its 3′-hydroxyl group interacts with backbone carbonyls 160A and 307A and with the side chain of Arg304A by way of bridging water molecules. In contrast, the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of IMP at chain B hydrogen-bond only with backbone carbonyl 160B, the latter directly and the former through a bridging water molecule. The N-7 atom of IMP at chain A hydrogen-bonds with the side chain of Asn256A, whereas the side chain of Asn256B is more that 7 Å away from the N-7 atom of IMP. Despite this difference, Asp43 retains its hydrogen-bond with the N-1 atom of IMP in both subunits. In essence, IMP is bound to chain A as in the fully ligated complex of the basic isozyme, whereas IMP binds to chain B in a mode not observed in any previous structure of the synthetase.Significant differences in the ligation of chains A and B extend beyond the IMP pocket to the l-aspartate and GTP pockets. A molecule of acetate hydrogen-bonds with the side chains of Thr333A and Arg335A and backbone amides 332A and 333A (essentially the putative β-carboxylate site forl-aspartate). The corresponding site at chain B is free of electron density, and the side chain of Arg335B extends far into the solvent. A second molecule of acetate occupies the β-phosphoryl site of the GTP pocket in chain A, hydrogen-bonding to backbone amides 45A and 46A, the side chain of Lys46A, and either a water molecule or the side chain of His71A. Interactions of the acetate anion at the GTP pocket are virtually identical to those of β-phosphoryl group of GDP in the fully ligated complex (see below). In the GTP pocket of chain B a second molecule of IMP binds along with Mg2+ (Fig. 3). The base and ribose of IMP here have interactions similar to those of GDP in its full"
https://openalex.org/W2091665792,"Two subfamilies of UDP-GlcNAc C6 dehydratases were recently identified. FlaA1, a short soluble protein that exhibits a typical SYK catalytic triad, characterizes one of these subfamilies, and WbpM, a large membrane protein that harbors an altered SMK triad that was not predicted to sustain activity, represents the other subfamily. This study focuses on investigating the structure and function of these C6 dehydratases and the role of the altered triad as well as additional amino acid residues involved in catalysis. The significant activity retained by the FlaA1 Y141M triad mutant and the low activity of the WbpM M438Y mutant indicated that the methionine residue was involved in catalysis. A Glu589 residue, which is conserved only within the large homologues, was shown to be essential for activity in WbpM. Introduction of this residue in FlaA1 enhanced the activity of the corresponding V266E mutant. Hence, this glutamate residue might be responsible for the retention of catalytic efficiency in the large homologues despite alteration of their catalytic triad. Mutations of residues specific for the short homologues (Asp70, Asp149-Lys150, Cys103) abolished the activity of FlaA1. Among them, C103M prevented dimerization but did not significantly affect the secondary structure. The fact that we could identify subfamily-specific residues that are essential for catalysis suggested an independent evolution for each subfamily of C6 dehydratases. Finally, the loss of activity of the FlaA1 G20A mutant provided evidence that a cofactor is involved in catalysis, and kinetic study of the FlaA1 H86A mutant revealed that this conserved histidine is involved in substrate binding. None of the mutations investigated altered the substrate, product, and function specificity of these enzymes. Two subfamilies of UDP-GlcNAc C6 dehydratases were recently identified.

Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1295-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both enzymes catalyze the stereo-specific conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to Qui2NAc1 via the formation of a 4-keto, 6-deoxy intermediate. They are both highly specific for their substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, and exhibit no activity with closely related substrates, such as UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, or UDP-GalNAc, or with substrates of other known C6 dehydratases such as GDP-mannose or dTDP-glucose. This is consistent with the fact that, despite their dehydratase activity, FlaA1 and WbpM exhibit very limited sequence similarity with other known C6 dehydratases, such as GDP-d-mannose (3Sullivan F.X.

In contrast, they are homologous to C4 epimerases such as GalE fromEscherichia coli (45% homology) (15Frey P.A.

Hence, FlaA1 and WbpM are representative members of a larger family of bifunctional dehydratases/reductases that is characterized by the presence of five conserved domains organized in the same pattern (1Creuzenet C.

One of these motifs corresponds to the signature for nucleotide-binding proteins. Another corresponds to an α-helicoidal segment, where the typical SYK catalytic triad that defines enzymes of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family is found (17Jornvall H. Persson B.

Based on the size and cellular localization of the enzymes as well as the presence or absence of a SYK catalytic triad, the family of bifunctional dehydratases/reductases can be further divided into two subfamilies.

In addition, these large homologues have been shown to be essential for the production of surface carbohydrates that contain Qui2NAc or a derivative and are all associated with bacterial virulence. Understanding their mechanism of action is a prerequisite to the rational design of inhibitors with high specificity toward these enzymes and a broad spectrum of activity against all of the bacteria that harbor the homologues. In the ever expanding SDR protein family, the level of identity between enzymes is rather low (15–30%), and the tyrosine of the catalytic triad has been observed as one of the few absolutely conserved residues (17Jornvall H.

Biol. 2000; 303: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At most, 0.25% of wild-type catalytic activity was reported using a Y/C dehydrogenase mutant (41Chen Z. Jiang J.C. Lin Z.G. Lee W.R. Baker M.E. Chang S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Such an essential role of the tyrosine in the catalytic triad was also confirmed in the case of C6 dehydratases (9Snipes C.E. Brillinger G.U. Sellers L. Mascaro L. Floss H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8113-8117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12He X. Thorson J.S. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hence, it is intriguing that WbpM and its large homologues have the capacity to perform catalysis via the formation of a 4-keto intermediate, since they contain an altered catalytic triad lacking the central tyrosine. This suggests that, in this subfamily of UDP-GlcNAc C6 dehydratases, another residue must assume the role of the catalytic base and/or that the catalytic mechanism involved might be slightly different. A site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to investigate the role of the tyrosine and methionine residues in the SYK and SMK catalytic triads present in FlaA1 and WbpM, respectively. The catalytic role of charged residues specific for each subfamily was also investigated. Also, FlaA1 and WbpM exhibit the GXXGXXG signature for nucleotide binding proteins and also share a conserved alternating α-helicoidal/β-sheeted secondary structure that, in SDR proteins, delineates a Rossmann fold essential for nucleotide cofactor binding. The importance of this fingerprint sequence for nucleotide cofactor binding and activity has been demonstrated previously by the abolition of protein activity by single point mutations (42Coleman W.G., Jr. Leive L. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 899-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Deacon A.M., Ni, Y.S. Coleman W.G., Jr. Ealick S.E. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that FlaA1, like C4 epimerases and unlike other C6 dehydratases, might recycle an internal nucleotide cofactor during catalysis, but no evidence for the existence of a bound cofactor could be obtained (1Creuzenet C. Schur M.J., Li, J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of residues potentially involved in Rossmann fold formation and cofactor binding was performed in FlaA1 to address this question. Finally, most C4 epimerases and C6 dehydratases have been shown to exist as dimers and tetramers under physiological conditions, but the importance of oligomerization for activity is not fully understood (10Allard S.T.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous studies on dehydrogenases, epimerases, and dehydratases showed that the interactions between subunits involved mostly the N-terminal moiety of the proteins and more specifically the conserved long α-helices 4 and 5 (17Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 44Deacon A.M., Ni, Y.S.

Bolognesi M. Structure. 1998; 6: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For clarity, these helices correspond to amino acid residues 97–120 and 140–160 in FlaA1 based on secondary structure prediction using the ExPASy molecular biology software (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.ch). Because the N-terminal moiety of SDR enzymes is also devoted to cofactor binding, it is possible that oligomerization and cofactor binding are interdependent. Each subunit possesses its own cofactor-binding site, so that nucleotide cofactor binding should be stoichiometric with the amount of enzyme if it is independent of oligomerization. However, several studies report a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of cofactor per dimer of protein (12He X. Thorson J.S. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 46Bisso A. Sturla L.

Chem. 1969; 244: 3430-3437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that dimerization might promote cofactor binding and hence be essential for activity. Moreover, the helix 5 that is involved in oligomerization contains the tyrosine and lysine residues of the catalytic triad. Hence, it is possible that participation of this helix in oligomer formation results in a slightly different structure at the level of the catalytic site, which could also have a significant effect on the activity. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that some SDR proteins crystallize as a dimer in an asymmetric unit, where substantial differences have been observed between the structures of the binding sites of two monomers (39Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that dimerization might be responsible for fine tuning of the active site configuration. Hence, cofactor binding and oligomerization might be interconnected phenomena that affect enzymatic activity. In the case of FlaA1, the formation of a dimer under physiological conditions has been described previously, but the residues essential for the process have not been identified (1Creuzenet C. Schur M.J., Li, J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In FlaA1 and other short homologues, the α-helix 4, which is potentially involved in dimerization, contains two conserved cysteine residues (Cys103 and Cys118). Their potential role for dimerization and stabilization of protein structure was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. This report presents the structure-function characterization of mutants of FlaA1 and WbpM with a view to explain their particular biochemical and catalytic properties. The effects of the mutations on protein structure and dimerization were investigated by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and gel filtration chromatography. The substrate specificity and physico-kinetic characteristics of each mutant were determined by capillary electrophoresis analysis of the reaction products. The results reveal novel essential catalytic residues and provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of action of these dehydratases/reductases that are devoid of the usual SYK triad. Unless stated otherwise, all chemical reagents used were from Sigma, and all cloning was performed in E. coli DH5α. All of the kits or enzymes were used following the manufacturers' instructions. Protein quantitation was performed using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with modifications according to Wang and Malcolm (49Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and codons that resulted in minimal mispairing were used to introduce the desired mutations (TableI). The templates for mutagenesis were His-FlaA1-pET and His-S262-pET. S262 corresponds to a soluble truncated version of WbpM where the four N-terminal transmembrane domains have been removed (2Creuzenet C. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1295-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For clarity, WbpM refers to the soluble truncated form S262 throughout this study. In both templates, the gene of interest was cloned into a pET23 derivative (50Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the presence of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (1Creuzenet C. Schur M.J., Li, J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

After mutagenesis, DNA sequencing was performed on each mutant construct to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and exclude the existence of any unwanted secondary mutation. DNA sequencing was performed at the Laboratory Services Division of the University of Guelph.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for the construction of site-directed mutantsa The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutations.b Forward and reverse primers are represented by plus or minus, respectively.c In the forward primer of H86A, where ATTGCA was highlighted, ATC was changed to ATT to lower the melting temperature, whereas GCA is the mutation to produce the alanine residue.

Proper clones carrying the desired mutations were transformed into CaCl2-competentE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and protein expression was carried out as described previously (1Creuzenet C.

Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1295-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In some cases, conditions for protein expression were modified to circumvent the production of mutant proteins as inclusion bodies. Incubations were performed at 30 °C instead of 37 °C, and growth was performed in Tryptone/phosphate medium (51Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) instead of Terrific broth. The concentration of the inducer isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside varied from 0.15 to 1 mm. The wild-type and mutant proteins were purified by low pressure nickel chelation chromatography as described elsewhere (1Creuzenet C. Schur M.J., Li, J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The fractions containing pure protein were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, adjusted to pH 7, and concentrated using polyethylene glycol 8000 before use for activity assays. Typically, reactions were carried out using 0.75 mm UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate. For WbpM and its mutants, 0.14 mm of NAD+ was added to the reactions. The reactions were incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, at 37 °C, for FlaA1 and its mutants, or in bis-Tris-propane, pH 10, at 30 °C for WbpM and its mutants. The specific composition of each reaction mix and the reaction time are indicated in the legend of each figure. For the determination of kinetic parameters, reactions were performed in a total volume of 70 μl with 0.7–3.8 μg of pure enzyme. Incubations were performed at the optimum pH and temperature determined for each mutant as indicated in TableII. To account for the high and lowKm for UDP-GlcNAc of WbpM and FlaA1, respectively, the substrate concentration varied from 0.05 to 3.5 mm for mutants of WbpM and from 0.02 to 1.5 mm for mutants of FlaA1. The reactions were quenched by boiling for 6 min. To investigate the substrate specificity, UDP-GlcNAc was replaced by UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, GDP-mannose, or dTDP-Glc.Table IISummary of all the mutants constructed and their main propertiesMutantExpression conditions2-aTB, terrific broth; Tr-P, Tryptone/phosphate medium (40).SolubilityActivitySuspected roleWild-type FlaA12-bMain properties of wild-type FlaA1 are derived from Creuzenet et al.

We have identified a new mechanism by which Rad52 protein stimulates Rad51 protein-promoted DNA strand exchange. This function of Rad52 protein is revealed when subsaturating amounts (relative to the single-stranded DNA concentration) of replication protein-A (RPA) are used. Under these conditions, Rad52 protein is needed for extensive DNA strand exchange. Interestingly, in this new role, Rad52 protein neither acts simply as a single strand DNA-binding protein per se nor, in contrast to its previously identified stimulatory roles, does it require physical interaction with RPA because it can be substituted by the Escherichia colisingle strand DNA-binding protein.

Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 334-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1991: 407-521Google Scholar). For these processes, there exist multiple pathways that can be distinguished according to their need for Rad51 protein, the structural and functional homologue of the Escherichia coli DNA strand exchange protein, RecA. Both RAD51-dependent andRAD51-independent pathways exist, and they share a common requirement for RAD52 (1Pacques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 334-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins of theRAD52 epistasis group interact directly with one or more other proteins of the group. Rad52 protein physically interacts with Rad51 protein (3Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and with replication protein-A (RPA) (4Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Massey P. Banerjee R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the yeast functional homologue of the E. coli single strand DNA-binding protein SSB. Rad51 protein promotes DNA strand exchange in vitro (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Using the single strand circular and homologous linear duplex DNA substrate system, complete heteroduplex formation by Rad51 protein was strongly dependent on the presence of RPA. RPA maximizes heteroduplex product yield by increasing the amount of ssDNA that can be incorporated into the active complex, which is composed of Rad51 protein and ssDNA and known as the presynaptic filament. In this respect, the RecA protein- and Rad51 protein-promoted reactions are different. Although SSB stimulates the activity of RecA protein, RecA protein can promote a significant level of DNA strand exchange in the absence of SSB (6Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most effective level of RPA was found to be that which could completely saturate the ssDNA (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and complete product formation was extremely sensitive to the order of protein addition to ssDNA (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). When Rad51 protein is introduced to the ssDNA before RPA, DNA strand exchange occurs efficiently. However, RPA and Rad51 protein compete for binding to the same ssDNA binding sites. Because RPA binds more rapidly to ssDNA, when RPA is bound to ssDNA prior to or simultaneous with Rad51 protein, formation of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament is inhibited and DNA strand exchange is blocked. Consequently, while RPA is an essential cofactor for DNA strand exchange, it is also an inhibitor because of its ability to outcompete Rad51 protein for binding to ssDNA. Although dsDNA is a substrate in the reaction, it too can inhibit the reaction by tightly binding and sequestering Rad51 protein (8Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) when present prior to the formation of a functional Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex. We and others (9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 10Sung P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) have shown that Rad52 protein can surmount these inhibitory effects to increase DNA strand exchange. Using a mechanism that is dependent on specific Rad52-RPA and Rad52-Rad51 protein-protein interactions, Rad52 protein allows Rad51 to gain access to the ssDNA by facilitating the displacement of RPA. In targeting Rad51 protein to ssDNA, Rad52 protein also reduces the sequestration of Rad51 protein by dsDNA. The effect of Rad52 protein on DNA strand exchange can be summarized by its ability to increase the assembly of a critical component of the reaction, the presynaptic filament. Here we have demonstrated that Rad52 protein can stimulate DNA strand exchange by acting in a different manner, one that does not require RPA as an intermediary. Rad52 protein was purified as described (9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Rad51 protein was purified as described (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A cleared lysate was prepared in 500 mm KCl and fractionated over Q-Sepharose. Flow-through fractions were pooled, reduced to 200 mm KCl by dialysis, and applied to a Cibacron blue column from which Rad51 protein eluted at 1 mKCl. The sizing chromatography step was omitted. RPA was purified as described (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), as were SSB (12LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage lambda DNA Replication.Ph.D. thesis. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1985Google Scholar) and RecA (13Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). φX174 ss- and dsDNA were purchased from New England Biolabs. The duplex linear substrate was produced by PstI digestion of φX174 dsDNA followed by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction, ether extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspension in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA). DNA strand exchange reactions were performed essentially as described (9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions (12.5 μl) were assembled with 42.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm ATP, and 33 μm (nucleotides) φX174 ssDNA (New England Biolabs). Saturating levels of Rad51 protein (11 μm) were used in all experiments. RPA concentration was as indicated with the stoichiometric (1×) concentration equal to 1 μm (1 RPA per 30 nucleotides). Unless noted otherwise, a 1× concentration of Rad52 protein (0.77 μm) was used where 1× equals one Rad52 protein per 37.5 nt. In experiments usingE. coli SSB to replace RPA, it was added at the concentrations specified; a 1× concentration corresponds to the level needed to saturate the ssDNA, which is 1 SSB monomer per 15 nt. When RecA protein was substituted for Rad51 protein, it was present in stoichiometric amounts equal to one RecA protein per 3 nt; the magnesium ion concentration was 4 mm, the ATP concentration was 1 mm, and an ATP regeneration system was included (13Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Except where specified, the order of protein addition was Rad51 protein, RPA, and Rad52 protein. Where used, E. coliproteins (RecA protein and SSB) replaced their yeast counterparts (Rad51 protein and RPA, respectively) using the same order of addition. The incubation time between the addition of each protein was kept constant at 5 min. Five minutes following the addition of all proteins (except where noted), the reaction was initiated by the addition ofPstI-linearized φX174 dsDNA to a final concentration of 33 μm (base pairs). Spermidine acetate was added to a final concentration of 4 mm. Reactions were terminated after 90 min, or at the indicated times, by addition of SDS (0.5% final concentration) and proteinase K (1 mg/ml final concentration) followed by incubation at 37° for 15 min prior to addition of gel loading buffer and application onto 1% agarose gels. After electrophoresis at 40 V for 17 h in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA) buffer, the gels were stained in ethidium bromide, rinsed, and photographed using a Gel Print 2000i (Biophotonics) gel documentation system. The resulting image was analyzed using ImageQuant 5.0 software. ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C as described (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In reactions examining the effect of salt, NaCl was added immediately following the addition of dsDNA. We addressed the possibility that Rad52 protein might function to stimulate DSB repair and homologous recombination in ways not previously identified. Our approach was to use reaction conditions that were suboptimal for DNA strand exchange. Optimal conditions require concentrations of Rad51 protein capable of saturating all sites on the ssDNA so that assembly of a full-length, uninterrupted Rad51-ssDNA filament is possible (and preventable only by the presence of a secondary structure). These conditions require that RPA, which is responsible for melting these stably paired regions of ssDNA, also be present in stoichiometric amounts. Saturating levels correspond to ratios of 1:3 nt for Rad51 protein and 1:30 nt for RPA (defined as 1×) (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, when both proteins are used at these levels, prior formation of a RPA-ssDNA complex inhibits DNA strand exchange (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) by blocking formation of the Rad51 protein-ssDNA presynaptic filament. Addition of Rad52 protein antagonizes this inhibition and restores formation of the nicked circle product (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). We anticipated that when RPA is allowed to associate with ssDNA prior to Rad51 protein (“RPA-first” reactions) reducing RPA to subsaturating levels should permit access by Rad51 protein to the ssDNA. If nucleation of the Rad51 presynaptic filament were the limiting step in RPA displacement, then RPA displacement would be rapid and little stimulation by Rad52 protein should be expected. Instead, stimulation by Rad52 protein is seen at all subsaturating RPA levels tested (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6, 8,10, 12). Strikingly, the RPA concentration can be reduced 67% without reducing product yield (lane 6) because complete DNA strand exchange, as signified by nicked circular DNA formation, is equal to or even slightly exceeds that observed with saturating RPA (lane 4). These results suggest that Rad52 protein may complement RPA function. Because interpretation of this effect is complicated by the possibility that some of the stimulation may yet be attributable to eviction of RPA by Rad52 protein, reactions were repeated with Rad51 protein added prior to RPA. Rad52 protein has only a minor effect when saturating RPA is present (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5) but clearly stimulates product formation at all subsaturating levels (lanes 7, 9, 11, 13,15), indicating unambiguously that Rad52 protein can complement RPA function. An additional effect of Rad52 protein is also evident in these experiments. Although a stoichiometric level of Rad51 protein is required for efficient DNA strand exchange, Rad51 protein alone is not sufficient to produce stably paired molecules because only negligible levels of joint species are formed when RPA is omitted (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, when Rad52 protein is included in the absence of RPA, joint molecules are formed at levels comparable to that produced when RPA is present but no Rad52 protein is added (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2and 3). The ability of Rad52 protein to substitute for RPA was unexpected because these two proteins mediate apparently antagonistic reactions: RPA denatures secondary structure (14Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) whereas the robust annealing activity of Rad52 protein promotes duplex DNA formation (15Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stimulation may result from an increase in both reaction rate and extent. Time courses performed at optimal RPA levels show that neither the rate nor the extent of nicked circular DNA formation is dependent on Rad52 protein, and each reaction is 50% complete by 25 min (Fig.2 A). However, at 0.25× RPA, the result is significantly different: primarily by eliminating a lag phase of about 30 min, Rad52 protein reduces the time for 50% completion from 65 to 35 min (Fig. 2 B), which is much closer to the time needed with 1× RPA. If dsDNA is introduced prior to the formation of a Rad51-ssDNA complex, the Rad51 protein (which binds rapidly and tightly to dsDNA) becomes sequestered and DNA strand exchange is inhibited (8Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In RPA-first reactions, we showed previously that stimulation by Rad52 protein increased directly with the length of time between the additions of Rad52 protein and dsDNA (9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This time dependence reflects the kinetics of RPA displacement and incorporation of Rad51 protein into the nucleoprotein filament, which prevents sequestration of Rad51 protein by dsDNA. 2T. Sugiyama and S. Kowalczykowski, submitted for publication. We performed comparable Rad51 protein-first experiments and varied the interval from 0 to 15 min (Fig. 3,lanes 6, 8, 10). No time-dependent difference was observed. This suggests that Rad52 protein either alters the filament quickly in such a way that Rad51 protein cannot be sequestered by dsDNA or, alternatively, that it acts later in DNA strand exchange. If Rad52 protein simply functioned as an alternative SSB, a reduction in the amount of RPA should require a compensatory increase in the level of Rad52 protein. To test this expectation, the concentration of Rad52 protein was varied at three different levels of RPA. As seen in Fig. 4, there was no systematic increase in the amount of Rad52 protein needed as the RPA concentration was reduced. These results suggest instead that, because the optimal level of Rad52 protein remains approximately constant, the concentration at which its effect is strongest is determined by a fixed level of some other species, possibly the presynaptic filament. Also supportive of the hypothesis that Rad52 protein does not act as an SSB per se is the fact that it cannot completely replace RPA. We note, however, that in reactions containing Rad51 and Rad52 proteins (but no RPA) a small amount of product formation (∼3–4%) is reproducibly observed (Fig. 1 A, lane 2; Fig. 1 B,lane 3; Fig. 3, lanes 2–4; Fig.5, lanes 2 and 3) that is never seen in reactions containing only Rad51 protein (Fig.1 B, lane 2).Figure 5Stimulation of DNA strand exchange does not require a specific interaction with RPA.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We exploited this fact to test whether specific protein interactions were required for complementation of RPA function by Rad52 protein. At a 1× concentration of SSB, no stimulation by Rad52 protein is detected (data not shown). However, at all lower levels tested, although product formation was proportional to the level of SSB, as expected and as seen also with RPA, we found that Rad52 protein stimulated complete DNA strand transfer (Fig. 5). This indicates that stimulation is not mediated by an interaction of Rad52 protein with RPA and, moreover, does not even require RPA. Substitution of RecA protein for Rad51 protein in reactions containing various concentrations of either RPA (Fig. 6 A) or SSB protein (Fig.6 B) failed to support stimulation, suggesting that Rad52 protein exerts its effect through specific interaction with Rad51 protein. How this interaction might affect the presynaptic filament and how it might affect the response of the filament to challenge by salt was examined using the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rad51 as a measure of Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex formation. The results presented in Fig. 7 show that in the absence of added NaCl, Rad51 protein ATPase activity was increased by about 20% upon addition of Rad52 protein, in line with the level of stimulation previously reported using the same substrate (11Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). When NaCl was present, up to a concentration of 500 mm, including Rad52 protein resulted in an enhancement of activity by an extent similar in magnitude to that seen in reactions devoid of salt. Our observation that Rad52 protein can compensate for a reduction in RPA concentration appears to contradict the findings of Song and Sung (18Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), who concluded that Rad52 protein had no effect. Their reaction conditions, which included 50 mm KCl as well as a change in the order of protein addition such that RPA was added after Rad51 and Rad52 proteins were simultaneously allowed to bind ssDNA, differed from ours. These variations were tested individually to determine which, if either, could account for the observed discrepancy. Although altering the staging of protein addition did have a modest effect in our hands, the presence of 50 mm KCl was sufficient to abrogate stimulation by Rad52 protein (Fig.8 A). Because the yield of nicked circular DNA product was less than that seen in Fig. 2, most likely due to the use of a somewhat less active preparation of Rad52 protein, a time course of DNA strand exchange was also performed to confirm the effect of the addition of KCl. The results (Fig.8 B) are completely consistent with those in Fig.8 A, and they show more specifically that 50 mmKCl restores the lag phase eliminated by Rad52 protein in the absence of salt (Fig. 2). The kinetics of product formation in the reaction containing both KCl and Rad52 protein are identical to those of reactions, with or without added salt, where Rad52 protein is omitted. The difference in our observations can, therefore, be fully explained by this effect. Rad52 protein interacts physically and in a species-specific manner with Rad51 protein and RPA. An important conclusion drawn fromin vitro analysis is that this property is critical, under conditions expected to reflect those present in the cell, for Rad52 protein to properly coordinate the series of steps which lead to the renaturation of complementary ssDNA or the exchange of DNA strands over several kilobases. For the DNA strand exchange reaction examined in this work, previous studies demonstrated that under optimal conditions where Rad51 protein and RPA are at saturating levels relative to ssDNA, the severe inhibition of product formation that occurs when RPA is allowed to bind ssDNA prior to Rad51 protein can be reversed by Rad52 protein. To examine other possible functions of Rad52 protein in DNA strand exchange, we investigated its effect when conditions were rendered suboptimal by limiting the amount of RPA. Our results demonstrate that Rad52 protein can stimulate the formation of completely exchanged DNA strands, thereby compensating for a reduction in RPA, and that this stimulation is seen irrespective of the order of RPA or Rad51 protein binding to ssDNA relative to the binding of Rad52 protein. This effect is particularly evident in an RPA-first reaction in which addition of Rad52 protein restores product yield to that seen with optimal conditions even though the concentration of RPA was reduced by two-thirds (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and6). Joint molecule production is also affected by Rad52 protein. Formation of these partially exchanged intermediates is normally dependent on the presence of RPA because they are not readily formed by Rad51 protein alone. In this case as well, Rad52 protein can substitute for RPA (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and3; Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). The enhancement of both joint molecule intermediates and nicked circle products by Rad52 protein seen here differs significantly from the behavior of HsRad52 protein. In a reaction that showed no stimulation by RPA, HsRad51 protein-mediated joint molecule formation could be stimulated by HsRad52 protein when HsRad51 protein was reduced 2-fold to a suboptimal level (19Benson F.E. Baumann P. West S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, at a saturating level (such as that used in this work) of HsRad51 protein, HsRad52 protein actually inhibited DNA strand exchange (20Baumann P. West S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To eliminate a lengthy lag phase such that the rate as well as the extent of DNA strand exchange is increased, Rad52 protein must accelerate a rate-limiting step, and formation of the presynaptic filament is a good candidate for this step. Consistent with a role in filament assembly is the fact that the addition of dsDNA, which essentially quenches filament formation by its ability to bind Rad51 protein, is not inhibitory when added immediately after the addition of Rad52 protein (Fig. 3). This result suggests that all of the Rad51 protein is engaged quickly in the presynaptic filament. The reduction in the amount of time required for Rad52 protein to act on the filament via its effect on Rad51 protein presumably reflects the fact that the need to first displace RPA while simultaneously promoting the nucleation/binding of Rad51 protein has been greatly reduced or eliminated when Rad51 is allowed to bind ssDNA before RPA. This rapid effect contrasts with the situation in RPA-first reactions where the yield of complete products is proportional to the amount of time between addition of Rad52 protein and dsDNA (9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The amount of Rad52 protein needed to elicit a maximal stimulatory response remained almost invariant over a 9-fold range of RPA concentrations, indicating that Rad52 protein is not acting as an SSBper se (Fig. 4). If it were, RPA and Rad52 protein levels should be inversely related because less ssDNA is bound when RPA is decreased. This observation indicated that the concentration of Rad52 protein is set by a constant level of some other component of the reaction, such as the presynaptic complex. An inference from this result is that Rad52 protein acts through Rad51 protein but independently of RPA. This hypothesis was tested in the following two ways. 1) When RecA was substituted for Rad51 protein, no stimulation was detected when either RPA (Fig. 6 A) or SSB (Fig.6 B) was present. 2) When Rad51 protein was used and RPA was replaced by SSB, Rad52 protein stimulated nicked circle production at all subsaturating levels examined (Fig. 5). We conclude that although DNA strand exchange requires ssDNA binding activity, the stimulatory effect of RAD52 protein is a consequence of specific interactions with Rad51 protein and does not demand direct interaction with RPA, which is, in fact, completely dispensable. In attempting to understand how Rad52 protein might function, some models can be eliminated from consideration. One possibility is that Rad52 protein acts postsynaptically in a manner analogous to SSB. SSB increases the yield of strand exchange product by binding the displaced strand and inhibiting the binding of RecA protein that could lead to strand re-invasion and a return to starting substrates (21Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If Rad52 protein were to bind to the displaced strand, however, it could recruit any available Rad51 protein, as has been shown for the presynaptic phase of DNA strand exchange (9New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). It might then actually promote re-invasion which would, consequently, reduce product yield. Therefore, a postsynaptic role seems unlikely. Another possibility is that Rad52 protein, via specific interaction with RPA, increases the RPA concentration for a subpopulation of presynaptic complexes to achieve levels closer to saturation. This model is untenable because SSB, which can substitute for RPA, is not known to interact with Rad52 protein. In a third model, Rad52 protein can participate as an SSB protein. This scenario predicts that the optimal level of Rad52 protein would be directly proportional to the amount of ssDNA left unbound by RPA. This model is inadequate because the data in Fig. 4 (showing that the optimal Rad52 protein concentration is essentially unchanged as RPA concentration is varied) are not congruent with this prediction. Instead we favor a role for Rad52 protein during presynapsis, where it stabilizes the presynaptic filament and/or potentiates the ability of Rad51 protein to penetrate regions of weaker secondary structure. Results published by Shinohara and Ogawa (11Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), showing that Rad52 protein stimulates the rate of Rad51 protein-dependent ATP hydrolysis, support such a filament stabilizing role. Our work here has confirmed this result and extended it by demonstrating a Rad52 protein-dependent enhancement of ATPase activity in the presence of NaCl concentrations up to 500 mm (Fig. 7). Because this stimulation is relatively constant over the range tested, a formal possibility is that Rad52 protein directly affects the ssDNA-dependent Rad51 protein ATP turnover number. Evidence from the same set of experiments (Fig. 3a of Ref. 11Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) suggests that this is not the case. The rate of ATP hydrolysis in reactions containing stoichiometric amounts of Rad51 protein and RPA (conditions which promote complete filament formation) is identical to the rate in reactions that also contain Rad52 protein. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the mere presence of Rad52 protein is not sufficient to increase the ATP turnover rate by Rad51 protein. Additionally, we are unaware of any precedent for this type of effect on the extensively characterized E. coli RecA protein. In a second experiment, Shinohara and Ogawa (11Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) observed that the ATPase activity of Rad51 protein could be inhibited by SSB protein, which occurs as a consequence of the competition between these two proteins for binding to ssDNA. Addition of Rad52 protein to reactions containing both Rad51 protein and SSB, however, resulted in a severalfold increase in ATPase activity over the SSB-depressed level. When the findings presented here are taken together with earlier results (9–11,19), a more unified picture of Rad52 protein activity emerges in which it plays two separate, successive roles to stimulate both the extent and the rate of DNA strand exchange. In the first role, Rad52 protein facilitates the displacement of RPA and assists, along with the Rad55/Rad57 heterodimer (22Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), the loading of Rad51 protein onto ssDNA. Rad52 protein in its second role promotes formation of a single contiguous filament by contributing additional stability through its physical interaction with Rad51 protein, resulting in the reduced RPA requirement seen here. The description of a new stimulatory role for Rad52 protein in recombination and DSB repair provides additional evidence for and insight into the complex interplay in these processes between Rad52 protein, Rad51 protein, and RPA. RPA, besides its role in homologous recombination, is required for DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair and in yeast also acts as a transcription regulatory factor (for review, see Ref. 14Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). An implication of this work is that Rad52 protein may buffer DNA strand exchange from the competing demands of other RPA-requiring processes, especially under conditions of severe genotoxic stress, by substantially expanding the range of RPA concentrations over which DSB repair can efficiently occur.

The lateral segregation of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in the lipid bilayer was detected through quenching between NBD-PGs upon the reconstitution of signal peptide into the liposome made with the<i>Escherichia coli</i> inner membrane composition. The tendency of lipid segregation was highly dependent on the export competency of signal peptides <i>in vivo</i>, with a decreasing order of wild-type, revertant, and mutant species. The colocalizations of pyrene-PG with BODIPY-PG were also induced by the signal peptides, confirming the phase separation of the acidic phospholipid. The wild-type and revertant signal peptides predominantly formed α-helical conformations with the presence of acidic phospholipid as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. In addition, they restricted the motion of lipid acyl chains as monitored by fluorescence anisotropy of DPH, suggesting a deep penetration of signal peptide into the lipid bilayer. However, the α-helical content of mutant signal peptide was only about half that of the wild-type or revertant peptide with a significantly smaller degree of penetration into the bilayer. An association of the defective signal peptides into the membrane was affected by salt extraction, whereas the functional ones were not. The aforementioned results indicate that the functionality of signal peptide is accomplished through its topologies in the membrane and also by its ability to induce lateral segregation of acidic phospholipid. We propose that the clustering of acidic phospholipid by the functional signal peptide is responsible for the formation of non-bilayer membrane structure, thereby promoting an efficient translocation of secretory proteins."

Although it catalyzes a redox reaction rather than ATP hydrolysis, transhydrogenase is in this category of proteins, and its amenable properties make it an excellent model for studying conformational coupling (reviewed in Refs.3Bizouarn T.

Thus, transhydrogenase is important as a source of NADPH for biosynthesis and glutathione reduction (for protection against free-radical damage) and in the regulation of flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (5Rydstrom J.

Genes encoding transhydrogenase have also been found in several protozoan parasites. In Plasmodium falciparum the enzyme is probably located in the mitochondrial membrane, but in Eimeria tenella it is thought to be associated with so-called “refractile bodies” (7Vermeulen A.N. Kok J.J. Van Den Boogart P. Dijkema R. Claessens J.A.J. FEMS Micobiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 223-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in Entamoeba histolytica, with “mitosomes” (8Tovar J. Fischer A. Clark C.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), otherwise known as “cryptons” (9Ghosh S. Field J. Rogers R. Hickman M. Samuelson J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4319-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The functions of the Ei. tenella refractile bodies and theEn. histolytica mitosomes and the nature of the partner proteins that are coupled to the transhydrogenase in the local chemiosmotic proton circuits are not known. The partner proteins are probably not enzymes normally associated with oxidative phosphorylation (10Reeves R.E. Adv. Parasitol. 1984; 23: 105-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All proton-translocating transhydrogenases seem to have a similar structural organization. There is a dII component, which spans the membrane, and dI and dIII components, which protrude from the membrane on the matrix side in mitochondria and on the cytoplasmic side in bacteria. The dI component binds NAD+/NADH, and dIII binds NADP+/NADPH. The manner in which the three components relate to the polypeptide composition varies in different species (Fig.1). In animal mitochondria, all three transhydrogenase components are on the same polypeptide chain; it runs dI-dII-dIII, N terminus to C terminus. In bacteria, gene sequences show that the dII component is always separated into dIIa and dIIb. InEscherichia coli transhydrogenase (and in the enzyme from some other bacterial species) an α polypeptide comprises dI plus dIIa, and a β polypeptide comprises dIIb plus dIII. In transhydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum (and some other bacterial species) there are three polypeptides; PntAA comprises dI, PntAB comprises dIIa, and PntB comprises dIIb plus dIII. The predicted order of components in the single polypeptide chain of transhydrogenase from the protozoan parasites (from the gene sequences) is dIIb-dIII-dI-dIIa. Thus, the N terminus of the protein corresponds to the N terminus of the bacterial β polypeptide (PntB). An extra segment (38 amino acid residues in both Ei. tenella andEn. histolytica) is predicted between dIII and dI and probably serves as a linker. We recently expressed the dIII-linker-dI fragment of En. histolytica transhydrogenase from cloned DNA in cells of E. coli and purified the protein (henceforth denotedehdIII-ehdI)1in substantial yields (11Weston C.J. White S.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Like complexes formed from mixtures of isolated dI and dIII from the transhydrogenases of other species (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Fjellstrom O.

This shows that, as in other complexes, hydride transfer between nucleotides bound to the dI and dIII components of ehdIII-ehdI is fast, and the release of NADP(H) from dIII is slow (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and hydrodynamic studies show that the mammalian transhydrogenase is a homodimer (17Anderson W.M. Fisher R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Persson B. Ahnstrom G. Rydstrom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that the E. coli enzyme is a comparable α2β2tetramer (19Hou C. Potier M. Bragg P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); both enzymes are essentially “dimers” of the two “trimeric” units of dI, dII, and dIII. The high-resolution crystal structures of isolated dI (20Buckley P.A. Jackson J.B. Schneider T. White S.A. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 809-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the complex of dI and dIII (21Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B.

The structure of the R. rubrum complex and its hydrodynamic (22Venning J.D. Rodrigues D.J. Weston C.J. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Errington N. Finet S. White S.A. Jackson J.B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) properties reveal another important feature,i.e. only one dIII polypeptide binds to the two polypeptides of the dI dimer. Because hydride transfer across the single dI/dIII interface of the complex is extremely rapid (25Pinheiro T.J.T. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44757-44761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it was proposed that in the complete enzyme the two dI/dIII interfaces must be alternately brought together during turnover. The proposal is supported by earlier studies indicating “half of the sites” reactivity for bovine transhydrogenase (26Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and by another investigation in which inactivation of the bovine enzyme by high concentrations of Triton X-100 was attributed to the dissociation of dimers into monomers (18Persson B. Ahnstrom G. Rydstrom J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we use the tethered complex ofehdIII-ehdI and a tethered hybrid complex ofEn. histolytica dIII and R. rubrum dI to show the importance of dimeric interactions between dI units in hydride transfer. The unique properties of the parasite transhydrogenase provide further evidence for site alternation during transhydrogenase turnover and begin to reveal the structural basis for this process. TetheredehdIII-ehdI and isolated rrdI andrrdIII were expressed from plasmids pCJW3, pCD1, and pCD2, respectively, in the appropriate E. coli host cells as described (11Weston C.J. White S.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DNA coding for isolated ehdI (amino acid residues Leu565–Lys931) (29Clark C.G. Roger A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6518-6521Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers made by Alta Bioscience and a construct bearing the complete En. histolytica transhydrogenase gene generously provided by Dr. C. G. Clarke of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The DNA sequence of the “sense” primer was chosen to result in Leu-565 being changed to the N-terminal Met residue of the ehdI protein. DNA coding forehdIII (amino acids Met326–Lys527) was similarly amplified. The PCR products for ehdI andehdIII were (separately) ligated into pPCR-ScriptTM SK(+) using the PCR-Script Amp kit from Stratagene. After confirming that the DNA fragments were free of polymerase errors, they were cloned into pET21(d) from Novagen to give pCJW1 (for ehdI) and pCJW4 (for ehdIII). The constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (30Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were then grown to mid-log phase at 25 °C in NZCYM medium (see Ref. 11Weston C.J. White S.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 14 h. Growth at higher temperatures led to the aggregation of proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies from which active proteins could not be recovered by conventional refolding techniques. Cells bearing the plasmid coding for the dI construct grew very slowly, and relatively small amounts of recombinant protein were obtained. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and stored at −20 °C. As a preliminary step in the generation of DNA coding for the tethered hybrid ehdIII-rrdI, the internal NdeI site was removed from plasmid pCJW3 by site-directed mutagenesis of T to C at position 1360 using the Stratagene QuikChange kit and oligonucleotide primers from Alta Bioscience. This mutation does not change the amino acid sequence of the transcribed and translated gene. A new NdeI site was then introduced at the 5′-end of the DNA coding for the ehdI by mutagenesis of 1793G→C, 1796T→A, and 1798A→G. In the final construct this change results in the substitution of an Asp residue for a His at the extreme C terminus of the linker. DNA sequencing established that no errors were introduced by the polymerase. The NdeI-BamHI fragment (coding for En. histolytica dI) from this construct was replaced by the NdeI-BamHI fragment (coding forR. rubrum dI) from pCD1 using standard cloning procedures. The final construct, designated pCJW7, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and cells were grown, induced, harvested, washed, and stored as described above. TetheredehdIII-ehdI and isolated rrdI andrrdIII were purified by column chromatography as described (11Weston C.J. White S.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purification protocols for ehdIII andehdIII-rrdI were similar to those forehdIII-ehdI except that, in the case ofehdIII-rrdI, the protein solution was supplemented with 5% (rather than 10%) ammonium sulfate prior to the phenyl-Sepharose HP column, and the reverse gradient was from 5 to 0% saturation. To purify the ehdI protein, a substantial modification of our standard procedures was required. The thawed bacterial extract from 3.2 liters of culture was applied to a 5 × 30-cm column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). The column was developed with a gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled and then brought to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant, containing ehdI, was applied to a 2.6 × 25-cm column of butyl-Toyopearl (TosoHaas) pre-equilibrated in buffer A supplemented with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. The column was developed with a reverse gradient of ammonium sulfate (40–0% saturation), and recombinant protein was eluted in a final wash of buffer A. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to ∼3 ml in Vivascience centrifugal filters (10-kDa cutoff), and subjected to a final purification step on a 2.6 × 62-cm column of Hiload Superdex 200 in buffer A. The protein was stored in 25% glycerol at −80 °C in 2-ml thin-walled cryovials (Nalgene). During chromatography, proteins were assayed for transhydrogenation activity (see below) either alone or in the presence of partner nucleotide-binding proteins (dI or dIII) added in excess. Protein concentrations were determined by the microtannin procedure (31Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar); all values are given as polypeptide monomers. The final preparations were routinely examined by SDS-PAGE; all were >95% pure according to staining intensity with Page Blue 83. The amounts of nucleotide associated with the purified recombinant proteins were determined by enzymic assay after appropriate denaturation as described (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Prior to all experiments the stored proteins were thawed on ice, concentrated in Vivascience filters (5-kDa cutoff for dIII proteins, 10 kDa for all other proteins), and washed with reaction buffer (see the legends to Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol and 4 μm NADP+. Reverse transhydrogenation was measured as the reduction of the NAD+ analogue, AcPdAD+, by NADPH using the absorbance coefficient 6.07 mm−1 cm−1 at 375 nm (32Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cyclic transhydrogenation is the reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADH in the presence of NADP+ or NADPH (33Hutton M.N. Day J.M. Bizouarn T. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It corresponds to the reduction of NADP+ by NADH followed by the oxidation of NADPH by AcPdAD+; the reaction can occur without NADP(H) leaving the enzyme. Steady-state rates of transhydrogenation were measured (at 25 °C) in a PerkinElmer Lambda 16 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. Pre-steady-state kinetics were measured in anApplied Photophysics DX-17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer in its absorbance mode at 25 °C. The optical path length was 2 mm, and the slits were set to give 5-nm half-bandwidth. The mixing dead time was 1.31 ms (34Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol.

The sample and standards were separately applied to the column in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 μmNADP+. The molecular mass was calculated from a plot of logM r versus V e /V 0, whereV e is the volume required to elute the respective protein. Solution x-ray scattering data were collected following standard procedures on the X33 camera of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany. Scattering from the ehdIII-rrdI protein (271 μm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 μm NADP+was measured with a sample to a detector distance of 2.5 m. At a wavelength (λ) of 1.5 Å, the data covered the momentum transfer range 0.014 < s < 0.251 Å−1, wheres = (4πsinθ)/λ and θ is half the scattering angle. For molecular mass calibration, bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for the detector response using the program OTOKO (35Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McSweeney S. Nuc. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1986; 249: 399-407Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The buffer data were subtracted, and the results scaled for concentration using the program PRIMUS. 2P. A. Konarev and D. I. Svergun, unpublished data. The maximum diameter of the particle, the forward scattering value I(0), the radius of gyration R g, and the pair-distribution function p(r) were calculated from the scattering curve using the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (36Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar) with the data truncated tos = 0.1918 Å−1. Low-resolution dummy atom models were calculated using the program DAMMIN (37Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) operating in “slow” mode with a spherical initial search space. The models generated by DAMMIN were subjected to an interaxial alignment step with respect to the crystal structure of the R. rubrumdI2dIII1 complex (PDB 1HZZ) using the program SUPCOMB (38Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) followed by a round of manual refinement to permit the inclusion of a second dIII polypeptide using the program MASSHA (39Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Experimental curves were compared with the scattering curves predicted from the crystal structure of the R. rubrumdI2dIII1 complex and the truncated/extended forms thereof (see below) using the program CRYSOL (40Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Recombinant forms of isolated dI and dIII from En. histolytica transhydrogenase were expressed inE. coli and purified (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis by SDS-PAGE indicated that the monomer molecular masses of ehdI and ehdIII were ∼40 and ∼28 kDa, respectively (compare 39.7 and 22.0 kDa predicted from amino acid sequence data). Isolated recombinant dIII from transhydrogenases of other organisms also behaves anomalously on SDS-PAGE, and the reasons for this are not clear (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Gel exclusion chromatography under non-denaturing conditions indicated that, at 450 μm, recombinant ehdIII is probably monomeric (it eluted in a sharp peak at 29.4 kDa; see “Experimental Procedures”), but the recombinant ehdI protein eluted in a broad peak with molecular mass in the range 46–64 kDa. As found for other transhydrogenase dIII components (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Fjellstrom O.

Acta. 1999; 1411: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), purifiedehdIII was associated with tightly bound nucleotide (∼0.5 mol NADP+ and 0.4 mol NADPH mol−1 dIII). Separately, ehdI and ehdIII were incapable of transhydrogenation, but together in simple mixtures they catalyzed significant rates of reaction. The dependence of the rate of cyclic transhydrogenation on the concentration of ehdI at fixedehdIII is shown in Fig.2 a. The reaction showed no sign of saturation even at >4 μm ehdI, suggesting that the affinity between the components is quite weak, and the rates were low in comparison with those achieved with tetheredehdI-ehdIII (11Weston C.J. White S.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A mixture of isolated R. rubrum dI (rrdI) andEn. histolytica dIII gave rise to a very active complex. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2 b, the ehdIII was saturated by only moderate concentrations of rrdI (apparentK d ≈ 500 nm), and the maximum rates were similar to those obtained with mixtures of rrdI andrrdIII (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, mixtures of ehdI (for example at 975 nm) and rrdIII (2 μm) gave rise to only very low rates of transhydrogenation (0.2 μmol AcPdADH μmol−1 ehdIII·min−1) (results not shown). It is concluded that, in its isolated form, ehdIII is a well behaved protein able to bind a partner dI, resulting in a complex capable of good rates of hydride transfer. On the other hand, during expression and/or isolation, ehdI loses integrity (e.g. relative to that inehdIII-ehdI). An apparently similar situation was noted with the (non-tethered) nucleotide-binding domains of E. coli transhydrogenase; a mixture of ecdI +ecdIII had low activity, and ecdI +rrdIII was inactive, w"
