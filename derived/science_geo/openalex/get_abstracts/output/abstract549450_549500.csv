https://openalex.org/W2210080033,"Increasing evidence indicates that metabolic disorders in offspring can result from the father's diet, but the mechanism remains unclear. In a paternal mouse model given a high-fat diet (HFD), we showed that a subset of sperm transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), mainly from 5' transfer RNA halves and ranging in size from 30 to 34 nucleotides, exhibited changes in expression profiles and RNA modifications. Injection of sperm tsRNA fractions from HFD males into normal zygotes generated metabolic disorders in the F1 offspring and altered gene expression of metabolic pathways in early embryos and islets of F1 offspring, which was unrelated to DNA methylation at CpG-enriched regions. Hence, sperm tsRNAs represent a paternal epigenetic factor that may mediate intergenerational inheritance of diet-induced metabolic disorders."

Removing one or more exons from the mutated transcript can produce an in-frame mRNA and a truncated, but still functional, protein. In this study, we developed and tested a direct gene-editing approach to induce exon deletion and recover dystrophin expression in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Delivery by adeno-associated virus (AAV) of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 endonucleases coupled with paired guide RNAs flanking the mutated Dmd exon23 resulted in excision of intervening DNA and restored the Dmd reading frame in myofibers, cardiomyocytes, and muscle stem cells after local or systemic delivery. AAV-Dmd CRISPR treatment partially recovered muscle functional deficiencies and generated a pool of endogenously corrected myogenic precursors in mdx mouse muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2216283224,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of diverse biological processes. Here, we describe the initial functional analysis of a poorly characterized human lncRNA (LINC00657) that is induced after DNA damage, which we termed “noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage”, or NORAD. NORAD is highly conserved and abundant, with expression levels of approximately 500–1,000 copies per cell. Remarkably, inactivation of NORAD triggers dramatic aneuploidy in previously karyotypically stable cell lines. NORAD maintains genomic stability by sequestering PUMILIO proteins, which repress the stability and translation of mRNAs to which they bind. In the absence of NORAD, PUMILIO proteins drive chromosomal instability by hyperactively repressing mitotic, DNA repair, and DNA replication factors. These findings introduce a mechanism that regulates the activity of a deeply conserved and highly dosage-sensitive family of RNA binding proteins and reveal unanticipated roles for a lncRNA and PUMILIO proteins in the maintenance of genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2221521666,"By continuous wave pumping of a dispersion engineered, planar silicon nitride microresonator, continuously circulating, sub-30fs short temporal dissipative solitons are generated, that correspond to pulses of 6 optical cycles and constitute a coherent optical frequency comb in the spectral domain. Emission of soliton induced Cherenkov radiation caused by higher order dispersion broadens the spectral bandwidth to 2/3 of an octave, sufficient for self referencing, in excellent agreement with recent theoretical predictions and the broadest coherent microresonator frequency comb generated to date. In a further step, this frequency comb is fully phase stabilized. The ability to preserve coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth using soliton induced Cherenkov radiation marks a critical milestone in the development of planar optical frequency combs, enabling on one hand application in e.g. coherent communications, broadband dual comb spectroscopy and Raman spectral imaging, while on the other hand significantly relaxing dispersion requirements for broadband microresonator frequency combs and providing a path for their generation in the visible and UV. Our results underscore the utility and effectiveness of planar microresonator frequency comb technology, that offers the potential to make frequency metrology accessible beyond specialized laboratories."

Ferenczi et al. combined focal, cell type-specific, optogenetic manipulations with brain imaging, behavioral testing, and in vivo electrophysiology (see the Perspective by Robbins). Stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons increased activity in a brain region called the striatum and was correlated with reward-seeking across individual animals. However, elevated excitability of an area called the medial prefrontal cortex reduced both striatal responses to the stimulation of dopamine neurons and the behavioral drive to seek the stimulation of dopamine neurons. Finally, modulating the excitability of medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons drove changes in neural circuit synchrony, as well as corresponding anhedonic behavior. These observations resemble imaging and clinical phenotypes observed in human depression, addiction, and schizophrenia.

Sun-loving plants have the ability to detect and avoid shading through sensing of both blue and red light wavelengths.

Our results indicate that CRYs signal by modulating PIF activity genome wide and that these factors integrate binding of different plant photoreceptors to facilitate growth changes under different light conditions. Plants are incapable of long-distance migration and therefore must respond appropriately to ever-changing environmental challenges. Numerous environmental factors influence plant development, including temperature, light, touch, water, and gravity. Plants use this information to determine the time of day and season, to assess and anticipate temporal fluctuations in resource availability, and to determine whether they will soon be in the shade of another plant (Casal, 2012Casal J.J. Shade Avoidance.The Arabidopsis Book. 2012; 10: e0157Crossref Google Scholar). Of the many environmental input pathways, light is understood the best. Light is perceived by a complex array of photoreceptors, which are defined by the color of light they absorb. In Arabidopsis, phytochromes (phyA–E) absorb red/far-red light; cryptochromes (CRY1–2), phototropins (phot1–2), and three ZTL-type receptors absorb blue/UV-A light; and one receptor (UVR8) absorbs UV-B light (Casal, 2012Casal J.J. Shade Avoidance.The Arabidopsis Book. 2012; 10: e0157Crossref Google Scholar, Chory, 2010Chory J. Light signal transduction: an infinite spectrum of possibilities.Plant J. 2010; 61: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Combinatorial analysis of these 13 photoreceptor genes indicate that they have complex synergistic, antagonistic, and redundant relationships (Mazzella and Casal, 2001Mazzella M. Casal J. Interactive signalling by phytochromes and cryptochromes generates de-etiolation homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell Environ. 2001; 24: 155-161Crossref Google Scholar). Photoreceptor signaling pathways primarily regulate the expression of a large number of genes involved in light responses, which then lead to the differential growth of specific cells and organs within the plant. Plants have developed adaptive responses to detect and interpret changes in light quantity, quality, and directionality. In sun-loving plants, one such adaptive response is the ability to sense and avoid shading by neighboring plants. To avoid shading, plants utilize a suite of responses that are collectively known as the shade avoidance response (SAR) (Smith, 1982Smith H. Light quality, photoperception, and plant strategy.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 481-518Crossref Google Scholar). During SAR, energy resources are re-allocated from storage organs to enable the rapid elongation of stems and petioles (leafstalk), allowing a shaded plant to outcompete its neighbors. Prolonged exposure to shade is costly. Shaded plants have accelerated reproductive development, leading to lower biomass and seed yield (Casal, 2012Casal J.J. Shade Avoidance.The Arabidopsis Book. 2012; 10: e0157Crossref Google Scholar). SAR is triggered not only by a reduction in total amount of visible light (400–700 nm; known as photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]) but also changes in spectral composition (Ballaré, 1999Ballaré C.L. Keeping up with the neighbours: phytochrome sensing and other signalling mechanisms.Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 97-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, Smith, 1982Smith H. Light quality, photoperception, and plant strategy.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 481-518Crossref Google Scholar). Photosynthetic pigments within the plants absorb most of the visible light (red and blue), whereas far-red (FR) light is poorly absorbed and most is transmitted through or reflected by leaves. For instance, the red to far-red ratio (R:FR) of light is ∼1.15 during midday and varies little with the weather or season. However, R:FR can be as low as 0.09 underneath a vegetational canopy (Smith, 1982Smith H. Light quality, photoperception, and plant strategy.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 481-518Crossref Google Scholar). Underneath a canopy, there are simultaneous reductions in red (low R:FR) and blue light, and plants likely monitor these spectra to evaluate shading. Low R:FR has long been associated with all shade avoidance responses; however, studies in a variety of species and settings have shown that reduced or low blue light (LBL) can also invoke shade avoidance responses. Seedlings grown at a constant fluence rate of red light, but specifically deprived of blue light, resemble in many ways plants exposed to low R:FR (Ballaré, 1999Ballaré C.L.

Sasidharan R. Pierik R. Physiological regulation and functional significance of shade avoidance responses to neighbors.Plant Signal. Behav. 2010; 5: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A mechanism for how phytochromes (PHYs) regulate shade-induced growth in response to low R:FR light has been proposed. The detection of low R:FR by PHYs leads to the dephosphorylation of phytochrome interacting factor (PIF7), a bHLH TF that directly interacts with phyB (Li et al., 2012Li L. Ljung K. Breton G. Schmitz R.J. Pruneda-Paz J. Cowing-Zitron C. Cole B.J. Ivans L.J. Pedmale U.V. Jung H.-S. et al.Linking photoreceptor excitation to changes in plant architecture.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This allows PIF7 to bind E-boxes in the promoters of a subset of YUCCA genes that encode the rate-limiting enzymes in auxin biosynthesis. This leads to increased levels of auxin, upregulation of auxin-regulated genes, and transport (Keuskamp et al., 2010aKeuskamp D.H. Pollmann S. Voesenek L.A.C.J. Peeters A.J.M. Pierik R.

When grown in low R:FR, loss-of-function mutations in TAA1 or PIF7 do not upregulate auxin levels and therefore do not exhibit SAR (Li et al., 2012Li L. Ljung K. Breton G. Schmitz R.J. Pruneda-Paz J. Cowing-Zitron C. Cole B.J. Ivans L.J. Pedmale U.V. Jung H.-S. et al.Linking photoreceptor excitation to changes in plant architecture.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, a role for the newly synthesized auxin that is both temporally and spatially distributed in early shade avoidance responses has been well documented. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms by which the CRYs regulate hypocotyl growth in response to the LBL canopy signal (Bouly et al., 2007Bouly J.-P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. Van Der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. Cryptochrome blue light photoreceptors are activated through interconversion of flavin redox states.J. Biol.

Cryptochrome as a sensor of the blue/green ratio of natural radiation in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2010; 154: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) are less clear. Several phytohormones have been implicated in LBL-induced elongation responses, including auxin (Keuskamp et al., 2011Keuskamp D.H. Sasidharan R. Vos I. Peeters A.J.M. Voesenek L.A.C.J. Pierik R. Blue-light-mediated shade avoidance requires combined auxin and brassinosteroid action in Arabidopsis seedlings.Plant J. 2011; 67: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Pierik et al., 2009Pierik R.

Auxin and ethylene regulate elongation responses to neighbor proximity signals independent of gibberellin and della proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, auxin transport inhibitors that block low R:FR-induced elongation do not completely block hypocotyl elongation in response to LBL, indicating that R:FR and LBL growth responses maybe mediated by separate mechanisms (Keuskamp et al., 2011Keuskamp D.H. Sasidharan R. Vos I. Peeters A.J.M. Voesenek L.A.C.J. Pierik R. Blue-light-mediated shade avoidance requires combined auxin and brassinosteroid action in Arabidopsis seedlings.Plant J. 2011; 67: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the bHLH transcription factors (TFs) PIF4 and PIF5 are necessary for LBL-induced hypocotyl growth and that they act downstream of CRY1 and CRY2. We also show that CRY1 and CRY2 physically interact with PIF4 and PIF5. Transcriptome analysis indicates that the LBL response does not involve overrepresentation of auxin-regulated genes. Finally, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) that PIF4/5 and CRY2 occupy overlapping promoter regions, indicating that CRYs signal by modulating PIF4 and PIF5 activities to promote growth under LBL. As PIF4/5 act downstream of CRYs and PHYs to transduce blue- and red-light signals, respectively, these proteins represent a molecular basis for cross talk between these photosensory pathways. This work provides mechanistic detail to our understanding of how CRYs regulate plant growth. The bHLH TFs, PIF1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 directly link PHYs to light-regulated gene expression and growth. PIF4 also plays a role in sensing high temperatures, which also cause rapid extension of the hypocotyl (Koini et al., 2009Koini M.A. Alvey L. Allen T. Tilley C.A. Harberd N.P. Whitelam G.C. Franklin K.A. High temperature-mediated adaptations in plant architecture require the bHLH transcription factor PIF4.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 408-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether PIFs also act downstream of CRYs to mediate hypocotyl growth in responses to LBL. We grew various pif mutants in white light (WL) for 5 days and then moved them to LBL for 4 days (Figure 1A). In contrast to wild-type (WT) seedlings, the hypocotyls of pif4 and pif5 seedlings did not elongate in response to LBL (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A). In similar experiments, pif4 and pif5 seedlings exhibited appropriate hypocotyl elongation in response to low R:FR (Figure 1C), indicating that PIF4 and PIF5 predominantly mediate responses to LBL. However, pif7 mutant seedlings, which fail to elongate under low R:FR (Li et al., 2012Li L. Ljung K. Breton G. Schmitz R.J. Pruneda-Paz J. Cowing-Zitron C. Cole B.J. Ivans L.J. Pedmale U.V. Jung H.-S. et al.Linking photoreceptor excitation to changes in plant architecture.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), responded partially to LBL (Figure 1D). We then measured hypocotyl length of pif quadruple (pif1pif3pif4pif5/pifQ) mutant seedlings (Leivar and Monte, 2014Leivar P. Monte E. PIFs: systems integrators in plant development.Plant Cell. 2014; 26: 56-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and found that they failed to respond to LBL but clearly elongated in response to low R:FR, albeit to a lesser extent than WT (Figure 1D), suggesting that PIF1 and PIF3 do not play an important role in this process. To determine whether PIF4/5 act in the same genetic pathway as CRYs, we generated cry1pif4 double and cry1pif4pif5 triple mutants. These hypocotyls failed to elongate in LBL (Figures 1E and S1D), whereas cry1 mutant showed a slightly exaggerated hypocotyl growth response compared to WT consistent with previous findings (Pierik et al., 2009Pierik R. Djakovic-Petrovic T. Keuskamp D.H. de Wit M. Voesenek L.A.C.J. Auxin and ethylene regulate elongation responses to neighbor proximity signals independent of gibberellin and della proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using the HyDE technique to measure new hypocotyl growth (Cole et al., 2011Cole B. Kay S.A. Chory J. Automated analysis of hypocotyl growth dynamics during shade avoidance in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2011; 65: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we found that the initiation of hypocotyl elongation response in LBL was slower than the response to low R:FR (Figure S1B). In addition, hypocotyl growth inhibition during de-etiolation under monochromatic blue light was pronounced in cry1pif4 and cry1pif4pif5 seedlings compared to cry1 single-mutant hypocotyls (Figure S1E). We also constructed transgenic lines overexpressing PIF4 (PIF4ox) under the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter in the cry1 mutant background. Two independent lines showed increased hypocotyl elongation under LBL conditions compared to the cry1 (Figure 1F). Together, these results indicate that PIF4 and PIF5 function downstream of CRYs to mediate hypocotyl elongation in response to LBL.Figure S1Phenotypic Characterization of LBL Response, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Quantitation of hypocotyl length for indicated seedlings.

Many reports have shown that light destabilizes PIFs (with the exception of PIF7) and that the accumulation of PIF proteins correlates with their function (Leivar and Monte, 2014Leivar P. Monte E. PIFs: systems integrators in plant development.Plant Cell. 2014; 26: 56-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of LBL on PIF4 and PIF5 protein levels by growing PIF4/5-Flash (expressed under 35S promoter) seedlings and then exposing them to LBL for various durations. Western blotting revealed the accumulation of PIF5-Flash protein within 1 hr of LBL exposure, whereas PIF4-Flash protein levels remained constant (Figure 2A). In contrast, PIF5-Flash protein only transiently accumulated under low R:FR, peaking at 2 hr of exposure and declining back to baseline levels by 16–24 hr (Figure S2A). Because light fluence levels regulate CRY2 protein levels (Yu et al., 2007Yu X. Klejnot J. Zhao X. Shalitin D. Maymon M. Yang H. Lee J. Liu X. Lopez J. Lin C. Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2 completes its posttranslational life cycle in the nucleus.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3146-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we examined the dynamics of CRY1 and CRY2 protein accumulation in WT under LBL. CRY1 and CRY2 levels increased marginally in response to LBL (Figure 2B). In contrast, phyA and phyB protein levels were not affected by LBL exposure. Expression of CRY1 and CRY2 transcripts increased after 6 or 24 hr of LBL exposure compared to seedlings grown in WL (Figure 2C). However, these increases in expression were independent of PIF4 or PIF5, as similar CRY1 and CRY2 expression increases were seen in pif4pif5 seedlings exposed to LBL (Figure 2C). To spatially visualize PIF4 and PIF5 protein accumulation in response to LBL, we fused PIF4/5 coding sequences to β-glucuronidase (GUS) and drove expression of these reporter genes via their native promoters (Figure S2B). Five-day-old seedlings stably expressing these transgenes were treated with LBL for up to 96 hr and then subjected to histochemical staining. We observed broad distributions of PIF4-GUS and PIF5-GUS throughout the seedlings when they were treated with LBL for <24 hr (Figures 2D and 2E). After 24 hr, PIF4 and PIF5 accumulated in the apical portion of the hypocotyl and were absent from the basal region. In Arabidopsis, cell elongation occurs from the base of the hypocotyl (Boron and Vissenberg, 2014Boron A.K. Vissenberg K. The Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl, a model to identify and study control mechanisms of cellular expansion.Plant Cell Rep. 2014; 33: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), potentially indicating that PIF4 and PIF5 are present in cells of the hypocotyl and the petioles that are actively elongating under LBL. Under low R:FR conditions, however, PIF4-GUS and PIF5-GUS proteins accumulated in all cells of the hypocotyl (Figures S2C and S2D).Figure S2Expression Dynamics of PIF4-GUS and PIF5-GUS in Low R:FR, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Transgenic seedlings expressing PIF4-Flash and PIF5-Flash proteins were grown in white light for 5 days and then exposed to low R:FR for indicated amounts of time (hours).

In mouse, the bHLH TF BMAL1 interacts with CRY1/2 (Langmesser et al., 2008Langmesser S. Tallone T. Bordon A. Rusconi S. Albrecht U. Interaction of circadian clock proteins PER2 and CRY with BMAL1 and CLOCK.BMC Mol. Biol. 2008; 9: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Arabidopsis, the bHLH TF CIB1 interacts with CRY2 (Liu et al., 2008Liu H. Yu X. Li K. Klejnot J. Yang H. Lisiero D. Lin C. Photoexcited CRY2 interacts with CIB1 to regulate transcription and floral initiation in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, CRY2 is present only in the nucleus, whereas CRY1 is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Yu et al., 2007Yu X. Klejnot J. Zhao X. Shalitin D. Maymon M. Yang H. Lee J. Liu X. Lopez J. Lin C. Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2 completes its posttranslational life cycle in the nucleus.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3146-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PIFs are primarily nuclear (Leivar and Monte, 2014Leivar P. Monte E. PIFs: systems integrators in plant development.Plant Cell. 2014; 26: 56-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Arabidopsis CRYs interact with PIF4 and PIF5, we performed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. We tagged CRY1 and CRY2 with the amino-terminal portion of yellow fluorescent protein (nYFP) and tagged PIF4 and PIF5 with the carboxyl terminus of YFP (cYFP). When co-expressed, we observed a strong fluorescence signal, evident of YFP reconstitution, in nuclei of plants treated with LBL for 12 hr (Figures 3A and S3A). This indicates that these proteins can interact in planta and that the interaction occurs in the nucleus. We observed similar nuclear-localized interactions between phyB and PIF4, which served as a positive control (Figure S3B).Figure S3PIF4 and PIF5 Interact with CRY1 and CRY2, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Lower magnification confocal image displaying numerous nuclear BiFC signals of CRY2 with PIF4 and PIF5 in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells.

To confirm these results, we co-immunoprecipitated HA-PIF4 and Flag-PIF5 with Myc-CRY1/2 under light (Figures 3B and 3C), demonstrating their potential for physical interaction in vitro. CRY1-PIF5 interaction was not detected in the dark, whereas CRY2-PIF5 interaction was independent of light (Figure S3C). We also tested the interaction between CRYs and PIFs in HEK293 cells—a heterologous system devoid of PHYs. This is important because phyA binds CRY1 and phyB binds CRY2 (Más et al., 2000Más P. Devlin P.F. Panda S. Kay S.A. Functional interaction of phytochrome B and cryptochrome 2.Nature. 2000; 408: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), which could confound our analyses. When HA-PIF4 and HA-PIF5 were expressed in HEK293 cells, they co-immunoprecipitated with Arabidopsis Myc-CRY2 in light (Figure 3D). CRYs have two distinct conserved domains (Figure 3E), the amino-terminal chromophore binding PHR (photolyase homology region) and the carboxyl-terminal CCE (cryptochrome C-terminal extension) domain (Liu et al., 2008Liu H. Yu X. Li K. Klejnot J. Yang H. Lisiero D. Lin C. Photoexcited CRY2 interacts with CIB1 to regulate transcription and floral initiation in Arabidopsis.Science. 2008; 322: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged PHR domain of CRY2 interacted with full-length Flag-PIF5 (Figure 3F), whereas the N-terminal region of PIF5 (Flag-PIF5-N) interacted with Myc-CRY2 (Figure 3G). PIFs contain a conserved motif called active phytochrome binding (APB), which is necessary for binding to phyB (Figure S3D) (Khanna et al., 2004Khanna R. Huq E. Kikis E.A. Al-Sady B. Lanzatella C. Quail P.H. A novel molecular recognition motif necessary for targeting photoactivated phytochrome signaling to specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine the possibility that CRY-PIF interaction occurs via the APB motif, we tested the binding between Myc-CRY2 and Flag-PIF5 containing mutated APB motif (PIF5mAPB). Interaction between PIF5mAPB and CRY2 was not eliminated (Figure S3E) and, as reported, PIF5mAPB did not interact with the active Pfr form of phyB (Figure S3D). This finding indicates that CRY2-PIF5 contact occurs outside the APB motif. In addition, we demonstrated the CRY-PIF interaction in planta under LBL using co-immunoprecipitation using transgenic lines expressing mCitrine-CRY1 and mCitrine-CRY2, along with PIF4-Flash and PIF5-Flash. After exposing these transgenic lines to 16 hr of LBL, mCitrine-CRY1/2 immunoprecipitated PIF4/5-Flash proteins (Figures 3H and 3I). Together, these results imply that CRY1 and CRY2 physically interact with PIF4 and PIF5. Since we have implicated PIF4/5 in responses to LBL, we sought to determine whether phyB also mediates LBL responses. We first measured hypocotyl elongation responses to LBL for transgenic lines expressing phyB under its own promoter (PHYBpro::PHYB-Cit), as well as for lines overexpressing phyB (35Spro::PHYB-CFP). Surprisingly, seedlings overexpressing phyB did not elongate in response to LBL (Figure 4A) compared to WT and seedlings expressing phyB under its own promoter. This suggests that extremely high levels of phyB suppress LBL responses. However, phyB protein levels in these transgenic and WT plants did not significantly change in response to LBL (Figure 4B). Since phyB protein levels were extremely high in the phyB overexpression line, we hypothesize that phyB was sequestering PIF4/5, thereby preventing them from promoting growth and interacting with CRYs. We also mutated the conserved APB motif of PIF4 and PIF5 (PIF4/5mAPB), renderi"

Considering the tremendously broad array of transition metal-catalyzed transformations, it is remarkable that the underlying elementary reaction steps are relatively few in number. Here, we describe an alternative to the organometallic transmetallation step that is common in many metal-catalyzed reactions, such as Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. Specifically, we demonstrate that vinyl boronic ester ate complexes, prepared by combining organoboronates and organolithium reagents, engage in palladium-induced metallate rearrangement wherein 1,2-migration of an alkyl or aryl group from boron to the vinyl α-carbon occurs concomitantly with C-Pd σ-bond formation. This elementary reaction enables a powerful cross-coupling reaction in which a chiral Pd catalyst merges three simple starting materials-an organolithium, an organoboronic ester, and an organotriflate-into chiral organoboronic esters with high enantioselectivity."

We show that monolayers of graphene and boron nitride can be used to separate hydrogen ion isotopes. Employing electrical measurements and mass spectrometry, we find that deuterons permeate through these crystals much slower than protons, resulting in a separation factor of ~10 at room temperature. The isotope effect is attributed to a difference of about 60 meV between zero-point energies of incident protons and deuterons, which translates into the equivalent difference in the activation barriers posed by two dimensional crystals. In addition to providing insight into the proton transport mechanism, the demonstrated approach offers a competitive and scalable way for hydrogen isotope enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W2207623969,"Eusocial insects organize themselves into behavioral castes whose regulation has been proposed to involve epigenetic processes, including histone modification. In the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus, morphologically distinct worker castes called minors and majors exhibit pronounced differences in foraging and scouting behaviors. We found that these behaviors are regulated by histone acetylation likely catalyzed by the conserved acetyltransferase CBP. Transcriptome and chromatin analysis in brains of scouting minors fed pharmacological inhibitors of CBP and histone deacetylases (HDACs) revealed hundreds of genes linked to hyperacetylated regions targeted by CBP. Majors rarely forage, but injection of a HDAC inhibitor or small interfering RNAs against the HDAC Rpd3 into young major brains induced and sustained foraging in a CBP-dependent manner. Our results suggest that behavioral plasticity in animals may be regulated in an epigenetic manner via histone modification."

https://openalex.org/W2220171776,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that affect cellular processes by controlling gene expression. Recent studies have shown that hypoxia downregulates Drosha and Dicer, key enzymes in miRNA biogenesis, causing a decreased pool of miRNAs in cancer and resulting in increased tumor growth and metastasis. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized mechanism by which hypoxia downregulates Dicer. We found that miR-630, which is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, targets and downregulates Dicer expression. In an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, delivery of miR-630 using 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) nanoliposomes resulted in increased tumor growth and metastasis, and decreased Dicer expression. Treatment with the combination of anti-miR-630 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody in mice resulted in rescue of Dicer expression and significantly decreased tumor growth and metastasis. These results indicate that targeting miR-630 is a promising approach to overcome Dicer deregulation in cancer. As demonstrated in the study, use of DOPC nanoliposomes for anti-miR delivery serves as a better alternative approach to cell line-based overexpression of sense or antisense miRNAs, while avoiding potential in vitro selection effects. Findings from this study provide a new understanding of miRNA biogenesis downregulation observed under hypoxia and suggest therapeutic avenues to target this dysregulation in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2198745268,"Types 1 and P pili are prototypical bacterial cell-surface appendages playing essential roles in mediating adhesion of bacteria to the urinary tract. These pili, assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway, are polymers of pilus subunits assembling into two parts: a thin, short tip fibrillum at the top, mounted on a long pilus rod. The rod adopts a helical quaternary structure and is thought to play essential roles: its formation may drive pilus extrusion by preventing backsliding of the nascent growing pilus within the secretion pore; the rod also has striking spring-like properties, being able to uncoil and recoil depending on the intensity of shear forces generated by urine flow. Here, we present an atomic model of the P pilus generated from a 3.8 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. This structure provides the molecular basis for the rod’s remarkable mechanical properties and illuminates its role in pilus secretion."

In order to develop a translational human TAU aggregation model suitable for screening, we transduced TAU harboring the pro-aggregating P301L mutation into control hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells followed by differentiation into cortical neurons. TAU aggregation and phosphorylation was quantified using AlphaLISA technology. Although no spontaneous aggregation was observed upon expressing TAU-P301L in neurons, seeding with preformed aggregates consisting of the TAU-microtubule binding repeat domain triggered robust TAU aggregation and hyperphosphorylation already after 2 weeks, without affecting general cell health. To validate our model, activity of two autophagy inducers was tested. Both rapamycin and trehalose significantly reduced TAU aggregation levels suggesting that iPSC-derived neurons allow for the generation of a biologically relevant human Tauopathy model, highly suitable to screen for compounds that modulate TAU aggregation."

Hama et al. tested this idea in the laboratory, by forming water ice at low temperature and then photodesorbing it to measure the ortho:para ratio. They found a ratio of 3, even at 10 K.

https://openalex.org/W2220475175,"Although diabetes has been identified as a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation, little is known about glucose metabolism in the healthy and diabetic atria. Glucose transport into the cell, the rate-limiting step of glucose utilization, is regulated by the Glucose Transporters (GLUTs). Although GLUT4 is the major isoform in the heart, GLUT8 has recently emerged as a novel cardiac isoform. We hypothesized that GLUT-4 and -8 translocation to the atrial cell surface will be regulated by insulin and impaired during insulin-dependent diabetes. GLUT protein content was measured by Western blotting in healthy cardiac myocytes and type 1 (streptozotocin-induced, T1Dx) diabetic rodents. Active cell surface GLUT content was measured using a biotinylated photolabeled assay in the perfused heart. In the healthy atria, insulin stimulation increased both GLUT-4 and -8 translocation to the cell surface (by 100% and 240%, respectively, P<0.05). Upon insulin stimulation, we reported an increase in Akt (Th308 and s473 sites) and AS160 phosphorylation, which was positively (P<0.05) correlated with GLUT4 protein content in the healthy atria. During diabetes, active cell surface GLUT-4 and -8 content was downregulated in the atria (by 70% and 90%, respectively, P<0.05). Akt and AS160 phosphorylation was not impaired in the diabetic atria, suggesting the presence of an intact insulin signaling pathway. This was confirmed by the rescued translocation of GLUT-4 and -8 to the atrial cell surface upon insulin stimulation in the atria of type 1 diabetic subjects. In conclusion, our data suggest that: 1) both GLUT-4 and -8 are insulin-sensitive in the healthy atria through an Akt/AS160 dependent pathway; 2) GLUT-4 and -8 trafficking is impaired in the diabetic atria and rescued by insulin treatment. Alterations in atrial glucose transport may induce perturbations in energy production, which may provide a metabolic substrate for atrial fibrillation during diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2197961894,"Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.), the progenitor of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa L.), is endangered due to habitat loss. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the genetic diversity of wild rice species in isolated populations and to develop a core collection of representative genotypes for ex situ conservation. We collected 885 wild rice accessions from eight geographically distinct regions and transplanted these accessions in a protected conservation garden over a period of almost two decades. We evaluated these accessions for 13 morphological or phenological traits and genotyped them for 36 DNA markers evenly distributed on the 12 chromosomes. The coefficient of variation of quantitative traits was 0.56 and ranged from 0.37 to 1.06. SSR markers detected 206 different alleles with an average of 6 alleles per locus. The mean polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.64 in all populations, indicating that the marker loci have a high level of polymorphism and genetic diversity in all populations. Phylogenetic analyses based on morphological and molecular data revealed remarkable differences in the genetic diversity of common wild rice populations. The results showed that the Zengcheng, Gaozhou, and Suixi populations possess higher levels of genetic diversity, whereas the Huilai and Boluo populations have lower levels of genetic diversity than do the other populations. Based on their genetic distance, 130 accessions were selected as a core collection that retained over 90% of the alleles at the 36 marker loci. This genetically diverse core collection will be a useful resource for genomic studies of rice and for initiatives aimed at developing rice with improved agronomic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2224022826,"In spite of a global concern on the transfer of antibiotic resistances (AR) via the food chain, limited information exists on this issue in species of Leuconostoc and Weissella, adjunct cultures used as aroma producers in fermented foods. In this work, the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for 16 antibiotics in 34 strains of dairy origin, belonging to Leuconostoc mesenteroides (18), Leuconostoc citreum (11), Leuconostoc lactis (2), Weissella hellenica (2), and Leuconostoc carnosum (1). Atypical resistances were found for kanamycin (17 strains), tetracycline and chloramphenicol (two strains each), and erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampicin (one strain each). Surprisingly, L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides LbE16, showed resistance to four antibiotics, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and virginiamycin. PCR analysis identified tet(S) as responsible for tetracycline resistance in LbE16, but no gene was detected in a second tetracycline-resistant strain, L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris LbT16. In Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum LbE15, erythromycin and clindamycin resistant, an erm(B) gene was amplified. Hybridization experiments proved erm(B) and tet(S) to be associated to a plasmid of ≈35 kbp and to the chromosome of LbE15 and LbE16, respectively. The complete genome sequence of LbE15 and LbE16 was used to get further insights on the makeup and genetic organization of AR genes. Genome analysis confirmed the presence and location of erm(B) and tet(S), but genes providing tetracycline resistance in LbT16 were again not identified. In the genome of the multi-resistant strain LbE16, genes that might be involved in aminoglycoside (aadE, aphA-3, sat4) and virginiamycin [vat(E)] resistance were further found. The erm(B) gene but not tet(S) was transferred from Leuconostoc to Enterococcus faecalis both under laboratory conditions and in cheese. This study contributes to the characterization of AR in the Leuconostoc-Weissella group, provides evidence of the genetic basis of atypical resistances, and demonstrates the inter-species transfer of erythromycin resistance."

Assignment to the TNF ligand family is based on the presence of a conserved C-terminal TNF homology domain (THD), 2The abbreviations used are: THD, TNF homology domain; TNFSF, tumor necrosis factor superfamily; TNFRSF, TNF receptor superfamily; GpL, G. princeps luciferase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; ALPS, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; PLAD, pre-ligand assembly domain. which mediates formation of homotrimeric molecules and binding to members of the TNF receptor family (1Bodmer J.L.

TNFSF ligands are typically type II or type III transmembrane proteins and thus contain in addition to the THD an N-terminal cytosolic domain and a single transmembrane domain that is separated from the THD by a stalk region of variable length and structure (1Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. The molecular architecture of the TNF superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 2Locksley R.M.

There are also soluble variants of TNFSF ligands that result from proteolytic processing in the stalk region or from alternative splicing. Because of the presence of the THD, these soluble molecules also form trimers that retain the receptor-binding ability of the membrane-bound ligand. The TNFRSF receptors are characterized by the presence of one or more copies of a conserved cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal part of these molecules (1Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. The molecular architecture of the TNF superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

According to structural and functional similarities, three subcategories of TNFRSF receptors can be defined. The first subgroup comprises the death receptors that are characterized by a conserved C-terminally located protein-protein interaction domain, called the death domain (3Wajant H. Death receptors.Essays Biochem. 2003; 39: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The death domain enables most death receptors to induce apoptosis but is also required to transmit non-apoptotic signals. Second, there are the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-interacting receptors that possess one or more motifs in their cytoplasmic domain allowing direct interaction with members of the TRAF adapter protein family (4Xie P. TRAF molecules in cell signaling and in human diseases.J. Mol. Signal. 2013; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The third subgroup consists of soluble and membrane-anchored TNFRSF receptors that act as decoy receptors of the death and TRAF-interacting receptors by competition for ligand binding and/or by forming signaling-incompetent heteromeric receptor complexes (5Lemke J. von Karstedt S. Zinngrebe J. Walczak H. Getting TRAIL back on track for cancer therapy.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21: 1350-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Lin W.W. Hsieh S.L.

The broad physiological and pathophysiological relevance of the ligands and receptors of the TNF family is, for example, evident from the fact that various inherited diseases, including autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), common variable immunodeficiency, TNFR1-associated periodic fever syndrome, X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, and X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, can be caused by mutations in genes encoding ligand and receptors of the TNF family (CD40L (X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome), CD95L (ALPS), ectodysplasin-A1 (EDA-A1; XEDA), CD95 (ALPS), TACI (common variable immunodeficiency), TNFR1 (TNFR1-associated periodic fever syndrome)) (7Aggarwal B.B. Gupta S.C. Kim J.H. Historical perspectives on tumor necrosis factor and its superfamily: 25 years later, a golden journey.Blood. 2012; 119: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Moreover, chronic production of TNF and the deregulated activity of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand have been identified as crucial factors in the development of autoimmune diseases and the progression of bone destructive processes (7Aggarwal B.B. Gupta S.C. Kim J.H. Historical perspectives on tumor necrosis factor and its superfamily: 25 years later, a golden journey.Blood. 2012; 119: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The specificity of TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor interactions and the extracellular accessibility of these molecules make them highly attractive and straightforward targets for therapeutic interventions. Indeed, recombinant TNF is approved for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma by isolated limb perfusion, and TNF-specific antibodies and a TNFR2 ectodomain Fc-fusion protein are an established and broadly used option in the therapy of various immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease (7Aggarwal B.B. Gupta S.C. Kim J.H. Historical perspectives on tumor necrosis factor and its superfamily: 25 years later, a golden journey.Blood. 2012; 119: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies specific for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and BAFF are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, and several more molecules targeting ligands and receptors of the TNF family are under consideration in clinical trials. The development and analysis of drugs modulating the activity of a certain TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor pair as well as the understanding of the principles of TNF receptor activation highly benefit from knowledge of the affinities of these interactions. With few exceptions, however, experimental data on the receptor affinity of TNF ligands derived from analysis with intact cells are rare. Indeed, the majority of available binding data on TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor interactions are gained with cell-free methods that are based on the usage of distinct experimental methods and recombinant receptor variants containing varying numbers of receptor molecules (Table 1). Therefore, it is not really unexpected that affinities published for a certain ligand-receptor interaction can vary considerably (Table 1). In particular, values derived from cell free assays are often quite different from binding parameters obtained by cellular binding studies (Table 1). Presumably, this dissatisfying situation is mainly caused by the fact that the formation of TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor complexes on the cell surface is controlled by several cell intrinsic factors, such as dynamic self-assembly of TNFRSF receptors in the absence of ligand and interactions with the cytoskeleton that cannot be adequately gathered by cell-free techniques (8Wajant H. Principles of antibody-mediated TNF receptor activation.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22: 1727-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Literature survey of TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor affinities View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a 41BBed-AP is a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of 41BB with alkaline phosphatase, and the latter forms dimers.b Endogenous/transfected 41BBL of high and low affinity binding sites.c Solution phase BIAcore binding assay (for details see Ref.)

Here, we generated highly bioluminescent and functionally not compromised ligand variants of all TNFSF members by N-terminal fusion with the luciferase from Gaussia princeps (GpL). By help of these fusion proteins, we performed a systematic and comprehensive study on the interactions between TNFSF ligands and their cell surface-expressed receptors. Cloning of GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNF, GpL-FLAG-TNC-TWEAK, and GpL-fLAG-TNC-CD95L has been described elsewhere (9Fick A. Lang I. Schäfer V. Seher A. Trebing J. Weisenberger D. Wajant H.

The expression plasmids encoding the GpL-FLAG-TNC variants of the other TNF ligands used in this study have been obtained by exchange of the TNF-encoding fragment of the pCR3-based GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNF expression plasmid with PCR amplicons encoding THD-encompassing soluble versions of the other TNFSF ligand types (Table 2) by help of flanking EcoRI (5′ end) and XbaI (3′ end) restriction sites. A single synthetic DNA fragment encoding a QLGGGS linker followed by a FLAG epitope and an LTα protomer (amino acids 35–205) connected with an LTβ protomer (amino acids 76–244) between two (GGGS)4 linkers was used to replace the FLAG-TNC part of GpL-FLAG-TNC-LTβ encoding amino acids 76–244 of LTβ to obtain the expression plasmid encoding GpL-FLAG-scLTαβ2. The single chain-encoded LTαβ2 (scLTαβ2) part has been designed in analogy to single chain-encoded constructs for TNF (11Krippner-Heidenreich A. Grunwald I. Zimmermann G. Kühnle M. Gerspach J. Sterns T. Shnyder S.D. Gill J.H. Männel D.N. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Single-chain TNF, a TNF derivative with enhanced stability and antitumoral activity.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 8176-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and is largely similar to a C-terminally His-tagged scLTαβ2 variant encoding LTα amino acids 62–205 and LTβ amino acids 87–243 separated by short GGSG linkers that have been published elsewhere (12Sudhamsu J. Yin J. Chiang E.Y. Starovasnik M.A. Grogan J.L. Hymowitz S.G. Dimerization of LTβR by LTα1β2 is necessary and sufficient for signal transduction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19896-19901Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The conventional FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligand expression constructs have been obtained by replacement of the TNF domain in the FLAG-TNC-TNF-encoding expression plasmid with THD-encompassing DNA fragments/amplicons. FLAG-scLTαβ2 was obtained by replacing the FLAG-TNC-TNF cassette with the FLAG-scLTαβ2 cassette of GpL-FLAG-scLTαβ2. HEK293 cells transiently or stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding the recombinant protein of interest were grown near confluency and were then cultivated for 5–7 days in low serum medium (0.5–2%). Supernatants containing the recombinant proteins were collected and cleared by centrifugation and then either used directly for experiments or subjected to anti-FLAG affinity purification.TABLE 2Amino acid residues of full-length TNFSF ligands contained in the soluble TNFSF ligand variants Open table in a new tab For evaluation of the purity and protomer size of recombinant soluble TNFSF ligands, the protein samples were separated on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli. To visualize the proteins, the gels were then subjected to silver staining by help of a commercially available kit (Pierce® silver stain kit, Thermo Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany). For Western blot analysis of p100 to p52 processing, cells were washed once with PBS and scraped into PBS using a rubber policeman. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 4× Laemmli sample buffer (∼1 × 106 cells/100 μl of buffer) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures II (Sigma). To improve cell disintegration, samples were sonicated for 15 s with maximum amplitude (UP100H Ultrasonic Processor, Hielscher, Germany), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min to remove residual insoluble material. Lysates were further processed by SDS-PAGE and standard Western blotting procedures. Finally, p100 processing was determined using anti-p100/p52 from Millipore (05-361), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako), and the ECL Western blotting detection reagents and analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells (typically 2 × 105 per well in 24-well plates) were cultured overnight to ensure adherence. For equilibrium binding experiments, the cells in half of the wells were dedicated for determination of nonspecific binding and were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with either an excess of the “GpL-less” variant of the soluble TNFSF ligand investigated or with an antibody blocking access to the membrane-bound TNFRSF receptor. Untreated cells (= total binding) and “blocked” cells were then pairwise incubated with the GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion protein of interest for an additional hour at 37 °C. Unbound GpL-TNFSF ligands were removed by 10 rapid washes in ice-cold PBS, and cells were scratched with a rubber policeman in 50 μl of culture medium (0.5% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin). Cell-associated GpL activity was finally measured in black 96-well plates using a commercial Gaussia luciferase assay kit (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt a.M., Germany). To keep errors caused by the comparatively rapid decay of bioluminescent activity of GpL (∼T½ = 4 min) below 3%, substrate/buffer solution was applied to only one column of a 96-well plate at one time, and light emission was immediately measured (1 s per sample, Lucy 2 Luminometer, Anthos Labtec Instruments, Krefeld, Germany). In the cases where TNFRSF receptor transfectants have been used for the determination of total binding, the corresponding parental and receptor-negative transfectants have been used for the evaluation of nonspecific binding without further “blocking” treatment. To evaluate the activity of soluble TNFSF ligands and GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins, HT1080 cells, or HT1080 transfectants of the TNFRSF of interest, were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (2 × 104/well) and cultured overnight. The following day, cells were stimulated in triplicate with the recombinant ligands. In experiments where oligomerized ligand molecules have been used, ligands were preincubated on a separate 96-well plate with 1 μg/ml FLAG-specific mAb M2 irrespective of the ligand concentration and were transferred to the cells after 15–30 min. In cases where IL8 induction has been investigated, medium was exchanged prior to ligand stimulation to minimize the background of constitutively produced IL8. Next day, IL8 production and cellular viability were measured. In cell death experiments, cells were sensitized for apoptosis induction by co-treatment with 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide. IL8 in cell culture supernatants was quantified using a commercially available ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cellular viability was quantified by crystal violet staining. A variety of studies with soluble fusion proteins containing the THD of TNFSF ligands suggest that the functionality of the THD with respect to receptor binding and receptor activation is largely insensitive to N-terminal linkage of additional protein domains (3Wajant H. Death receptors.Essays Biochem. 2003; 39: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We recently took advantage of this fact and generated GpL fusion proteins of the TNFSF ligands CD95L, TNF, and TWEAK for cellular binding studies (9Fick A. Lang I. Schäfer V. Seher A. Trebing J. Weisenberger D. Wajant H. Studies of binding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) to fibroblast growth factor inducible 14 (Fn14).J. Biol.

These GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins were proved to be highly traceable and functionally not distinguishable from their conventional counterparts. We extended this work and generated a panel of GpL fusion protein covering all human members of the TNFSF ligand family for the systematic and comprehensive analysis of TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor interactions on intact cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins consist of an N-terminal GpL domain and C-terminally of the THD of the various human TNFSF ligands. To facilitate purification of the GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins, we furthermore introduced an internal FLAG epitope between the GpL and TNFSF ligand domain. Soluble TNFSF ligands typically assemble with high efficiency into trimeric molecules and interact with members of the TNFRSF receptors. However, in some cases soluble TNF ligand variants are unstable and tend to form not only trimers but to a varying extent inactive misfolded aggregates (13Berg D. Lehne M. Müller N. Siegmund D. Münkel S. Sebald W. Pfizenmaier K. Wajant H.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 1851-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We and others have previously found that the formation of the latter can be reduced by introduction of a heterologous trimerization domain, such as a modified leucine zipper or the tenascin-C trimerization domain (13Berg D.

Therefore, we also introduced the trimerization domain of TNC preceding the THD to ensure proper production and trimer assembly of all TNFSF ligands used in this study (Fig. 1A, left panel). To obtain LTα-LTβ heterotrimers of defined 1:2 stoichiometry, we encoded peptide linker-connected LTα and LTβ protomers (single-chain LTαβ2, scLTαβ2) by a single DNA expression cassette (Fig. 1B, right panel). Supernatants collected from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding the various GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins typically yielded 30–120 μg of recombinant protein per 15-cm cell culture Petri dish. GpL-FLAG-TNC-TRAIL showed the poorest productivity and only yielded ∼10 μg per 15-cm cell culture Petri dish despite supplementing the culture medium with zinc ions, which are required by this TNF ligand for proper folding (16Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. A unique zinc-binding site revealed by a high-resolution x-ray structure of homotrimeric Apo2L/TRAIL.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and silver staining of anti-FLAG affinity chromatography-purified GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins revealed one to three bands that correspond in size to the deduced molecular weight of the non-modified ligand molecules or to moderately glycosylated forms (Fig. 1B). Luciferase activity of all GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins was between 940 and 1360 relative light units per s and fmol. Thus, there was no evidence for a TNFSF ligand-specific impact of the THD in the various GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins on the activity of the GpL domain. As found before for the GpL fusion proteins of CD95L, luciferase activity increased linearly over several orders of magnitude with the concentration of the GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins (data not shown). Next, we investigated for a subset of the novel GpL-FLAG-TNC-TNFSF ligands whether the GpL domain interferes with the receptor stimulating activity of the THD contained in these molecules. For this purpose, we determined side-by-side the dose dependence of induction of apoptosis, IL8 production, or p100 processing by the GpL fusion proteins of 4–1BBL, CD27L, OX40L, CD40L, GITRL, TRAIL, TNF, CD95L, LTα, LIGHT, and scLTαβ2 and the corresponding conventional ligands without GpL domain. We observed in no case major differences in the corresponding ED50 values between the GpL domain-containing and the GpL domain-less variants (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). For example, GpL-FLAG-TNC-TRAIL induced apoptosis in HT1080 cells with an ED50 value of 250 pm (= 20 ng/ml), whereas conventional FLAG-TNC-TRAIL showed an ED50 value of 43 pm (= 6 ng/ml) (Fig. 2A). Likewise, GpL-FLAG-TNC-LTα, GpL-FLAG-TNC-GITRL, GpL-FLAG-TNC-CD40L, GpL-FLAG-TNC-41BBL, GpL-FLAG-TNC-CD95L, GpL-FLAG-TNC-OX40L, GpL-FLAG-TNC-CD27L, and GpL-FLAG-TNC-LIGHT triggered IL8 production in HT1080 cells with comparable efficacy as their GpL domain-less counterparts (Fig. 2B). Induction of p100 processing by GpL-FLAG-TNC-CD27L, GpL-FLAG-TNC-LIGHT, GpL-FLAG-TNC-OX40L, GpL-FLAG-TNC-CD40L, and GpL-FLAG-scLTαβ2, on the one hand, and FLAG-TNC-CD27L, FLAG-TNC-LIGHT, FLAG-TNC-OX40L, FLAG-TNC-CD40L, and FLAG-scLTαβ2, on the other hand, also occurred with similar efficacy (Fig. 3). It is well established that some members of the TNF receptor superfamily require oligomerization of their corresponding soluble trimeric ligands to become properly activated. Importantly, the presence of a GpL domain had no influence or only a minor influence on this requirement (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Together, the dose-response analysis experiments indicate that genetic fusion of the GpL domain to the N-terminal end of the THD of soluble TNFSF ligands has no major impact on the TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor interaction. Thus, N-terminal fusion of the GpL domain is a generally applicable strategy for labeling soluble TNFSF ligands for studies on TNFSF ligand-TNFRSF receptor interactions in living cells.FIGURE 3Induction of p100 processing by GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins and conventional soluble TNFSF ligands. Cells (HT1080 for LIGHT and LTαβ2, HT1080 TNFRSF receptor transfectants for CD40L, CD27L, and OX40L) were challenged with increasing concentrations of the indicated TNFSF ligands in the presence and absence of the anti-FLAG mAb M2 (1 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis to evaluate p100 to p52 expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine binding affinities of the various TNFSF ligands at 37 °C to their cell-expressed TNFRSF receptors, saturation binding studies were performed using the various GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion proteins. Depending on the particular TNFRSF receptor-TNFSF ligand pair that has been investigated, nonspecific binding was determined in two different ways. For a few TNF receptors (CD40, TNFR2, CD27, OX40, 41BB, GITR, and CD30) that are not endogenously expressed in HT1080 or HeLa cells, we had available stable transfectants from other work. In these cases, specific binding was calculated as the difference of total binding of a GpL-TNFSF ligand fusion protein to the corresponding receptor-expressing transfectant and its nonspecific binding to the receptor expression-negative parental cell line. Similarly, binding studies with GpL-FLAG-TNC-BAFF, GpL-FLAG-TNC-APRIL, GpL-FLAG-TNC-EDA-A2, GpL-FLAG-TNC-TL1A, and GpL-FLAG-TNC-TRAIL were performed using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding BCMA, BAFFR, TACI, XEDAR, DR3, and the TRAIL receptors (TRAILR1, TRAILR2, TRAILR3, and TRAILR4) and mock-transfected control cells. HEK293 cells express moderate amounts of TRAIL receptors, but this barely affected the binding studies due to the much higher number of ectopically expressed TRAIL receptors.

The association between each SNP and BMI was tested using logistic and linear regression adjusted for age, gender, and ancestry and assuming additive, recessive, and dominant effects of the minor allele. Association analysis after BMI stratification showed that all five FTO SNPs (rs1121980, rs17817449, rs3751812, rs9930506, and rs17817449), were significantly associated with obesity class II/III under an additive model (P<0.05). Interestingly, we also documented a genetic model-dependent influence of gender on the effect of FTO variants on increased BMI. Two SNPs were specifically associated in males under a dominant model, while the remainder were associated with females under additive and recessive models (P<0.05). The SNP rs9930506 showed the highest increased in obesity risk in females (odds ratio = 4.4). Linear regression using BMI as a continuous trait also revealed differential FTO SNP contributions. Homozygous individuals for the risk alleles of rs17817449, rs3751812, and rs9930506 were on average 2.18 kg/m2 heavier than homozygous for the wild-type alleles; rs1121980 and rs8044769 showed significant but less-strong effects on BMI (1.54 kg/m2 and 0.9 kg/m2, respectively). Remarkably, rs9930506 also exhibited positive interactions with age and BMI in a gender-dependent manner. Women carrying the minor allele of this variant have a significant increase in BMI by year (0.42 kg/m2, P = 1.17 x 10−10). Linear regression haplotype analysis under an additive model, confirmed that the TGTGC haplotype harboring all five minor alleles, increased the BMI of carriers by 2.36 kg/m2 (P = 1.15 x 10−5). Our data suggest that FTO SNPs make differential contributions to obesity risk and support the hypothesis that gender differences in the mechanisms involving these variants may contribute to disease development."
https://openalex.org/W2239280378,"In humans, the chemokine CXCL1/MGSA (hCXCL1) plays fundamental and diverse roles in pathophysiology, from microbial killing to cancer progression, by orchestrating the directed migration of immune and non-immune cells. Cellular trafficking is highly regulated and requires concentration gradients that are achieved by interactions with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). However, very little is known regarding the structural basis underlying hCXCL1-GAG interactions. We addressed this by characterizing the binding of GAG heparin oligosaccharides to hCXCL1 using NMR spectroscopy. Binding experiments under conditions at which hCXCL1 exists as monomers and dimers indicate that the dimer is the high-affinity GAG ligand. NMR experiments and modeling studies indicate that lysine and arginine residues mediate binding and that they are located in two non-overlapping domains. One domain, consisting of N-loop and C-helical residues (defined as α-domain) has also been identified previously as the GAG-binding domain for the related chemokine CXCL8/IL-8. The second domain, consisting of residues from the N terminus, 40s turn, and third β-strand (defined as β-domain) is novel. Eliminating β-domain binding by mutagenesis does not perturb α-domain binding, indicating two independent GAG-binding sites. It is known that N-loop and N-terminal residues mediate receptor activation, and we show that these residues are also involved in extensive GAG interactions. We also show that the GAG-bound hCXCL1 completely occlude receptor binding. We conclude that hCXCL1-GAG interactions provide stringent control over regulating chemokine levels and receptor accessibility and activation, and that chemotactic gradients mediate cellular trafficking to the target site."
https://openalex.org/W2221164950,"Aims The assessment of the distribution and activity of vessel wall inflammation is clinically important in patients with Takayasu arteritis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful tool, but the clinical utility of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in Takayasu arteritis has yet to be determined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of LGE in assessing vessel wall inflammation and disease activity in Takayasu arteritis. Methods and Results We enrolled 49 patients with Takayasu arteritis who had undergone 1.5 T MRI. Patients were divided into Active (n = 19) and Inactive disease (n = 30) groups. The distribution of vessel wall inflammation using angiography and LGE was assessed by qualitative analysis. In 79% and 63% of patients in Active and Inactive groups, respectively, greater distribution of vessel wall inflammation was observed with LGE than with conventional angiography. MRI values of pre- and post-contrast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), SNR increment (post-SNR minus pre-SNR), pre- and post-contrast contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR), and CNR increment (post-CNR minus pre-CNR) were evaluated at arterial wall sites with the highest signal intensity using quantitative analysis of post-contrast LGE images. No statistically significant differences in MRI parameters were observed between Active and Inactive groups. Contrast-enhanced MRI was unable to accurately detect active disease. Conclusion Contrast-enhanced MRI has utility in detecting the distribution of vessel wall inflammation but has less utility in assessing disease activity in Takayasu arteritis."
https://openalex.org/W2228126962,"Crowdsourcing linguistic phenomena with smartphone applications is relatively new. In linguistics, apps have predominantly been developed to create pronunciation dictionaries, to train acoustic models, and to archive endangered languages. This paper presents the first account of how apps can be used to collect data suitable for documenting language change: we created an app, Dialäkt Äpp (DÄ), which predicts users' dialects. For 16 linguistic variables, users select a dialectal variant from a drop-down menu. DÄ then geographically locates the user's dialect by suggesting a list of communes where dialect variants most similar to their choices are used. Underlying this prediction are 16 maps from the historical Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland, which documents the linguistic situation around 1950. Where users disagree with the prediction, they can indicate what they consider to be their dialect's location. With this information, the 16 variables can be assessed for language change. Thanks to the playfulness of its functionality, DÄ has reached many users; our linguistic analyses are based on data from nearly 60,000 speakers. Results reveal a relative stability for phonetic variables, while lexical and morphological variables seem more prone to change. Crowdsourcing large amounts of dialect data with smartphone apps has the potential to complement existing data collection techniques and to provide evidence that traditional methods cannot, with normal resources, hope to gather. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize a range of methodological caveats, including sparse knowledge of users' linguistic backgrounds (users only indicate age, sex) and users' self-declaration of their dialect. These are discussed and evaluated in detail here. Findings remain intriguing nevertheless: as a means of quality control, we report that traditional dialectological methods have revealed trends similar to those found by the app. This underlines the validity of the crowdsourcing method. We are presently extending DÄ architecture to other languages."
https://openalex.org/W2221821490,"KDM2B (also known as FBXL10) controls stem cell self-renewal, somatic cell reprogramming and senescence, and tumorigenesis. KDM2B contains multiple functional domains, including a JmjC domain that catalyzes H3K36 demethylation and a CxxC zinc-finger that recognizes CpG islands and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1. Here, we report that KDM2B, via its F-box domain, functions as a subunit of the CUL1-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL1/SCFKDM2B) complex. KDM2B targets c-Fos for polyubiquitylation and regulates c-Fos protein levels. Unlike the phosphorylation of other SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)/CRL1 substrates that promotes substrates binding to F-box, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced c-Fos S374 phosphorylation dissociates c-Fos from KDM2B and stabilizes c-Fos protein. Non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutations at S374 result in c-Fos protein which cannot be induced by EGF or accumulates constitutively and lead to decreased or increased cell proliferation, respectively. Multiple tumor-derived KDM2B mutations impaired the function of KDM2B to target c-Fos degradation and to suppress cell proliferation. These results reveal a novel function of KDM2B in the negative regulation of cell proliferation by assembling an E3 ligase to targeting c-Fos protein degradation that is antagonized by mitogenic stimulations."
https://openalex.org/W2199928846,"Human-wildlife conflict is a global issue. Attempts to manage this conflict impact upon wild animal welfare, an issue receiving little attention until relatively recently. Where human activities harm animal welfare these effects should be minimised where possible. However, little is known about the welfare impacts of different wildlife management interventions, and opinions on impacts vary widely. Welfare impacts therefore need to be assessed objectively. Our objectives were to: 1) establish whether an existing welfare assessment model could differentiate and rank the impacts of different wildlife management interventions (for decision-making purposes); 2) identify and evaluate any additional benefits of making formal welfare assessments; and 3) illustrate issues raised by application of the model. We applied the welfare assessment model to interventions commonly used with rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), moles (Talpa europaea) and crows (Corvus corone) in the UK. The model ranked interventions for rabbits (least impact first: fencing, head shot, chest shot) and crows (shooting, scaring, live trapping with cervical dislocation). For moles, managing molehills and tunnels scored least impact. Both spring trapping, and live trapping followed by translocation, scored greater impacts, but these could not be compared directly as they scored on different axes of the model. Some rankings appeared counter-intuitive, highlighting the need for objective formal welfare assessments. As well as ranking the humaneness of interventions, the model highlighted future research needs and how Standard Operating Procedures might be improved. The model is a milestone in assessing wildlife management welfare impacts, but our research revealed some limitations of the model and we discuss likely challenges in resolving these. In future, the model might be developed to improve its utility, e.g. by refining the time-scales. It might also be used to reach consensus among stakeholders about relative welfare impacts or to identify ways of improving wildlife management practice in the field."

https://openalex.org/W2278478606,"Postnatal proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs), proposed cells of origin for the SHH-associated subgroup of medulloblastoma, is driven by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in the developing cerebellum. Shh induces the oncogene Yes-associated protein (YAP), which drives IGF2 expression in CGNPs and mouse Shh-associated medulloblastomas. To determine how IGF2 expression is regulated downstream of YAP, we carried out an unbiased screen for transcriptional regulators bound to IGF2 promoters. We report that Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1), an onco-protein regulating transcription and translation, binds to IGF2 promoter P3. We observed that YB-1 is upregulated across human medulloblastoma subclasses as well as in other varieties of pediatric brain tumors. Utilizing the cerebellar progenitor model for the Shh subgroup of medulloblastoma in mice, we show for the first time that YB-1 is induced by Shh in CGNPs. Its expression is YAP-dependent and it is required for IGF2 expression in CGNPs. Finally, both gain-of function and loss-of-function experiments reveal that YB-1 activity is required for sustaining CGNP and medulloblastoma cell (MBC) proliferation. Collectively, our findings describe a novel role for YB-1 in driving proliferation in the developing cerebellum and MBCs and they identify the SHH:YAP:YB1:IGF2 axis as a powerful target for therapeutic intervention in medulloblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W2209001004,"Mucin-like 1 (MUCL1) was first identified as a breast-specific gene over a decade ago. Based on its highly restricted mRNA expression in breast tissue and continued expression during breast tumorigenesis and progression, MUCL1 is an attractive tumor-associated antigen and a potential therapeutic target. However, very little is known about the cellular location, biological functions and regulation of the MUCL1 protein, which will have a major impact on its druggability. Here we describe our efforts to fully characterize the cellular localization of MUCL1, investigate its regulation by key breast cancer oncogenes such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and discover its functional roles in breast cancer. Although some mucins are membrane bound, our data indicate that MUCL1 is secreted by some breast cancer cells, whereas others only express high levels of intracellular MUCL1. MUCL1 expression is highest in HER2-amplified breast tumors and inhibiting HER2 activity in tumor cells resulted in a decreased MUCL1 expression. In-depth investigation demonstrated that phosphoinositide3-kinase/Akt pathway, but not Ras/MEK pathway, controls MUCL1 expression downstream of HER2. Phenotypic assays revealed a strong dependence of HER2-positive cells on MUCL1 for cell proliferation. We further identified the mechanism by which MUCL1 regulates cell growth. Knockdown of MUCL1 induced a G1/S phase arrest concomitant with decreased cyclin D and increased p21 and p27 levels. Finally, we investigated the impact of MUCL1 loss on kinase signaling pathways in breast cancer cells through phospho-kinase array profiling. MUCL1 silencing abrogated phospho-focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun signals, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase or Akt pathway activities, thereby pointing to FAK/JNK pathway as the downstream effector of MUCL1 signaling. We are the first to identify an important role for MUCL1 in the proliferation of breast cancer cells, probably mediated via the FAK/JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest a potential utility for therapeutic targeting of this protein in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2234305517,"Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) encodes for CASPR2, a multidomain single transmembrane protein belonging to the neurexin superfamily that has been implicated in a broad range of human phenotypes including autism and language impairment. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, including small angle x-ray scattering, single particle electron microscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and bio-layer interferometry, we present novel structural and functional data that relate the architecture of the extracellular domain of CASPR2 to a previously unknown ligand, Contactin1 (CNTN1). Structurally, CASPR2 is highly glycosylated and has an overall compact architecture. Functionally, we show that CASPR2 associates with micromolar affinity with CNTN1 but, under the same conditions, it does not interact with any of the other members of the contactin family. Moreover, by using dissociated hippocampal neurons we show that microbeads loaded with CASPR2, but not with a deletion mutant, co-localize with transfected CNTN1, suggesting that CNTN1 is an endogenous ligand for CASPR2. These data provide novel insights into the structure and function of CASPR2, suggesting a complex role of CASPR2 in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2201085958,"Objective Damage to intestinal epithelial tight junctions plays an important role in sepsis. Recently we found that Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecule-2 (CORM-2) is able to protect LPS-induced intestinal epithelial tight junction damage and in this study we will investigate if CORM-2 could protect intestinal epithelial tight junctions in the rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. Materials and Methods The CLP model was generated using male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats according to standard procedure and treated with CORM-2 or inactive CORM-2 (iCORM-2), 8 mg/kg, i.v. immediately after CLP induction and euthanized after 24h or 72h (for mortality rate only). Morphological changes were investigated using both transmission electron and confocal microscopy. The levels of important TJ proteins and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) were examined using Western blotting. Cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α were measured using ELISA kits. The overall intestinal epithelial permeability was evaluated using FD-4 as a marker. Results CORM-2, but not iCORM-2, significantly reduced sepsis-induced damage of intestinal mucosa (including TJ disruption), TJ protein reduction (including zonula occludens-l (ZO-1), claudin-1 and occludin), MLC phosphorylation and proinflammatory cytokine release. The overall outcomes showed that CORM-2 suppressed sepsis-induced intestinal epithelial permeability changes and reduced mortality rate of those septic rats. Conclusions Our data strongly suggest that CORM-2 could be a potential therapeutic reagent for sepsis by suppressing inflammation, restoring intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2205191163,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an overlap of myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasm, is an intractable pediatric myeloid neoplasm. Epigenetic regulation of transcription, particularly by CpG methylation, plays an important role in tumor progression, mainly by repressing tumor-suppressor genes. To clarify the clinical importance of aberrant DNA methylation, we studied the hypermethylation status of 16 target genes in the genomes of 92 patients with JMML by bisulfite conversion and the pryosequencing technique. Among 16 candidate genes, BMP4, CALCA, CDKN2A, and RARB exhibited significant hypermethylation in 72% (67/92) of patients. Based on the number of hypermethylated genes, patients were stratified into three cohorts based on an aberrant methylation score (AMS) of 0, 1–2, or 3–4. In the AMS 0 cohort, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and transplantation-free survival (TFS) were good (69% and 76%, respectively). In the AMS 1–2 cohort, the 5-year OS was comparable to that in the AMS 0 cohort (68%), whereas TFS was poor (6%). In the AMS 3–4 cohort, 5-year OS and TFS were markedly low (8% and 0%, respectively). Epigenetic analysis provides helpful information for clinicians to select treatment strategies for patients with JMML. For patients with AMS 3–4 in whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not improve the prognosis, alternative therapies, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and new molecular-targeting agents, should be established as treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W2273947997,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy without effective therapeutics. Thromboxane A2 (TxA2)/TxA2 receptor (T prostanoid receptor (TP)) modulates the progression of some carcinomas; however, its effects on MM cell proliferation remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and downstream prostaglandin profiles in human myeloma cell lines RPMI-8226 and U-266 and analyzed the effects of COX-1/-2 inhibitors SC-560 and NS-398 on MM cell proliferation. Our observations implicate COX-2 as being involved in modulating cell proliferation. We further incubated MM cells with prostaglandin receptor antagonists or agonists and found that only the TP antagonist, SQ29548, suppressed MM cell proliferation. TP silencing and the TP agonist, U46619, further confirmed this finding. Moreover, SQ29548 and TP silencing promoted MM cell G2/M phase delay accompanied by reducing cyclin B1/cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) mRNA and protein expression. Notably, cyclin B1 overexpression rescued MM cells from G2/M arrest. We also found that the TP agonist activated JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPK depressed U46619-induced proliferation and cyclin B1/CDK1 protein expression. In addition, SQ29548 and TP silencing led to the MM cell apoptotic rate increasing with improving caspase 3 activity. The knockdown of caspase 3 reversed the apoptotic rate. Taken together, our results suggest that TxA2/TP promotes MM cell proliferation by reducing cell delay at G2/M phase via elevating p38 MAPK/JNK-mediated cyclin B1/CDK1 expression and hindering cell apoptosis. The TP inhibitor has potential as a novel agent to target kinase cascades for MM therapy."

The aim of the study was to assess the role of clock genes in human prediabetes. To this end, genotype-phenotype associations of 121 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK, CRY1, CRY2, PER1, PER2, PER3, and TIMELESS were assessed in a study population of 1,715 non-diabetic individuals metabolically phenotyped by 5-point oral glucose tolerance tests. In subgroups, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps, intravenous glucose tolerance tests, and magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy were performed. None of the tested SNPs was associated with body fat content, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion. Four CRY2 SNPs were associated with fasting glycaemia, as reported earlier. Importantly, carriers of these SNPs' minor alleles revealed elevated fasting glycaemia and, concomitantly, reduced liver fat content. In human liver tissue samples, CRY2 mRNA expression was directly associated with hepatic triglyceride content. Our data may point to CRY2 as a novel switch in hepatic fuel metabolism promoting triglyceride storage and, concomitantly, limiting glucose production. The anti-steatotic effects of the glucose-raising CRY2 alleles may explain why these alleles do not increase type-2 diabetes risk."
https://openalex.org/W2284396685,"Mutations in the renal specific Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC2) lead to type I Bartter syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease featuring arterial hypotension along with electrolyte abnormalities. We have previously shown that NKCC2 and its disease-causing mutants are subject to regulation by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). The aim of the present study was to identify the protein partners specifically involved in ERAD of NKCC2. To this end, we screened a kidney cDNA library through a yeast two-hybrid assay using NKCC2 C terminus as bait. We identified OS9 (amplified in osteosarcomas) as a novel and specific binding partner of NKCC2. Co-immunoprecipitation assays in renal cells revealed that OS9 association involves mainly the immature form of NKCC2. Accordingly, immunocytochemistry analysis showed that NKCC2 and OS9 co-localize at the endoplasmic reticulum. In cells overexpressing OS9, total cellular NKCC2 protein levels were markedly decreased, an effect blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Pulse-chase and cycloheximide-chase assays demonstrated that the marked reduction in the co-transporter protein levels was essentially due to increased protein degradation of the immature form of NKCC2. Conversely, knockdown of OS9 by small interfering RNA increased NKCC2 expression by increasing the co-transporter stability. Inactivation of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain of OS9 had no effect on its action on NKCC2. In contrast, mutations of NKCC2 N-glycosylation sites abolished the effects of OS9, indicating that OS9-induced protein degradation is N-glycan-dependent. In summary, our results demonstrate the presence of an OS9-mediated ERAD pathway in renal cells that degrades immature NKCC2 proteins. The identification and selective modulation of ERAD components specific to NKCC2 and its disease-causing mutants might provide novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of type I Bartter syndrome.

Molecular physiology and pathophysiology of electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Given that the reabsorptive capacity of downstream portions of the nephron is limited, inhibition of TAL transport capacity results in marked natriuresis and diuresis, making specific inhibitors of NaCl transport in TAL cells such as furosemide or bumetanide the most potent class of all diuretics (3Gamba G. Molecular biology of distal nephron sodium transport mechanisms.Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1606-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The apically located Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC2) is the pacemaker of TAL sodium chloride reabsorption (2Gamba G. Molecular physiology and pathophysiology of electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Hence, the activity of NKCC2 is a key determinant of final urinary salt excretion, consequently influencing long term blood pressure levels (2Gamba G. Molecular physiology and pathophysiology of electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest because changes in NKCC2 expression can be caused by several conditions such as high salt intake (4Wu J. Liu X. Lai G. Yang X. Wang L. Zhao Y.

Inherited variation in the activity of NKCC2 or its regulators alters blood pressure in humans (8Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S.

Molecular physiology and pathophysiology of electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Conversely, enhanced activity of NKCC2 has been linked to salt-sensitive hypertension (2Gamba G. Molecular physiology and pathophysiology of electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters.Physiol.

More recently, it was shown that carriers of rare NKCC2 mutations are protected against the development of arterial hypertension, further supporting the notion that factors governing the activity of NKCC2 are key determinants of essential hypertension in the general population (10Monette M.Y.

Intriguingly, despite the importance of NKCC2 in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of Bartter syndrome, the molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking, targeting, and turnover of NKCC2 remain largely unknown. NKCC2 belongs to the superfamily of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride co-transporters, which also contains the Na-Cl and K-Cl co-transporters (13Russell J. Sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Similar to nearly all membrane proteins, the preparation for appropriate trafficking starts as the co-transporter protein is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (14Vitale A. Denecke J. The endoplasmic reticulum-gateway of the secretory pathway.Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 615-628PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J.

Membrane polarity in epithelial cells: protein sorting and establishment of polarized domains.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1997; 272: F425-F429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ER acts therefore as an important determinant of the amount of protein that reaches the plasma membrane (14Vitale A. Denecke J. The endoplasmic reticulum-gateway of the secretory pathway.Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 615-628PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. New perspectives on mechanisms involved in generating epithelial cell polarity.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The ER represents an important quality control mechanism for newly synthesized proteins given that it is the site where membrane and secretory proteins fold, and only properly folded proteins usually exit the ER (17Hebert D.N. Molinari M. In and out of the ER: protein folding, quality control, degradation, and related human diseases.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1377-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Incompletely folded proteins may be retained in the ER, and if folding cannot be achieved, they may form aggregates or be targeted for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (18Stolz A. Wolf D.H. Endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation: a chaperone assisted journey to hell.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Guerriero C.J. Brodsky J.L. The delicate balance between secreted protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in human physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 537-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Based on their size and complex topologies, even the wild-type forms of integral membrane proteins such as cation-coupled chloride co-transporters are expected to encounter a significant number of hurdles during synthesis (19Guerriero C.J. Brodsky J.L. The delicate balance between secreted protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in human physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 537-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The first integral membrane mammalian protein to be characterized as an ERAD substrate was the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (20Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B.

CFTR folding and maturation in the ER is an inefficient, temperature-sensitive process as illustrated by the fact that 80% of wild-type CFTR is degraded via ERAD (20Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S.

Kopito R.R. Degradation of CFTR by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Likewise, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) assembles inefficiently after its insertion into the ER; a substantial portion of its subunits is targeted for ERAD (22Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D.

The ERAD pathway is a multistep process that requires substrate recognition, retrotranslocation, ubiquitination, and proteolysis of aberrant proteins (18Stolz A. Wolf D.H. Endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation: a chaperone assisted journey to hell.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Guerriero C.J. Brodsky J.L. The delicate balance between secreted protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in human physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 537-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Generally, the selection of misfolded proteins requires substrate-specific interactions with molecular chaperones (18Stolz A.

For instance, the ERAD of CFTR is a complex process requiring several chaperones such as members of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 40 (Hsp40) protein family, Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), and derlin 1 (24Ahner A.

Most importantly, we found evidence that the maturation of NKCC2 is also a relatively slow and inefficient process and suggested that export from the ER constitutes the limiting step in the maturation and cell surface expression of the co-transporter (26Zaarour N.

Accordingly, the majority of newly synthesized NKCC2 proteins is trapped in the ER and destined for ERAD (25Zaarour N. Demaretz S. Defontaine N. Mordasini D. Laghmani K.

Despite this, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the ER quality control of NKCC2 proteins is nil. More specifically, the identities of the protein partners of NKCC2 that are involved in the ERAD of the co-transporter are unknown. Accordingly, identifying proteins that specifically interact with NKCC2 at the ER should help to begin to define the pathway by which NKCC2 is subject to quality control. In this report, we describe a novel protein-protein interaction between the C-terminal tail of NKCC2 and OS9, a ubiquitous protein originally identified as being amplified in certain osteosarcomas (27Su Y.A.

Here, we show that OS9 interacts with the ER-resident form of NKCC2 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome pathway, revealing therefore a new molecular pathway in the regulation of the co-transporter. Consequently, these findings may open up new avenues in studying the regulation of the ER-associated degradation of cation-coupled chloride co-transporters in general and in particular of renal Na-Cl co-transporters, proteins that are necessary for normal blood pressure homeostasis. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Penicillin and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Subclonings were carried out with the following vectors: 1) pGKT7 (Clontech), 2) pCMV-Myc (Clontech), 3) pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), and 4) pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously in detail (29Szathmary R. Bielmann R. Nita-Lazar M. Burda P. Jakob C.A.

Briefly, the cDNA fragment encoding the distal region of the NKCC2 C terminus (last 195 amino acids) was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7-BD and transformed into the yeast strain AH109. AH109 expressing the bait was then mated with the Y187 yeast strain pretransformed with a human kidney cDNA library constructed in the pACT2-AD vector. Mated yeast cells were first grown on low stringency selection plates (−Leu, −Trp, −His) and then on high stringency selection plates (−Leu, −Trp, −His, −Ade). Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity, and DNA from positive clones encoding the putative interacting proteins was isolated from yeast cells using the RPM yeast plasmid isolation kit (BIO 101 Systems). Prey plasmids were rescued by transformation into DH5α bacteria (Invitrogen) and isolated using a Qiagen kit. Insert sizes were checked by BglII digestion. cDNA plasmids were then sequenced and assessed using the BLAST program. The cDNAs encoding mouse NKCC2 and Na-Cl co-transporter (NCC) were fused at the N-terminal end of Myc (Myc-NKCC2 and Myc-NCC) or EGFP (EGFP-NKCC2) using pCMV-Myc and pEGFP-C2 vectors, respectively. The mouse pcDNA3 plasmid encoding mouse OS9.1 was a kind gift from L. Litovchick (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The mouse OS9 coding sequence was subcloned into the mammalian expression pcDNA3.1/V5 vector. Alanine, glutamine, or asparagine substitutions were introduced into the OS-V5 construct at Tyr-120 (Y120A), Gln-130 (Q130E), Arg-188 (R188A), Glu-212 (E212N), and Tyr-212 (Y212A) using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Opossum kidney (OKP) cells were grown in DMEM complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For DNA transfection, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence on plastic culture dishes and then transiently transfected for 5 h with plasmids using a Lipofectamine Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For protein degradation assays, transiently transfected cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) or leupeptin (100 μm) overnight prior to cell lysis. Measurement of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) was accomplished in cells grown to confluence on coverslips using the intracellularly trapped pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein as described earlier (25Zaarour N.

Briefly, cells were first bathed at 37 °C in a CO2-free Hepes/Tris-buffered medium to measure baseline pHi. 20 mm NH4Cl was then added to the medium, causing a very rapid initial cellular alkalinization followed by a pHi recovery. The initial rate of intracellular pH recovery (dpHi/dt) was measured over the first 20 s of recordings as reported earlier (36Benziane B. Demaretz S. Defontaine N. Zaarour N. Cheval L. Bourgeois S.

The dpHi caused by NH4Cl addition was used to calculate the cell buffer capacity, which was not different between the studied groups (data not shown). Hence, the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter transport activity is expressed as dpHi/dt. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0.2 or 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (120 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm KCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics catalog number 1697498).

https://openalex.org/W2213300165,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurs when there is insufficient insulin release to control blood glucose, due to insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. The GPR39 receptor is expressed in metabolic tissues including pancreatic β-cells and has been proposed as a T2D target. Specifically, GPR39 agonists might improve β-cell function leading to more adequate and sustained insulin release and glucose control. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that GPR39 agonism would improve glucose stimulated insulin secretion in vivo. A high throughput screen, followed by a medicinal chemistry program, identified three novel potent Zn2+ modulated GPR39 agonists. These agonists were evaluated in acute rodent glucose tolerance tests. The results showed a lack of glucose lowering and insulinotropic effects not only in lean mice, but also in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and Zucker fatty rats. It is concluded that Zn2+ modulated GPR39 agonists do not acutely stimulate insulin release in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2206383882,"Possessing power contributes to high self-esteem, but how power enhances self-esteem is still unknown. As power is associated with both self-oriented goals and social-responsibility goals, we proposed that power predicts self-esteem through two positive personal and interpersonal results: authenticity and relationship satisfaction. Three studies were carried out with a total of 505 Chinese participants, including college students and adults, who completed surveys that assessed personal power, self-esteem, authenticity, relationship satisfaction, communal orientation, and social desirability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that power, authenticity, and relationship satisfaction each uniquely contributed to self-esteem. More importantly, multiple mediation analysis showed that authenticity and relationship satisfaction both mediated the effects of power on self-esteem, even when controlling for participants' communal orientation and social desirability. Our findings demonstrate that authenticity and relationship satisfaction represent two key mechanisms by which power is associated with self-esteem."
https://openalex.org/W2210537740,"The discovery that the alteration of aging by reducing the activity of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) cascade protects nematodes and mice from neurodegeneration-linked, toxic protein aggregation (proteotoxicity) raises the prospect that IIS inhibitors bear therapeutic potential to counter neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, we reported that NT219, a highly efficient IGF-1 signaling inhibitor, protects model worms from the aggregation of amyloid β peptide and polyglutamine peptides that are linked to the manifestation of Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, respectively. Here, we employed cultured cell systems to investigate whether NT219 promotes protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in mammalian cells and to explore its underlying mechanisms. We found that NT219 enhances the aggregation of misfolded prion protein and promotes its deposition in quality control compartments known as ""aggresomes."" NT219 also elevates the levels of certain molecular chaperones but, surprisingly, reduces proteasome activity and impairs autophagy. Our findings show that IGF-1 signaling inhibitors in general and NT219 in particular can promote proteostasis in mammalian cells by hyperaggregating hazardous proteins, thereby bearing the potential to postpone the onset and slow the progression of neurodegenerative illnesses in the elderly.-Moll, L., Ben-Gedalya, T., Reuveni, H., Cohen, E. The inhibition of IGF-1 signaling promotes proteostasis by enhancing protein aggregation and deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2282146643,"Alterations of the tightly interwoven neuron/astrocyte interactions are frequent traits of aging, but also favor neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). These alterations reflect impairments of the innate responses to inflammation-related processes, such as β-amyloid (Aβ) burdening. Multidisciplinary studies, spanning from the tissue to the molecular level, are needed to assess how neuron/astrocyte interactions are influenced by aging. Our study addressed this requirement by joining fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy/phasor multiphoton analysis with confocal microscopy, implemented with a novel method to separate spectrally overlapped immunofluorescence and Aβ autofluorescence. By comparing data from young control rats, chronically inflamed rats, and old rats, we identified age-specific alterations of neuron/astrocyte interactions in the hippocampus. We found a correlation between Aβ aggregation (+300 and +800% of aggregated Aβ peptide in chronically inflamed and oldvs.control rats, respectively) and fragmentation (clasmatodendrosis) of astrocyte projections (APJs) (+250 and +1300% of APJ fragments in chronically inflamed and oldvs.control rats, respectively). Clasmatodendrosis, in aged rats, associates with impairment of astrocyte-mediated Aβ clearance (-45% of Aβ deposits on APJs, and +33% of Aβ deposits on neurons in oldvs.chronically inflamed rats). Furthermore, APJ fragments colocalize with Aβ deposits and are involved in novel Aβ-mediated adhesions between neurons. These data define the effects of Aβ deposition on astrocyte/neuron interactions as a key topic in AD biology.-Mercatelli, R., Lana, D., Bucciantini, M., Giovannini, M. G., Cerbai, F., Quercioli, F., Zecchi-Orlandini, S., Delfino, G., Wenk, G. L., Nos, D. Clasmatodendrosis and β-amyloidosis in aging hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2224591020,"The chasmosaurine ceratopsid Chasmosaurus is known from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Two valid species, Chasmosaurus belli and C. russelli, have been diagnosed by differences in cranial ornamentation. Their validity has been supported, in part, by the reported stratigraphic segregation of chasmosaurines in the Dinosaur Park Formation, with C. belli and C. russelli occurring in discrete, successive zones within the formation.An analysis of every potentially taxonomically informative chasmosaurine specimen from the Dinosaur Park Formation indicates that C. belli and C. russelli have indistinguishable ontogenetic histories and overlapping stratigraphic intervals. Neither taxon exhibits autapomorphies, nor a unique set of apomorphies, but they can be separated and diagnosed by a single phylogenetically informative character-the embayment angle formed by the posterior parietal bars relative to the parietal midline. Although relatively deeply embayed specimens (C. russelli) generally have relatively longer postorbital horncores than specimens with more shallow embayments (C. belli), neither this horncore character nor epiparietal morphology can be used to consistently distinguish every specimen of C. belli from C. russelli.Kosmoceratops is purportedly represented in the Dinosaur Park Formation by a specimen previously referred to Chasmosaurus. The reassignment of this specimen to Kosmoceratops is unsupported here, as it is based on features that are either influenced by taphonomy or within the realm of individual variation for Chasmosaurus. Therefore, we conclude that Kosmoceratops is not present in the Dinosaur Park Formation, but is instead restricted to southern Laramidia, as originally posited."
https://openalex.org/W2200999279,"The p53 tumor suppressor is a stress sensor, driving cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage or oncogenic signals. p53 activation by oncogenic signals relies on the p19(Arf) tumor suppressor, while p53 activation downstream of acute DNA damage is reported to be p19(Arf)-independent. Accordingly, p19(Arf)-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) arrest in response to acute DNA damage. However, p19(Arf) is required for replicative senescence, a condition associated with an activated DNA damage response, as p19(Arf)-/- MEFs do not senesce after serial passage. A possible explanation for these seemingly disparate roles for p19(Arf) is that acute and chronic DNA damage responses are mechanistically distinct. Replicative senescence may result from chronic, low-dose DNA damage responses in which p19(Arf) has a specific role. We therefore examined the role of p19(Arf) in cellular responses to chronic, low-dose DNA-damaging agent treatment by maintaining MEFs in low oxygen and administering 0.5 G y γ-irradiation daily or 150 μM hydroxyurea, a replication stress inducer. In contrast to their response to acute DNA damage, p19(Arf)-/- MEFs exposed to chronic DNA damage do not senesce, revealing a selective role for p19(Arf) in senescence upon low-level, chronic DNA damage. We show further that p53 pathway activation in p19(Arf)-/- MEFs exposed to chronic DNA damage is attenuated relative to wild-type MEFs, suggesting a role for p19(Arf) in fine-tuning p53 activity. However, combined Nutlin3a and chronic DNA-damaging agent treatment is insufficient to promote senescence in p19(Arf)-/- MEFs, suggesting that the role of p19(Arf) in the chronic DNA damage response may be partially p53-independent. These data suggest the importance of p19(Arf) for the cellular response to the low-level DNA damage incurred in culture or upon oncogene expression, providing new insight into how p19(Arf) serves as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, our study helps reconcile reports suggesting crucial roles for both p19(Arf) and DNA damage-signaling pathways in tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2201148070,"Objective Currently, no published studies have compared the clinical outcomes of the medial-to-lateral approach (MA) and lateral-to-medial approach (LA) for open right hemicolectomy. Thus, the present study aimed to assess whether one of these approaches has any potential benefits over the other. Methods A retrospective study was performed of all patients who underwent open right hemicolectomy with pathologically confirmed disease who met the eligibility criteria between June 2008 and June 2012. The population was divided into an MA group and an LA group by propensity scoring. We compared patient demographic and clinical characteristic variables between the two groups and assessed short-term and long-term outcomes. Results A total of 450 patients (MA, n = 150; LA, n = 300) were evaluated. The operation time (MA,138.4 minutesvs.LA,166.2 minutes; P < .05) and blood loss (MA,52.0mL vs. LA,62.6mL; P < .05)were significantly lower in the MA group. No differences in the number of harvested lymph nodes and oncologic outcomes were observed between the two groups. Further subgroup analysis for stage III colon cancer revealed that the MA group had significantly more retrieved lymph nodes (MA,18.8vs. LA,16.0; P = .028). There were no differences in other variables between the two groups. Conclusions The MA reduced operative time and blood loss compared with the LA. We thus concluded that the MA provided short-term benefits compared with the LA in open right hemicolectomy for right-sided colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2198443534,"The role of genetic abnormality of δ-sarcoglycan (δ-SG) gene in dilated (DCM) and hypertrophied (HCM) cardiomyopathy patients is still unfolding. In this study we first defined the promoter region and then searched for polymorphisms/mutations among the promoter, 5'-untranslated region, and the encoding exons in δ-SG gene in 104 Chinese patients with DCM, 145 with HCM, and 790 normal controls. Two novel polymorphisms were found, an 11 base-pair (bp) deletion (c.-100~-110; -) in the promoter region and a missense polymorphism of A848G resulting in p.Q283R in the highly conserved C-terminus. The prevalence of homozygous genotype -/- of c.-100~-110 was slightly higher in DCM (14.42%) and HCM patients (14.48%), as compared with normal controls (11.01%). The prevalence of genotype of 848A/G was significantly higher in DCM (6.73%; OR = 9.43; p = 0.0002), but not in HCM patients (1.38%; OR = 1.37; p = 0.62), as compared with controls (0.76%). Haplotype -_G consisting c.-100~-110 and A848G was associated with increased risk of DCM (OR = 17.27; 95%CI = 3.19-93.56; p = 0.001) but not associated with HCM (OR = 1.90; 95%CI = 0.38-9.55; p = 0.44). Co-occurrence of the genotypes -/- of c.-100~-110 and 848A/G was found in 5 patients with DCM (4.81%; OR = 39.85; p = 0.0001), none of HCM patients, and only 1 of the controls (0.13%). Both polymorphisms were also found in the Japanese population, but not in the Africans and Caucasians. C.-100~-110 resulted in a decrease of δ-SG promoter activity to 64±3% of the control level (p<0.01). Both co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein pull-down assays demonstrated that δ-SG-283R interacts normally to β- and γ-SG, but significantly decreased localization of β/δ/γ-SG on the plasma membrane. In conclusion, haplotype -_G composed of c.-100~-110 and A848G confers higher susceptibility to DCM in the Mongoloid population."
https://openalex.org/W2211524592,"Overexpression of plasma membrane multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP-1) in Ewing's sarcoma (ES) predicts poor outcome. MRP-1 is also expressed in mitochondria, and we have examined the submitochondrial localization of MRP-1 and investigated the mechanism of MRP-1 transport and role of this organelle in the response to doxorubicin. The mitochondrial localization of MRP-1 was examined in ES cell lines by differential centrifugation and membrane solubilization by digitonin. Whether MRP-1 is chaperoned by heat shock proteins (HSPs) was investigated by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and HSP knockout using small hairpin RNA and inhibitors (apoptozole, 17-AAG, and NVPAUY). The effect of disrupting mitochondrial MRP-1-dependent efflux activity on the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin was investigated by counting viable cell number. Mitochondrial MRP-1 is glycosylated and localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it is coexpressed with HSP90. MRP-1 binds to both HSP90 and HSP70, although only inhibition of HSP90β decreases expression of MRP-1 in the mitochondria. Disruption of mitochondrial MRP-1-dependent efflux significantly increases the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin (combination index, <0.9). For the first time, we have demonstrated that mitochondrial MRP-1 is expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is a client protein of HSP90β, where it may play a role in the doxorubicin-induced resistance of ES.—Roundhill, E., Turnbull, D., Burchill, S.

https://openalex.org/W2214742776,"The prion protein (PrP) seems to exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic activities. The toxic activities are associated with the C-terminal globular parts in the absence of the flexible N terminus, specifically the hydrophobic domain (HD) or the central region (CR). The wild type prion protein (PrP-WT), having an intact flexible part, exhibits neuroprotective qualities by virtue of diminishing many of the cytotoxic effects of these mutant prion proteins (PrPΔHD and PrPΔCR) when coexpressed. The prion protein family member Doppel, which possesses a three-dimensional fold similar to the C-terminal part of PrP, is also harmful to neuronal and other cells in various models, a phenotype that can also be eliminated by the coexpression of PrP-WT. In contrast, another prion protein family member, Shadoo (Sho), a natively disordered protein possessing structural features similar to the flexible N-terminal tail of PrP, exhibits PrP-WT-like protective properties. Here, we report that, contrary to expectations, Sho expression in SH-SY5Y or HEK293 cells induces the same toxic phenotype of drug hypersensitivity as PrPΔCR. This effect is exhibited in a dose-dependent manner and is also counteracted by the coexpression of PrP-WT. The opposing effects of Shadoo in different model systems revealed here may be explored to help discern the relationship of the various toxic activities of mutant PrPs with each other and the neurotoxic effects seen in neurodegenerative diseases, such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and Alzheimer disease."
