https://openalex.org/W1974331260,"The origin of a series of regionally correlatable seismic horizons in the Neogene sediments of the central equatorial Pacific is examined through seismic modeling and the detailed analyses of stratigraphic and physical property relationships in Deep Sea Drilling Project cores. These regionally traceable reflectors are synchronous; the younger reflectors are the direct result of carbonate dissolution events, the older ones of stratigraphically selective diagenetic processes. The changes in ocean chemistry associated with these events appear to be linked to global reorganizations of surface and bottom-water circulation patterns, the most dramatic of which are associated with reorganizations of North Atlantic bottom waters. These deepwater seismic horizons appear to correlate with the major events on the ""relative sea-level"" curve of Vail et al. for the Neogene."
https://openalex.org/W2023797828,"Lack of solid data on rates of habitat conversion and on the basic biology of Neotropical organisms makes predictions of massive waves of extinction in South America premature. South America's problems regarding the use of natural resources are a result of historical, sociological, economic, and scientific factors. Most countries in South America have done a great deal to encourage conservation efforts, but the magnitude of the problem is well beyond their limited economic means to solve. The problems of species disappearance in South America are of global importance. A successful solution will involve a coordinated and massive effort of governments and specialists in all aspects of conservation biology from throughout the world. There is still time to resolve these problems. Unnecessarily dire predictions of species extinction may be counterproductive to the development of a long-term conservation strategy that is needed to manage Neotropical conservation problems."
https://openalex.org/W2140348207,Fluvial sediments in paleovaileys cut in the Ashburton surface of the Davenport province of central Australia form terrace remnants that appear to retain their original depositional tops and have probably existed as subaerial landforms since their inception. Marine fossils in sediments conformable with the fluvial sediments near the southeast margin of the province give a Cambrian age for the terraces; the Ashburton surface forming the ridgetops between the paleovalleys is Cambrian or older.

Barnes (News & Comment, 25 July, p. 414), the date when Robert Gallo and his associates were awarded a patent for developing a test to detect antibodies in blood samples of people contaminated with the AIDS virus was incorrect. It should have been May 1985, not May 1984."
