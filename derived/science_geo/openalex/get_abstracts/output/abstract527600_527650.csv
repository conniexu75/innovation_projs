https://openalex.org/W1533942137,"Understanding the functional consequences of genetic variation, and how it affects complex human disease and quantitative traits, remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. We present an analysis of RNA sequencing data from 1641 samples across 43 tissues from 175 individuals, generated as part of the pilot phase of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We describe the landscape of gene expression across tissues, catalog thousands of tissue-specific and shared regulatory expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants, describe complex network relationships, and identify signals from genome-wide association studies explained by eQTLs. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the cellular and biological consequences of human genetic variation and of the heterogeneity of such effects among a diverse set of human tissues."

How do these online networks influence exposure to perspectives that cut across ideological lines? Using deidentified data, we examined how 10.1 million U.S. Facebook users interact with socially shared news. We directly measured ideological homophily in friend networks and examined the extent to which heterogeneous friends could potentially expose individuals to cross-cutting content. We then quantified the extent to which individuals encounter comparatively more or less diverse content while interacting via Facebook's algorithmically ranked News Feed and further studied users' choices to click through to ideologically discordant content. Compared with algorithmic ranking, individuals' choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to cross-cutting content."
https://openalex.org/W1816176398,"Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1492083415,"Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas."
https://openalex.org/W1810581179,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for protein structure determination at high resolution. Here we report the structure of a complex between Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and the cell-permeant inhibitor phenylethyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG), determined by cryo-EM at an average resolution of ~2.2 angstroms (Å). Besides the PETG ligand, we identified densities in the map for ~800 water molecules and for magnesium and sodium ions. Although it is likely that continued advances in detector technology may further enhance resolution, our findings demonstrate that preparation of specimens of adequate quality and intrinsic protein flexibility, rather than imaging or image-processing technologies, now represent the major bottlenecks to routinely achieving resolutions close to 2 Å using single-particle cryo-EM."
https://openalex.org/W1519008653,"Photosynthetic splitting of water into oxygen by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria is catalyzed by the oxygen-evolving center (OEC). Synthetic mimics of the OEC, which is composed of an asymmetric manganese-calcium-oxygen cluster bound to protein groups, may promote insight into the structural and chemical determinants of biological water oxidation and lead to development of superior catalysts for artificial photosynthesis. We synthesized a Mn4Ca-cluster similar to the native OEC in both the metal-oxygen core and the binding protein groups. Like the native OEC, the synthetic cluster can undergo four redox transitions and shows two magnetic resonance signals assignable to redox and structural isomerism. Comparison with previously synthesized Mn3CaO4-cubane clusters suggests that the fourth Mn ion determines redox potentials and magnetic properties of the native OEC."

https://openalex.org/W1725195596,"Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1843990841,"Expression, genetic variation, and tissues Human genomes show extensive genetic variation across individuals, but we have only just started documenting the effects of this variation on the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, only a few tissues have been examined per genetic variant. In order to examine how genetic expression varies among tissues within individuals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium collected 1641 postmortem samples covering 54 body sites from 175 individuals. They identified quantitative genetic traits that affect gene expression and determined which of these exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. Melé et al. measured how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated protein variants affect expression across tissues.

https://openalex.org/W601907569,"Although bone responds to its mechanical environment, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the skeleton to mechanical unloading are not completely understood. Osteocytes are the most abundant but least understood cells in bones and are thought to be responsible for sensing stresses and strains in bone. Sclerostin, a product of the SOST gene, is produced postnatally primarily by osteocytes and is a negative regulator of bone formation. Recent studies show that SOST is mechanically regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. During prolonged bed rest and immobilization, circulating sclerostin increases both in humans and in animal models, and its increase is associated with a decrease in parathyroid hormone. To investigate whether SOST/sclerostin up-regulation in mechanical unloading is a cell-autonomous response or a hormonal response to decreased parathyroid hormone levels, we subjected osteocytes to an in vitro unloading environment achieved by the NASA rotating wall vessel system. To perform these studies, we generated a novel osteocytic cell line (Ocy454) that produces high levels of SOST/sclerostin at early time points and in the absence of differentiation factors. Importantly, these osteocytes recapitulated the in vivo response to mechanical unloading with increased expression of SOST (3.4 ± 1.9-fold, p < 0.001), sclerostin (4.7 ± 0.1-fold, p < 0.001), and the receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) (2.5 ± 0.7-fold, p < 0.001) ratio. These data demonstrate for the first time a cell-autonomous increase in SOST/sclerostin and RANKL/OPG ratio in the setting of unloading. Thus, targeted osteocyte therapies could hold promise as novel osteoporosis and disuse-induced bone loss treatments by directly modulating the mechanosensing cells in bone."
https://openalex.org/W1490693685,"The weak interlayer binding in two-dimensional layered materials such as graphite gives rise to poorly understood low-friction characteristics. Accurate measurements of the adhesion forces governing the overall mechanical stability have also remained elusive. We report on the direct mechanical measurement of line tension and friction forces acting in sheared mesoscale graphite structures. We show that the friction is fundamentally stochastic in nature and is attributable to the interaction between the incommensurate interface lattices. We also measured an adhesion energy of 0.227 ± 0.005 joules per square meter, in excellent agreement with theoretical models. In addition, bistable all-mechanical memory cell structures and rotational bearings have been realized by exploiting position locking, which is provided solely by the adhesion energy."
https://openalex.org/W2166056574,"Inheritance of each chromosome depends upon its centromere. A histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), is essential for epigenetically marking centromere location. We find that CENP-A is quantitatively retained at the centromere upon which it is initially assembled. CENP-C binds to CENP-A nucleosomes and is a prime candidate to stabilize centromeric chromatin. Using purified components, we find that CENP-C reshapes the octameric histone core of CENP-A nucleosomes, rigidifies both surface and internal nucleosome structure, and modulates terminal DNA to match the loose wrap that is found on native CENP-A nucleosomes at functional human centromeres. Thus, CENP-C affects nucleosome shape and dynamics in a manner analogous to allosteric regulation of enzymes. CENP-C depletion leads to rapid removal of CENP-A from centromeres, indicating their collaboration in maintaining centromere identity."

Complementing previous approaches to confine electronic waves by carefully positioned adatoms at clean metallic surfaces, we demonstrate an approach inspired by the peculiar acoustic phenomena in whispering galleries. Taking advantage of graphene's gate-tunable light-like carriers, we create whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators defined by circular pn junctions, induced by a scanning tunneling probe. We can tune the resonator size and the carrier concentration under the probe in a back-gated graphene device over a wide range. The WGM-type confinement and associated resonances are a new addition to the quantum electron-optics toolbox, paving the way to develop electronic lenses and resonators."

As such, it provides a direct probe of the supernova engine. Observations of supernova 1987A (SN1987A) have resolved the 67.87- and 78.32-kilo-electron volt emission lines from decay of (44)Ti produced in the supernova explosion. These lines are narrow and redshifted with a Doppler velocity of ~700 kilometers per second, direct evidence of large-scale asymmetry in the explosion."
https://openalex.org/W2134148555,"Efforts to identify host determinants for malaria have been hindered by the absence of a nucleus in erythrocytes, which precludes genetic manipulation in the cell in which the parasite replicates. We used cultured red blood cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells to carry out a forward genetic screen for Plasmodium falciparum host determinants. We found that CD55 is an essential host factor for P. falciparum invasion. CD55-null erythrocytes were refractory to invasion by all isolates of P. falciparum because parasites failed to attach properly to the erythrocyte surface. Thus, CD55 is an attractive target for the development of malaria therapeutics. Hematopoietic stem cell-based forward genetic screens may be valuable for the identification of additional host determinants of malaria pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1539367495,"Detection of shallow slow earthquakes offers insight into the near-trench part of the subduction interface, an important region in the development of great earthquake ruptures and tsunami generation. Ocean-bottom monitoring of offshore seismicity off southern Kyushu, Japan, recorded a complete episode of low-frequency tremor, lasting for 1 month, that was associated with very-low-frequency earthquake (VLFE) activity in the shallow plate interface. The shallow tremor episode exhibited two migration modes reminiscent of deep tremor down-dip of the seismogenic zone in some other subduction zones: a large-scale slower propagation mode and a rapid reversal mode. These similarities in migration properties and the association with VLFEs strongly suggest that both the shallow and deep tremor and VLFE may be triggered by the migration of episodic slow slip events."
https://openalex.org/W1557546047,"Magnetized rocks can record the history of the magnetic field of a planet, a key constraint for understanding its evolution. From orbital vector magnetic field measurements of Mercury taken by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft at altitudes below 150 kilometers, we have detected remanent magnetization in Mercury's crust. We infer a lower bound on the average age of magnetization of 3.7 to 3.9 billion years. Our findings indicate that a global magnetic field driven by dynamo processes in the fluid outer core operated early in Mercury's history. Ancient field strengths that range from those similar to Mercury's present dipole field to Earth-like values are consistent with the magnetic field observations and with the low iron content of Mercury's crust inferred from MESSENGER elemental composition data."
https://openalex.org/W1769811286,"Alternative activation of alveolar macrophages is linked to fibrosis following exposure to asbestos. The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic M2 phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 (>3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-β1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Arg(432) and Arg(434) in domain V of MARCO are required for the polarization of macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype as mutation of these residues reduced FIZZ1 expression (17-fold) compared with cells expressing MARCO. These observations demonstrate that a macrophage membrane protein regulates the fibrotic response to lung injury and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1603125704,"The orphan nuclear receptor Nr4a2 is known to modulate both inflammatory and metabolic processes, but the mechanism by which it regulates innate inflammatory homeostasis has not been adequately addressed. This study shows that exposure to ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) robustly induces Nr4a2 and that this induction is tightly regulated by the PI3K-Akt signaling axis. Interestingly, exogenous expression of Nr4a2 in macrophages leads to their alternative phenotype with induction of genes that are prototypical M2 markers. Moreover, Nr4a2 transcriptionally activates arginase 1 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that increased survival of animals in endotoxin-induced sepsis is Nr4a2-dependent. Thus our data identify a previously unknown role for Nr4a2 in the regulation of macrophage polarization."
https://openalex.org/W1880173361,"The coordinated breakdown of intracellular triglyceride (TG) stores requires the exquisitely regulated interaction of lipolytic enzymes with regulatory, accessory, and scaffolding proteins. Together they form a dynamic multiprotein network designated as the Adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) catalyzes the initiating step of TG hydrolysis and requires comparative gene identification-58 (Cgi-58) as a potent activator of enzyme activity. Here, we identify adipocyte-type fatty acid-binding protein (A-Fabp) and other members of the fatty acid-binding protein (Fabp) family as interaction partners of Cgi-58. Co-immunoprecipitation, microscale thermophoresis, and solid phase assays proved direct protein/protein interaction between A-Fabp and Cgi-58. Using nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments and site-directed mutagenesis, we located a potential contact region on A-Fabp. In functional terms, A-Fabp stimulates Atgl-catalyzed TG hydrolysis in a Cgi-58-dependent manner. Additionally, transcriptional transactivation assays with a luciferase reporter system revealed that Fabps enhance the ability of Atgl/Cgi-58-mediated lipolysis to induce the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Our studies identify Fabps as crucial structural and functional components of the lipolysome."

Here we show that the protein phosphatase Phlpp1 regulates endochondral ossification. Phlpp1 null mice exhibit decreased bone mass and notable changes in the growth plate, including increased BrdU incorporation and matrix production. Phosphorylation of known Phlpp1 substrates, Akt2, PKC, and p70 S6 kinase, were enhanced in ex vivo cultured Phlpp1−/− chondrocytes. Furthermore, Phlpp1 deficiency diminished FoxO1 levels leading to increased expression of Fgf18, Mek/Erk activity, and chondrocyte metabolic activity. Phlpp inhibitors also increased matrix content, Fgf18 production and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Chemical inhibition of Fgfr-signaling abrogated elevated Erk1/2 phosphorylation and metabolic activity in Phlpp1-null cultures. These results demonstrate that Phlpp1 controls chondrogenesis via multiple mechanisms and that Phlpp1 inhibition could be a strategy to promote cartilage regeneration and repair.

https://openalex.org/W1950763268,"The closely related TNF family ligands B cell activation factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) serve in the generation and maintenance of mature B-lymphocytes. Both BAFF and APRIL assemble as homotrimers that bind and activate several receptors that they partially share. However, heteromers of BAFF and APRIL that occur in patients with autoimmune diseases are incompletely characterized. The N and C termini of adjacent BAFF or APRIL monomers are spatially close and can be linked to create single-chain homo- or hetero-ligands of defined stoichiometry. Similar to APRIL, heteromers consisting of one BAFF and two APRILs (BAA) bind to the receptors B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) but not to the BAFF receptor (BAFFR). Heteromers consisting of one APRIL and two BAFF (ABB) bind to TACI and BCMA and weakly to BAFFR in accordance with the analysis of the receptor interaction sites in the crystallographic structure of ABB. Receptor binding correlated with activity in reporter cell line assays specific for BAFFR, TACI, or BCMA. Single-chain BAFF (BBB) and to a lesser extent single-chain ABB, but not APRIL or single-chain BAA, rescued BAFFR-dependent B cell maturation in BAFF-deficient mice. In conclusion, BAFF-APRIL heteromers of different stoichiometries have distinct receptor-binding properties and activities.

Together with its close relative APRIL, BAFF acts on peripheral B cells at various stages of differentiation through three receptors as follows: BAFFR that responds to BAFF only, and TACI and BCMA that bind to both BAFF and APRIL (1Mackay F. Schneider P. Cracking the BAFF code.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). BAFFR controls the survival and metabolic fitness of peripheral B cells, with the exception of memory cells, plasma cells, and B1 B cells (2Benson M.J. Dillon S.R. Castigli E. Geha R.S. Xu S.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). BAFFR is highly expressed in naive B cells but decreases and finally completely disappears during activation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells. In contrast, TACI is transiently expressed in B cells upon activation, for example in response to Toll-like receptor ligands (5Treml L.S. Carlesso G. Hoek K.L. Stadanlick J.E. Kambayashi T. Bram R.J. Cancro M.P. Khan W.N. TLR stimulation modifies BLyS receptor expression in follicular and marginal zone B cells.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7531-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Its expression is particularly high in marginal zone B cells, but, as for BAFFR, it is not maintained in plasma cells. The role of TACI is complex. It is required for efficient antibody production in response to type II T-independent antigens, but at the same time it exerts a negative role on B cells. Indeed, TACI-deficient mice display higher numbers of B cells than their wild type counterparts (6von Bülow G.U. van Deursen J.M. Bram R.J.

In marginal zone B cells, simultaneous engagement of TACI and Toll-like receptors induces expression of both Fas and FasL to help contract this innate-like type of response by apoptotic cell death at a later stage (8Figgett W.A.

Because of the intrinsic difficulty of producing and purifying BAFF-APRIL heteromers, these ligands have remained incompletely characterized. Here, we produced single-chain heteromers of BAFF and APRIL with defined compositions; we crystallized one of them and characterized their receptor-binding profile, their activities, and their susceptibility to BAFF or BAFF and APRIL inhibitors. C57BL/6 WT and BAFF-KO were as described (20Bossen C. Cachero T.G. Tardivel A. Ingold K. Willen L. Dobles M. Scott M.L. Maquelin A. Belnoue E. Siegrist C.A. Chevrier S. Acha-Orbea H. Leung H.

Cells were grown for 7 days in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for the production of single-chain lymphotoxins or for 48 h in complete medium for surface expression of receptors:TRAILR3 fusion proteins. CHO cells (Sigma) grown in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 2% FCS were transfected with polyethylenimide or Polyfect (Qiagen) and selected 48 h later in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Calbiochem). Cells were cloned by limiting dilution or by two or three rounds of FACS sorting when constructs of interest were linked to green fluorescent protein expression via an internal ribosome entry site sequence. The best producing clones were selected. Conditioned supernatants were affinity-purified on anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) or protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for FLAG- and Fc-tagged ligands, respectively, essentially as described (21Schneider P. Production of recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL receptor:Fc chimeric proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 322-345Google Scholar). Single-chain ligands were subsequently fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. Protein concentrations were inferred from the extinction coefficient calculated from the theoretical amino acid sequence. Untagged single-chain heteromers were obtained by secretion from HEK 293 cells with N-terminal His6-FLAG tags, affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, tag cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease, and size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. The final purified proteins were prepared in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and were concentrated on 30-kDa ultrafiltration devices (Vivascience). SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed according to standard procedures. Proteins were revealed directly with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-human IgG antibody or in two steps with anti-FLAG M2 at 1 μg/ml, anti-hBAFF Buffy-2 rat IgM at 1 μg/ml, or anti-hAPRIL Aprily-2 mouse IgG1 at 1 μg/ml, followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary reagents. Coomassie blue staining was performed with a semidry iD Stain System (Eurogentec). The direct binding of FLAG-tagged ligands to immobilized receptor-Fcs, either adsorbed to or captured via anti-human antibodies in 96-well immunoplates, was revealed with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and horseradish-coupled streptavidin as described previously in detail (22Schneider P. Willen L. Smulski C.R. Tools and techniques to study ligand-receptor interactions and receptor activation by TNF superfamily members.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 545: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the competition ELISA, titrated amounts of untagged ligands were added to immobilized receptor-Fcs for 30 min and followed, without intermediate washing step, by an empirically determined fixed and nonsaturating concentration of FLAG-tagged ligand sufficient to generate ∼80% of the maximal signal in the absence of competitor (22Schneider P.

Similarly, Jurkat JOM2 BAFFR:Fas cell lines (cl21) were generated as described in detail elsewhere by retrovirus-mediated transduction of a BAFFR:Fas chimeric receptor, puromycin selection, and screening of clones for their selective ability to respond to Fc-BAFF by apoptotic cell death (22Schneider P.

Reporter cells were incubated for 16 h with the indicated concentrations of ligands, after which time cell viability was measured by the phenazine methosulfate/3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay essentially as described (22Schneider P.

FLAG-tagged ligands were used in the presence of 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Crystals of the single-chain APRIL-BAFF-BAFF heterotrimer (His6-FLAG-TEV-GS-hAPRIL (aa 111–250, T126A)-GGGGS-hBAFF(140–285)-GGGGS-hBAFF(140–285), with cleaved tags) were obtained by mixing 0.5 μl of protein solution (6 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.5 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.75, 14% PEG6000 (w/v), and 1 m LiCl) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. Before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, crystals were cryo-protected by reservoir solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) 2,3-butanediol. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline X06SA (Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland). Data were processed to 2.43 Å resolution using the programs XDS and XSCALE (24Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11288) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group C 2 2 21 containing two heterotrimers per asymmetric unit. Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser and the published structures of APRIL (Protein Data Bank code 1Q5X) and BAFF (Protein Data Bank code 1KD7) as search models (25McCoy A.J.

Cells were analyzed using FACScan or Accuri 6 flow cytometers (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Splenocytes or lymph node cells were incubated with anti-CD16/32 (Fc-block, clone 93) and stained with a mix of anti-CD19-PE.Cy7 (clone eBio1D3, 1:200), anti-CD93-biot (mAb493, 1:100, a kind gift of Antonius Rolink, University of Basel, Switzerland), and anti-CD3-APC (clone 17A2, 1:100) (all from eBiosciences) for 20 min on ice followed by phycoerythrin Cy5.5-coupled streptavidin (1:100) and analysis with a FACS Canto (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with the FlowJo software. TNF family members share a common structural fold, the TNF homology domain, that trimerizes to form receptor-binding sites at the interface of ligand subunits. In the structure of TNF and of several other TNF family ligands, the N- and C-terminal regions of monomeric ligand subunits are only 5–11 Å away from each other (14Liu Y. Xu L. Opalka N. Kappler J.

We first validated the single-chain ligand approach using lymphotoxin-α and -β (LTα and LTβ). LTα and LTβ form both homo- and heterotrimers of physiologic relevance that differ in their receptor-binding profile: LTα binds to TNFR1 and LTα1β2 binds to LTβR (34Browning J.L. Ngam-ek A. Lawton P.

https://openalex.org/W1595231518,"In the fruit fly Drosophila, head formation is driven by a single gene, bicoid, which generates head-to-tail polarity of the main embryonic axis. Bicoid deficiency results in embryos with tail-to-tail polarity and no head. However, most insects lack bicoid, and the molecular mechanism for establishing head-to-tail polarity is poorly understood. We have identified a gene that establishes head-to-tail polarity of the mosquito-like midge, Chironomus riparius. This gene, named panish, encodes a cysteine-clamp DNA binding domain and operates through a different mechanism than bicoid. This finding, combined with the observation that the phylogenetic distributions of panish and bicoid are limited to specific families of flies, reveals frequent evolutionary changes of body axis determinants and a remarkable opportunity to study gene regulatory network evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1523500733,"The particular importance of Ca2+ signaling to neurons demands its precise regulation within their cytoplasm. Isoform 3 of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (the PMCA3 pump), which is highly expressed in brain and cerebellum, plays an important role in the regulation of neuronal Ca2+. A genetic defect of the PMCA3 pump has been described in one family with X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia. Here we describe a novel mutation in the ATP2B3 gene in a patient with global developmental delay, generalized hypotonia and cerebellar ataxia. The mutation (a R482H replacement) impairs the Ca2+ ejection function of the pump. It reduces the ability of the pump expressed in model cells to control Ca2+ transients generated by cell stimulation and impairs its Ca2+ extrusion function under conditions of low resting cytosolic Ca2+ as well. In silico analysis of the structural effect of the mutation suggests a reduced stabilization of the portion of the pump surrounding the mutated residue in the Ca2+-bound state. The patient also carries two missense mutations in LAMA1, encoding laminin subunit 1α. On the basis of the family pedigree of the patient, the presence of both PMCA3 and laminin subunit 1α mutations appears to be necessary for the development of the disease. Considering the observed defect in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and the previous finding that PMCAs act as digenic modulators in Ca2+-linked pathologies, the PMCA3 dysfunction along with LAMA1 mutations could act synergistically to cause the neurological phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W224674415,"Experimental evidence indicates that aging leads to accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and they develop a secretory phenotype (also known as SASP, for senescence-associated secretory phenotype) that can contribute to chronic inflammation and diseases. Recent results have showed that markers of senescence in astrocytes from aged brains are increased in brains with Alzheimer's disease. These studies strongly involved the stress kinase p38MAPK in the regulation of the secretory phenotype of astrocytes, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of senescence and SASP activation remain unclear. In this work, we propose a discrete logical model for astrocyte senescence determined by the level of DNA damage (reparable or irreparable DNA strand breaks) where the kinase p38MAPK plays a central role in the regulation of senescence and SASP. The model produces four alternative stable states: proliferation, transient cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence (and SASP) computed from its inputs representing DNA damages. Perturbations of the model were performed through gene gain or loss of functions and compared with results concerning cultures of normal and mutant astrocytes showing agreement in most cases. Moreover, the model allows some predictions that remain to be tested experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W218894951,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration are associated with cognition in bipolar disorder and healthy controls, respectively. CSF concentrations of total and phosphorylated tau, amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42, ratios of Aβ42/40 and Aβ42/38, soluble amyloid precursor protein α and β, and neurofilament light chain protein were analyzed in relation to neuropsychological performance in 82 euthymic bipolar disorder patients and 71 healthy controls. Linear regression models were applied to account for performance in five cognitive domains using the CSF biomarkers. In patients, the CSF biomarkers explained a significant proportion of the variance (15–36%, p=.002 - <.0005) in all cognitive domains independently of age, medication, disease status, and bipolar subtype I or II. However, the CSF biomarkers specifically mirroring Alzheimer-type brain changes, i.e., P-tau and Aβ1-42, did not contribute significantly. In healthy controls, CSF biomarkers did not explain the variance in cognitive performance. Selected CSF biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes accounted for cognitive performance in persons with bipolar disorder, but not for healthy controls.

With the increasing availability of “big data,” researchers can now take advantage of novel metrics of health status. These predictive algorithms were initially developed to forecast and manage expenditures, yet they represent an underutilized tool that could contribute significantly to health research. In this paper, we describe the properties and possible applications of one such “health risk score,” the DxCG Intelligence tool. Methods We link claims and administrative datasets on a cohort of U.S. workers during the period 1996–2011 (N = 14,161). We examine the risk score’s association with incident diagnoses of five disease conditions, and we link employee data with the National Death Index to characterize its relationship with mortality. We review prior studies documenting the risk score’s association with other health and non-health outcomes, including healthcare utilization, early retirement, and occupational injury. Results and Conclusions We find that the risk score is associated with outcomes across a variety of health and non-health domains. These examples demonstrate the broad applicability of this tool in multiple fields of research and illustrate its utility as a measure of overall health status for epidemiologists and other health researchers."
https://openalex.org/W2130017009,"Anchoring pharmacologic agents to the vascular lumen has the potential to modulate critical processes at the blood-tissue interface, avoiding many of the off-target effects of systemically circulating agents. We report a novel strategy for endothelial dual targeting of therapeutics, which both enhances drug delivery and enables targeted agents to partner enzymatically to generate enhanced biologic effect. Based on the recent discovery that paired antibodies directed to adjacent epitopes of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 stimulate each other's binding, we fused single-chain fragments (scFv) of paired anti-mouse PECAM-1 antibodies to recombinant murine thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), endothelial membrane proteins that partner in activation of protein C (PC). scFv/TM and scFv/EPCR bound to mouse endothelial PECAM-1 with high affinity (EC50 1.5 and 3.8 nM, respectively), and codelivery induced a 5-fold increase in PC activation not seen when TM and EPCR are anchored to distinct cell adhesion molecules. In a mouse model of acute lung injury, dual targeting reduces both the expression of lung inflammatory markers and trans-endothelial protein leak by as much as 40%, as compared to either agent alone. These findings provide proof of principle for endothelial dual targeting, an approach with numerous potential biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W844439034,"Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, has emerged recently in Jingjiang City, China where the disease had not been known to exist. We analyzed epidemiological data, clinical characteristics and risk factors of scrub typhus outbreak in Jingjiang City, 2013. The 271 clinically diagnosed patients were predominantly farmers 50 to 69 years old and the peak of onset was early to mid-November. For the 187 laboratory-confirmed cases, the major clinical manifestations of the patients were fever (100%), eschar (88.2%), rash (87.7%), chills (87.7%), and headache (66.8%). A community-based case-control study was carried out to investigate the risk factors of the scrub typhus outbreak. Bundling or moving waste straw (OR=9.0, 95%CI 4.6-17.8) and living at the edge of village (OR=0.6, 95%CI 0.4-0.9) posed the highest risks through single- and multi-variable conditional logistic regression. Phylogenetic analysis of the 56-kDa TSA gene showed that the new cluster (GB-C2) and the previously reported cluster (GB-C1) of O. tsutsugamushi were associated with this outbreak. These findings are useful for the establishment of a detailed control strategy for scrub typhus infection in previously unrecognized areas of Jiangsu Province, China."
https://openalex.org/W1756592597,"Macromolecular complexes are responsible for many key biological processes. However, in most cases details of the assembly/disassembly of such complexes are unknown at the molecular level, as the low abundance and transient nature of assembly intermediates make analysis challenging. The assembly of virus capsids is an example of such a process. The hepatitis B virus capsid (core) can be composed of either 90 or 120 dimers of coat protein. Previous studies have proposed a trimer of dimers as an important intermediate species in assembly, acting to nucleate further assembly by dimer addition. Using novel genetically-fused coat protein dimers, we have been able to trap higher-order assembly intermediates and to demonstrate for the first time that both dimeric and trimeric complexes are on pathway to virus-like particle (capsid) formation.

Therefore, HPV screening has been carried out in pre-adolescent, adolescent and young adult tribal girls using self-collected urine samples.20-35 ml self-collected midstream urine samples were obtained from a total of 2278 healthy tribal girls (9-25 years) comprising pre-adolescent, adolescent and young adults from three Indian states: Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. β-globin positive 2034 samples were employed for HPV detection and genotyping.The overall prevalence of HPV infection in tribal girls was 12.9% (262/2034). More than 65% (172/262) of them were infected with HR-HPV types of which HPV16 was the most predominant type (54%). Young adult girls aged 18-25 years showed a significantly higher prevalence of HPV infection (19.2%; OR = 3.36; 95% CI 2.97-6.34, P<0.001) as compared to that in adolescent (11.4%; OR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.20-2.76, P<0.01) or pre-adolescent girls (6.6%).This is a first study showing significantly a very high prevalence of HPV infection in adolescent and young adult tribal girls possibly due to different socio-sexual behavior, indicating a serious health concern for Indian tribal women."
https://openalex.org/W2119582033,"Background Alcohol consumption has a disinhibiting effect that may make sexual risk behaviors and disease transmission more likely. The characteristics of alcohol-serving outlets (e.g. music, dim lights, lack of condoms) may further encourage risky sexual activity. We hypothesize that frequenting alcohol outlets will be associated with HIV risk. Methods In a sample of 2,533 school-attending young women in rural South Africa, we performed a cross-sectional analysis to examine the association between frequency of alcohol outlet visits in the last six months and four outcomes related to HIV risk: number of sex partners in the last three months, unprotected sex acts in the last three months, transactional sex with most recent partner, and HSV-2 infection. We also tested for interaction by alcohol consumption. Results Visiting alcohol outlets was associated with having more sex partners [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), one versus zero partners (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.51 (1.21, 1.88)], more unprotected sex acts [aOR, one versus zero acts (95% CI): 2.28 (1.52, 3.42)], higher levels of transactional sex [aOR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.03, 2.59)], and HSV-2 infection [aOR (95% CI): 1.30 (0.88, 1.91)]. In combination with exposure to alcohol consumption, visits to alcohol outlets were more strongly associated with all four outcomes than with either risk factor alone. Statistical evidence of interaction between alcohol outlet visits and alcohol consumption was observed for all outcomes except transactional sex. Conclusions Frequenting alcohol outlets was associated with increased sexual risk in rural South African young women, especially when they consumed alcohol. Sexual health interventions targeted at alcohol outlets may effectively reach adolescents at high risk for sexually transmitted infections like HIV and HSV-2.

Metabolism studies with AαC (0 or 50 μm in DMSO, 0.01% (v/v)) were conducted for 24 h. A solution of 1:1 AαC and [13C6]AαC (50 μm) was employed for characterization of AαC-albumin adducts, whereas the DNA adduct studies employed AαC (50 μm). The culture media containing albumin were removed after 24 h of incubation and immediately stored at −80 °C. The cells were washed with PBS, and cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were stored at −80 °C until further use. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyltiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test, and treatment with AαC did not decrease cell viability (37Langouët S. Coles B. Morel F.

Peptides were resolved with an Atlantis C18 nanoACQUITY column (0.3 mm × 150 mm, 3-μm particle size, 100 Å) (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) using solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 94.99% water, 0.01% formic acid) and solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 4.99% water, 0.01% formic acid) as mobile phases with a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 Nano/Cap LC System connected to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) using an Advance CaptiveSpray source (Auburn, CA) in the positive ionization mode. A 60-min gradient (99% solvent A to 60% solvent B for 45 min, 60 to 99% solvent B at 45–60 min) and 25-min gradient (99% solvent A to 60% solvent B for 20 min and 60–90% solvent B for 20–25 min) at 5 μl/min flow rate were used, respectively, for data-dependent (DDA) and targeted data acquisition. The top five precursor ions for CID-MS/MS analysis with dynamic exclusion for 180 s with three repeats of 60-s repeat duration were selected for DDA. Mass tag DDA (MS tag DDA) was employed to trigger MS/MS on peptides and amino acid adducts displaying the characteristic pattern of a 1:1 isotopic mixture of AαC and [13C6]AαC (38Tang Y. Kassie F.

Full scan data were acquired over a mass range of 150–1800 m/z at a resolving power of 120,000 (at 400 m/z), whereas MS/MS data acquisition was carried out with the ion trap or Orbitrap (resolving power 60,000) as mass analyzer with isolation widths 1.5 and 2 m/z. An internal lock mass at m/z 371.1012 (polysiloxane) was employed while using the Orbitrap mass analyzer. The tune parameters were optimized with LQQCPFEHVK and LQQCPF peptides (New England Peptide, Gardner, MA). Mass spectral data were acquired with Xcalibur version 3.0.63 software.

Accurate surveys of intestinal parasites in children inform empirical treatment regimens and can assess the impact of school based drug treatment programmes. There is limited information on this topic in Cambodia.In a prospective study of intestinal parasites in symptomatic children attending Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia, April-June 2012, samples were examined by microscopy of a direct and concentrated fecal sample. Two culture methods for hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were employed when sufficient sample was received. Demographic, clinical and epidemiological data were collected.We studied 970 samples from 865 children. The median (inter-quartile range) age of the children was 5.4 (1.9-9.2) years, 54% were male. The proportion of children with abdominal pain was 66.8%, diarrhea 34.9%, anemia 12.7% and malnutrition 7.4%. 458 parasitic infections were detected in 340 (39.3%) children. The most common parasites using all methods of detection were hookworm (14.3%), Strongyloides stercoralis (11.6%) and Giardia lamblia (11.2%). Giardia lamblia was most common in children aged 1-5 years, hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were more common with increasing age. Hookworm, Strongloides stercoralis and Giardia lamblia were more common in children living outside of Siem Reap town. In a multivariate logistic regression increasing age was associated with all three infections, defecating in the forest for hookworm infection, the presence of cattle for S. stercoralis and not using soap for handwashing for G. lamblia.This study confirms the importance of intestinal parasitic infections in symptomatic Cambodian children and the need for adequate facilities for laboratory diagnosis together with education to improve personal hygiene and sanitation."
https://openalex.org/W216660218,"Chronic tinnitus seems to be caused by reduced inhibition among frequency selective neurons in the auditory cortex. One possibility to reduce tinnitus perception is to induce inhibition onto over-activated neurons representing the tinnitus frequency via tailor-made notched music (TMNM). Since lateral inhibition is modifiable by spectral energy contrasts, the question arises if the effects of inhibition-induced plasticity can be enhanced by introducing increased spectral energy contrasts (ISEC) in TMNM. Eighteen participants suffering from chronic tonal tinnitus, pseudo randomly assigned to either a classical TMNM or an ISEC-TMNM group, listened to notched music for three hours on three consecutive days. The music was filtered for both groups by introducing a notch filter centered at the individual tinnitus frequency. For the ISEC-TMNM group a frequency bandwidth of 3/8 octaves on each side of the notch was amplified, additionally, by about 20 dB. Before and after each music exposure, participants rated their subjectively perceived tinnitus loudness on a visual analog scale. During the magnetoencephalographic recordings, participants were stimulated with either a reference tone of 500 Hz or a test tone with a carrier frequency representing the individual tinnitus pitch. Perceived tinnitus loudness was significantly reduced after TMNM exposure, though TMNM type did not influence the loudness ratings. Tinnitus related neural activity in the N1m time window and in the so called tinnitus network comprising temporal, parietal and frontal regions was reduced after TMNM exposure. The ISEC-TMNM group revealed even enhanced inhibition-induced plasticity in a temporal and a frontal cortical area. Overall, inhibition of tinnitus related neural activity could be strengthened in people affected with tinnitus by increasing spectral energy contrast in TMNM, confirming the concepts of inhibition-induced plasticity via TMNM and spectral energy contrasts."
https://openalex.org/W400257646,"Peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear hormone receptor that forms a heterodimeric complex with retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) to regulate transcription of genes involved in fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. PPARγ is a target for pharmaceutical intervention in type 2 diabetes, and insight into interactions between PPARγ, RXRα, and DNA is of interest in understanding the function and regulation of this complex. Phosphorylation of PPARγ by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been shown to dysregulate the expression of metabolic regulation genes, an effect that is counteracted by PPARγ ligands. We applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the relationship between the ligand-binding domains of PPARγ and RXRα with their respective DNA-binding domains. Our results reveal that phosphorylation alters collective motions within the PPARγ-RXRα complex that affect the LBD-LBD dimerization interface and the AF-2 coactivator binding region of PPARγ."

Previous NMR relaxation studies have identified exchange line broadening, indicative of submillisecond conformational motion, throughout the β4-β5 loop in the FK1 domain of FKBP51, which are suppressed by the FKBP52-like L119P substitution. This substitution also attenuates exchange line broadening in the underlying β2 and β3a strands that is centered near a bifurcated main chain hydrogen bond interaction between these two strands. The present study demonstrates that these exchange line broadening effects arise from two distinct coupled conformational transitions, and the transition within the β2 and β3a strands samples a transient conformation that resembles the crystal structures of the selectively inhibited FK1 domain of FKBP51 recently reported. Although the crystal structures for their series of inhibitors were interpreted as evidence for an induced fit mechanism of association, the presence of a similar conformation being significantly populated in the unliganded FKBP51 domain is more consistent with a conformational selection binding process. The contrastingly reduced conformational plasticity of the corresponding FK1 domain of FKBP52 is consistent with the current model in which FKBP51 binds to both the apo- and hormone-bound forms of the steroid receptor to modulate its affinity for ligand, whereas FKBP52 binds selectively to the latter state.Background:FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) inhibits and FKBP52 stimulates transcription by various steroid receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1651161831,"Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps are considered the ""gold standard"" for assessing whole body insulin sensitivity. When used in combination with tracer dilution techniques and physiological insulin concentrations, insulin sensitization can be dissected and attributed to hepatic and peripheral (primarily muscle) effects. Non-human primates (NHPs), such as rhesus monkeys, are the closest pre-clinical species to humans, and thus serve as an ideal model for testing of compound efficacy to support translation to human efficacy. We determined insulin infusion rates that resulted in high physiological insulin concentrations that elicited maximal pharmacodynamic responses during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. These rates were then used with [U-13C]-D-glucose, to assess and document the degrees of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance between healthy and insulin-resistant, dysmetabolic NHPs. Next, dysmetabolic NHPs were treated for 28 days with pioglitazone (3 mg/kg) and again had their insulin sensitivity assessed, illustrating a significant improvement in hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. This coincided with a significant increase in insulin clearance, and normalization of circulating adiponectin. In conclusion, we have determined a physiological clamp paradigm (similar to humans) for assessing glucose turnover in NHPs. We have also demonstrated that insulin-resistant, dysmetabolic NHPs respond to the established insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone, thus confirming their use as an ideal pre-clinical translational model to assess insulin sensitizing compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1907780700,"Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of obese type 2 diabetes. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity has been shown to lead to ATM accumulation in rodents; however, the impact of hyperglycemia on ATM dynamics in HFD-fed type 2 diabetic models has not been studied. We previously showed that hyperglycemia induces the appearance of proinsulin (PI)-producing proinflammatory bone marrow (BM)-derived cells (PI-BMDCs) in rodents. We fed a 60% HFD to C57BL6/J mice to produce an obese type 2 diabetes model. Absent in chow-fed animals, PI-BMDCs account for 60% of the ATMs in the type 2 diabetic mice. The PI-ATM subset expresses TNF-α and other inflammatory markers, and is highly enriched within crownlike structures (CLSs). We found that amelioration of hyperglycemia by different hypoglycemic agents forestalled PI-producing ATM accumulation and adipose inflammation in these animals. We developed a diphtheria toxin receptor-based strategy to selectively ablate PI-BMDCs among ATMs. Application of the maneuver in HFD-fed type 2 diabetic mice was found to lead to near total disappearance of complex CLSs and reversal of insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis in these animals. In sum, we have identified a novel ATM subset in type 2 diabetic rodents that underlies systemic insulin resistance."

The accuracy of manual image matching in image-guided radiotherapy depends on the image quality. We aimed to assess the accuracy of target position localization using free-breathing CBCT during stereotactic lung radiotherapy. The Vero4DRT linear accelerator device was used for the examinations. Reference point discrepancies between the MV X-ray beam and the CBCT system were calculated using a phantom device with a centrally mounted steel ball. The precision of manual image matching between the CBCT and the averaged intensity (AI) images restructured from four-dimensional CT (4DCT) was estimated with a respiratory motion phantom, as determined in evaluations by five independent operators. Reference point discrepancies between the MV X-ray beam and the CBCT image-guidance systems, categorized as left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI), were 0.33 ± 0.09, 0.16 ± 0.07, and 0.05 ± 0.04 mm, respectively. The LR, AP, and SI values for residual errors from manual image matching were -0.03 ± 0.22, 0.07 ± 0.25, and -0.79 ± 0.68 mm, respectively. The accuracy of target position localization using the Vero4DRT system in our center was 1.07 ± 1.23 mm (2 SD). This study experimentally demonstrated the sufficient level of geometric accuracy using the free-breathing CBCT and the image-guidance system mounted on the Vero4DRT. However, the inter-observer variation and systematic localization error of image matching substantially affected the overall geometric accuracy. Therefore, when using the free-breathing CBCT images, careful consideration of image matching is especially important."

It has been shown that mammalian cytosolic HSP70 binds antigenic peptides mediating the activation of the immune system, and that it plays a determining role in tumour immunogenicity. This suggests that HSP70 may be used for the production of conjugated vaccines. Human and plant HSPs share high sequence similarity and some important biological functions in vitro. In addition, plant HSPs have no endotoxic side effects. Extraction of HSP70 from plants for use as vaccine adjuvant requires enhancing its concentration in plant tissues. In this work, we explored the possibility to produce HSP70 in both transgenic and non-transgenic plants, using alfalfa as a model species. First, a transcriptional analysis of a constitutive and an inducible HSP70 genes was conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana. Then the coding sequence of the inducible form was cloned and introduced into alfalfa by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and the accumulation of the protein in leaf tissue of transgenic plants was demonstrated. We also tested diverse alfalfa varieties for heat-inducible expression of endogenous HSP70, revealing variety-specific responses to heat shock."

These expressions of agency within structure were interpreted in the light of Cockerham's Health Lifestyles Theory. Furthermore, social constructions of masculinities were addressed in our analysis.Repeated interviews with ten young men in a cohort of school leavers were analyzed with qualitative content analysis.Cockerham's model was useful for interpreting our findings and we found disposition to act to be a crucial theoretical tool to capture the will and intentions of participants in relation to health. We developed the model in the following ways: structure and socialization were visualized as surrounding the whole model. Analyses of what enhances or restricts power are important. In addition to practices of health lifestyles, we added experiences of health as outcome as well as emotional aspects in disposition to act. We interpret our findings as constructions of masculinities within certain structures, in relation to choices, habitus and practices.Qualitative research could contribute to develop the understanding of the agency within structure relationships.
