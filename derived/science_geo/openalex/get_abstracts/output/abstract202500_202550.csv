Typically, the subject imposes extinction at the start of the usual fixed-ratio run."

https://openalex.org/W1967191774,"URINE oxygen tension is regularly lower than the oxygen tension of renal venous blood. When urine does not contain large amounts of reducing substances, for example, ascorbic acid, the urinary oxygen consumption is very low and cannot account for the low oxygen tension of fresh pelvic urine1. It has been calculated that only insignificant oxygen tension gradient may exist across the tubule wall2. The low urine oxygen tension therefore indicates that some segment of the tubule system has a lower oxygen tension then renal venous blood. Reeves et al. 2 have suggested a low oxygen tension in the peritubular capillaries due to ‘plasma skimming’3, and that urine oxygen tension is determined in the convoluted tubules. As the collecting ducts have been shown to be freely permeable to water and urea, howrever, an equilibration of the urine oxygen tension with medullary oxygen tension as well seems highly probable. Determination of the availability of oxygen to a platinum electrode introduced into the various zones of the dog kidney was therefore undertaken."

https://openalex.org/W1631500072,"The clasic concept that breathing is regulated only by chemoreceptor mechanisms in the arterial blood stream- the respiratory center, the carotid and aortic bodies-has been modified in two ways. It has been expanded by postulating another chemoreceptor which reacts to the composition of mixed venous blood. It has been qualified by questioning the assumption that the respiratory center has physiologically significant chemosensitivity. (The respiratory center is considered to be, on the contrary, primarily a computing mechanism that integrates information received from chemoreceptors responding to both arterial and mixed venous blood.) By postulating a chemoreceptor mechanism which reacts to the composition of mixed venous blood, a variety of ventilatory responses can be accounted for with a unified and semiquantitative concept based on the ventilatory response to exercise. For the quantitative description of exercise, data obtained from normal men at rest and during exercise have been used to develop several equations which describe the ventilatory response to exercise in terms of P(co)(2) and H(+) of arterial and mixed venous blood. The simplest of these equations, yet a useful one, is the following: V = 1.1 H(+)a + 2.3 Pv(co)(2) - 135 (5a) which states that the volume of breathing is determined by the algebraic summation of influences in arterial and mixed venous blood. Ventilatory responses, as measured in several experimental and clinical situations characterized by acid-base imbalance and associated hyperpnea, have been compared with the ventilation predicted by this equation and by the equation which quantifies Gray's multiple-factor theory. Equation 5a estimated the various ventilatory responses as closely as the multiple-factor theory equation did. Equation 5a was also able to predict ventilation during exercise. It is concluded, therefore, that the hyperpnea of muscular exercise may be a generally applicable expression of the ventilatory response to alterations of the composition of both arterial and mixed venous blood. When applied to the ventilatory responses of cross-perfused animals during exercise, the concept gives a satisfactory qualitative explanation of the various observations. Although there is strong indirect evidence that a chemoreceptor mechanism exists which reacts to the composition of mixed venous blood and whose activity can be quantified, the equations that have been developed are not definitive expressions of the stimuli which regulate breathing. That the equations apply as well as they do, in view of the known errors of fact in their development, is probably the best evidence yet adduced for the essential validity of the present concept."

https://openalex.org/W1977689921,"IN a recent communication1, Prof. C. H. Waddington protests against the increasing use of the name ‘molecular biology’ for a large and ever-growing field to which, he argues, it does not apply, and suggests confining it to more restricted topics for which in any event a better name would be ‘ultra-structural biology’. Since, as I believe, I was responsible for first propagating the name ‘molecular biology’, and its widespread adoption seems to date particularly from my 1950 Harvey Lecture “Adventures in Molecular Biology”2, it may be worth while stating again what I personally had in mind. In that lecture I said that molecular biology, as I envisaged it, “implies not so much a technique as an approach, an approach from the viewpoint of the so-called basic sciences with the leading idea of searching below the large-scale manifestations of classical biology for the corresponding molecular plan. It is concerned particularly with the forms of biological molecules, and with the evolution, exploitation and ramification of those forms in the ascent to higher and higher levels of organisation. Molecular biology is predominantly three-dimensional and structural—which does not mean, however, that it is merely a refinement of morphology. It must at the same time inquire into genesis and function”."
https://openalex.org/W2043485255,"SINCE the work of Young and Helmholtz, the highly developed colour vision in man and many animals has been thought to depend on several, usually three, retinal receptors with different spectral sensitivity1,2. Such a theory is best suited for the explanation of human sensations, of animal reactions, and of electrical responses of the whole eye. It is, however, very difficult to determine the spectral sensitivity of the postulated single receptors using these methods. The existence of different photosensitive pigments has been demonstrated by chemical methods in vertebrates3, and in vivo photometric measurements have shown them for the mammalian retina4. But this again does not give us an entirely satisfactory explanation of the principal unit-level functions, and the very successful chemical analyses of the visual pigments do not help us understand colour vision5."

https://openalex.org/W1996754746,"The retina of the grass frog, Rana pipiens, responds to flashes of highintensity x-rays and produces an electroretinogram indistinguishable in form from the electroretinogram produced in response to light stimulation at low and intermediate intensities. At higher intensities the form changes and, for maximal responses, the electroretinogram in response to x-rays shows a lower amplitude and a longer latent period than that in response to light. The prolonged latent period indicates additional intermediate reactions for the x-rays response."

https://openalex.org/W2070790797,"HISTAMINE is released from mast cells following the injection into animals of histamine liberators. Coincident with the release of histamine other substances have been detected in the plasma capable of causing a slow contraction of isolated smooth muscle1–4. Paton4 was able to demonstrate the presence of a ‘slow-contracting’ substance in addition to histamine in the plasma of cats and dogs following an intravenous injection of the potent histamine release agent, compound 48/80. Preliminary experiments have shown that a similar substance appears in plasma collected from rats 5 min. after an intravenous injection of compound 48/80 (1 mgm./kgm.). The origin of the slow-contracting substance in rat plasma was investigated by means of an in vitro system consisting of a solution of compound 48/80, rat plasma, mast cells from the peritoneal cavity of the rat, and an isolated rat uterus preparation."

https://openalex.org/W2025875172,"IN histochemistry it is well known that an objection to the specificity of the periodic acid–Schiff reaction for mucopolysaccharides is due to the possible interference of some amino-acids. This objection is particularly important when the periodic acid–Schiff reaction is applied to serous glands, in which the secretion is essentially proteins. However, Junqueira et al. 1 found material giving a positive reaction in the parotids of many mammals, and concluded that substances other than proteins were present in the secretion of parotid gland. This observation opened up an interesting problem of cellular biology, regarding the possibility of a multiple secretion from serous glands."

https://openalex.org/W2022819354,"IN a recent paper1, Leo Szilard has shown that a system consisting of an enzyme, an enzyme-forming apparatus and a repressor may be able to exist in two stable states, provided the combining energies between the various components of this system lie within certain ranges of magnitude. The two stable states which can exist contain either high or low concentrations of the enzyme. If the concentration of the enzyme or the repressor is changed by external manipulation, the system returns to one or the other of the stable states. Such a system was termed ‘para-constitutive’ by Szilard, and its possible biological significance in differentiation and antibody formation2 was suggested by him."
https://openalex.org/W2091500007,"IT has been postulated that the inhibitory post-synaptic potential in motoneurones is caused by the movement of ions across patches of the postsynaptic membrane that are momentarily (1–2 msec.) made very permeable for ions less than a certain critical size1. A sufficiently increased intracellular concentration of anions capable of passing through the postsynaptic membrane would change the normally hyper-polarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potential into a depolarizing one. In accordance with the hypothesis it was shown that injections of the small ions, Br−, Cl−, NO3−, and SCN−, but not injections of the large HCO3−, CH3CO2−, SO4−−, H2PO4− or HPO4−−, were effective in transforming the inhibitory postsynaptic potential into a depolarizing response. The diameter of the largest effective anion (derived from limiting ion conductances2 and expressed relative to K+= 1.00) was 1.11 and that of the smallest not effective, 1.65 (ref. 1). A weakness in the experimental evidence was the relatively few ions tested and the gap in size between the effective, and not effective, ions. Furthermore, it was not possible to exclude a slight effect of the bicarbonate ion (diameter 1.65) (ref. 1)."
