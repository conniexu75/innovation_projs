https://openalex.org/W2043118554,"This work presents direct evidence that the bcl-2 gene is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and directly links the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway with Bcl-2 expression and its pro-survival response in human prostate carcinoma cells. DNase I footprinting, gel retardation and supershift analysis identified a NF-κB site in the bcl-2 p2 promoter. In the context of a minimal promoter, this bcl-2 p2 site 1 increased transcription 10-fold in the presence of the p50/p65 expression vectors, comparable to the increment observed with the consensus NF-κB site, while for the full p2 promoter region transcriptional activity was increased sixfold by over-expression of NF-κB, an effect eliminated by mutating the bcl-2 p2 site 1. The expression of Bcl-2 has been linked to the hormone-resistant phenotype of advanced prostate cancer. Here we show that an increase in the level of expression of Bcl-2 in the human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP observed in response to hormone withdrawal is further augmented by TNF-α treatment, and this effect is abated by inhibitors of NF-κB. Concomitantly, bcl-2 p2 promoter studies in LNCaP cells show a 40-fold increase in promoter activity after stimulation with TNF-α in the absence of hormone."

Here we show that the human IL-24 is secreted by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and is the ligand for two heterodimeric receptors, IL-22R1/IL-20R2 and IL-20R1/IL-20R2. The latter is also the receptor for IL-20. COS cells transfected with either IL-24 receptor heterodimers bind the ligand with similar saturation kinetics. IL-24 binding to either its endogenous receptors on human keratinocytes or to ectopically expressed receptors on baby hamster kidney cells leads to activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for IL-24 being the fourth member of IL-10 family of cytokines to which their specific receptors have been identified.

Both subunits of the IL-20 receptor were initially discovered as orphan receptors in the class II cytokine receptor family, similar to those of IL-10 (3Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A.

However, the IL-22 receptor consists of a novel R1 type of class II cytokine receptor and the previously known IL-10R2 (11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Esterova E. Dickensheets H.

Although IL-10 and IL-22 share the same R2 receptor subunit, the receptor activation is ligand-specific (11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Esterova E. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P.

Binding of these cytokines to their corresponding receptors leads to the activation of JAK-STAT pathways (for review, see Ref.15Kotenko S.V. Pestka S.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we have identified the rat IL-24 (mob-5) as an oncogenic Ras-specific target gene, which, like its human ortholog, encodes a secreted protein with 23% homology to IL-10 (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence showing that IL-24, which is induced by oncogenic ras through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, may function through its cell surface receptor(s) in either an autocrine or paracrine fashion in the course of neoplastic transformation (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence also support a potential involvement of the IL-10 family of cytokines in cell transformation and cancer development. It has been shown that many DNA viruses, including the DNA tumor virus Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Yaba-like disease virus, and herpesvirus saimiri either encode their own IL-10-like proteins (21Miyazaki I.

Although exhibiting rather restricted tissue expression, IL-22R1 is found to be expressed by a variety of cell lines derived from solid tumors (11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V.

To provide insight into the biochemical and biological functions of IL-24 in normal development as well as during cell transformation and tumorigenesis, we report here the identification and characterization of its functional cell surface receptors. The novel scheme of receptor subunit swapping uncovered in this study provides a molecular basis for ligand cross-talk among members of IL-10 family of cytokines. All cell lines including 293T (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN), HaCaT (3Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H.

COS-E5 (GenHunter Corp.), a clonally purified COS-1 cell line, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Total RNA from cultured cells was purified using the RNApure reagent following the manufacturers instructions (GenHunter Corp.). The cDNA synthesis, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and Southern blot hybridization were carried out as described previously (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Production of secreted AP and IL-24-AP fusion proteins were described previously (9Zhang R. Tan Z.

For the production of human IL-24-His, the PCR primer was used to attach 9XHis to the C terminus of IL-24, and the resulting PCR product was subcloned into theBglII site of the pAPtag-5 expression vector (GenHunter Corp.). After transfection into the 293T cells, stable cell lines constitutively secreting IL-24-His into the conditioned media were obtained. The coding regions of human IL-10R2 (14Kotenka S.V. Krause C.D.

The complete coding region of human IL-20R1 was also PCR amplified using an EST clone (IMAGE number 2700520) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) as a template, subcloned into the BglII site of the pAPTag-5 expression vector and used for the receptor binding studies. One μg of IL-10R2, IL-20R1, IL-22R2, and IL-22R1 expression vector alone or in pairs were transiently transfected into either COS-E5, or BHK cells using FUGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturers instructions. Quantitative and in situ receptor binding studies were carried out using AP assay reagent A and AP assay reagent S, respectively (GenHunter Corp.), following the manufacturers instructions as previously described (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-E5 cells were seeded at the density of 1 × 105/well in 6-well plates and grown to 50% confluence. Forty-eight hours after transfection with different receptor expression construct(s), quantitative or in situ receptor binding assays were carried out in duplicate with 1 ml/well of either the IL-24-AP or AP alone conditioned media produced by 293T cells as previously described (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The AP activities of both conditional media were kept equal at 1.0 unit/ml. For saturation binding assays, the IL-24-AP conditioned medium was concentrated to 6.2 unit/ml using a Amicon concentrator. COS cells transiently transfected with either IL-20R1/IL-20R2 or IL-22R1/IL-20R2 heterodimeric receptors were allowed to bind increasing amount of IL-24-AP ranging from 0 to 50 nm based on the specific activity of AP as described previously (24Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Receptor specific ligand binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific IL-24-AP binding to COS cells with mock transfection and analyzed by the computer program HYPER (25Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Each data point was determined in duplicate. The polyclonal antibody to human IL-24 was described previously (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For monoclonal antibody production, bacterially expressed human IL-24–6XHis (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was purified as a denatured protein. After dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline, 25–100 μg of recombinant protein in Fruend's complete adjuvant was injected into 4–5-week-old female BALB/c mice. After 3 weeks, sera from immunized mice were assayed by ELISA for the titer of anti-IL-24 antibody, using human IL-24-AP as an antigen as well as a reporter. Mice were then boosted with an additional 25–100 μg of purified human IL-24-AP fusion protein to enhance the production of antibodies recognizing native, rather than, denatured IL-24. Three days prior to fusion, mice were hyperimmunized, again with 25–100 μg of IL-24-AP. Spleens from hyperimmunized mice were then fused with SP2/O myeloma cells and hybridomas producing anti-Mob5-specific hybridomas were subcloned according to standard procedures. Human IL-24-His was partially purified from the conditioned medium using Ni-NTA beads (Qiagene), following the manufacturers instructions. Deglycosylation of N- andO-linked carbohydrates from denatured IL-24-His was carried out with endoglycanase F (PNGase F) and endo-O-glycosidase (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA), respectively, following the manufacturers recommended procedure (26Tan J.C. Braun S. Rong H. DiGiacomo R. Dolphin E. Baldwin S. Narula S.K. Zavodny P.J. Chou C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12906-12911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human PBMCs were freshly purified from healthy donors by gradient centrifugation using LSM lymphocyte separation medium (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. After resuspension in 150 μl of RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 106 cells/well in a 96-well plate, the cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) or 25 μg/ml ConA (Sigma) for 2 and 4 h. The conditioned media with or without stimulation were analyzed for IL-24 production by Western blot analysis as described (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using a monoclonal antibody to human IL-24 (clone L14). Two days after transfection as described above, cells were exposed to 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 volume of conditioned medium from 293T cells without or with IL-24-His (final concentration at 50 ng/ml). Thirty minutes following the treatment, nuclear extracts were prepared by the standard protocol. For STAT-specific gel shift assays, the STAT-specific double stranded DNA probe GRR (5′-ATGTATTTCCCAGAAA-3′/5′-CCTTTTCTGGGAAATAC-3′) was end-labeled with32P using Klenow (Invitrogen), incubated with the nuclear extracts and separated on a 5–6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as described previously (5Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, 1 μg of STAT-1 or STAT-3 specific antibody was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Freshly prepared PBMCs (see above) were resuspended at a density of 106cells/well in 150 μl of RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum in a 96-well plate. LPS was then added to each well at a final concentration of 80 ng/ml in the absence or presence of either 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-10 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or 100 ng/ml human IL-24-His, or both, for 5 h. TNF-α levels in the conditioned media of the cells were determined with an ELISA kit for human TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as instructed by the manufacturer. Each data point was determined in duplicate. Although we have shown previously that IL-24 expression in rodents was not detectable in any normal adult tissues or embryos (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J.

Mosmann T.R. Science. 1990; 248: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), we looked at IL-24 induction under similar conditions. Freshly prepared human PBMCs were stimulated with either bacterial LPS or ConA. Following stimulation, the production of IL-24 by PBMCs in the conditioned media was analyzed by Western blot (Fig.1). ConA induced a rapid secretion of IL-24 by the PBMCs. LPS, on the other hand, had little effect on IL-24 production. The predicted molecular weight of human IL-24 is 23,800, but both the IL-24 secreted by human PBMCs (Fig. 1) and the IL-24-His secreted by 293T stable transfectants appeared to be much bigger, with an apparent molecular weight closer to 35,000 (Fig. 2). To determine whether this is due to glycosylation, partially purified IL-24-His was subjected to digestion with either endoglycanase F (PNGase F) which is specific for asparagine-linked (N-linked) carbohydrates, or PNGase F plus endo-O-glycosidase, which is specific for serine/threonine-linked (O-linked) oligosaccharides. As predicted, PNGase F converted the 35-kDa form of IL-24-His to a single band of lower molecular mass of about 23 kDa (Fig. 2 B). It appeared that the extensive glycosylation of human IL-24 was allN-linked type, since endo-O-glycosidase treatment had little effect on the protein. Since IL-24 shares significant homology to IL-10, we predicted that IL-24 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis was our finding that not only IL-24, but also its putative cell surface receptor, appeared to be induced by ras oncogenes (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Shortly after our initial description of IL-24, two more members of IL-10 family of cytokines, IL-20 and IL-22, and their receptors were reported (3Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Esterova E. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2725-2732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment indicated that IL-24 and the other members of the IL-10 family of cytokines share an overall homology ranging from 24 to 33%. Among these, IL-24 is closest to IL-20 with 33% homolgy overall, and the highest homology is found at the C termini of the proteins. Based on published data and data base searches of GenBankTM(NCBI), only three R1 and two R2 types of the IL-10 family of receptor subunits can be identified. The three R1 subunits are IL-10R1, IL-20R1, and IL-22R1, whereas the two R2 subunits are IL-20R2 and IL-10R2, the latter of which is also the second receptor subunit for IL-22. Thus we speculated that the IL-24 receptor could be a heterodimer of the known R1 and R2 receptor subunits. To determine whether IL-24 is the ligand for any of the heterodimers of known R1 and R2 receptor subunits, we carried out receptor binding assays using either secreted human placental AP or the IL-24-AP fusion protein as a probe (Fig.3 A) (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The quantitative cell surface binding assays were carried out with COS cells transfected with plasmids expressing IL-10R2, IL-20R1, IL-22R1, and IL-20R2 individually or with all four R1/R2 combinations (Fig. 3 B). IL-24-AP, but not AP, exhibited significant binding to COS cells transfected with IL-20R2 alone, and the binding was further dramatically increased when IL-20R2 was co-transfected with either IL-20R1 or IL-22R1. Neither IL-20-R1 nor IL-22R1 alone were able to bind to IL-24-AP. Using AP staining assays, we were able to confirm the quantitative IL-24-AP binding data (Fig. 3 C). Specific cell surface staining was detected with IL-24-AP when COS cells were transiently transfected with IL-20R2, but not IL-20R1 or IL-22R1 alone (Fig. 3 C). When cells were transiently transfected with IL-20R2 in combination with either IL-20R1 or IL-22R1, the cell surface binding of IL-24-AP was greatly increased (Fig. 3 C). In addition to increased ability to bind IL-24-AP, the presence of either R1 subunit resulted in a much more uniformed distribution of the heterodimeric receptor over the entire cell surface (Fig. 3 C). Binding kinetics of IL-24 to its receptors was determined using COS cells transiently transfected with either IL-20R1/IL-20R2 or IL-22R1/IL-20R2 heterodimeric receptors (Fig.4). IL-24-AP was shown to bind to both receptors with similar affinity and saturation kinetics. The affinity (K d) of IL-24-AP to both IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2 heterodimeric receptors were about 8 nm. To functionally determine whether IL-24 can signal through these putative receptors by activating the downstream JAK-STAT pathways, as has been observed for other members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, we performed the following three experiments. First, we examined the expression of IL-22R1 in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, which was shown to be positive for IL-20 receptor (IL-20R1/IL-20R2) (3Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The finding of the coexpression of IL-22R1 and IL-20R2 in the HaCaT, but not the BHK cell line (Fig.5 A), suggests that the former might contain both receptors that are capable of binding IL-24. The gel shift assays were then conducted for the functional analysis of STAT activation in the HaCaT cells by IL-24-His (Fig. 5 B). After a 30-min stimulation, IL-24-His-treated cells showed a marked increase in STAT activation (Fig. 5 B). It is possible that the IL-24-induced STAT activation in HaCaT cells could be due to IL-24 binding to either the IL-20 receptor or to the IL-22R1/IL-20R2 heterodimer. To differentiate between these two possibilities, vectors expressing either IL-20R1 and IL-20R2, or IL-22R1 and IL-20R2 were transfected into the BHK cell line, which does not have endogenous IL-24 receptors as predicted by the lack of IL-20R2 expression. Interestingly, upon stimulation of the transfected cells with either the control or IL-24-His-conditioned medium, the gel shift assay revealed that both the IL-20 receptor (IL-20R1/IL-20R2) and the IL-22R1/IL-20R2 heterodimeric receptor were able to confer comparable and robust IL-24-dependent STAT activation (Fig.6 A). None of the receptor subunits alone, including IL-20R2, were able to confer IL-24-dependent STAT activation (data not shown). These data are consistent with the receptor binding assays (Fig. 3). Finally, to determine which STAT was activated by IL-24 in BHK cells transfected with the IL-24 receptor (IL-22R1/IL-20R2), antibodies against different STATs were used to interfere with the gel shift assays. A higher resolution band-shift gel showed that IL-24 binding to its heterodimeric receptor led to the activation of both STAT-1 and -3, which could be interfered (for STAT-1) or super-shifted (for STAT-3) by the corresponding antibodies, respectively (Fig. 6 B). IL-10 is known to be a potent inhibitor of cytokine synthesis induced by LPS (28Wang P., Wu, P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 811-816PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-24 has a similar biological activity, freshly prepared human PBMCs were stimulated with LPS in the absence or presence of IL-10, IL-24, or both. The effects of IL-10 and IL-24 on LPS-induced TNF-α production were determined by ELISA. Unlike IL-10, IL-24 did not appear to have any inhibitory effect on TNF-α induction by LPS in PBMCs (Fig.7). In this report, we show that human IL-24 (MDA-7), which is heavily glycosylated, is produced by PBMCs following ConA stimulation, like most of the members of the IL-10 family of cytokines. While this work was in progress, a gene designated FISP was reported to be a secreted protein produced by murine Th2 cells (10Schaefer G. Venkataraman V. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5859-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence homology, FISP is likely the mouse ortholog of IL-24. Together these evidence support that IL-24 is a T cell-derived cytokine. Like IL-22 (12Xie M.H. Aggarwal S., Ho, W.H. Foster J. Zhang Z. Stinson J. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Gurney A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31335-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), IL-24 is unable to inhibit LPS induced cytokine production by PBMCs, an activity that still appears to be unique to IL-10 (27Moore K.W. Vieira P. Fiorentino D.F. Trounstine M.L. Khan T.A. Mosmann T.R. Science. 1990; 248: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 28Wang P., Wu, P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 811-816PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, ligand binding studies using AP alone and IL-24-AP, indicated that few cells in PBMCs appeared to have IL-24 receptors (data not shown). The identification of two functional IL-24 receptor heterodimers, one consisting of two recently identified class II cytokine receptors, IL-22R1 and IL-20R2, and the other being the IL-20 receptor (IL-20R1/IL-20R2), provides the final proof that IL-24 is indeed a new member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, following IL-20 and IL-22. However, the finding of two different IL-24 receptors with similar affinity to IL-24 raises an interesting issue for future research into whether these are functionally redundant receptors or whether they are differentially used by IL-24, depending on cellular context. Likewise, the utilization of IL-20R1/IL-20R2 by either IL-20 (K d = 1.5 nm) (3Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) or IL-24 (K d = 8 nm) raises the issue as to whether these cytokines induce identical signals downstream or they would compete for utilization of the same receptor to a different biological end point. It is interesting to note that the affinity of IL-10 to its receptor appears to be an order of magnitude higher than those of IL-20 and IL-24 (28Wang P., Wu, P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 811-816PubMed Google Scholar). Although the three previously known receptors of the IL-10 family of cytokines are all heterodimeric, each being made up of a R1 type and a R2 type of receptor subunit, IL-10 and IL-22 share the same R2 type of receptor subunit, IL-10R2. It is very interesting to note that IL-24 not only shares the same R2 type of receptor subunit with IL-20, but also its R1 type of receptor subunit is shared with IL-22. The implication from the discovery of such a scheme of receptor subunit swapping is important in two aspects. First, it implies that there could be a total of six combinations of heterodimeric receptors made up of three known R1 and two known R2 receptor subunits, to which four combinations now have already assigned ligands, IL-10, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24 (Table I). Thus, two more receptors made up of IL-10R1/IL-20R2 and IL-20R1/IL-10R2 may also have their specific ligands. Incidentally, there are indeed two more IL-10-like cytokines without their known receptors, IL-19 (2Gallagher G. Dickensheets H. Eskadale J. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Peat J.D. Pestka S. Vazquez N. Donnelly R.P. Kotenko S.V. Genes Inmmun. 2000; 1: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and AK155 (6Knappe A. Hor S. Wittmann S. Fickenscher H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), both of which are encoded by cellular genes. It is possible that more R1 or R2 receptor subunits remain to be discovered and the discovery of the receptor-ligand relationship presented in this study should be helpful for the identification and assignment of their corresponding ligands. Obviously, the current nomenclature for the IL-10 family of receptor subunits has not taken the consideration of such extensive receptor subunit swapping. The use of the CRF2-X designation system (15Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) may turned out to be more appropriate, since any given R1 or R2 receptor subunit may be shared by more than one ligand.Table IIL-10 Family of cytokines and receptorsR1/R2IL-10R2IL-20R2IL-10R1IL-10?IL-20R1?IL-20, IL-24IL-22R1IL-22IL-24 Open table in a new tab Second, the scheme of receptor subunit swapping uncovered here further supports the prediction that there is cross-talk among the IL-10 family of cytokines (11Kotenko S.V.

Clearly shown by this study, like IL-20 (3Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), IL-24 can signal through the IL-20 receptor. Conversely, IL-20 may also be able to signal through the new IL-24 receptor (IL-22R1/IL-20R2). Moreover, our finding of IL-22R1 being the first R1 type of receptor subunit shared by two different ligands of the IL-10 family of cytokines, would also predict a potential cross-talk between IL-22 and IL-24. For example, although we showed that IL-24 could not signal through the IL-22 receptor (IL-22R1/IL-10R2), it is not clear if IL-22 will be able to signal through the IL-24 receptor(s). Such potential cross-talk among the IL-10 family of cytokines and their receptors can now be readily tested. Dysfunction in the control of such ligand-receptor cross-talk as a result of aberrant expression of the cytokines and their receptors could be one of the underlying causes for diseases, such as cancer. We have shown that ras oncogenes cause constitutive expression of IL-24 in cells from nonhematopoietic origin (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ras transformed rat embryo fibroblasts and intestinal epithelial cells not only constitutively produce IL-24, but also appear to have increased expression of the IL-24 receptor(s) (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Like IL-20, one of the likely normal target tissues for IL-24 is skin, since the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT appears to express both endogenous IL-24 receptors. This is also consistent with the finding that IL-24 is transiently expressed in lesions of skin injury from a rat wound healing model (8Soo C. Shaw W.W. Freymiller E. Longaker M.T. Bertolami C.N. Chiu R. Tieu A. Ting K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). While little expression of IL-22R1 was detected from colon and lung, overexpression of the gene was found in cancer cell lines from these tissue origins (11Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Esterova E. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2725-2732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It will be also important to determine how virally encoded IL-10-like cytokines participate in cell infection and transformation, and through which receptor(s) these viral cytokines function. It should be pointed out that the human IL-24 gene (mda-7), when ectopically expressed, was reported to have growth inhibitory effect on some cancer cell lines (29Jiang H., Su, Z. Lin J.J. Goldstein N.I. Young C.S.H. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9160-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which is in paradox with our finding that the gene is both induced by theras oncogene and overexpressed in colon cancer tissues (data not shown). With the finding that IL-24 is a secreted cytokine, as we predicted previously, and it functions through its specific heterodimeric receptors, the apparent contradiction now may be clarified by more mechanistic experimentation. Taken together, our work presented here should help to shed light on future work on how aberrations in the expression of IL-24 or other members of IL-10 family of cytokines and their receptors could contribute to neoplastic cell transformation. We are grateful to Dr. Lynn Matrisian and Emily Thomas for critical reading of the manuscript and to the Molecular Recognition Core facility of Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center for generating the monoclonal antibody to IL-24. In concordance with the nomenclature of established members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, MDA-7/MOB-5 has been renamed as interleukin 24 (IL-24) with the approval of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee."

Mutations in the p48 gene that cause the loss of DDB activity were found in a subset of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E (XP-E) patients and have linked to the deficiency in global genomic repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in these cells. Here we show that with a highly defined system of purified repair factors, DDB can greatly stimulate the excision reaction reconstituted with XPA, RPA, XPC·HR23B, TFIIH, XPF·ERCC1 and XPG, up to 17-fold for CPDs and ∼2-fold for (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs), indicating that no additional factor is required for the stimulation by DDB. Transfection of thep48 cDNA into an SV40-transformed human cell line, WI38VA13, was found to enhance DDB activity and the in vivoremoval of CPDs and 6-4PPs. Furthermore, the combined technique of recently developed micropore UV irradiation and immunostaining revealed that p48 (probably in the form of DDB heterodimer) accumulates at locally damaged DNA sites immediately after UV irradiation, and this accumulation is also observed in XP-A and XP-C cells expressing exogenous p48. These results suggest that DDB can rapidly translocate to the damaged DNA sites independent of functional XPA and XPC proteins and directly enhance the excision reaction by core repair factors.

The recent in vivo studies showed that XP-E cells are selectively defective in global genomic repair (GGR) (14Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), which repairs lesions from both nontranscribed genomic DNA and the nontranscribed strand of expressed genes. Chu and colleagues have demonstrated that Chinese hamster cells lack DDB activity and that the cells have a defect in the GGR of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), but not (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs) (13Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of the p48 gene into Chinese hamster cells conferred the DDB activity as well as GGR activity for CPDs (19Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recently we found that DDB stimulates the excision of CPDs, but not of 6-4PPs, with cell-free extracts (CFEs) from Chinese hamster cells (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All of these data suggest that DDB can be involved in the recognition process of CPDs in GGR. In this study we have employed a defined system to test the direct effect of DDB on the in vitro excision reaction using purified repair proteins. Furthermore, we have established the SV40-transformed human cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged p48 and investigated a role of DDB in NER in vivo. DDB heterodimer was overexpressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system and extensively purified by a modification of the procedure described previously (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, after chromatographic separation on a SP-Sepharose column, the fractions containing DDB heterodimer were combined and dialyzed against buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m KCl and applied to a heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) column. After extensive washing, proteins were eluted by a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 m KCl in buffer A. DDB was then purified by anti-FLAG affinity gels (Sigma) as described previously (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The other six repair factors, XPA, RPA, XPC·HR23B, TFIIH, XPF·ERCC1, and XPG, which are necessary for the reconstitution experiment, were prepared basically as described previously (21Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); all the factors except TFIIH were recombinant proteins. The assay measures release of 24–32-nucleotide-long oligomer by dual incision of damaged DNA (22Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The substrates for the excision repair assay were a 136-bp duplex-DNA containing a cis-syn-cyclobutane thymine-thymine dimer or a thymine-thymine (6-4) photoproduct in the center and 32P-label at fourth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion (23Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The substrate (3 or 6 fmol) was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated periods with six repair factors (60 ng of XPA, 300 ng of RPA, 20 ng of XPC·HR23B, 75 or 150 ng of TFIIH, 20 ng of XPF·ERCC1, and 10 ng of XPG) in 25 μl of reaction buffer (32 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 64 mm KCl, 6.44 mm MgCl2, 0.16 mm dithiothreitol, 0.16 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, and 4% glycerol). To investigate the effect of DDB on the reconstituted system, various amounts of DDB were added to the reaction. After incubation, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and either visualized by autoradiography or quantified by exposing the gels to Bas2000 imaging screens and measuring the intensities with a Fuji Bas2000 Bioimaging Analyzer. The SV40-transformed normal human cell line, WI38VA13, and various XP cell lines listed below were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS): XP2OSSV (XP group A), XP4PASV (XP group C), and XP2YOSV (XP group F).p48 cDNA with FLAG epitope sequences was excised from pFASTBac1-Fp48 used for baculovirus/insect cell system (20Wakasugi M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Human cells were transfected with the pcDNA-Fp48 plasmid using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacture's instructions and selected in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS containing 400–600 μg/ml Geneticin (Sigma). Human cells were irradiated with 10 or 40 J/m2 UV light (254 nm) from a germicidal lamp (Toshiba, GL-10) and incubated for various periods. Genomic DNAs were purified with the DNeasy kit (Qiagen), and the amounts of CPDs and 6-4PPs were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific monoclonal antibodies, TDM-2 or 64M-2, respectively, as described previously (24Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Micropore UV irradiation was carried out essentially as described previously (25Katsumi S. Kobayashi N. Imoto K. Nakagawa A. Yamashita Y. Muramatsu T. Shirai T. Miyagawa S. Sugiura S. Hanaoka F. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Mori T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1156-1161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing FLAG-tagged p48 were inoculated at 2–8 × 105 cells in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.). After 1- or 2-day incubation, cells were covered with an isopore polycarbonate membrane filter (Milipore Corp., pore size 8 μm in diameter) and exposed to 100 J/m2 UV light. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Wako) at 4 °C for 15 min, permeabilized with ice-cold detergent solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) on ice for 5 min, and treated with 20% FBS in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min for masking nonspecific binding sites of antibodies. After incubation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and sequentially Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes), fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica DMIRBE microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics). We previously reported that DDB stimulates the excision of CPDs by CFEs prepared from AA8 Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack DDB (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, we did not exclude the possibility that DDB titrated out unknown inhibitory factors in CFEs or that other factors in CFEs mediated the stimulation. To clarify these points, we have now utilized a defined system with purified repair proteins. DNA substrates containing a CPD were incubated with purified DDB (100 ng) and appropriate amounts of six core NER factors, XPA, RPA, XPC·HR23B, TFIIH, XPF·ERCC1, and XPG (Fig.1A). To our surprise, DDB could greatly enhance the excision of CPDs in the defined system, and the stimulatory effect (5–17-fold) was much higher than that observed in the crude system (3–4-fold) (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrating that no additional factor is required for the stimulation of CPD repair by DDBin vitro. Similar experiments were conducted to determine the effect of DDB on the excision of 6-4PPs in the defined system. In contrast to the results with CPD substrates, 100 ng of DDB failed to stimulate the excision of 6-4PPs and rather inhibited the reaction by ∼2-fold (data not shown, also see Fig. 1B, lane 4). However, the excision of 6-4PPs could be stimulated ∼2-fold when 0.1–1 ng of DDB was used (Fig. 1B). We previously observed an inhibitory effect or no effect of DDB on 6-4PP excision in a concentration range of 4.4–280 ng/25-μl reaction using the crude system (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Optimum DDB concentrations for stimulation of 6-4PP repair appear to be much lower than for that of CPD repair, probably due to the much stronger affinity of DDB for 6-4PPs versus cys-syn CPDs (10Reardon J.T.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We speculate that nonphysiological excess amounts of DDB to 6-4PPs may produce abnormal complexes that are nonproductive for excision. The in vitro stimulation prompted us to test whether DDB also acts as a stimulatory factor for NER in vivo. We transfected the p48 gene with FLAG epitope sequences (pcDNA-Fp48) into the SV40-transformed human cell line, WI38VA13, which exhibits relatively low DDB activity in vitro and repair activity in vivo (data not shown), probably due to the inactivation of p53 function by the SV40 large T antigen. The protein levels of FLAG-p48 in each stable clone correlate well with their DDB activity (Fig. 2,A and B), indicating that the exogenous FLAG-tagged p48 forms a heterodimeric complex with endogenous p127, since both subunits are required for DDB activity (12Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Two clones (C-5 and C-18) showing high FLAG-p48 expression and DDB activity exhibited enhanced repair capacity for both types of photolesions (Fig.2C). It should be noted that, at 2 h, the repair of 6-4PPs is more significantly enhanced, while at 4–24 h, CPDs are repaired faster than the WI38VA13/pcDNA3.1 (V-3) control cells, suggesting that 6-4PPs are the early target, and CPDs are a later target for DDB. Since transfection of p48 into the rodent cells lacking DDB showed no effect on the 6-4PP repair (19Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), human cells may require DDB for the efficient repair of 6-4PPs more than do rodent cells, which is supported by the fact that XP-E cells carrying the p48 mutations also exhibited partial deficiency in 6-4PP repair (14Hwang B.J.

Dermatol. 1999; 113: 251-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether DDB actually translocates to the damaged sites in vivo, we have employed the micropore UV irradiation technique that enables us to induce photoproducts in a localized area of the cell nucleus (25Katsumi S. Kobayashi N. Imoto K. Nakagawa A. Yamashita Y. Muramatsu T. Shirai T. Miyagawa S. Sugiura S. Hanaoka F. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Mori T. J. Invest.

Without UV irradiation, homogeneous fluorescence staining was observed in the nucleus of WI38VA13/pcDNA-Fp48 (C-5) cells, but not of WI38VA13/pcDNA3.1 (V-3) control cells (Fig. 3A), consistent with the previous reports that p48 subunit alone or DDB heterodimer localizes within the nucleus (7Chu G.

The micropore UV irradiation dramatically changed the localization of p48 from homogeneous staining to localized foci within the nucleus, which can be observed even in the cells fixed without incubation after UV (Fig.3C). Furthermore, the localized staining pattern of p48 was completely merged with CPD localization (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that p48 (probably in the form of DDB heterodimer) translocates to the damaged DNA sites very rapidly, in agreement with the notion that DDB acts at a very early step of NER. However, we failed to observe the localized staining of p48 after 2 h or later following the UV irradiation (data not shown). We considered that the loss of the localized staining might reflect the rapid turnover of DDB in the NER reaction. We generated the XP2YOSV cell line, which belongs to XP group F (XP-F) and therefore carries a defect in the 5′ endonuclease, and also expresses FLAG-tagged p48. When this repair-deficient cell line was subjected to the micropore UV irradiation, the localized staining of p48 could be observed even at 24 h after UV (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the association of DDB at the damaged sites appears to be productive for the subsequent NER process.Figure 4Effect of XPA,XPC, or XPF mutations upon accumulation of DDB. XP2OSSV/pcDNA-Fp48 (XP-A), XP4PASV/pcDNA-Fp48 (XP-C), or XP2YOSV/pcDNA-Fp48 (XP-F) cells were irradiated with 100 J/m2 UV light through an isopore membrane filter and incubated for 0.5 or 24 h in the culture medium. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the question of whether the rapid intranuclear translocation of DDB requires other NER factors, we conducted similar experiments with the XP2OSSV (XP-A) and XP4PASV (XP-C) cell lines expressing FLAG-p48 (Fig. 4). Accumulation of DDB could be observed in both cell lines at 30 min as well as 24 h after the micropore UV irradiation, indicating that XPA and XPC proteins are not required for the translocation of DDB to the damaged sites. These results together with the in vitro data and the literature lead us to propose that most of CPDs and some of 6-4PPs are recognized by DDB, which can recruit other repair factors including XPA and XPC. Consistently, it has been reported that CPDs are hardly recognized by XPC·HR23B, which binds to 6-4PPs with high affinity (30Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We previously showed that DDB enhances the binding of XPA to CPD-containing DNA and that it forms a complex with XPA or XPA and RPA on damaged DNA (20Wakasugi M. Shimizu M. Morioka H. Linn S. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence XPA or XPA·RPA seems to be the repair factor that is attracted to the DNA damage sites by DDB, but the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Another role suggested for DDB is to mediate chromatin modification and/or remodeling at the damaged sites (13Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Otrin V.R. McLenigan M. Takao M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J.

Res. 2001; 486: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is, however, unlikely that the stimulation of in vitro excision reaction by DDB in this study is related to the chromatin modification, since we used the pure system with naked DNA and purified repair proteins. DDB might play multiple roles in the NER reaction in vivo, damage recognition, and the recruitment of other repair factors as well as of chromatin modification factors to the damaged DNA sites.

ONOO− is highly reactive toward all classes of biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and is a potential candidate for effecting the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In proteins, ONOO− modifies residues such as cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine (4Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). The irreversible modification of protein residues by ONOO−, such as nitration of critical tyrosine amino acids exhibits functional consequences like inactivation of a wide variety of enzymes (5Muszynska G.

It has also been reported that tyrosine nitration may interfere with signal transduction pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation (10Gow A.J. Duran D. Malcolm S. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The formation of 3,3′-dityrosine is known to result in inter- or intramolecular cross-linking of proteins such as membrane receptors consequently affecting the cell signaling pathways (11van der Vliet A.

Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidants may play a role as signaling intermediates required for receptor tyrosine kinase function and downstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (12Rosen G.M.

The aim of the present studies was to examine the role of ONOO− in the regulation of cytokines production by human monocytes and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from whole blood taken from healthy donors by a density-gradient centrifugation method (Histopaque-1017® and 1119® mediums, Sigma, Poole, UK). Briefly, into 15-ml conical Falcon centrifuge tubes (Falcon, Roskilde, Denmark) 3 ml of Histopaque-1017® were layered on top of 3 ml of Histopaque-1119® medium. 6 ml of whole blood carefully layered onto the upper gradient of the tubes were then centrifuged at 700 × g for 30 min at room temperature (18–22 °C). Distinct opaque layers of mononuclear cells were recovered from the top band and twice washed in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The cells were suspended in serum-free Hanks' balanced salt medium without phenol red, supplemented with Ham's nutrients F-12 and bovine serum albumin (0.25% w/v) at pH 7.4. 1 ml of cell suspension was added into 1.5-ml plastic tubes and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The culture medium was then removed from tubes leaving monocytes adhering to the plastic surface. The monocytes were further washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove any non-adherent cells. Fresh 1 ml of medium was then added at the start of experiments. Monocytes (1 × 10 (6)) were treated with authentic ONOO− (CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) suspended in 4.7% NaOH at pH 12.0, in bolus doses. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C in an air, 5% CO2 incubator, the effect of various concentrations of ONOO− on proinflammatory cytokine release was determined in the cell lysates. Cell lysates were prepared after rapid homogenization in the medium by using an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer, with a dispersing tool (IKA Laboratories, Staufen, Germany) at 20,000 rpm. The crude lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the supernatants were transferred into precooled tubes, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. A control aliquot treated with decomposed ONOO− (suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4) was also included. To study the effect of tyrosine nitration on proinflammatory cytokine release, cells were treated with the nitration inhibitor EGCG,1 at 0, 1, 10, and 100 μm, with or without 10 μmONOO− for 6 h. Furthermore, the distinct role of ONOO− on cytokine release, was studied in monocytes by treatment with a ONOO− scavenger, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron (III) chloride (FeTPPS) at 200 μm in the presence and absence of EGCG (10 μm). Transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory cytokine release was investigated by treating the cells with 10 μm ONOO− in the presence and absence of proteasome inhibitor, Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO, a known inhibitor of NF-κB activity. In addition, the role of ONOO−, FeTPPS, and EGCG in the induction of NF-κB activity in monocytes nuclear extracts was investigated. TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 levels in cell lysates were determined by standard ELISA assays (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA). Nitration of protein tyrosine residues was determined by a highly sensitive competitive ELISA assay described previously (13Khan J. Brennan D.M. Bradley N. Gao B. Bruckdorfer R. Jacobs M. Biochem. J. 1998; 300: 795-801Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using a modification of a previously published method (14Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Briefly, after experiments monocytes were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then 100 μl of Dignam buffer A, composed of 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 μl of inhibitor mixture (Sigma)/ml of buffer A, was added, and the tubes were vortexed vigorously on the highest setting for 15 s. The tubes were then incubated on ice for 10 min. 11 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 solution was added to each tube followed by vortexing for 5 s on the highest setting and incubated on ice for 1 min. The tubes were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant fractions were collected into clean prechilled tubes and stored on ice. The insoluble fractions (pellet), which contain nuclei, were then resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 100 μl of inhibitor mixture/ml of buffer B), vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and incubated on ice for a total of 40 min with mixing at every 10 min. The tubes were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, for 10 min. The supernatant (nuclear extract) fraction was immediately transferred into clean prechilled tubes and placed on ice. 5 μl of all the extract fractions were used for protein quantification by a standard Bradford assay (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), and the rest was stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, respectively, were separated for NF-κB p65/Rel A and IκB-α by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The presence of NF-κB p65/Rel A in nuclear extracts was determined by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal NF-κB p65 (Rel A) antiserum. IκB-α was determined in the corresponding cytoplasmic extracts after immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum or a monoclonal anti-phospho-IκB-α that recognizes phosphorylated IκB-α at amino acid residues serine 32 and serine 36 only. All the antibodies used in this part of the study were obtained from CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK. The immunoblot signal was visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence and scanned with an Epson Expression 1600 Pro. The relative intensities of bands were determined using an NIH Image 1.62 package. The assay is based on that DNA-protein complexes migrate slower than unbound DNA or double-stranded oligonucleotides in a native polyacrylamide or agarose gel, resulting in a “shift” in migration of the labeled DNA band. The detection of bands was by “The LightShiftTM Chemiluminescent EMSA kit” (Pierce) that uses a non-isotopic method to detect DNA-protein interactions. Biotin end-labeled DNA duplex of sequence 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3 and 3′-TCA ACT CCC CTG AAA GGG TCC G-5′ containing a putative binding site for nuclear factor κB was incubated with the nuclear extracts. After the reaction the DNA-protein complexes were subjected to a 6% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne B membrane also supplied by Pierce). As gel shift controls, lane 1 contained Epstein-Barr virus nuclear extracts (EBNA) and biotin-labeled control oligonucleotide duplex with a binding site of: 5′-..TAGCATATGCTA..3′ and 3′-..ATCGTATACGAT-5′. Lane 2 contained EBNA extract, biotin-labeled control oligonucleotide and unlabeled control oligonucleotide for competitive binding inhibition. After transfer the membrane was immediately cross-linked for 15 min on a UV transilluminator equiped with 312 nm bulbs. A chemiluminescent detection method utilizing a luminol/enhancer solution and a stable peroxide solution (Pierce) was used as described by the manufacturer, and membranes were exposed to x-ray films for 2–5 min before developing. The bands were scanned with an Epson Expression 1600 Pro, and relative intensities were analyzed by using an NIH Image 1.62 package Cytotoxicity was measured by the MTT cell viability assay (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by a one-way analysis of variance analysis, and values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ONOO− caused a bell-shaped dose-response curve on the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by monocytes (Fig.1, A and B). Peak values were observed at ONOO− concentrations of 2–20 μm followed by a reduction at higher concentrations. The reduction in cytokine production at 200 μmONOO− was not due to the loss of cell viability, since MTT values, an index of viability, were unaffected (data not shown). These results suggest that ONOO− is an important regulator of cytokine production by monocytes. The pattern of 3-nitrotyrosine formation resulting from treatment of monocytes with a range of ONOO− concentrations suggests that significant increase in protein nitration occur at 200 μm ONOO− (Fig.2A). To study the effect of tyrosine nitration on cytokine response, monocytes were treated with EGCG, an inhibitor of nitration, in the presence and absence of 10 μm ONOO−. It was observed that a significant reduction in nitration of tyrosine residues occurs when mononuclear cells are treated with EGCG at 10–100 μm in the presence and absence of ONOO− (Fig. 2B). Fig.3, A and B, show that ONOO− (10 μm) and EGCG (10 μm) increased TNF-α and IL-6 production and that the combination of the two did not have additive effect.Figure 3The effect of eEGCG on cytokine production. Monocytes were treated with 10 μm EGCG in the presence and absence of 10 μm ONOO−for 6 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

As shown before, treating the cells with EGCG significantly increased the release of TNF-α and IL-6; however, FeTPPS alone and in combination with EGCG almost completely abolished the release of cytokines. To determine whether ONOO−modulates proinflammatory cytokines at the transcriptional level, mononuclear cells were stimulated with 0, 10, and 200 μmONOO− concentrations in the presence and absence of proteasome inhibitor (20 μm). The proteasome inhibitor blocks the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and therefore suppresses activation of NF-κB by stabilizing IκB-α. The results show that the proteasome inhibitor blocks the release of proinflammatory cytokines induced by ONOO− (Fig.5, A and B), suggesting that this action is regulated via NF-κB activation. Further evidence of transcriptional modulation of NF-κB by ONOO− was obtained by investigating the nuclear translocation of p65/RelA subunits of NF-κB and DNA binding capacity. The proportion of phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated IκB-α molecules in cytoplasmic cell extracts was also determined. Monocytes were incubated with various doses of ONOO− (0, 10, and 200 μm), EGCG (1, 10, and 100 μm), and FeTPPS (200 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Greater NF-κB p65/Rel A values were detected in cells treated with 10 μm ONOO− and EGCG (1–100 μm) (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas they were decreased with 200 μmONOO− and with FeTPPS. EMSA shift assays also showed that the greatest DNA binding activity was with monocytes treated with 10 μm ONOO− and EGCG (1–100 μm), while no binding was detected in those treated with 200 μm ONOO− and FeTPPS (Fig.7, A and B). As shown in Fig. 8, A–C, IκB-α was significantly dephosphorylated by ONOO− at all concentrations and also significantly phosphorylated at all EGCG concentrations, but the greatest degree of IκB-α phosphorylation was induced by FeTPPS.Figure 7Determination of the effect of ONOO−, EGCG, and FeTPPS on NF-κB/p65 DNA binding.

In particular, the actions of ONOO− on leukocyte migration and accumulation at the site of inflammation remains contradictory. On one hand, nanomolar concentrations of ONOO− have been reported to inhibit adhesion of granulocytes to the endothelium of the rat mesenteric vascular bed, and this has been shown to be mediated via down-regulation of P-selectin expression on the endothelial cell surface (16Lefer D.J. Scalia R. Campbell B. Nossuli T. Hayward R. Salamon M. Grayson J. Lefer A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the other hand, scavenging of ONOO− by uric acid has been shown to decrease the invasion of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord of a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (17Hooper D.C. Scott G.S. Zborek A. Mikheeva T. Kean R.B. Koprowski H. Spitsin S.V. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies (18Zouki C. Zhang S.-L. Chan J.S.D. Filep J.G. FASEB J. 2000; 15: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have shown that micromolar concentrations of ONOO− activates Erk in neutrophils via the Ras/Raf-1/MEK signal transduction pathway, which although leads to down-regulation of L-selectin, it also up-regulates surface expression of CD11b/CD18 and consequently increases neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. The demonstration that ONOO− mediates IL-8 gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human whole blood (19Filep J.G. Beuchamp M. Baron C. Paquette Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5656-5662PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the notion that ONOO− is involved in the regulation of inflammatory reaction by blood leukocytes; however, the mechanism of this action remains unclear. The present studies have demonstrated that the production of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 by human mononuclear cells is predominantly regulated by ONOO− in a concentration-dependent manner. This action is mediated via the transcription factor NF-κB, by a mechanism that may involve nitration or dephosphorylation of its inhibitor IκB-α. We have shown that ONOO− affects NF-κB activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6, A and B) and completely dephosphorylates IκB-α at concentrations of 10–200 μm (Fig. 7,A and B). In addition, ONOO− at high concentrations nitrates tyrosine residues in cell lysates (Fig.2A) that in turn block phosphorylation of these amino acids in IκB-α molecules and possibly promotes IκB-α degradation. This thesis is supported by previous reports showing that tyrosine nitration interferes with the process of phosphorylation and that nitrated IκB-α molecules are themselves targets for rapid degradation by intracellular enzymes (10Gow A.J. Duran D. Malcolm S. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Singh et al. (20Singh S. Darnay B. Aggarwal B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have shown that tyrosine residue at site 42 (Tyr-42) on IκB-α is the specific acceptor site for phosphorylation, which prevents IκB-α degradation. This implies that ONOO− may activate NF-κB simply by nitrating critical residues in IκB-α that would normally be phosphorylated. Taken together, it is possible to speculate that ONOO− at concentrations ≤20 μm may nitrate tyrosine residues, including the critical site Tyr-42, a reaction that blocks its phosphorylation. However, IκB-α molecules containing nitrated tyrosine residues are themselves targets for degradation that would result in increased NF-κB activity. In contrast, 200 μm ONOO−inhibits NF-κB activation, because this concentration causes extensive nitration and dephosphorylation of amino acid residues in both NF-κB subunits and IκB-α. This extensive nitration step prevents NF-κB nuclear translocation probably in two ways. The first is by causing extensive nitration of tyrosine residues in NF-κB and IκB-α, which renders both molecules targets for degradation by proteases, thus resulting in very little nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits (Fig. 6A). The second may involve inactivation of intracellular degrading enzymes induced by extensive nitration that in turn fails to degrade IκB-α. Candidate proteases that may be inactivated by high ONOO− concentrations are the HOS-SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, IκB-α kinases, other protein tyrosine kinases, and the 26 S proteasome. Treatment of cells with EGCG (10 μm) induced increases in TNF-α and IL-6 release. Western blots of nuclear extracts separated by SDS-PAGE showed that EGCG at concentrations of 1–100 μm increases p65 nuclear translocation and DNA binding in the presence and absence of ONOO−, suggesting that this is the mechanism by which EGCG promotes NF-κB activity and cytokine release in mononuclear cells. From our results it may be possible to hypothesize that EGCG protects tyrosine residues from nitration (Fig.2) without preventing phosphorylation. Thus, although EGCG may effectively protect tyrosine residues from nitration, it may not prevent the phosphorylation of serines 32 and 36, a phenomenon previously described as the signal for IκB-α degradation by the 26 S proteasome (10Gow A.J. Duran D. Malcolm S. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of nitration, phosphorylation of IκB-α leads to the observed NF-κB activation that in turn increases cytokine production. The removal of ONOO− by FeTPPS protects tyrosine residues from nitration but not phosphorylation. The absence of nitration resulted in an extensive phosphorylation of IκB-α molecule (Fig.8A), probably of serine residues 32 and 36 and critical Tyr-42 residues. The phosphorylation of a large proportion of Tyr-42 residues would prevent the degradation of IκB-α molecules, as observed by Singh et al. (20Singh S. Darnay B. Aggarwal B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), that remain trapped within the cytoplasm. However, it cannot be ruled out that an increase in protein synthesis may also play a part in the total elevation of cytoplasmic IκB-α (Fig. 8B). It has been shown in the literature that ONOO− exhibits diverse effects in vivo dependent on the tissue affected and its environment (16Lefer D.J. Scalia R. Campbell B. Nossuli T. Hayward R. Salamon M. Grayson J. Lefer A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21Nossuli T.O. Hayward R. Scalia R. Lefer A.M.

Ther. 2000; 292: 912-920PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have disclosed that ONOO− modulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by mononuclear leukocytes in a concentration-dependent manner via the transcription factor NF-κB activation. Furthermore, the interplay between nitration and phosphorylation of amino acid residues involved in the intracellular signaling pathways appears to be an important regulatory mechanism.

The characteristic desmoplastic stromal reaction of pancreatic adenocarcinoma greatly hampers expression studies in this tumour type, and usually necessitates time-consuming tissue microdissection for enrichment of the tumour cell population. We show that fine needle aspiration of cancer provides a fast and efficient way of obtaining samples highly enriched in tumour cells with sufficient yields of RNA. Using Atlas cancer cDNA arrays with 588 cancer-related genes, we describe gene expression profiles of normal pancreas, bulk pancreatic tumour tissues and pancreatic tumour aspirates containing more than 95% tumour cells. Analysis of bulk tissue specimens revealed differentially expressed genes belonging predominantly to the stromal component of the tumour. This contrasted with the results obtained from tumour-cell enriched samples. Several genes already described in pancreatic cancer (caspase 8, TIMP1, CD9, IL-13) were also differentially expressed in our study. Furthermore, we found dysregulated expression of genes not previously associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, such as Rac 1, GLG1, NEDD5, RPL-13a, RPS9 and members of the Wnt5A gene family. In summary, we present a panel of genes newly identified in the pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and demonstrate that fine needle aspirates of the tumour mass are a convenient source of material for gene expression studies in tumours accompanied by desmoplastic reactions."

This protein was recently found to be highly inducible by p53 in a colon carcinoma cell line, DLD-1, and designated as PIG1 (for p53-inducedgene 1). We studied transfectants of HeLa and DLD-1 cells ectopically expressing this protein and found that they were more susceptible to apoptosis than control transfectants. This was observed in apoptosis induced by mechanistically distinct stimuli, suggesting that galectin-7 acts on a common point in the apoptosis signaling pathways. Further analyses of actinomycin D-induced apoptosis demonstrated that galectin-7 expression causes enhanced caspase-3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and the potentiation of apoptosis by galectin-7 was completely abrogated by a caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone. In addition, galectin-7 transfectants displayed accelerated mitochondrial cytochrome c release and up-regulated JNK activity upon apoptosis induction. Several lines of evidence indicate that the effect on apoptosis is not due to the lectin functioning extracellularly through interactions with cell surface glycoconjugates. In fact, this lectin is found to localize in nuclei and cytoplasm of the transfectants and the transformed keratinocyte line HaCaT.

Family members have sequence similarity to each other and are evolutionarily highly conserved, because they are present in organisms from nematodes to vertebrates. These proteins all lack a classical signal peptide and are mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but they can be secreted, possibly through a nonclassical secretory pathway (6Hughes R.C. Biochim.

Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). More recently, galectin-7 has been shown to be rapidly inducible in skin keratinocytes exposed to UV irradiation in association with p53 stabilization, and the increased levels of the protein was mainly found in sunburned apoptotic keratinocytes (23Bernerd F. Sarasin A. Magnaldo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11329-11334Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of galectin-7 in a squamous cell line by transient transfection resulted in increased apoptosis, suggesting a pro-apoptotic function of this protein (23Bernerd F. Sarasin A. Magnaldo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11329-11334Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of galectin-7's pro-apoptotic function, we have generated and studied stable transfectants of HeLa and DLD-1 cells ectopically expressing this protein. We found that galectin-7 expression results in increased apoptosis induced by stimuli that operate through distinct mechanisms, suggesting that galectin-7 acts on a common point in the apoptosis signaling pathways. Additional mechanistic analyses revealed that the accelerated apoptosis caused by galectin-7 is caspase-dependent and associated with mitochondrial cytochrome c release as well as heightened JNK1 activation. Finally, DNA microarray analysis of mRNA differentially expressed in galectin-7 and control transfectants showed up-regulation of several gene groups suggestive of galectin-7's involvement in tissue remodeling processes. The analysis also revealed genes that are potentially connected to the pro-apoptotic function of galectin-7, and these include a set of redox-related genes that are either up- or down-regulated as a result of the ectopic expression of galectin-7. HeLa and DLD-1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HaCaT cells were kindly provided by Dr. N. Fusenig (Deutsche Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany) (24Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Actinomycin D, etoposide, camptothecin, cycloheximide, digitonin, and human recombinant TNF-α were from Sigma. zVAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) was from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA). Anti-caspase-3 (CPP32) monoclonal antibody (clone 19) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibodies against PARP (clone C2–10), caspase-8 (clone B9–2), and cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12) were from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against JNK1 (polyclonal goat and mouse sera) and p38 (polyclonal rabbit serum) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Bio-Rad. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Galectin-7 and -9 cDNA were obtained as expressed sequence tag clones from ATCC. For antibody production, galectin-7 and -9 cDNA were cloned into pET25b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and pTrcHis2C (Invitrogen), respectively. These recombinant proteins were used to produce goat and rabbit antibodies against galectin-7 and -9, respectively. For transfection, cDNA was cloned into pEF1-neo (25Yang R.-Y. Hill P.N. Hsu D.K. Liu F.-T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4086-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 3 × 105/well in six-well dishes for 1 day and then transfected with 2.5 μg of pEF1-galectin-7, pEF1-galectin-9, or pEF1-neo using Superfect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The medium was changed every 3–4 days. When numerous G418-resistant colonies appeared (usually after 2 weeks), the cells in the colonies were mixed. The mixed population of G418-resistant cells was stored in liquid nitrogen until used for studies. After the aliquots were thawed, the cells were cultured in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml G418 and used in experiments within 2 months to avoid possible phenotypic changes after long term culture. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was removed and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Samples containing 30–60 μg of proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. For the analysis of galectin-9 expression, the lysates were mixed with lactosyl-Sepharose 4B and the absorbed proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting of both galectins, the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with TBS-T (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for more than 30 min at room temperature and probed overnight at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of the primary antibodies in TBS-T, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. After extensive washes with TBS-T, proteins were visualized by the ECL protein detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Apoptosis was induced by incubating cells with DMEM containing 10% FBS in the presence of actinomycin D, TNF-α plus cycloheximide, etoposide, or camptothecin at the indicated concentrations. For the induction of apoptosis with ultraviolet (UV) light, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were exposed to UVB using a UV cross-linker apparatus (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) at 190 J/m2. After UV irradiation, fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the cells, and the cells were cultured for the indicated periods. After induction of apoptosis, both detached and attached cells were harvested and combined. Mild trypsinization was used to collect the attached cells. Cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed once with PBS, stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and propidium iodide (PI), and subjected to two-color analysis using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cytochrome crelease was analyzed by immunoblotting using cell lysates solubilized with a low concentration of digitonin (26Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat.

Cells were harvested as above, washed once with PBS, and solubilized with 100 μl of digitonin lysis buffer (80 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 200 μg/ml digitonin in PBS) for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and removal of the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. Both supernatants were stored at −70 °C until used in immunoblot analysis. Cells were harvested and washed once with PBS and lysed with kinase lysis buffer (200 mmTris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmNaF) at 5 × 106/ml for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. One μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1 or anti-p38 was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice in kinase lysis buffer and twice in assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with 25 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 1 μg of substrate, 30 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 20 min. GST- c-Jun (residues 1–79) or GST-ATF-2 was used as the substrate for JNK1 and p38, respectively. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The phosphorylated proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were grown onto coverslips in the wells of six-well plates (2 × 105/well). After 2 days, the coverslips were removed and rinsed with PBS and fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% formalin in PBS, followed by two washes with PBS. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS. Cells were incubated with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for at least 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes in T-TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Cells were then reacted with polyclonal goat anti-galectin-7 antiserum diluted 1:500 in 0.2% gelatin/T-TBS at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three washes (15 min each) in T-TBS. Then, cells were incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG in 0.2% gelatin/T-TBS, followed by incubation with PI (10 μg/ml) for 15 min and three additional washes in T-TBS. Cells were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). cRNA preparation and hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays were according to Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, total RNA was prepared from vector- or galectin-7-transfected HeLa cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Five μg of total RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with a primer containing oligo(dT)24and T7 promotor sequence. Labeled RNA was then generated by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotinylated CTP and UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The resultant cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to U95Av2 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing ∼12,000 human genes according to the manufacturer's protocol. The chips were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by biotinylated anti-streptavidin IgG/streptavidin-phycoerythrin amplification. The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Data analysis was performed by GeneChip 4.0 software (Affymetrix) with scaling of all genes to 250. Data were sorted based on “-fold change” and genes that had at least 3-fold change in duplicate experiments with “increase” or “decrease” call determined by the difference call decision matrix were chosen for further consideration. We generated galectin-7 and -9 transfectants from HeLa cells, which are commonly used as a model for studying apoptosis (e.g. Ref. 26Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that the level of galectin-7 in galectin-7 transfectants was lower than that in HaCaT, which is a spontaneously transformed keratinocyte line constitutively expressing this protein (Fig.1A). Galectin-9 transfectants express galectin-9 but not galectin-7, and control transfectants express neither protein (Fig. 1B). Galectin-7 transfectants showed a slightly slower growth rate than control transfectants or parental HeLa cells, particularly when the cells were cultured in suboptimal conditions (e.g. low concentration of FBS) (data not shown). The cell cycle distribution of the transfectants was studied, but no difference was found between galectin-7 and control transfectants (data not shown). Therefore, we suspected that the lower growth rate might be related to an altered apoptosis susceptibility of galectin-7 transfectants. To test this possibility, we treated these cells with UV irradiation, and the degree of apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry following FITC-annexin V/PI double staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, after UV treatment, galectin-7 transfectants demonstrated enhanced apoptosis, as indicated by the increase in the total percentage of cells stained by annexin V, compared with galectin-9 or control transfectants. The difference is mainly displayed in the annexin V-positive fraction, which corresponds to cells in the early phase of apoptosis (29Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B,upper panel), and not by the PI-positive fraction, which corresponds to cells in the late phase of apoptosis or necrosis (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, such as membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation, were more pronounced in galectin-7 transfectants than control cells. Trypan blue staining 24 h after UV irradiation showed that the total number of nonviable cells was ∼2-fold higher in galectin-7 transfectants compared with control transfectants (data not shown).Figure 2Enhanced UV-induced apoptosis in galectin-7-transfected HeLa cells. Cells plated at 105cells/well in 12-well dishes and cultured overnight were irradiated with UV (190 J/m2). After the indicated time periods, cells were collected and the apoptotic events were assessed by annexin V and PI dual staining.

Data presented are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined the apoptosis susceptibility of HeLa transfectants upon treatment with various agents. When actinomycin D (1 μm) was used as the apoptosis inducer, significantly more cells became annexin V-positive at 6 and 12 h in galectin-7 transfectants compared with control transfectants (Fig.3A). The difference in apoptosis susceptibility between galectin-7 and control transfectants was also observed when these cells were exposed to etoposide (Fig.3B), camptothecin (Fig. 3C), and a combination of TNF-α and cycloheximide (Fig. 3D). Polyak et al. reported that overexpression of p53 in DLD-1, a colon carcinoma cell line, results in induction of many genes and galectin-7 (p53-induced gene 1, PIG1) is among the most highly induced (22Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). To test the effect of galectin-7 expression in this cell line, we obtained stable transfectants expressing galectin-7. Immunoblotting showed relatively high expression of galectin-7 in the transfectants compared with HaCaT cells (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 4, actinomycind-induced apoptosis was potentiated in galectin-7 transfectants (Fig. 4A). We noted that, even in cells not treated with actinomycin D, there was a significantly higher percentage of cells that were annexin V-positive among galectin-7 transfectants compared with control transfectants. This portion was dominated by cells stained positively by both annexin V and PI (Fig.4B), and thus in late apoptosis or necrosis. We also obtained similar results in apoptosis induced by camptothecin and etoposide (data not shown). To identify a common apoptosis signaling point at which galectin-7 might act, additional analyses were conducted using actinomycin D as the apoptosis inducer. First, we examined the cleavage of procaspase-3 and its substrate PARP. Caspase-3 is a cell death executioner that is crucially activated in apoptosis by various stimuli, leading to the cleavage of many substrates, including PARP (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, when the cells were exposed to actinomycin D for 6 and 12 h, the cleavage of procaspase-3 was enhanced in galectin-7 transfectants over control transfectants, as demonstrated by the decrease in the intensity of the procaspase-3 signal. The enhanced procaspase-3 cleavage was accompanied by increased PARP cleavage. The results indicate that galectin-7 expression results in accelerated kinetics of apoptosis. In contrast, the protein level of procaspase-8 was unaltered in either galectin-7 or vector-transfected cells, upon exposure to actinomycin D for 12 h. This is consistent with the fact that caspase-8 is not a primary mediator of apoptosis induced by this drug (26Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). However, at 24 h, procaspase-8 was no longer detectable in both galectin-7 and control transfectants, suggesting that cleavage had occurred by this time, probably by the mechanism of post-mitochondrial activation of caspases (32Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The results suggest that galectin-7 does not function through caspase-8 activation. Next, we tested whether the potentiated apoptotic susceptibility induced by galectin-7 is caspase-dependent. Cells were exposed to actinomycin D in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, and annexin V-stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.6, the addition of zVAD-fmk inhibited apoptosis in both control and galectin-7 transfectants, suggesting that actinomycin d-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent, which is consistent with a previous report (26Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). More importantly, because apoptosis in galectin-7-transfected cells was completely abrogated in the presence of zVAD-fmk, the results suggest that caspase-independent pathways are not activated in galectin-7 transfectants in response to actinomycin D. We then analyzed galectin-7's effect upstream of caspase-3 activation. Because cytochrome c release is known to play a central role in the apoptosis-signaling pathways leading to caspase-3 activation, we tested whether cytochrome c release is affected in cells expressing galectin-7. As shown in Fig.7, as early as 6 h after exposure to actinomycin D, cytochrome c was released to the cytosol. Significantly more cytochrome c was released in galectin-7 transfectants compared with control cells at the 6-, 9-, and 12-h time points. Because the same result was obtained in apoptosis induced by the combination of TNF-α and cycloheximide (data not shown), which is a mechanistically different stimulus, this up-regulated cytochromec release is possibly a common mechanism for the apoptosis susceptibility induced by galectin-7. Galectin-7 thus appears to function upstream of cytochrome c release. The pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk had no inhibitory effect on cytochrome crelease observed in control transfectants nor on the enhanced release in galectin-7 transfectants (Fig. 7). The results suggest that caspases are not involved in the apoptosis signaling pathway upstream of cytochrome c release through which galectin-7 functions.

Activation of this receptor in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages or monocytes also stimulates processing and release of the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) through activation of caspase-1. The cytokine interleukin 18 (IL-18) is also cleaved by caspase-1 and shares pro-inflammatory characteristics with IL-1β. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that IL-1β, IL-18, and/or caspase-1 activation contribute directly to macrophage cell death induced by LPS and ATP. Macrophages were cultured from normal mice or those in which genes for the P2X7 receptor,IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-18, orcaspase-1 had been deleted. Our data confirm the importance of the P2X7 receptor in ATP-stimulated cell death and IL-1β release from LPS-primed macrophages. We demonstrate that prolonged stimulation with ATP leads to cell death, which is partly dependent on LPS priming and caspase-1, but independent of cytokine processing and release. We also provide evidence that LPS priming of macrophages makes them highly susceptible to the toxic effects of brief exposure to ATP, which leads to rapid cell death by a mechanism that is dependent on caspase-1 but, again, independent of cytokine processing and release.

IL-1β, the predominant form of IL-1 in many cell types, is expressed as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-1β), which must be cleaved by the enzyme caspase-1 (interleukin-1-converting enzyme) to produce active mature IL-1β (2Thornberry N.A.

In vitro, post-translational processing of pro-IL-1β depends on LPS-activated monocytes or macrophages encountering a secondary stimulus (e.g. ATP), which stimulates caspase-1 activation, cleavage of pro-IL-1β, and subsequent release of the mature cytokine (7Hogquist K.A.

Indeed, exposure of macrophages to ATP alone causes only modest release of IL-1β but, together with LPS, induces marked release of IL-1β and cell death (9Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S.

However, the relationship between P2X7 receptor stimulation, pro-IL-1β cleavage by caspase-1, cellular release, and cell death has not been confirmed. Reduced cell death has been reported in monocytes and microglia from animals lacking caspase-1 or exposed to pan-caspase inhibitors (18Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). IL-1β appears to have a functional role in caspase-mediated cell death in HeLa cells (21Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Rotello R. Yuan J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 184: 717-724Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but its contribution to macrophage cell death has not been well characterized. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 (also processed by caspase-1) and IL-1α are also regulated by ATP stimulation of cells (22Mehta V.B. Hart J. Wewers M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (11Perregaux D.G. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar) and may therefore contribute to cell death. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that activation of caspase-1 and release of active IL-1β and/or IL-18 contribute directly to the rapid cytolytic macrophage cell death induced by either prolonged (30 min) or brief (5 min) exposure to ATP. To test this, macrophages were isolated from mice lacking genes (knockout (KO)) for the P2X7 receptor, IL-1β,IL-1α, IL-18, or caspase-1. We present evidence that prolonged ATP stimulation leads to cell death via LPS-dependent and LPS-independent mechanisms, the former requiring the presence of caspase-1. Perhaps more importantly, we present evidence that LPS priming can render macrophages highly sensitive to a short pulse of ATP, which leads to almost complete cell death through a mechanism dependent on the presence of caspase-1 but is independent of mature cytokine production.

Animals were maintained at 22 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Adult WT and KO male and female mice were sacrificed, and the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 8 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2 mm glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, UK). The medium recovered from four to five mice was pooled. The cells were collected by centrifugation (80 ×g, 10 min) and plated onto 12- or 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Macrophages were allowed to adhere for 2 h (37 °C, 5% CO2), washed with fresh medium to remove unattached cells, and incubated overnight. Cells were primed for 2 h with 1 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 026:B6, Sigma, UK) or vehicle (sterile PBS), and then treated with ATP (Sigma, UK, 1 or 5 mm), vehicle (PBS), nigericin (Sigma, UK, 20 μm), or lysis buffer (100 μl/ml Triton X-100 (9% v/v, final concentration) to measure total cell lysis) for a further 30 min. At the time of LPS incubation, some cells were also treated with PBS or the P2X7 receptor antagonist oATP (26Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Sigma, UK, 100 μm). In other experiments some cells received PBS, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, Dr. S. Poole, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), 100 ng/ml), recombinant rat IL-1β (100 ng/ml, Dr. S. Poole), or cycloheximide (50 μm, Sigma, UK) 5 min before ATP treatment, whereas zVAD-fmk (Bachem, UK, 50 μm) was administered 30 min before ATP (1.5 h after the start of LPS incubation). At the end of the experiments, the medium was collected for LDH and cytokine analysis, or immunoblot analysis. In selected experiments cell/medium lysates were prepared by the addition of Triton X-100 to the wells for total cytokine measurements and immunoblot analysis. Macrophages were incubated as above, primed with LPS or PBS for 2 h, and then briefly stimulated with either PBS or ATP (5 mm) for 5 min then washed with fresh medium. Samples of medium were taken at 0.5, 2, and 4 h after addition of ATP for analysis of LDH and IL-1β release, and the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue was examined. The protein concentration of the medium or medium/cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Germany). Samples (20 μg of protein per lane) were loaded on an 8% SDS acrylamide gel, and the proteins were resolved by gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., UK). The membrane was briefly exposed to Ponceau S (Sigma, UK) to visualize the protein bands. To reduce nonspecific antibody binding, the membrane was washed in 5% milk (Marvel, UK; 5% in PBS Tween 20, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with a polyclonal antibody raised to a peptide sequence from the C terminus of the rat P2X7 receptor (1:200 dilution in 5% milk, Alomone, Israel) at 1.5 μg/ml, and an anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma, UK; 1:10,000 dilution in 5% milk) for 1 h. The membrane was finally stained with a polyclonal antibody raised against rabbit IgG, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), which was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Proteins were resolved on a 12% acrylamide gel by the above protocol. The membrane was probed with a polyclonal antibody raised to mouse IL-1β (1:1000 dilution of stock in 5% milk, S329, NIBSC, UK) followed by staining with a polyclonal antibody raised against sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:4000 dilution of stock in 5% milk, NIBSC, UK), which was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cell death was assessed by the CytoTox-96 assay (Promega), which measures release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from dying cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total LDH release was achieved by adding Triton X-100 (100 μl/well of a 9% solution, Sigma, UK) to untreated control cells. Treatment values were then expressed as a percent of the total LDH release. Trypan blue exclusion was used to quantify the number of viable cells. At the end of the brief ATP stimulation experiments, 150 μl of medium was removed for measurements of LDH and IL-1β release. Trypan blue (10 μl/100 μl medium, Sigma, UK) was added to the remaining medium, and the macrophages were observed under a light microscope. The number of trypan blue-positive cells per 50 cells was counted in triplicate and expressed as a percentage. The concentrations of IL-1α and IL-1β (both pro and mature) released into the medium, or in lysates containing medium and cells (medium/cell lysates for total IL-1), were quantified by specific mouse IL-1α and β sandwich ELISAs. ELISA reagents were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Poole (NIBSC, UK). Assay detection limits were ≤20 pg/ml, and internal quality controls (recombinant cytokines at concentrations of 200 and 1000 pg/ml) were included in each assay. To test the ability of the ELISA to distinguish between the pro and mature forms of IL-1β, samples of pro-IL-1β (as determined by Western blotting) were cleaved by incubation with activated caspase-1 (Nancy Thornberry, Merck Research Laboratory, 100 units/100 μl sample + 10 mmdithiothreitol) and the un-cleaved and cleaved samples (confirmed by immunoblot analysis) were compared with the ELISA. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of measurements in three or more independent cultures (each culture assessed in triplicate). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Neuman-Keuls post hoc test. In some cases (e.g. zVAD) the data presented are the result of one experiment performed in triplicate, which was replicated on a further two occasions due to the variability of cytokine levels between independent cultures. In control WT macrophages, spontaneous LDH release was ∼12% of maximal death (Fig.1A). Cell lysis was not affected by 2 h incubation with LPS (1 μg/ml), although cells exhibited an activated state with morphological changes, including elongation of processes. Stimulation of control macrophages with 1 mm ATP (30 min) increased LDH release (90%, but not significantly), whereas exposure to 5 mm ATP elicited a significant (p < 0.05) 3-fold increase in cell death. ATP-induced LDH release was significantly greater in macrophages primed with LPS (2 h before the ATP) with 3.2- and 4-fold increases observed in cells exposed to 1 or 5 mm ATP, respectively (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01versus LPS alone). Incubation of the macrophages with the potassium ionophore nigericin (20 μm, for 30 min) in LPS-primed cells resulted in 80% LDH release. WT macrophages exposed to vehicle (PBS) or LPS released only small amounts of IL-1β into the culture medium (<150 pg/ml). Treatment with ATP alone resulted in a small (NS) increase in IL-1β release. However, combined exposure to ATP and LPS (ATP/LPS) resulted in dramatic cytokine release (3500 ± 826 and 5300 ± 1790 pg/ml after 1 and 5 mm ATP, respectively Fig. 1B). The cytolytic actions of nigericin (Fig. 1A) were also accompanied by dramatic release of IL-1β (8250 ± 1746 pg/ml, Fig. 1B) from LPS-primed macrophages. ATP-stimulated LDH and IL-1β release in LPS-primed macrophages were completely prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the P2X7 receptor antagonist oATP (100 μm at the time of LPS treatment, Fig. 1, A andB). Spontaneous LDH release from P2X7 KO vehicle-treated macrophages was slightly higher (21 ± 4% total LDH release, NS) than from WT cells (12 ± 2% total). Incubation ofP2X7 KO cells with ATP (1 or 5 mm) in the presence or absence of LPS priming failed to affect LDH or IL-1β release (Fig. 2). However, treatment of LPS-primed P2X7 KO macrophages with nigericin (20 μm) dramatically induced the release of both LDH (81 ± 8% total) and IL-1β (7100 ± 200 pg/ml) to a similar extent to that observed in WT macrophages (82 ± 4% total and 8250 ± 1750 pg/ml, respectively). To investigate cleavage of IL-1β, Western blots were performed on aliquots of culture medium. When stimulated with ATP (5 mm), WT macrophages released pro-IL-1β and a very small quantity of mature IL-1β into the culture medium accompanying cell lysis (Fig. 3A). However, in the presence of LPS and ATP IL-1β was again released, but was found predominantly in the mature form following 1 mm ATP, and in greater quantities following 5 mm ATP. To distinguish between the cytolytic effects of ATP and IL-1 release, IL-1β and IL-1α were measured in medium/cell lysates, giving a measure of total IL-1 within the cells and medium. Priming of WT andP2X7 KO macrophages with LPS resulted in a significant increase in IL-1β (5500 ± 460 and 4270 ± 210 pg/ml, respectively, Fig. 4A), which was exclusively pro-IL-1β (Fig. 3B). In WT macrophages the addition of ATP (5 mm) increased total IL-1β by 68% (9280 ± 430 pg/ml, Fig. 4A), with ∼50% cleaved to the mature form (Fig. 3B). In P2X7 KO macrophages, ATP had no effect on either the production (Fig.4A, 4270 ± 90 versus 4900 ± 90) or the cleavage of IL-1β (Fig. 3B). Cleavage of pro-IL-1β samples (LPS-primed WT macrophage samples) with activated caspase-1 did not alter the ELISA reading of the samples (3390 ± 250 versus 3350 ± 370 pg/ml pre- and post-caspase-1 incubation, respectively). To examine the role of protein synthesis in the increase in total IL-1β following ATP stimulation of LPS-treated WT cells, separate cultures were incubated with cycloheximide (50 μm). Although cycloheximide did not affect LDH release (data not shown), it reduced total IL-1β production in LPS-stimulated control cells (33%, 4830 ± 490 versus 3240 ± 20), but did not significantly alter total IL-1β in LPS-primed cells treated with ATP (5 mm, 5332 ± 80 versus 4550 ± 350). In response to LPS and ATP (5 mm), macrophages from WT mice also released IL-1α (4000 ± 300 pg/ml) in a similar pattern to IL-1β (data not shown). This release of IL-1α was completely absent from macrophages from P2X7 KO mice. In WT andP2X7 KO macrophages, LPS increased the level of total IL-1α in cells/medium (5480 ± 270 and 4800 ± 450 pg/ml, respectively) compared with vehicle (<150 pg/ml). However, stimulation with ATP (5 mm) did not significantly affect total IL-1α in either WT (5306 ± 680 pg/ml) or P2X7 KO macrophages (5400 ± 460 pg/ml, Fig. 3B). Expression of the P2X7 receptor was not altered by incubation with LPS in WT macrophages, but the receptor was completely absent inP2X7 KO animals (data not shown). Treatment of WT (C57/BL6) cultures with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (50 μm) did not affect basal cell death of vehicle or LPS-primed cells (Fig. 5A). However, zVAD-fmk significantly inhibited cell death induced by 5 mm ATP in LPS-primed cells (47% reduction,p < 0.001), bringing it to the level seen in control ATP-treated cells. zVAD-fmk also dramatically reduced total IL-1β production from LPS-primed ATP stimulated cells (measured in cell/medium lysates; 58% reduction, p < 0.001, Fig.5B), and prevented its cleavage to the mature form (Fig.6).Figure 6Cleavage of IL-1β induced by prolonged (30 min) ATP stimulation in LPS-primed macrophages is inhibited by pre-treatment of cells with zVAD-fmk (WT, C57/BL6) and is absent in caspase-1KOmacrophages. Peritoneal macrophages from WT (C57/BL6) andcaspase-1 KO mice were primed with LPS (1 μg/ml) or PBS for 2 h (37 °C). After 1.5 h cells were treated with zVAD-fmk (50 μm) or PBS for 30 min, then stimulated with PBS or ATP (1 and 5 mm) for a further 30 min. Medium/cell lysates were prepared (by addition of Triton X-100) and fractioned by SDS-PAGE, and the polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was then probed for IL-1β using a mouse-specific antibody to reveal pro (34 kDa) and mature (17 kDa) IL-1β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Macrophage cultures from caspase-1 KO mice showed levels of basal cell death in the absence and presence of LPS similar to WT cultures. Stimulation with ATP (5 mm, 30 min) again resulted in significant cell death in vehicle-treated macrophages (2.0-fold increase, p < 0.01, Fig.7A), but this was not significantly altered by LPS incubation (2.8-fold increase). LDH release from LPS-primed ATP (5 mm) treatedcaspase-1 KO macrophages was reduced (25% total) relative to WT macrophages (approximately 50% total). Vehicle-treated macrophages from caspase-1 KO mice, however, exhibited high basal IL-1β as measured in cell/medium lysates (1230 ± 220 pg/ml compared with WT macrophages, 210 ± 40 pg/ml). Incubation of cultures with LPS for 2 h dramatically increased total IL-1β production (5-fold increase, 7850 ± 735, p < 0.001), which was all detected as the pro form (Fig. 6). Addition of ATP (5 mm) reduced IL-1β production (25%,p < 0.001) in caspase-1 KO macrophages (Fig. 7B) and failed to induce cleavage of IL-1β to the mature 17-kDa form (Fig. 6). P2X7 receptor expression was similar in macrophages from WT (C57/BL6) andIL-1β KO mice and was not affected by exposure to LPS (data not shown). Spontaneous LDH release was similar in vehicle and LPS-stimulated macrophages cultured from WT (Fig.8A) and IL-1β KO (Fig. 8B) mice. Addition of 1 mm ATP did not affect LDH release in either control WT or IL-1β KO mice, whereas exposure to 5 mm ATP induced similar increases in LDH release (127%) in cells from WT (NS versus vehicle) andIL-1β KO (126%, p < 0.05) mice. In LPS-primed macrophages, ATP dramatically increased LDH release from both WT and IL-1β KO cells (64 ± 11% and 53 ± 7% after 5 mm ATP, respectively, p < 0.001 versus vehicle). Treatment of LPS-stimulated macrophages, from either strain of mice, with nigericin resulted in similar levels of LDH release (increases of 84 ± 11% and 61 ± 18% in WT and IL-1β KO mice, respectively,p < 0.001), which were comparable to those observed in macrophages from P2X7 WT and KO mice (Figs. 1 and 2). Treatment of macrophages with IL-1ra (100 ng/ml) at the time of vehicle/LPS incubation did not affect basal LDH release or that induced by 5 mm ATP in LPS-treated macrophages (LPS + 5 mm ATP: 38 ± 9% versus IL-1ra + LPS + 5 mm ATP: 37 ± 6%, NS). Treatment of WT macrophages with IL-1β (100 ng/ml) at the same time as ATP did not affect either control or ATP-induced LDH release in LPS-primed macrophages (37 ± 7% versus 29 ± 1% total LDH release, ATP + LPSversus ATP + LPS + IL-1β respectively, NS). To investigate whether the actions of ATP on LDH release inIL-1β KO macrophages were due to compensatory effects of IL-1α, the release of this cytokine was measured. LPS-primed WT macrophages stimulated with ATP (5 mm) released a large quantity of IL-1α (2902 ± 653 pg/ml). However,IL-1β KO macrophages showed very low levels of IL-1α release in response to LPS/ATP (5 mm, 395 ± 190 pg/ml), despite similar levels of cell death. Indeed, further evidence that IL-1 is not required for ATP-induced cell death was provided by the cytotoxic actions of ATP in LPS-primed macrophages isolated fromIL-1αβ (animals with both IL-1α and IL-1β genes deleted) KO mice (LPS: 13 ± 3%, LPS plus 5 mm ATP: 47 ± 6% cell death, p < 0.001). Macrophages from IL-18 KO mice showed a similar profile of LDH and IL-1β release in response to ATP/LPS (Fig.9A) to WT cells. ATP (1 mm) induced a 2-fold increase in LDH release from LPS-primed IL-18 KO macrophages, compared with vehicle alone, but this response failed to reach statistical significance. However, 5 mm ATP stimulated LDH release to 50% of total (p < 0.001), and 4.0- and 8.8-fold increases seen in vehicle and LPS-primed cells, respectively. The cytotoxic actions of ATP in LPS-primed, IL-18 KO macrophages were accompanied by IL-1β release (LPS/ATP 5 mm: 7380 ± 320 pg/ml). Although the active forms of IL-1β and IL-18 are both dependent on cleavage by caspase-1, IL-1β cleavage stimulated by LPS/ATP was similar in WT and IL-18 KO macrophages (data not shown). A brief pulse of ATP (5 mmfor 5 min) had no effect on basal LDH release from control WT macrophages, and the cells completely excluded trypan blue (data not shown). Similarly, treatment of LPS-primed cells with PBS or zVAD-fmk was without effect. However, in LPS-primed cells, a brief pulse of ATP resulted in a dramatic release of LDH within 30 min (Fig.10A, 42 ± 4% total) and almost complete release after 2 h (96 ± 26% total). This was accompanied by a loss of membrane integrity as indicated by the uptake of trypan blue (42 ± 3 and 54 ± 2% at 0.5 and 2 h respectively, Fig. 10B) and release of IL-1β into the medium (LPS + ATP, 2570 ± 310 pg/ml). Pre-treatment of LPS-primed cells with zVAD-fmk (30 min prior to ATP) almost completely prevented ATP-induced LDH release (7 ± 4%,p < 0.001 and 27 ± 9% total, p< 0.05 at 0.5 and 2 h, respectively, versus ATP treated, Fig. 10A), uptake of trypan blue (3 ± 1 and 9 ± 3% cells positive for trypan blue after 0.5 and 2 h,p < 0.001 versus ATP-treated, Fig.10B), and IL-1β release (58 ± 23 pg/ml). In a separate set of experiments, WT, LPS-primed macrophages showed complete release of LDH 30 min after brief (5 min) exposure to 5 mm ATP (103 ± 20% total, Fig.11A), and 41 ± 2% cells were positive for trypan blue (Fig. 11B). In contrast, macrophages harvested from caspase-1 KO mice, primed with LPS, were totally insensitive to the effects of a short pulse of ATP; there was no change in LDH release (16 ± 4%, and 15 ± 5% total, NS versus non LPS-primed cells, Fig. 11A), cell viability (trypan blue exclusion, Fig. 11B) or release of IL-1β (30 ± 16 pg/ml) up to 4 h later. However, LPS-primed caspase-1 KO macrophages exposed to ATP did exhibit alterations in morphology, including a loss of cell processes as observed in WT cells (data not shown).

SHP expression is regulated by several other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including the orphan receptors SF-1 and LRH-1, and the bile acid receptor FXR. We have found that the SHP promoter is also activated by the estrogen receptor-related receptor γ (ERRγ) but not the related ERRα and ERRβ isoforms. SHP and ERRγ mRNAs are coexpressed in several tissues, including pancreas, kidney, and heart, confirming the potential relevance of this transactivation. ERRγ transactivation is dependent on only one of five previously characterized DNA-binding sites for SF-1, and this element differs from previously reported ERR response elements. However, treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A significantly increased ERRα and ERRβ activity on this element indicating that the lack of activity of ERRα and -β may depend on their association with co-repressor in vivo. Furthermore, using protease sensitivity assays on DNA bound receptors it was demonstrated that DNA sequence of different response elements may cause allosteric modulation of ERR proteins, which in turn may be responsible for the differential activities of these receptors on different response elements. SHP inhibits ERRγ transactivation and physically interacts with all three members of ERR subfamily, as demonstrated by both yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays. As with other SHP targets, this interaction is dependent on the AF-2 coactivator-binding site of ERRγ and the previously described N-terminal receptor interaction domain of SHP.

Both conventional and orphan nuclear receptors share a very similar structure. At the N terminus is a domain that is not conserved in sequence in different receptor families, but in many cases contains a ligand independent transcriptional activation domain termed activation function 1. The central DNA-binding domain (DBD)1 is strongly conserved and includes two zinc-binding units based on invariant cysteine residues. A conserved helical region within the DBD termed the P box (3Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) makes base specific contacts with hormone response elements. The sequence of this motif serves as one of the main criteria for dividing the nuclear receptor superfamily into subgroups. The C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) functions not only in ligand binding, but also dimerization and ligand mediated transcriptional activation. This transactivation is based on an additional activation function referred to as AF-2. In most receptors, allosteric effects of ligand binding result in the formation of an appropriate binding site for a series of transcriptional coactivators. In a number of orphans, however, coactivator binding is not dependent on the presence of a ligand. Members of this subset of orphans, which includes HNF-4, and ERRγ, function as constitutive transactivators (4Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J.

Various studies have reported SHP to be a repressor of transcriptional activities of a number of nuclear receptors, including both ligand responsive receptors like, ER, TR, RAR, and RXR, and orphan receptors like CAR, HNF-4, and FTF (6Johansson L.

Hanstein B. Brown M. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 10: 1551-1557Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The very broad range of receptors sensitive to inhibition by SHP suggests a central role for SHP in modulation of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Although the mechanisms underlying this repressive function remain unclear, recent results (7Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) demonstrate that SHP can compete with coactivators for binding to the AF-2 surface. In addition, a direct transcriptional repressor domain contributes significantly to the inhibitory function of SHP.The SHP gene is structurally conserved in all the species from which it has been characterized. It consists of 2 exons interrupted by an intron and is located on human chromosome 1 at position 1p36.1 (12Lee H.K. Lee Y.K. Park S.H. Kim Y.S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14398-14440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Initial studies indicated that SHP is expressed predominantly in the liver, spleen, small intestine, and pancreas (8Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar,12Lee H.K. Lee Y.K. Park S.H. Kim Y.S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.S. J. Biol.

However, later studies with more sensitive approaches have demonstrated the presence of SHP mRNA in a wide variety of tissues, with highest expression in heart, brain, liver, lung, and adrenal gland (11Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although very little is known about SHP gene regulation, some recent reports have suggested important roles for the bile acid receptor FXR, and AP-1 transcription factors in regulatingSHP gene expression and subsequent regulation of cholesterol homeostasis (13Goodwin B.

A recent report also demonstrated the activation of the SHP promoter by SF-1 and its close relative LRH-1, both of which bind five distinct sites present in the region spanning from 453 to 68 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start (16Lee Y.K. Parker K.L. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20869-20873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SHP is coexpressed with SF-1 or LRH-1 only in gonads, adrenal gland, and liver, however, indicating that other transcription factors are involved in SHP gene expression in other tissues, such as pancreas, heart, and brain.The ERR subfamily includes the first orphan receptors described (17Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). These proteins form a distinct subgroup within the superfamily with striking sequence similarity in the DBD with estrogen receptors (ER). The similarity in the LBD is more limited, and the ERRs do not bind natural estrogen. However, a recent report has demonstrated the binding of the synthetic estrogen analogue diethylstilbestrol to the ERR subfamily members (18Tremblay G.B. Kunath T. Bergeron D. Lapointe L. Champigny C. Bader Jo-Ann Rossant J. Giguère V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this case, diethylstilbestrol acts as an inverse agonist by disrupting ERR-coactivator interaction (18Tremblay G.B. Kunath T. Bergeron D. Lapointe L. Champigny C. Bader Jo-Ann Rossant J. Giguère V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Three different ERR genes have been characterized (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol.

The ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ isoforms show considerable homology among themselves, with the highest similarity between ERRβ and ERRγ. The hypervariable N-terminal A/B domain of ERRβ shares 58.2% amino acid identity with ERRγ, and in the DBD and the LBD they share 98.9 and 73.1% identity, respectively (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All three isoforms have been reported to bind and transactivate both estrogen response elements (ERE) and SF-1 response elements (SF-1RE) (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol.

ERRα has been implicated in various roles in bone and muscle development, modulation of aromatase expression in breast tissues, regulation of thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) expression, overall development of mouse embryos, and fatty acid metabolism (21Bonnelye E.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the murine ERRβ gene caused severe placental abnormalities and embryonic mortality at 10.5 days post-coitum, and ERRβ has also been implicated in repression of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcriptional activities (31Luo J. Sladek R. Bader J-A. Rossant J. Giguere V. Nature. 1997; 388: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 32Trapp T. Holsboer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9879-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The biological roles of ERRγ, the newest member of the subfamily, remain to be elucidated. The expression profiles of the three ERR isoforms show an overlapping pattern. ERRα mRNA is primarily expressed in tissues associated with fatty acid metabolism such as kidney, heart, and brown adipocytes. ERRγ is expressed at a high level in heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, and at a lower level in liver (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20Heard D.J. Norby P.L. Hollowa Y.J. Vissing H. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 12: 2151-2162Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), while the expression of its closer relative ERRβ is barely detectable in few tissues in adult rat including kidney, testis, heart, brain, and prostate. In the mouse ERRβ expression has been demonstrated in a subset of extraembryonic tissues in a small window between 5.5 days post-coitum and 8.5 days post-coitum (17Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar).Since the SHP gene promoter contains several SF-1 response elements that are predicted to be ERR response elements, we investigated whether ERR subfamily members can regulate theSHP gene promoter. Unexpectedly, transient transfection studies demonstrated a preferential effect of ERRγ on this promoter. Mapping studies revealed that only one of the five previously reported SF-1REs on SHP gene promoter is responsible for the ERRγ mediated activation of the SHP promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and mutational studies confirmed the binding of ERRγ, to this element. As expected, SHP coexpression inhibits ERRγ transactivation of its own promoter, and SHP competes with the coactivator GRIP-1/SRC-2 for binding to ERRγ. We conclude that ERRγ is a component of a new potential autoregulatory loop controllingSHP gene expression.DISCUSSIONSeveral recent results have identified three nuclear receptors, SF-1, LRH-1, and FXR, as potential regulators of SHP expression. This is consistent with the relatively high levels of expression of SHP in tissues that express these three receptors including liver, adrenal, and pancreas. However, SHP is expressed in additional tissues, including heart, small intestine, stomach, epididymus, and prostate, several of which also express the orphan receptor ERRγ. Thus, it has been previously reported that murine ERRγ is expressed relatively highly in heart, brain, and kidney, with a lower expression in liver (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Human ERRγ transcripts were found in heart, brain, placenta, kidney, pancreas, with a lower level of expression detected in spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, and small intestine (20Heard D.J. Norby P.L. Hollowa Y.J. Vissing H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In our study of human endocrine tissues, we found that both ERRγ and SHP are strongly expressed in pancreas, with a lower level of expression for both observed in adrenal medulla and cortex, stomach, and intestine. In mouse tissues, ERRγ expression was highest in the submaxillary gland, which also showed relatively high levels of SHP. Coexpression of ERRγ and SHP was also observed in heart, kidney, epididymus, prostate, and pancreas. Based on both this coexpression and its ability to transactivate the SHP promoter, we conclude that ERRγ is an additional potential regulator of SHP expression. As a consequence of the broad inhibitory functions of SHP, such regulation by ERRγ could have significant implications for nuclear receptor signaling pathways in a number of tissues.In addition to identifying a novel target gene for ERRγ, to our knowledge the first for this as yet poorly characterized receptor, these results also define unexpected DNA binding and functional properties for ERRγ. SF-1 requires at least three high affinity binding sites to efficiently transactivate the SHP promoter (16Lee Y.K. Parker K.L. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20869-20873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although such SF-1 sites have been proposed to be targets for ERR family members, only the sft4 element showed such binding. Unexpectedly, although all three ERR family members bound this element with comparable affinity, only ERRγ significantly transactivated theSHP promoter in several different cell lines examined. Somewhat similar differential effects have been described in other contexts. Thus, a previous report demonstrated that ERRγ could efficiently bind a consensus SF-1RE/ERRE, TCAAGGTCA, but could only transactivate it weakly (20Heard D.J. Norby P.L. Hollowa Y.J. Vissing H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we found that ERRγ exhibited insignificant activity on the TRαpromoter, which contains a perfect ERRE (23Vanacker J.M. Bonnelye E. Delmarre C. Laudet V. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2429-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas, on a five-copy SF-1RE reporter ERRγ demonstrated modest activity relative to that on a three-copy sft4 Luc (Fig. 4B). An additional study demonstrated ERRγ could not activate a palindromic thyroid hormone response element (TRE-Pal) (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas both ERRα and ERRβ are known to bind this element and efficiently activate a reporter containing it (26Xie W. Hong H. Yang N.N. Lin R.J. Simon C.M. Stallcup M.R. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 12: 2151-2162Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In our hands, ERRγ shows a modest activity on TRE inducing it by 1.5–2-fold in HeLa cells and DNA binding studies indicate that ERRγ binds TRE-Pal with a similar affinity as it binds sft4 (data not shown). The basis for the differential activities of the three ERR isoforms observed on SHP promoter is yet to be completely elucidated, but our results demonstrate differential effects of different DNA sequences on ERRγ tertiary structure. Protease sensitivity experiments performed on consensus SF-1RE, sft4, and TRE-Pal bound ERRγ or ERRα (Fig. 4, B and C, and data not shown) confirm this conclusion and suggest that DNA sequences may also act as allosteric modulator of ERRα structure. These effects are similar to those previously described for the GR and other nuclear receptors (36Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23096-23104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Although on sft4 TSA induced the activities of ERRα and -β but not ERRγ, we found that the activities of all three isoforms could be augmented by TSA treatment on ERE and TRE-Pal (Fig. 4A, and data not shown). The allosteric effects of DNA-binding sites on ERR structure suggest a specific mechanism for such differential transactivation. In this hypothesis, the structure of ERRα and -β bound to sft4 would be relatively permissive for corepressor binding, while the ERRγ-sft4 would be nonpermissive. It is also possible, of course, that allosteric effects of the DNA-binding site could alter interactions with coactivators, or with other DNA bound transcription factors. Detailed further studies will be required to test the potential importance of the differential effects of DNA sequence on ERR functions suggested by the initial results described here.The current study also demonstrates that SHP inhibits ERRγ transactivation. As with other receptors (5Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 6Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) this inhibition is a consequence of a direct physical interaction of SHP with the AF-2 surface of ERRγ. Thus, in tissues where ERRγ is active, SHP should autoregulate its own gene expression. This mechanism should limit the response of not only SHP, but other ERRγ target genes to signals that increase ERRγ transactivation. The identification of such signals and such gene targets will be necessary to test this hypothesis.While this report was under review two reports demonstrated an antiestorgenic therapeutic drug, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, as a ligand for ERRβ and ERRγ (40Coward P. Lee D. Hull M.V. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8880-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 41Tremblay G.B. Bergeron D. Giguere V. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4572-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These reports, together with our report indicate that the SHP gene promoter may be a bona fide target of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Further studies are needed to characterize such a possibility. The nuclear receptor superfamily is a diverse group of transcription factors that includes both conventional receptors with known ligands and orphan nuclear receptors that lack them (for reviews, see Refs. 1Evans R.M.

In this study, we examined the IGF signaling pathway in two breast cancer cell lines selected for metastatic behavior. LCC6 was selected for growth as an ascites tumor in athymic mice from parental MDA-MB-435 cells (435P). The MDA-231BO cell line was derived from osseous metastases that formed after intracardiac injection of the MDA-MB-231 cell line in athymic mice. Compared to the parental cell lines, IGF-I treatment enhanced IRS-2 phosphorylation over IRS-1 in the metastatic variants. IGF-I stimulated cell migration in the variant cells, but not in the parental cells. To determine the role for IRS-2 in IGF-mediated motility, we transfected MDA-231BO cells with an anti-sense IRS-2 construct. Transfected cells had decreased levels of IRS-2 with diminished IGF-mediated motility and anchorage independent growth when compared to control cells. However, adherence to fibronectin was enhanced in the transfected cells compared to MDA-231BO cells. Our data show that breast cancer cells selected for metastatic behavior in vivo have increased IRS-2 activation and signaling. In these cells, IGF-I enhances cell adhesion and motility suggesting that IRS-2 may mediate these aspects of the malignant phenotype."

The crystal structure of modified human GR at 1.9-Å resolution provides the first picture of protein inactivation by peroxynitrite and reveals that this is due to the exclusive nitration of 2 Tyr residues (residues 106 and 114) at the glutathione disulfide-binding site. The selective nitration explains the impairment of binding the peptide substrate and thus the nearly 1000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of glutathione reductase observed at physiologic pH.

A 6-mg sample of the latter was purified, and its structure was validated by NMR studies as the hydrate of the 4” ketone. ArnA resembles UDP-galactose epimerase, dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, and UDP-xylose synthase in oxidizing the C-4“ position of its substrate, but differs in that it releases the NADH product. phosphoethanolamine 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose uridine 5′-(β-l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4“-ulose diphosphate) UDP-glucuronic acid 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid dithiothreitol spectral width relaxation delay Lipopolysaccharide is an immunogenic glycolipid that is the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R.H.

The genes in the pmrF operon, pmrHFIJKLM, are co-transcribed under PmrA control, and except for pmrM, are required for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance (23Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). ThepmrE gene and the pmrF operon are also present inE. coli (20Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and appear to be activated in polymyxin-resistant mutants or in wild-type cells exposed to ammonium metavanadate (14Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Based upon sequence similarity of the deduced proteins of the pmrE and pmrF loci to enzymes of known function, a putative biosynthetic pathway that starts with UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) was recently proposed by two independent laboratories as the source of the l-Ara4N substituent of lipid A (Fig. 2) (14Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 26Baker S.J. Gunn J.S. Morona R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the initial steps of the pathway have not yet been validated, we recently showed that arnT (previously pmrK) encodes an inner membrane enzyme that utilizes the novel glycolipid, undecaprenyl phosphate-l-Ara4N, to modify lipid A (27Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The existence of an undecaprenyl phosphate intermediate implies thatl-Ara4N transfer to lipid A occurs on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane (Fig. 2). We now show that extracts of a polymyxin-resistant E. colimutant (but not wild type) can convert UDP-GlcA to the novel sugar nucleotide, uridine 5′-β-l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4“-ulose diphosphate (UDP-l-Ara4O) (Fig. 2). The latter is subsequently transaminated to make UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (UDP-l-Ara4N) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, UDP-l-Ara4N is formylated in vitro in the presence of N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate, but the biological significance of this reaction is unclear (Fig. 2). The UDP-GlcA C-4”-dehydrogenase activity of ArnA was demonstrated with overexpressed protein, made by cloning arnA behind the T7 promoter. ArnA (previously designated PmrI or Orf3) (20Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 23Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) by itself catalyzed both the C-4“ oxidation and C-6” decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA to generate UDP-l-Ara4O (Fig. 2). The latter was obtained in 6 mg quantities almost entirely in the form of its 4“-hydrate in aqueous solution, as judged by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The data support our proposed scheme forl-Ara4N biosynthesis and transfer to lipid A (Fig. 2), but are at variance with Baker et al. (26Baker S.J. Gunn J.S. Morona R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Gunn (29Gunn J.S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 57-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who suggested that an additional enzyme (PmrJ) catalyzes the C-6”-decarboxylation. ArnA is homologous to other enzymes that oxidize the C-4“ position of certain UDP sugars, such as UDP-galactose epimerase (30Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (31Hegeman A.D. Gross J.W. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6598-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the eucaryotic enzyme that converts UDP-GlcA to UDP-xylose (32Gebb C. Baron D. Grisebach H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 54: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Schutzbach J.S. Feingold D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArnA is unique, however, in releasing the 4” ketone and the NADH products without reutilizing the latter for a subsequent reduction step. ArnA, furthermore, contains a second catalytic domain that is highly homologous to methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (34Schmitt E. Panvert M. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6819-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the function of the formyltransferase domain of ArnA remains unclear, it is responsible for the UDP-l-Ara4N formylation observed in vitro (Fig.2). UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (yeast), inorganic pyrophosphatase (yeast), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (bovine, type VI), UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronic acid, NAD, NADP, glucose 1-phosphate, triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5),l-glutamate, polymyxin B sulfate, kanamycin, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (citrovorum factor), and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]UTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes (NdeI andXhoI) were obtained from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase, oligonucleotides, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Invitrogen. The Pfu polymerase was purchased from Stratagene. The polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were purchased from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. DEAE-SepharoseTM Cl-6B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences AB. Construction of the polymyxin-resistant mutant WD101 derived from E. coli W3110 was described previously (28Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The synthesis of [α-32P]UDP-glucose was analogous to that of [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (35Kelly T.M.

The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 1 h, diluted to 1.5 ml with deionized water, and loaded onto a 2-ml column of DEAE-SepharoseTM CL-6B (pre-equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5). The column was washed with 5 ml of deionized water followed by elution of the product with a 0–100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) gradient (40 ml total volume). The eluted material was concentrated using a Speed-Vac centrifuge, and was re-dissolved in 200 μl of deionized water. The yield was generally greater than 75% based on recovery of radioactivity. The conversion of [α-32P]UDP-glucose to [α-32P]UDP-glucuronic acid proceeded in the following reaction: 50 mm Tris (pH 8.7), 2 mm DTT, 6 mm NAD, [α-32P]UDP-glucose (100 μCi), 3 mm MgCl2, and 75 μg of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase in 150 μl total volume for 60 min at 30 °C. The reaction was diluted to 1.5 ml with deionized water and loaded onto a 2-ml column of DEAE-SepharoseTM CL-6B (pre-equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5). The column was washed with 5 ml of deionized water and 5 ml of 50 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5). The product was eluted with 30 ml of 100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5). The eluted material was concentrated by lyophilization, and re-dissolved in deionized water. The yield was generally greater than 75% based on recovery of radioactivity. Typically, bacteria were grown in LB medium (36Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) at 37 °C to late log phase, and harvested at anA600 = 1.0 by centrifugation at 6500 ×g for 15 min. Cells from a 100-ml culture were resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol, passed through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi, and then clarified by centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. These cell-free extracts were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid using the Pierce assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard (37Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18640) Google Scholar). Assays contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 10 μm [α-32P]UDP-glucuronic acid (8 × 105 cpm/nmol), 0.5 mg/ml protein, and when appropriate, 3 mm NAD, 3 mm NADP, 1 mm l-glutamate, and/or 1 mm5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate in a total volume of 50 μl, as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and at the desired time points 1 μl was withdrawn and spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate. The spots were allowed to dry, and the plate was washed in methanol for 5 min. After drying, the plate was developed using 0.25 m acetic acid with 0.4m LiCl. The plate was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Radioactive enzymatic products were identified and quantified with a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software, Molecular Dynamics). The conversion of N-5-formyltetrahydrofolate toN-5,N-10 methenyltetrahydrofolate was carried out as described (38Blanquet S. Dessen P. Kahn D. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In 1.5 ml of deionized water containing 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 7.5 mg of N-5-formyltetrahydrofolate was dissolved, and the pH was adjusted to 1.9 with 0.1 n HCl. The material was diluted to 2.2 ml with deionized water, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature. Generation ofN-5,N-10 methenyltetrahydrofolate was followed by measuring the increase in absorbance at 355 nm. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was stored at −20 °C. TheN-5,N-10-methenyltetrahydrofolate was converted to N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate at pH 7.5 (38Blanquet S. Dessen P. Kahn D. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by performing a 10-min preincubation of this substrate in the enzymatic assay buffer, which contains 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Preparation of competent cells, transformation by the CaCl2 method, genomic DNA purification, and electrophoresis were performed according to published procedures (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Restriction enzymes, Pfu DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were used as recommended by the manufacturer.

The Opti-PrimeTM PCR Optimization kit (Stratagene) was used as described by the manufacturer. Amplification in a 50-μl reaction mixture with 10 × Opti-Prime Buffer 9 (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.2, 35 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 250 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of clonedPfu DNA polymerase for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min) followed by one cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 15 min resulted in a single product of the expected size. The PCR product was isolated with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), digested withXhoI and NdeI, and ligated into a T7 expression vector, pET24b (Novagen), previously digested with the same enzymes. The fidelity of the Pfu DNA polymerase was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the cloned arnA gene in pETArnA. The plasmid pETArnA was transformed into E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) cells (Novagen). Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C from single colonies in LB broth supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was then used to inoculate 100 ml of the same LB broth, and cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued at 30 °C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,500 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT, and lysis was achieved by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to give crude cell-free extracts. Expression was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. l-Threo-pentapyranosyl-4“-ulose diphosphate) (Compound 1)—A 15-ml reaction mixture containing 0.1 mg/ml of the recombinant ArnA crude cell-free extract, 1 mmUDP-glucuronic acid, and 6 mm NAD, in buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 2 mm DTT, was allowed to proceed for 8 h at 30 °C. Protein was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a CentriconTM (YM-10) membrane. The enzymatic product was loaded onto a 10-ml column of DEAE-SepharoseTM CL-6B (pre-equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5). The column was washed with 40 ml of deionized water followed by elution of the product with a 0–100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) gradient (200 ml total volume). Chromatography was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm, and fractions containing the desired product, the putative UDP-l-Ara4O, were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization to give the triethylammonium salt of the sugar nucleotide. Conversion to the sodium salt was accomplished by passage over a 1-ml column of AGTM 50W-X8 resin (sodium form), followed by lyophilization to give the pure compound (6 mg, 68% yield). The putative UDP-l-Ara4O (Na+ salt, total of 6 mg) and the UDP-glucuronic acid (34 mg) were each dissolved in 0.6 ml of 99% D2O in 5-mm NMR tubes. Measurements with a 3-mm pH electrode revealed pD values of 6.51 and 5.44 for the ArnA product and the UDP-GlcA samples, respectively. All 1H and13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid at 0.00 ppm. The31P NMR spectra were referenced to 85% phosphoric acid at 0.00 ppm. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer equipped with a Sun Ultra 5 computer and a 5-mm Varian triple resonance probe. One-dimensional 1H spectra were obtained with a spectral width (SW) of 6.5 kHz, a 72° pulse flip angle (6 μs), a 6.3-s acquisition time, and a 1.2-s relaxation delay (RD), and digitized using 82000 points to obtain a digital resolution of 0.159 Hz/pt. 1H-decoupled one-dimensional 13C spectra were recorded with a 35 kHz SW, a 54° pulse flip angle (6 μs), and a 3.1-s repeat time, and digitized into 91000 points to give a digital resolution of 0.777 Hz/pt. Two-dimensional COSY data were recorded in absolute value mode with 2048 points, 1-s RD, and 32 scans per increment; 512 time increments were collected and zero-filled to 2048 points with sine-bell weighting in both dimensions before Fourier transformation, followed by symmetrization of the two-dimensional matrix. The two-dimensional NOESY data were recorded in hypercomplex phase-sensitive mode with two sets of 256 time incremented spectra, 32 scans per increment, a 1-s delay and a mixing time of 500 ms.

Band shift analysis showed that this extra domain provides LysRS with nonspecific tRNA binding properties. A N-terminally truncated derivative of LysRS, LysRS-ΔN, displayed a 100-fold lower apparent affinity for tRNA3Lys and a 3-fold increase inKm for tRNA3Lys in the aminoacylation reaction, as compared with the native enzyme. The isolated N-domain of LysRS also displayed weak affinity for tRNA, suggesting that the catalytic and N-domains of LysRS act synergistically to provide a high affinity binding site for tRNA. A more detailed analysis revealed that LysRS binds and specifically aminoacylates an RNA minihelix mimicking the amino acid acceptor stem-loop structure of tRNA3Lys, whereas LysRS-ΔN did not. As a consequence, merging an additional RNA-binding domain into a bacterial-like LysRS increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, especially at the low concentration of deacylated tRNA prevailing in vivo.

Because aminoacylated tRNAs connect a given anticodon to the corresponding amino acid, accurate translation of the genetic code relates on the specific charging of these RNA molecules by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein-tRNA interactions play a central role in this essential process. A wealth of biochemical and structural data have revealed different modes of tRNA-synthetase interaction. However, the acceptor stem and anticodon of tRNA are generally involved in binding to the synthetase (2Schimmel P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 125-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The majority of earlier studies have focused on bacterial enzymes. A major difference that characterizes eukaryotic enzymes as compared with their prokaryotic counterparts is the presence of polypeptide chain extensions appended to the N or C terminus of the protein (4Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although the mean features of tRNA-synthetase interaction uncovered in bacterial systems should hold true for eukaryotic enzymes, additional RNA-binding helper domains have been recently characterized for several eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: (i) The yeast protein Arc1p is an RNA-binding protein associated with MetRS and GluRS that functions as a trans-acting cofactor for tRNA aminoacylation (5Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6Deinert K. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6000-6008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A similar RNA-binding domain is recovered as a C-terminal polypeptide chain extension in plant MetRS (7Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or as an auxiliary protein associated with the mammalian multisynthetase complex (8Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Its crystal structure revealed an oligonucleotide-binding-fold conformation characteristic of numerous RNA-binding proteins (9Kim Y. Shin J. Li R.B. Cheong C. Kim K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27062-27068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Renault L. Kerjan P. Pasqualato S. Menetrey J. Robinson J.C. Kawaguchi S. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Mirande M. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). (ii) A large, 228-amino acid residue RNA-binding domain is appended to the N terminus of yeast GlnRS (11Wang C.C. Morales A.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17180-17186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). (iii) Bombyx mori GlyRS, multifunctional GluProRS, and human MetRS share a short, 50-amino acid residue RNA-binding domain corresponding to a single helix-turn-helix motif (12Wu H. Nada S. Dignam J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16327-16336Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M.

(iv) Yeast AspRS share with eukaryotic class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases another type of RNA-binding module (15Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the RNA binding capacity of mammalian LysRS, a class IIb enzyme that may be involved in targeting tRNA3Lys, one of the three isoaccepting lysine tRNAs, to human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1)1 viral particles where it serves as a primer for reverse transcription of viral RNA (16Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In mammals, lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), a homodimeric protein of 136 kDa, is one of the components of a multisynthetase complex containing the nine synthetases specific for amino acids Glu, Pro, Ile, Leu, Met, Gln, Lys, Arg, and Asp, as well as three auxiliary proteins (17Mirande M. Kellermann O. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11049-11055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mirande M. Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11056-11063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native form of LysRS, obtained after dissociation from the synthetase complex, displayed a remarkable affinity for negatively charged carriers, as compared with the Escherichia colienzyme (19Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following controlled elastase digestion of the purified complex, LysRS was converted to a dimer with an apparentMr of 2 × 62 kDa, similar in size toE. coli LysRS, which had lost its polyanion binding property (19Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the two E. coli lysS (20Onesti S. Desogus G. Brevet A. Chen J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. Brick P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12853-12861Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and lysU (21Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) gene products and the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus LysRS complexed with tRNALys (22Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6321-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have been described. The anticodon binding domain, located at the N terminus of the bacterial enzyme, is built around a β-barrel. The C-terminal catalytic domain consists of an extended anti-parallel β-sheet characteristic of class II synthetases. Cloning of the cDNA encoding hamster or human LysRS revealed the presence of a polypeptide chain extension of about 60 amino acid residues appended to the N terminus of the protein (see Fig.1). The site of cleavage by elastase of mammalian LysRS has been localized within the stretch of alanine residues from Ala49to Ala54 (23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), just upstream from the anticodon binding domain of the synthetase. The truncated product shares 43% identity to the E. coli enzyme (48% identities for the catalytic domains; 33% identities for the anticodon-binding domains). The eukaryotic-specific, N-terminal polypeptide chain extension of hamster or human LysRS is rich in basic residues (12 Lys and 2 Arg residues) and is believed to be organized into helical segments (23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of eukaryotic class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases identified a conserved 11-amino acid peptide that may be functionally important for binding tRNA (15Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, recent in vitrodata suggested that removal of the N-domain of human LysRS causes relatively small changes in kinetic parameters for tRNA (24Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this work, we present evidence for the involvement of the N-domain of mammalian LysRS as a functional tRNA-binding domain. The native enzyme formed a stable RNA-protein complex with human tRNA3Lys, whereas a N-terminally truncated derivative did not. The presence of this extension decreases theKm value for tRNA and therefore should facilitate tRNA aminoacylation under the conditions of suboptimal tRNA concentration prevailing in vivo. Native LysRS from hamster was expressed in yeast and purified as described (23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Its N-terminally truncated derivative (LysRS-ΔN) was obtained by elastase treatment of the native enzyme (19Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The N-terminal polypeptide extension of LysRS (N-LysRS) was expressed in E. coli. The 5′-coding region of hamster cDNA was PCR-amplified between oligonucleotides cccccatggccacgctgcaggagtg and cccctcgagagtctcctcctcaacaccc and inserted into theNcoI-XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-28b (Novagen). The encoded protein corresponds to hamster LysRS from Met1 to Leu71 with the additional Glu-His6 C-terminal sequence. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of N-LysRS bearing a His tag was conducted starting from a 2-liter culture of BL21(DE3) transformed with the recombinant pET plasmid, grown at 37 °C in LB-kanamycin (50 μg/ml) broth to a cell density corresponding toA600 = 0.50. At that time, the recombinant protein was expressed for 3 h after addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g for 10 min), washed with ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol), resuspended in 20 ml of extraction buffer supplemented with 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, and homogenized by sonication. After lysis, the supernatant recovered after centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min was loaded on a 10-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow matrix (Qiagen) charged with Ni2+. After washing with extraction buffer, bound material was eluted by a 200-ml linear gradient of imidazole from 10 to 200 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing N-LysRS were pooled (∼30 ml), dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and applied to a 2.0 × 9.5-cm column of SOURCE 15S (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. After washing with equilibration buffer, N-LysRS was eluted by a 50-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 50 to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration on MICROSEP (Pall Filtron; 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off), dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 55% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C at a protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml. The completeness of the purified protein was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis (Bruker). The protein concentration was determined by using calculated absorption coefficients of 0.547 and 0.600 A280units·mg−1·cm2, respectively, for LysRS and LysRS-ΔN. The concentration of N-LysRS was estimated according to Ref. 26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The apparent native molecular mass of the isolated N-domain of LysRS was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl, and 1 mm DTT and developed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. All of the samples were loaded in 0.2 ml. For a particular protein, its elution was described in term of the corresponding Kav value.Kav = (Ve −V0)/(Vt −V0), where Ve is the elution volume of the particular molecule, V0 is the void volume of the column, and Vt is the total bed volume. V0 andVt were determined with thyroglobulin (667 kDa) and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa), respectively. Ovalbumin (45 kDa) and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used for calibration. Ultracentrifugation experiments were conducted as described previously (27Agou F. Waller J.P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29295-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using an An 60 Ti rotor and a double-sector cell of 12-mm path length. Equilibrium was verified from the superimposition of duplicate scans recorded at 4-h intervals. The experimental sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted to a model for a single homogeneous species using the following equation.c(r)=c(rref)expMr(1−v̄ρ)ω2/2RT(r2−rref2)Equation 1 where c(r) is the protein concentration at radial position r, c(rref) is the concentration of the protein at an arbitrary reference radial distance rref, Mr is the molecular mass, v¯ is the partial specific volume (0.726 at 4 °C, for N-LysRS) of the solute, ρ is the density of the solvent, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, andR and T are the molar gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. Plasmid pTL9 was obtained from J. L. Darlix (LaboRetro, Lyon). It allows in vitrotranscription of tRNA3Lys lacking the 3′-terminal -C-A dinucleotide (28Barat C. Le Grice S.F.J. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To produce a functional tRNA, the two oligonucleotides LysF1 (5′-gatccggatgaaaa) and LysF2 (5′-gatcttttcatccg), which inserted a FokI site, were hybridized and introduced into pTL9 digested with BamHI, to give pLys3. Linearization with FokI followed by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (7Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) generated a functional full-length tRNA3Lys. The amino acid acceptor minihelixLys (AccLys) and anticodon microhelixLys (AntLys) were produced byin vitro transcription of BstNI- orEcoRV-digested pUC18 derivatives constructed by insertion into their HindIII-BamHI sites of oligonucleotides RS101 (5′-agcttaatacgactcact)/RS111 (5′-ctatagtgagtcgtatta) and KH101 (5′-atagcccggacagggttcaagtccctgttcgggcgccag)/KH111 (5′-gatcctggcgcccgaacagggacttgaaccctgtccggg), or RS101/RS111 and KH102 (5′-atagtcagacttttaatctgatatcg)/KH112 (5′-gatccgatatcagattaaaagtctga), respectively. 32P-Labeled tRNAs were purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and protein-tRNA interactions were analyzed using a band shift assay, as described previously (7Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, free and bound tRNA species were quantified by densitometry measurements. Initial rates of tRNA aminoacylation were measured at 25 °C in 0.1 ml of 20 mm imidazole HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 180 μm14C-labeled lysine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 16.66 Ci/mol), and saturating amounts of tRNA, as described previously (29Mirande M. Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total brewer's yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; lysine acceptance of 38 pmol/A260) or homogeneous human tRNA3Lys obtained byin vitro transcription (lysine acceptance of 720 pmol/A260) were used as tRNA substrate. Large scale synthesis of RNA substrates was conducted as described previously (7Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained catalytic amounts (1–2 nm) of enzymes appropriately diluted in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing bovine serum albumin at 4 mg/ml. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme producing 1 nmol of lysine-tRNALys/min, at 25 °C. For the determination of Km values for substrates, concentrations of 0.02–2 mm, 5–300 μm, and 0.25–50 μm were used for ATP, lysine, and tRNALys, respectively. Michaelian parameters were obtained by nonlinear regression of the theoretical Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental curve using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.8 software (Abelbeck Software). The time course of aminoacylation of tRNA3Lysminihelix was conducted at 25 °C in 20 mm imidazole HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 12 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 150 μm14C-labeled lysine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 309 Ci/mol) in the presence of 50 μm RNA substrates and 2.5 μm enzyme. At different time intervals, 0.02-ml aliquots were withdrawn and quenched on 3MM Whatman papers presoaked with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm[12C]lysine. After a 1-h incubation on ice, filters were washed five times for 10 min in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm lysine, washed once in 95% ethanol, dried and processed for liquid scintillation counting. For the determination of Km values for tRNALys minihelix, RNA concentrations of 9–136 μm were used. TheKi value for inhibition of AccLysaminoacylation by AntLys was deduced from a Dixon plot of 1/v versus [AntLys] (30Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 100-160Google Scholar). To probe the functional role of the appended N-terminal domain of mammalian LysRS, the native enzyme from hamster (LysRS; dimer of 2 × 68 kDa) expressed in yeast (23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a derivative with a deletion from residues 1–50 (LysRS-ΔN; dimer of 2 × 62 kDa) obtained by in vitro controlled digestion with elastase (19Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were isolated as described previously. The N-domain of LysRS from amino acid residues 1–71 (N-LysRS), corresponding to the eukaryotic-specific polypeptide extension preceding helix H1 from the anticodon-binding domain of bacterial LysRS (Fig. 1), was expressed in E. coli as a C-terminally His-tagged protein. This small protein domain (8,741 Da) proved to be highly soluble inE. coli (it contains 38% of charged residues Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp, with a calculated pI of 8.1) and was purified to homogeneity after fractionation on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, followed by a second fractionation step on a cation exchange (SOURCE 15S) column. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass of 8,608 ± 4 Da. The loss of 133 Da as compared with the calculated mass may be accounted for by the removal of the N-terminal Met residue from the sequence Met-Ala-. Indeed, in accordance with the N-terminal rules of methionine excision by Met aminopeptidase in E. coli (31Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), N-terminal methionine is generally removed when the second amino acid is alanine. The oligomeric structure of the isolated N-domain of LysRS was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Fig.2A). N-LysRS was eluted as a quite symmetrical peak between ovalbumin (molecular mass = 45 kDa;Kav = 0.251) and cytochrome c(molecular mass = 12.4 kDa; Kav = 0.519) with a Kav of 0.376, corresponding to the elution volume of a globular protein of 24.7 kDa. Taking into account the mass of a monomer (8,608 Da), N-LysRS might behave as a trimer in solution. Essentially similar results were obtained after chromatography in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, or 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 or 500 mm NaCl. Because molecular sieve chromatography essentially depends on Stokes radius of the solutes, N-LysRS was also analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium, a method that does not rely on the shape of the molecules. As shown in Fig. 2B, when N-LysRS was subjected to centrifugation equilibrium in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, experimental data could be fitted to a monodisperse solute with a molecular mass of 9,104 Da. Molecular masses of 8,551 or 8,462 Da were determined in 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, or 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl (not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the isolated N-domain of LysRS is a monomer with an elongated shape in solution. Because hamster LysRS displays a markedly basic N-domain appended to a bacterial-like core enzyme, we analyzed the ability of full-length and of N-terminally truncated LysRS to form complexes with various tRNA molecules. Radiolabeled in vitrotranscribed human tRNA3Lys was incubated with increasing amounts of LysRS (15–1000 nm), and free and bound tRNA species were analyzed by a gel retardation assay (Fig.3). LysRS interacted with tRNA3Lys with an apparent dissociation constant of 30 ± 10 nm, taking into account the dimeric status of LysRS. This Kd value compares well with that reported for association of tRNAAsp with yeast AspRS (Kd = ∼20 nm), an enzyme that possesses a related N-domain (15Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similar band shifts were also observed with noncognate tRNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(tRNAAsp, Kd = ∼40 nm; tRNAPhe, Kd = ∼40 nm; tRNAiMet, Kd = ∼120 nm) or with human tRNA3Lys deprived of the -C-A dinucleotide at its 3′-extremity (Kd = ∼50 nm) (not shown). These results established the general tRNA binding capacity of hamster LysRS and suggested that formation of a nonproductive RNA-protein complex might involve nonspecific electrostatic interactions between side chains of basic amino acid residues from the N-domain of LysRS and tRNA phosphate-sugar backbone. As shown in Fig. 3, the removal of the N-domain of LysRS was accompanied by a dramatic loss of its capacity to bind tRNA3Lys. LysRS-ΔN contributed a stable complex with in vitro transcribed tRNA3Lys but displayed a 100-fold lower apparent affinity (Kd = 3 ± 1 μm(dimer concentration)). The latter value compares with the dissociation constant of 26 μm determined in the E. colisystem between LysRS-S and tRNALys (32Commans S. Plateau P. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A weaker interaction (Kd ≥ 30 μm) was observed with noncognate yeast tRNAAsp (not shown). The isolated N-domain of LysRS formed a weak complex with tRNALys(Kd = ∼20 μm) (Fig. 3). Therefore, N-LysRS and LysRS-ΔN are both required to confer on the native enzyme a robust tRNA binding propensity. Because the RNA binding properties of LysRS and LysRS-ΔN radically differed, we investigated in detail kinetics of tRNA aminoacylation by these two enzyme species. First, we sought to check whether removal of the N-domain of LysRS affected the catalytic center of the enzyme. The kinetic parameters for lysine and ATP in the aminoacylation reaction, with Km values of approximately 100 and 200 μm, respectively, were not significantly different for LysRS and LysRS-ΔN (TableI). These results, obtained with the two substrates that deeply fit into the catalytic pocket of the enzyme, established that catalysis of Lys-tRNALys formation is basically unchanged by the deletion of the N-domain.Table IApparent kinetic parameters for lysine, ATP and tRNA by LysRS and LysRS-ΔN in the tRNALys aminoacylation reactionEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1s−1μm−1Lysine LysRS104 ± 25.8 ± 0.20.056 LysRS-ΔN92 ± 35.1 ± 0.20.055ATP LysRS250 ± 305.0 ± 0.20.020 LysRS-ΔN195 ± 305.1 ± 0.10.026YtRNA1-atRNALys acceptance of 38 pmol/A260.

Open table in a new tab Standard errors were determined from at least two independent data sets. In contrast, a moderate but consistently observed variation of theKm value for tRNA was uncovered. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of LysRS and LysRS-ΔN was determined with homogeneous, in vitrotranscribed human tRNA3Lys (lysine acceptance of 720 pmol/A260) (Fig.4 and Table I). Thekcat/Km for the aminoacylation of tRNA3Lys by LysRS-ΔN is 0.67 μm−1 s−1 at 25 °C in the presence of 180 μm lysine and 100 mm KCl (Table I), as compared with a value of ∼0.1 μm−1 s−1 determined for the homologous human enzyme at 30 °C in the presence of 20 μm lysine (a nonsaturating amino acid concentration) and 20 mm KCl (24Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We found that the kcat/Km for aminoacylation of tRNA3Lys is increased 3-fold for the native enzyme, resulting essentially from a 4-fold decrease inKm for tRNA. Therefore, the N-domain decreased the apparent Km value for tRNA but did not affect the catalytic rate of the enzyme. This is in contrast to an earlier work that reported identical Km values for tRNA for Lys-tRNA formation by native and N-terminally truncated human LysRS (25Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in that study the native enzyme was produced in E. coli with a large (16 amino acid residues) His tag appended to the N terminus of the protein, a feature that might have impair the function of this domain (see below). In the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, LysRS is exclusively found as a component (LysRSCx) of a multi-synthetase complex (4Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We checked whether association of LysRS within the complex changes its catalytic properties. Thekcat/Km for the aminoacylation of tRNA3Lys by LysRSCx (2.0 μm−1s−1) was similar to that determined for the ectopic free form of LysRS (2.07 μm−1 s−1) (Table I). This result confirms an earlier work showing that the association state of these enzymes is not required for their functioning in vitro (29Mirande M. Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In previous works, we showed that the presence of a large excess of noncognate tRNAs in the aminoacylation reaction may conceal kinetic effects contributed by the appended domains of other eukaryotic enzymes by neutralization of the nonspecific RNA-binding sites (7Kaminska M.

Cisplatin analogs with a diamminocyclohexane (DACH) carrier ligand, such as oxaliplatin and Pt(DACH)Cl2, do not elicit resistance in mismatch repair-deficient cells and therefore present promising therapeutic agents. This study compared the interactions of the purifiedEscherichia coli mismatch repair protein MutS with DNA modified to contain cisplatin and DACH adducts. MutS recognized the cisplatin-modified DNA with 2-fold higher affinity in comparison to the DACH-modified DNA. ADP stimulated the binding of MutS to cisplatin-modified DNA, whereas it had no effect on the MutS interaction with DNA modified by DACH or EN adducts. In parallel cytotoxicity experiments, methylation-deficient E. coli dammutants were 2-fold more sensitive to cisplatin than DACH compounds. A panel of recombination-deficient mutants showed striking sensitivity to both compounds, indicating that both types of adducts are strong replication blocks.

Einhorn L.H. Ann. Int. Med. 1984; 100: 704-713Google Scholar). The detailed biochemical mechanism underlying the clinical effectiveness of cisplatin is incompletely understood, but most likely it results from the formation of DNA adducts that block replication and elicit a variety of cellular responses including nucleotide excision repair (2Mello J.A. Trimmer E.E. Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1998; 12: 249-274Google Scholar, 3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem.

Cisplatin forms predominantly (>90%) 1,2-d(GpG), 1,2-d(ApG), and 1,3-d(GpNpG, where N is any nucleotide) intrastrand adducts, and a small number of monofunctional adducts and interstrand cross-links (6Eastman A.

The 1,2-intrastrand cisplatin-DNA adducts induce significant distortions of the double helix and provide a structural signal for specific recognition by a variety of cellular proteins, including those involved in mismatch repair (2Mello J.A. Trimmer E.E. Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1998; 12: 249-274Google Scholar, 8Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Google Scholar, 9Kartalou M. Samson L.D. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8032-8038Google Scholar, 10Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 1-21Google Scholar). Mismatch repair maintains genomic integrity by correcting polymerase replication errors and by ensuring the fidelity and frequency of recombination events (11Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Google Scholar, 12Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Google Scholar, 13Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, mismatch repair also plays a role in apoptotic signaling and cell cycle regulation (5Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G.J. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Google Scholar, 14Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Google Scholar). It has been established that mismatch repair proteins mediate the cellular responses to cisplatin damage, but paradoxically they seem to sensitize rather than protect the cell. In both Escherichia coli and eukaryotes, loss of mismatch repair confers cellular resistance to cisplatin cytotoxicity (2Mello J.A. Trimmer E.E. Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1998; 12: 249-274Google Scholar,15Aebi S. Kurdi-Haidar B. Gordon R. Cenni B. Zheng H. Boland C.R. Fishel R. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3087-3090Google Scholar, 16Fink D. Nevel S. Aebi S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1841-1845Google Scholar). Cisplatin resistance by tumors (mismatch repair-deficient) presents a serious clinical problem (19Brown R. Hirst G.L. Gallagher W.M. McIlwrath A.J. Margison G.P. van der Zee A.G. Anthoney D.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 45-52Google Scholar), and it has stimulated a great deal of interest in the design of novel platinum compounds that would overcome this drawback. One of the earliest leads involved complexes with diamminocyclohexane (DACH)1 carrier ligand (20Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Google Scholar), such as oxaliplatin ((trans-R,R)-(DACH)oxalatoplatinum(II), Fig. 1) and Pt(DACH)Cl2 ((1,2-DACH)dichloroplatinum(II), Fig. 1). Loss of mismatch repair does not seem to confer resistance to oxaliplatin (16Fink D. Nevel S. Aebi S. Zheng H. Cenni B. Nehme A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4881-4886Google Scholar), and, in recent years, oxaliplatin has shown great potential for clinical use (20Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Google Scholar, 21Culy C.R. Clemett D. Wiseman L.R. Drugs. 2000; 60: 895-924Google Scholar). Oxaliplatin and Pt(DACH)Cl2 form a similar DNA adduct profile to cisplatin (22Saris C.P. van de Vaart P.J. Rietbroek R.C. Blommaert F.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2763-2769Google Scholar, 23Woynarowski J.M. Faivre S. Herzig M.C. Arnett B. Chapman W.G. Trevino A.V. Raymond E. Chaney S.G. Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Juniewicz P.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 920-927Google Scholar), and modeling studies have suggested that the adducts of both cisplatin and DACH could induce similar distortions of secondary DNA structure (24Scheeff E.D. Briggs J.M. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 633-643Google Scholar). Adducts of the DACH compounds differ from cisplatin by their bulky, nonpolar ligand that probably protrudes in the major groove. The presence of the nonpolar cyclohexane ligand in the mostly polar major groove would certainly present a distinct recognition environment for the mismatch repair proteins or any other cellular proteins that interact with platinum adducts. For example, high mobility group 1 (HMG-1) box proteins, which recognize cisplatin-DNA adducts with great affinity (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Google Scholar), poorly recognize DACH-DNA adducts (25Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Google Scholar). We set out to examine if the differential mismatch repair-mediated cellular responses to the cisplatin and DACH compounds result from differential recognition of their platinum-DNA adducts by mismatch repair proteins. The eukaryotic mismatch repair proteins hMSH2 (26Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Google Scholar) and MutSα (27Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Google Scholar) bind to oligonucleotides modified to contain the major cisplatin-DNA adduct, a 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link. To date, however, there have been no studies of the interaction of their bacterial homologue, MutS, with DNA modified with cisplatin or DACH compounds. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the interactions of MutS with oligonucleotides differentially modified with platinum compounds. In addition, we assembled a panel of E. coli mutants deficient in the major mismatch repair and recombination pathways and we compared their sensitivity to treatment with the cisplatin and DACH compounds. Platinum compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, except for Pt(EN)Cl2 (cis-ethylenediammine dichloroplatinum(II)) and [Pt(DIEN)Cl]+(diethylenetriamine platinum(II)chloride), which were synthesized as previously described (28Watt G.W. Cude W.A. Inorg. Chem. 1968; 7: 335-338Google Scholar, 29Johnston G.L. Inorg. Synth. 1966; 8: 242-244Google Scholar). Oxaliplatin was a generous gift from Dr. S. B. Howell (University of California, San Diego, CA). Platinum-modified DNA probes were prepared as described previously (26Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Google Scholar). In brief, restriction enzyme digests of pSTR3 withClaI and EcoRV yielded 162- and 4205-bp restriction fragments. DNA probes of 162 bp were purified from the 4205-bp restriction fragment on native 5% polyacrylamide gels. Platination reactions of the restriction fragment were carried out in 3 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4(pH 7.4) with 100 μg/ml DNA and appropriate platinum compound:DNA molar ratios by incubating at 37 °C for 16 h. Unreacted platinum compounds were removed by dialysis (24 h) against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (TE). Levels of platinum modification were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy on a Varian AA1475 instrument equipped with a GTA95 graphite furnace. DNA probes of 162 bp were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci mmol−1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and resuspended in TE to 5000–10000 cpm/μl. It should be noted that for oligonucleotide modifications we used (trans-R,R)-Pt(DACH)Cl2whose chloride leaving groups differ from the oxalato group of oxaliplatin. However, following biotransformation both compounds should form identical adducts with DNA. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the Pt(DACH)Cl2 compound was used to demonstrate that the compound was in thetrans-R,R conformation. MutS was purified as previously described (30Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Google Scholar). The host strain was BL21 (λDE3) (pLysS), and the plasmid used was pMQ372 (31Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5948-5952Google Scholar). In brief, the strain was transformed with pMQ372 and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, shifted to room temperature, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 50 μm final concentration. Incubation was continued for 2 h at room temperature, and the cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell (Aminco). The lysate was treated with streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate as described (30Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Google Scholar). We used a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column instead of heparin-Sepharose. Two fractions (IVa and IVb) from the hydroxylapatite chromatography were saved and stored at −70 °C. The IVb fraction was used in the binding assays. Protein concentration was assayed using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Binding assays contained radiolabeled 162-bp DNA probes (present at 100–200 pm, 5000–10,000 cpm) either unmodified or modified with platinum compounds, and purified MutS present at 0–300 nm concentration. Binding reactions were carried out in a 15-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris base, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.01 mm EDTA, and 50 ng of nonspecific competitor chicken erythrocyte DNA. The binding reactions were incubated for 30 min on ice. Samples were then loaded onto 4% (29:1 acrylamide:bis) native gels containing TAE buffer (90 mm Tris base (pH 8.0), 2.0 mm EDTA, 90 mm boric acid) and 5% sucrose, and separated by electrophoresis at room temperature in TAE buffer at ∼25 mA (140 V) for 2 h. Amounts of bound and unbound radiolabeled probe were determined by quantitative analysis of gels using a Molecular Dynamics Storm system and ImageQuant software. TheKd(app) was determined by a nonlinear least squares fitting of the binding data to the standard Hill equation. In the reactions that contained nucleotides, ADP or ATP (Roche) was added to a 100 μm reaction concentration. Titration of increasing amounts of ADP (up to 300 μm) did not further increase the percentage of MutS bound to the modified probes. The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The strains are derivatives of GM112, used in the toxicity experiments with the mismatch repair- and methylation-deficient mutants, or AB1157, used in the experiments with the recombination-deficient mutants. The auxotrophic phenotype of each mutant was conformed by growth on the appropriate supplemented minimal medium.Table IGenotypes of E. coli K-12 strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceAB1157thr-1 ara-14 leuB6 − (gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 glnV44(AS)E.

Overnight cultures were diluted 1000-fold and grown in Luria-Bertani medium until the density of the population reached 2 × 108 cells/ml as determined byA600. The exponentially growing cells were resuspended in M9 minimal medium (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) and treated with drug dissolved in H2O for 2 h at 37 °C. Appropriate dilutions in M9 medium were plated on Luria-Bertani plates and incubated at 37 °C until colonies could be counted. Results from three to six independent experiments plated in duplicate were averaged and plotted against drug concentration, ± S.E. (standard error of the mean). IC37(inhibitory concentration of 37%) was determined as the drug concentration where there was 37% of survival in comparison to the untreated control. To examine if the bacterial MutS binds to DNA modified to contain cisplatin adducts, purified E. coli MutS was used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with DNA globally modified by cisplatin. Three types of globally modified cisplatin duplexes were constructed that differed in the level of modification. (i) Cisplatin-3 had, on the average, 3 cisplatin adducts/oligonucleotide molecule (drug-to-nucleotide ratio (rb) = 0.0009); (ii) cisplatin-7 had 7 adducts/oligonucleotide (rb = 0.0021); and (iii) cisplatin-11 had 11 adducts/oligonucleotide (rb = 0.0033). Binding of MutS to these radiolabeled 162-bp probes was readily observed by the retarded band migration that represented the bound probe (Fig.2). The fraction of bound probe increased proportionately as the cisplatin modification level increased, 4.9% for cisplatin-3, 12% for cisplatin-7, and 30% for cisplatin-11. The increased fraction of shifted material was probably caused by an increasing population of modified DNA, reinforcing the specific nature of the interaction. In the same assay, we examined the ability of MutS to recognize DNA modified with DACH adducts. The probe DACH-9 had on the average nine DACH adducts per DNA molecule (rb = 0.0027). MutS showed affinity for the DNA modified with DACH adducts, but the fraction of the shifted material was lower in comparison to the cisplatin-modified probes, showing only 2.9% bound probe for DACH-9 (Fig. 2). Under identical conditions the MutS protein did not cause a shift of the corresponding control unmodified homoduplex. To assess if the recognition of the globally modified cisplatin duplex were a consequence of nonspecific MutS interactions, we examined the interaction of MutS with the identical DNA modified by the panel of platinum compounds shown in Fig. 1. It is of interest to note that the electrophoretic mobility of the modified probes in the absence of MutS reflects the differential structural distortions the respective adducts induce to the double helix (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Google Scholar, 33Keck M.V. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3386-3390Google Scholar). As mentioned, cisplatin induces strong directional bend and distortion of the double helix, and higher levels of modification with cisplatin result in significantly altered electrophoretic mobility of the oligonucleotide. Other platinum compounds do not induce strong bending and unwinding of the double helix and, as a result, even high levels of modification do not alter the mobility of the oligonucleotide; trans-DDP (trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) adducts induce a hinge-like bend in the DNA, whereas [Pt(DIEN)Cl]+produces only minimally disruptive monofunctional adducts. MutS showed affinity for the DNA modified with adducts of the cisplatin analog Pt(EN)Cl2, an analog with an ethylenediammine (EN) ligand. The Pt(EN)Cl2-modified 162-bp probe had, on the average, seven EN adducts (rb = 0.0021), and the fraction of the MutS bound probe was 3.4%. This result is in line with previously published data that have shown that Pt(EN)Cl2-modified DNA is recognized by the MutS homologue hMSH2 (26Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Google Scholar). In contrast, MutS had low affinity for DNA that contained adducts of the clinically inactive platinum complexestrans-DDP and the monofunctional [Pt(DIEN)Cl]+(1.1 and 0.4% bound probe, respectively) even though, on the average, the trans-DDP-modified oligonucleotide contained 10 (rb = 0.0030) and the DIEN-modified oligonucleotide contained 13 platinum adducts (rb = 0.0039). The specificity of the interactions of MutS with the cisplatin-, EN-, and DACH-modified oligonucleotides was confirmed by competition band-shift experiments (described in detail in Ref. 26Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Google Scholar, and data not shown). To characterize the nature of the interaction between MutS and cisplatin- or DACH-modified DNA further, MutS protein was titrated into binding reactions containing a constant concentration of duplex DNA modified by adducts of the two drugs (Fig.3A). The 162-bp oligonucleotide used in this experiment contained, on the average, seven cisplatin adducts (cisplatin-7) or nine DACH adducts (DACH-9) per duplex DNA molecule (one cisplatin adduct per 23 bp, and one DACH adduct per 18 bp). The addition of increasing amounts of protein caused the complex to be proportionally shifted through the gel, presumably because multiple protein complexes bound to the multiplatinated probes. The binding isotherm (Fig. 3B) reveals that the fraction of bound platinated DNA increases to saturation over a narrow range of MutS concentrations, consistent with positive cooperative binding (Hill coefficient, nH = 2.9 for cisplatin-7;nH = 2.7 for DACH-9). The observed apparent cooperative binding behavior may be a consequence of multiple platinum sites situated in close proximity in the duplex DNA. MutS produces a 20-bp DNase I footprint at a mismatch site (30Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Google Scholar), and the crystal structure reveals protein DNA contacts that extend to 13 nucleotides proximal to the mismatch (34Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Google Scholar, 35Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Google Scholar). The binding of a MutS dimer to an adduct may render the subsequent binding of a second MutS dimer to a nearby platinum adduct more favorable, or it may facilitate the formation of higher ordered complexes (tetramers and higher oligomers) that have been observed in experiments with high MutS (or MutSα) concentrations (data not shown and Ref. 36Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Google Scholar). Generation of the binding isotherm yielded a Kd(app) = 57 nmfor the cisplatin-modified probe and Kd(app) = 120 nm for the DACH-modified probe. Neither the active fraction of our MutS preparation nor the aggregation state of the protein were established; thus, our estimation of the dissociation constant assumes that MutS binds as a dimer and that 100% of the protein is active in binding. These considerations, taken together with the observed complex nature of the MutS-DNA interactions, dictate that the dissociation constant should be considered an approximation of the affinity of MutS for the platinum-modified DNA. However, the value obtained for the interaction of MutS cisplatin-modified DNA is in accordance with the previously reported value for the interaction of hMSH2 with a cisplatin-modified probe of similar size and level of modification (26Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Google Scholar). No previous reports of MutS binding to DNA modified with DACH adducts exist for comparisons. Nucleotide (ATP or ADP) binding to MutS mediates the conformation of the protein dimer and its binding affinity for DNA and mismatches. Addition of ATP to mismatch-bound MutS can cause the protein to dissociate or translocate from the mismatch, whereas addition of ADP stimulates MutS binding (36Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Google Scholar, 37Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Google Scholar, 38Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of nucleotides on the interaction of MutS with platinum-modified DNA, ATP or ADP was added to a binding reaction containing MutS and the previously described platinum-modified probes (Fig. 4A). In the binding reactions that contained DNA probes modified with cisplatin adducts, the addition of ADP increased the proportion of the shifted probe, whereas the addition of ATP caused a decrease in the portion of the shifted probe (Fig. 4B). For the cisplatin-7 probe, the addition of ADP increased the amount of the shifted probe 1.8-fold, from 13 ± 2.1% to 23.9 ± 1.5%, whereas addition of ATP decreased the amount of shifted probe by a factor of 2, from 13.5 ± 2.1% to 7.4 ± 1.3%. Similar nucleotide effects were observed with the cisplatin-3 and the cisplatin-11 probe (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the results with cisplatin-modified probes, addition of ADP to the binding reactions that contained DNA modified with DACH or EN adducts did not increase the percentage of binding observed; actually, it slightly decreased it from 4.6 ± 0.65% to 3.4 ± 0.54% and from 4.2 ± 0.30% to 3.5 ± 0.95%, respectively. The addition of ATP to the binding reaction containing the DACH- and EN-modified probes also resulted in a decrease of the fraction of the bound probe. Methylation-deficient (dam)mutants in E. coli show high sensitivity to cisplatin, and this sensitivity is abrogated by additional mutations in either of the mismatch repair genes MutS or MutL (repeated in Fig.5; Ref. 39Fram R.J. Cusick P.S. Wilson J.M. Marinus M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 51-55Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for this observation is not known, but it has been proposed that it involves mismatch repair-initiated cycles of futile repair of cisplatin adducts (because of the absence of a strand discrimination signal in the dam mutants). We examined the survival ofdam, dam mutS, and dam mutL mutants following treatment with increasing concentrations of Pt(DACH)Cl2 (Fig. 5). The wild type showed higher sensitivity to equimolar Pt(DACH)Cl2 than cisplatin, which was expected because higher toxicity for DACH compounds has been reported previously in other systems (20Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Google Scholar). The methylation-deficientdam mutants demonstrated high sensitivity to both drugs in comparison to the wild type. When compared, the wild type/dam IC37 ratios for both compounds revealed that the dam mutants were ∼2-fold more resistant to Pt(DACH)Cl2 than cisplatin. The IC37 ratio was 1.4 for Pt(DACH)Cl2 (IC37(wild type) = 21 μm, IC37(dam) = 15 μm) and 2.7 for cisplatin (IC37(wild type) = 73 μm, IC37(dam) = 27 μm). This difference could reflect the degree of sensitivity added by the dam mutation, presumably because of the previously discussed abortive repair model. Introduction of an additional mutation in the mismatch repair gene MutS or MutL (dam mutS, dam mutL) abrogated the damsensitivity to Pt(DACH)Cl2 and cisplatin to similar levels. Similar results were observed in experiments where oxaliplatin was used in place of Pt(DACH)Cl2 (data not shown). Cisplatin-DNA adducts present strong blocks to replication in vitro and in vivo (2Mello J.A. Trimmer E.E. Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1998; 12: 249-274Google Scholar, 40Bruhn S.L. Toney J.H. Lippard S.J. Prog. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 38: 477-516Google Scholar), and these frequent replication blocks require various recombination pathways for their repair or tolerance (4Zdraveski Z.Z. Mello J.A. Marinus M.G. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 39-50Google Scholar). DACH adducts also present replication blocks, and it has been shown in vitro andin vivo that the DACH-DNA adducts are bypassed more efficiently than cisplatin adducts by various polymerases (41Gibbons G.R. Kaufmann W.K. Chaney S.G. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2253-2257Google Scholar, 42Vaisman A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Google Scholar, 43Chaney S.G. Vaisman A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 77: 71-81Google Scholar). We examined whether there would be a difference in E. coli in the capacity of the two drugs to induce replication-blocking lesions that would require recombination for their repair. We determined the sensitivity of a panel of mutants deficient in the major pathways of recombination to increasing concentrations of DACH compounds. TherecF mutant is deficient in repair of daughter strand gaps that follow replication blocks and it is sensitive to UV treatment (44Tseng Y.C. Hung J.L. Wang T.C. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 1-9Google Scholar). The ruvABC mutant is deficient in branch migration and resolution of various recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions, and these mutants are sensitive to certain types of DNA damage, including UV treatment, cisplatin, and γ irradiation (45Sharples G.J. Benson F.E. Illing G.T. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 219-226Google Scholar). The recBCD mutants are deficient in the repair of double strand breaks and are sensitive to γ irradiation (46Sargentini N.J. Smith K.C. Radiat. Res. 1986; 107: 58-72Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 6, all of the mutants tested showed sensitivity to treatment with Pt(DACH)Cl2. These results are comparable with the cisplatin sensitivity reported previously for this panel of mutants, shown here in Fig. 6 for better comparison (4Zdraveski Z.Z. Mello J.A. Marinus M.G. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 39-50Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggested that cisplatin and DACH compounds require recombinational repair for cellular survival, presumably because in E. coli both types of adducts present replication blocks. A similar pattern of sensitivity was observed when the strains were treated with oxaliplatin (data not shown). Mismatch repair-deficient cells have shown differential sensitivity to the two platinum analogs, cisplatin and oxaliplatin, and several mutually nonexclusive mechanisms have been proposed that account for this phenomenon. Mismatch repair could initiate abortive repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts, selectively inhibit their replicative or recombinational bypass, or directly trigger apoptotic signaling. A key common upstream event in these proposed mechanisms is the recognition of platinum-DNA adducts by mismatch repair proteins. Our working hypothesis was that mismatch repair proteins preferentially recognize cisplatin over oxaliplatin DNA adducts and that this preferential recognition could lead to the observed differential cellular responses to the two drugs. Our results showed that MutS recognized both types of adducts, but it recognized DNA modified with cisplatin adducts with a 2-fold higher affinity than DNA modified with DACH adducts. This could represent a biologically significant difference, especially when it is considered that mismatch repair proteins have only 10–20-fold higher affinity for mismatches than they have for homoduplex DNA (47Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Google Scholar). The possible reasons for weaker MutS interactions with DACH-modified DNA can be extrapolated from the recently reported crystal structure of MutS bound to a mismatch (34Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Google Scholar, 35Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Google Scholar). While the bending and unwinding caused by a cisplatin adduct would favor MutS recognition and possibly intercalation of MutS residues in the double helix, the nonpolar DACH ligand is likely to protrude into the major groove where it could disrupt the nonspecific, polar major groove interactions between the positively charged surface of the clamp portion of MutS and the phosphate backbone. Another difference specific for the MutS interaction with cisplatin-modified DNA was observed when nucleotides were added to the binding reaction. Addition of ADP increased the MutS affinity for the cisplatin-modified DNA, but it did not have an observable effect on the affinity of MutS for DNA modified with DACH or EN adducts. The function of nucleotide hydrolysis in the function of MutS, or its mammalian homologues, is currently unclear. It could provide the energy for bidirectional DNA scanning (48Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Google Scholar) or, it could form a molecular switch, signaling between ADP bound/on and ATP bound/off states to downstream components (36Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Google Scholar, 49Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Google Scholar). These downstream components include the reminder of the mismatch repair machinery and, in eukaryotes, apoptotic pathways as well. It has been shown that cisplatin-DNA damage can trigger c-Abl/p73 mismatch repair-mediated apoptosis (5Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G.J. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Google Scholar). This response is absent in mismatch repair-deficient cells, and oxaliplatin failed to show detectable activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or c-Abl kinases regardless of the mismatch repair status of the cells (50Nehme A. Baskaran R. Aebi S. Fink D. Nebel S. Cenni B. Wang J.Y. Howell S.B. Christen R.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3253-3257Google Scholar). It is attractive to speculate that the selective ADP modulation of MutS binding to cisplatin adducts underlines a potential mechanism of damage recognition-specific signaling. In parallel to the MutS binding assays, survival experiments showed that methylation-deficient mutants dam were more sensitive to cisplatin than DACH compounds when compared at a dose equitoxic to the wild type. In dam mutants, where the strand discrimination signal is absent, mismatch repair could initiate futile cycles of abortive repair opposite platinum adducts (39Fram R.J. Cusick P.S. Wilson J.M. Marinus M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 51-55Google Scholar). In support of this model, an additional mutation in mismatch repair genes abrogates the cisplatin sensitivity. This model has been extrapolated to account for the cisplatin resistance of eukaryotic mismatch repair-deficient cells as well (26Mello J.A. Acharya S. Fishel R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 579-589Google Scholar). If abortive repair were operational, preferential recognition of cisplatin in comparison to DACH adducts should lead to higher level of abortive repair in dam mutants and thus, enhanced toxicity. Our results support this model to the extent that the 2-fold higher sensitivity of the dam mutants to cisplatin in comparison to Pt(DACH)Cl2, reflects the 2-fold higher affinity of MutS for cisplatin over DACH-modified DNA. These results are also in line with studies done in mismatch repair-deficient cell lines, where it has been observed that defects in mismatch repair result in increased cisplatin, but not oxaliplatin, resistance (18Fink D. Zheng H. Nebel S. Norris P.S. Aebi S. Lin T.P. Nehme A. Christen R.D. Haas M. MacLeod C.L. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1841-1845Google Scholar). It is also possible that mismatch repair proteins could mediate cisplatin toxicity by inhibiting replication or recombination dependent bypass of platinum DNA adducts. Studies have shown that DACH compounds are more efficiently bypassed by eukaryotic polymerases in comparison to cisplatin adducts (42Vaisman A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Google Scholar, 43Chaney S.G. Vaisman A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 77: 71-81Google Scholar). Our survival experiments showed that recombination-deficient mutants were strikingly, but equally sensitive to both cisplatin and DACH compounds. This results suggests that the primary mechanism of cytotoxicity for both types of compounds, at least in E. coli, involves the formation of DNA adducts that form replication blocks that require recombination for their repair. The replicative bypass of cisplatin adducts is enhanced when a mismatch repair inactivating mutation is introduced (51Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Risinger J.I. Barrett J.C. Hamilton T.C. Chaney S.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3579-3585Google Scholar), an observation that has led to the speculation that direct interactions of cellular proteins and cisplatin adducts could result in enhanced replication blocks. The HMG-1 box protein can selectively inhibit translesion synthesis of cisplatin over oxaliplatin damaged templates, presumably because of a stronger affinity of HMG-1 box protein for cisplatin over oxaliplatin DNA adducts (25Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Google Scholar). It is possible that in our study the replication blocks, in at least in part, were also a consequence of preferential interactions between cellular proteins such as MutS and cisplatin adducts. In addition to the models for mismatch repair-mediated responses to cisplatin and oxaliplatin discussed above, other, yet undiscovered mechanisms by which these compounds contribute to cellular toxicity could exist. Because oxaliplatin and Pt(DACH)Cl2 are more toxic than cisplatin for equimolar doses, yet they have a substantially lower rate of formation of DNA adducts in comparison to cisplatin (22Saris C.P. van de Vaart P.J. Rietbroek R.C. Blommaert F.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2763-2769Google Scholar), it is possible that the cellular responses to the DACH compounds are significantly modulated by their interactions with proteins or other cellular components. Our results add information to the biochemical framework within which the differential cellular responses to the two platinum analogs can be viewed. Further biochemical elucidations within this framework could have clinical importance in that they may lead to the development of novel successful antitumor drugs based on the parental structure of cisplatin. We thank Dr. M. Kartalou for valuable discussions, Dr. K. Mitra for help with the 1H NMR studies, and Dr. S. B. Howell for the gift of oxaliplatin."

Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, following exposure to cAMP, the CREB factor, which is already bound to the cAMP-response element (CRE) in its target genes, is phosphorylated on serine 133 and can then recruit the CBP co-activator, resulting in cAMP-dependent activation of gene expression (1Lalli E.

Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Although originally identified in the cAMP pathway, it is now clear that CBP and the closely related p300 protein play a key role as co-activators for a wide variety of transcription factors involved in various different pathways, including the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, AP1, STAT factors, and muscle-specific transcription factors such as MyoD and MEF2 (for review see Ref. 3Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). As expected from this critical role in a variety of aspects of transcription factor regulation, loss of CBP is incompatible with survival of the organism. Indeed, even the loss of a singleCBP gene (with a functional copy remaining) results in humans in the severe developmental disorder Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (4Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C.M. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J.B. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breunig M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this disorder as well as its characteristic facial abnormalities and mental retardation can also result in cardiac disorders suggesting a role for CBP in the heart (5Rubinstein J.H. Taybi H. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1963; 105: 588-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 6Henneken R.C.M. Van Den Boogaard M.J. Sibbles B.J. Van Spijker H.G. Am. J. Med. Genet. Suppl. 1990; 6: 17-29PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the closely related p300 protein, such a role has been directly confirmed by the finding that knockout mouse embryos lacking both copies of the p300 show abnormal heart development with reduced trabeculation of the ventricular chambers and weaker/less extensive heart contractions, which appear to be responsible for the death of the knockout embryos in utero (7Yao T.-P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.-D. Ch'ng L.-E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the p300 knockout mouse embryos also show reduced expression of cardiac muscle structural proteins such as myosin heavy chain and α-actinin (8Hasegawa K. Meyers M.B. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20049-20054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This parallels previous findings that the expression of these genes could be inhibited in cultured cardiac cells by overexpression of the adenovirus E1A protein, which binds p300 and CBP and removes them from cellular transcription factors, thereby inhibiting the activity of these factors (8Hasegawa K. Meyers M.B. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20049-20054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Bishopric N.H Zeng G-Q Sato B. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20584-20594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This potential key role for CBP and p300 in regulating cardiac cell-specific gene expression is supported by recent data that demonstrate that doxorubicin appears to promote transcriptional repression in cardiac cells by specifically mediating the degradation of p300 (10Poizat C. Sartobelli V. Chung G. Kloner R.A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8643-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These effects of CBP and p300 on cardiac-specific gene expression are likely to be mediated via their ability to specifically interact with transcription factors involved in the regulation of gene expression in cardiac cells such as the MEF2 transcription factor, which is known to interact with p300/CBP and to play a key role in regulating cardiac-specific gene expression (10Poizat C. Sartobelli V. Chung G. Kloner R.A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8643-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Eckner R. Yao Y.-P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Similarly, CBP and p300 can also interact with transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in the hypertrophic response of the heart. Thus CBP/p300-interacting proteins include factors such as AP-1 and STAT-3, which are involved in the hypertrophic response to factors such as angiotensin II (12Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H.

Hypertension. 2000; 35: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy is a response to overload in the heart, which initially results in an adaptive increase in muscle mass, based on the increased size of cardiac myocytes in the heart but ultimately is deleterious and results in heart failure (for review see Ref. 16Van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Evidently, an understanding of the processes involved in regulating cardiac gene expression during hypertrophy would be of considerable importance both in itself and in the development of novel therapies. In view of the interaction of CBP with transcription factors known to be involved in hypertrophy, we have studied the effect of hypertrophic agents on CBP and p300.

The expression constructs for constitutively active MEK-1 (SS/DD), wild type p42 MAPK (P42WT), and the dominant negative p42 MAPK mutant (P42Y185F) were obtained from Dr. J. Pouyssegur (20Lavoie J.N.

The CREBDIEDML mutant and SS-CRE construct were a kind gift of Dr. R. H. Goodman (21Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ANF-luciferase reporter construct (−3003 to +62) of the ANF rat gene was a kind gift of Dr. K. Knowlton (22Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CBP antisense vector was constructed by cloning CBP full-length (1–7326) into theBamHI site of Bluescript SK (Stratagene) in the reversed orientation and subsequently excising the insert with NotI and SalI and inserting it into a pBI-G expression vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid containing a dominant negative mutant of p300 (lacking the C/HI domain, amino acids 348–412) under the control of the CMV promoter was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of neonatal rats (Sprague-Dawley) less than 2 days old and were cultured as described previously (23Simpson P.S. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocyte cell suspension was transferred to 24-well (1-cm diameter) gelatin-coated plates at a density of 106 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. After 24 h the cardiac cultures could be seen to beat in synchrony. Transient transfections of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure as described by Gorman (24Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, A Practical Approach, vol. 2. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1985: 143-190Google Scholar). The amounts of expression vector used are indicated in the figure legends. For each transfection, cells were incubated for 20 h in media containing 15% fetal calf serum. Cells were then treated with UCN, PE, CT-1, and cAMP for 26 h in media supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with different protein kinase inhibitors for 10 min before addition of PE. Cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activities according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). Results were normalized to protein content as determined by Bradford protein assay (25Bradford M.M. Analyt. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were run on a 10% acrylamide gel, transferred to Hybond C membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), probed with relevant antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used to visualize labeled bands by exposure to photographic film. Monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated or total p42/p44 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Values are given as percent activity relative to the luciferase in unstimulated cells (set at 100%). Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by the two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data, with p values <0.05 considered statistically significant. To analyze the effect of hypertrophic agents on the CBP transcriptional co-activator, we made use of constructs in which the DNA sequences encoding CBP have been fused to sequences encoding the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal 4 transcription factor (17Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of these constructs with a reporter construct containing Gal 4 DNA binding sites upstream of a heterologous promoter allows DNA binding mediated via the Gal 4 portion of the molecule and transcriptional activation via the CBP molecule. Hence the effect of any stimulus on the ability of CBP to activate transcription can be assessed without any complications arising from it being recruited to the DNA via interaction with a DNA-bound transcription factor that may itself be modulated by the stimulus. We have previously used this system to determine that nerve growth factor stimulates the transcriptional activating ability of CBP and that this effect is dependent upon the p42/p44 MAPK pathway (26Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Gal4/CBP constructs were therefore transfected into neonatal cardiac cells together with the reporter luciferase construct, and the cells were either left untreated or exposed to the hypertrophic agents PE, UCN, or CT-1. In these experiments, a significant enhancement of promoter activity was observed in the cells transfected with constructs containing full-length CBP when the activity in untreated cells was compared with that observed in PE-treated cells (Fig.1). In contrast, a much smaller up-regulation was observed with UCN and virtually no enhancement was observed with CT-1 or cAMP. PE produced no enhanced activity when a construct containing the isolated DNA binding domain of Gal 4 alone was transfected, indicating that these effects are mediated via the CBP or p300 portion of the construct (data not shown). A similar up-regulation of activity with PE to that seen with full-length CBP was observed with a Gal 4 construct containing the C-terminal activation domain of CBP (amino acids 1678–2441). In contrast, no enhancement with PE was observed when a construct containing the N-terminal activation domain of CBP (amino acids 1–460) was used, indicating that this effect was specific to the C-terminal activation domain (Fig. 1). The construct containing the C-terminal activation domain was, therefore, used in our subsequent mechanistic experiments. These experiments demonstrate therefore that the hypertrophic agent PE is able to enhance the transcriptional stimulating ability of CBP in cardiac cells acting via the C terminus of CBP. In view of this and the much weaker or no effect noted with UCN or CT-1, we decided to analyze the effect of PE. Initially to confirm that this effect was mediated via PE-mediated activation of α-adrenergic receptors, we used the α-adrenergic antagonist prazosin and, for comparison, the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (27Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In these experiments (Fig.2), prazosin blocked the effect of PE on CBP-mediated transcriptional activation, whereas propranolol had no effect, confirming that PE was acting via α-adrenergic receptor stimulation. To investigate the mechanisms mediating the effect of PE, the experiments were repeated in the presence or absence of the inhibitors PD, which specifically inhibits the activity of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway, and SB, which inhibits the activity of the p38 MAPK pathway. In these experiments (Fig. 3) the up-regulation of CBP activity by PE was unaffected by addition of SB, indicating that it does not involve the p38 MAPK pathway. In contrast, addition of PD resulted in a significant fall in the basal activity produced by the CBP and p300 constructs in the absence of PE and prevented any stimulatory effect of PE on this transcriptional activity. This suggests therefore that in cardiac cells the ability of PE to stimulate the transcriptional activity of CBP involves the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. As expected, Western blotting with an antibody specific for active phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK showed a clear activation of both p42 and p44 by PE. Moreover, this effect was not observed when PE and PD were added together (Fig. 4). It has previously been shown that activation of p42/p44 MAPK in cardiac myocytes requires activation of protein kinase C but not protein kinase A (27Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To test this in our system, we examined the effect of the PKC inhibitor H-7 or the PKA inhibitor H-89 on the ability of PE to activate CBP. As indicated in Fig. 3B, H-7 was indeed able to block activation by PE whereas H-89 had no effect, confirming the role of PKC. To confirm our experiments with the chemical inhibitor PD, we used a dominant negative mutant of the p42 MAPK enzyme that contains a single amino acid substitution replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine and acts as a dominant negative mutant. In these experiments (Fig.5A) transfection of an expression vector encoding this mutant was able to block the ability of PE to enhance CBP transcriptional activity, whereas transfection of a control expression vector lacking any insert failed to produce this effect. This therefore confirms our conclusion that CBP is activated by PE via the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. Interestingly, transfection of a plasmid encoding wild type p42 resulted in enhanced transcription activating ability of CBP, which was of similar extent to that produced by PE and which was not further enhanced by the addition of PE. This provides further evidence that PE acts via this pathway and hence does not further stimulate transcription in the presence of active p42 MAPK. In agreement with this, a plasmid (SS/DD) encoding a constitutively active form of MEK-1, the upstream activator of p42/p44 MAPK, was also able to stimulate the activity of the CBP construct in the absence of PE (Fig.5B). Interestingly, this stimulation was blocked by the PKC inhibitor H-7, suggesting that PKC may be downstream of MEK-1 in the pathway by which PE stimulates CBP. In our previous experiments (26Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that the ability of NGF to stimulate the transcription activating ability of CBP was also dependent on the p42/p44 MAPK pathway and was observed with constructs containing two small independent regions at the C terminus of CBP. To determine whether a similar effect could be observed in the case of PE, we transfected a wide variety of constructs containing different N-terminal and C-terminal regions of CBP linked to the Gal 4 DNA binding domain and analyzed their response to PE. In these experiments (Fig. 6) a strong response to PE of over 5-fold was observed with the construct containing the region of CBP from amino acids 1961 through 2039, and smaller responses of approximately 2-fold were observed with other C-terminal regions. This suggests that multiple regions at the C terminus of CBP can mediate the response to PE, but that a single short region produces the strongest effect. To determine whether this short region showed a similar dependence on the p42/p44 MAPK pathway for its transcriptional activation by PE, we carried out experiments in which the effect of PE on this region was assayed in the presence or absence of PD or of the dominant negative p42 MAPK pathway. In these experiments (Fig.7) the strong up-regulation of transcription activity by PE was prevented by the addition either of PD or of the dominant negative p42 MAPK construct, and the activity of this region was enhanced by the construct encoding wild type p42. Hence, as with the entire C terminus the effect of PE on this small region of the CBP factor requires the activity of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. Evidently, all our experiments investigating the effect of PE on CBP use Gal4/CBP fusion proteins, and this approach has been criticized, because of the artificial nature of the constructs used (21Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To confirm our results, we therefore used a mutant form of the CREB transcription factor, which has been altered so that it constitutively binds CBP without the need for phosphorylation of serine 133 of CREB (21Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, any effect of a specific agent when this mutant is used cannot reflect enhanced recruitment of CBP via phosphorylation of CREB. When a target promoter containing a CREB-binding cAMP-response element (CRE) was co-transfected into cardiac myocytes with this mutant form of CREB, transcription was stimulated by PE (Fig.8) consistent with PE targeting the transcriptional activity of CBP under conditions where any effect on its recruitment is eliminated. To further extend these studies, we wished to test the role of CBP in the activation of a natural promoter by PE. To do this we used the promoter of the atrial naturetic factor (ANF) gene, which is known to be activated during cardiac hypertrophy and to be stimulated by PE (22Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lee R.T. Bloch K.D. Pfeffer J.M. Pfeffer M.A. Neer E.J. Seidman C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The activation of this promoter by PE was abolished by co-transfection of a construct expressing full-length CBP in an antisense orientation (Fig.9A). As expected, the antisense CBP construct also inhibited the response of the SS-CRE promoter to cAMP, indicating that it was able to prevent a well characterized effect of CBP (Fig. 9B). Hence, the role of CBP in the PE response can be demonstrated on a natural promoter by inhibiting endogenous CBP providing further evidence that it is not dependent on the use of Gal4-CBP constructs. In view of the close relationship of CBP and p300, we wished to determine whether PE could also affect the ability of p300 to stimulate transcription. To do this we used constructs in which different regions of p300 had been linked to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (18Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In these experiments (Fig.10) a small non-statistically significant effect of PE was observed with constructs containing the C-terminal activation domain of p300 (amino acids 1737–2414 or 1945–2414), which is homologous to that found at the same position in CBP (for review see Refs. 3Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 29Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the strongest stimulation by PE, which was comparable to that observed with full-length p300, was observed with the N-terminal activation domain of p300 (amino acids 1–743) even though no effect of PE was observed with the homologous region of CBP (compare Figs. 1 and 10). Despite this distinction, activation of the N-terminal domain of p300 by PE was mediated via p42/p44 MAPK activation, because it was blocked by PD (Fig.11A) and by the dominant negative mutant of p42 MAPK as well as being activated by overexpression of wild type p42 (Fig. 11B). As in the case of CBP, the role of p300 in the response to PE could be demonstrated with a natural promoter. Thus, a dominant negative mutant of p300 (lacking amino acids 348–412) was able to block the activation of the ANF promoter by PE (Fig. 12) in a similar manner to that observed with the antisense CBP construct. Considerable evidence suggests that activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is critical for the hypertrophic response of cardiac cells. Thus, for example, stimuli that induce hypertrophy such as mechanical load and angiotensin II have been shown to induce activation of this pathway (30Yamazaki T. Tobe K. Hoh E. Maemura K. Kaida T. Komuro I. Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12069-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that overexpression of a constitutively active form of MEK1 (which is an upstream activator of the p42/p44 MAPK enzymes) in transgenic mice results in compensated cardiac hypertrophy providing direct evidence that activation of this pathway can induce a hypertrophic response (32De Bueno O.F. Windt L.J. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Jones S.P. Lefer D.J. Peng C.-F. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the case of PE, initial studies demonstrated that treatment of cardiac cells with this factor was associated with activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway (27Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, such activation appears to be necessary for the hypertrophic response induced by PE. Thus, it has been shown that down-regulation of the p42/p44 MAPK enzymes using an antisense approach inhibits the PE-induced hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes (34Glennon P.E. Kaddoura S. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and similar results were subsequently obtained using chemical inhibitors to block activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in response to PE (35Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Yue T.-L. Gu J.-L. Wang C. Reith A.D. Lee J.C. Mirabile R.C. Kreutz R. Wang Y. Maleeff B. Parsons A.A. Ohlstein E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37895-37901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These data indicate therefore that PE can activate the p42/p44 MAPK pathway and that activation of this pathway plays a key role in its ability to induce the hypertrophic response. The data presented here add a new aspect to this by indicating that PE can stimulate the transcriptional activation ability of CBP and p300 and that this effect is dependent upon its ability to activate the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. To examine such effects on CBP or p300 in the absence of any effect on their recruitment to the DNA, we used constructs in which different regions of CBP or p300 have been linked to the DNA binding domain of Gal4. Although this approach has been extensively used by ourselves and others (17Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it has been criticized (21Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here, we have independently confirmed our results using a mutant form of CREB, which constitutively recruits CBP (21Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This again allows effects on CBP to be studied in the absence of recruitment effects and has been used to show that some effects observed on Gal4/CBP chimeras cannot be reproduced with this system (21Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have used an antisense CBP construct to block the effect of PE on a natural target promoter, that of the ANF gene. Hence, in our case, the effect of PE has been demonstrated using three distinct systems, two of which rely on endogenous CBP rather than Gal4/CBP constructs. Interestingly, a dominant negative mutant of p300 was also able to block activation of the ANF promoter by PE indicating that the role of p300 in the PE response could also be demonstrated by inhibiting endogenous p300. It is possible that the ability to block the PE response of the ANF promoter by blocking either CBP or p300 reflects distinct functions for these two factors in the stimulation of the promoter, with inhibition of either factor therefore blocking the response. It is more likely, however, that this effect reflects a dependence of the response on the maintenance of the normal total level of functional CBP and p300. Hence, inhibition of either factor reduces the total level of these two closely related factors and therefore inhibits the response. This effect has been observed, for example, in knockout mice where CBP/p300 double-heterozygote animals show a similar lethal phenotype to that observed with the homozygous knockout of either factor alone (for review see Ref.39Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, other hypertrophic agents such as UCN and CT-1 did not induce significantly increased activity of CBP. Both these agents have been shown to activate the p42/p44 MAPK pathway (40Brar B.K. Jonassen A.K. Stephanou A.S. Santilli G. Railson J.E. Knight R.A. Yellon D.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 51: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, unlike the case of PE, inhibition of p42/p44 MAPK activation does not affect the ability of UCN or CT-1 to induce hypertrophy (14Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1997; 98: 346-352Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar,42Brar B.K. Stephanou A. Liao Z. O'Leary R.M. Pennica D. Yellon D.M. Latchman D.S. Cardiovasc.

Hence the ability of PE to induce strong enhancement of the transcriptional activation ability of CBP and p300 via the p42/p44 MAPK pathway correlates with the essential role of this pathway in its ability to induce hypertrophy. These findings suggest therefore the possibility that enhanced transcriptional activity of CBP and p300 may be involved in the induction of hypertrophy by PE. Interestingly, a number of factors involved in the hypertrophic response such as AP-1 and the STAT factors have been shown to associate with CBP and p300 (12Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Mascareno E. Dhar M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Cell Biol. 1998; 95: 5590-5594Google Scholar). Recent studies of the activation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) gene expression by PE have shown that the transcription factor GATA-4 is phosphorylated by the p42/p44 MAPK pathway following PE treatment and plays a critical role in the activation of ET-1 gene expression, which is required for hypertrophy (43Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CBP enhances the activation of BNP by GATA-4 and YYI (44Bhalla S.S. Robitaille L. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11439-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) whereas p300 associates with GATA-4 and inhibition of p300 activity by overexpression of E1A prevents GATA-4 stimulation of ET-1 activity (45Morimoto T. Kakita T. Wada H. Hasegawa K. Abstracts of the American Heart Association Annual Meeting, Abstr. 1060. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD2000Google Scholar). It is likely therefore that CBP and p300 play a critical role in the process of cardiac hypertrophy and, in particular, in its induction by PE. Initial studies of the CBP/CREB system showed that signaling pathways produced phosphorylation of the CREB factor leading to the recruitment of CBP to the DNA and transcriptional activation (1Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Studies of this type led to the idea that DNA-bound transcription factors such as CREB represented the primary targets for signaling pathways that induce transcriptional activation with co-activators such as CBP and p300, which in turn recognize the consequences of these signaling pathways acting on the DNA-bound transcription factors rather than being targets themselves for such signaling pathways. A variety of recent data, however, suggests that CBP and p300 themselves are targets for specific signaling pathways. Thus, for example, in our previous work (26Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that NGF was able to enhance the ability of CBP-Gal 4 fusion proteins to activate transcription and that this effect was dependent upon the ability of NGF to activate the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. Similar activation of CBP by calcium-stimulated signaling pathways has been observed in neuronal cells (37Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 38Hu S.-C. Chrivia J. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 46Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The work presented here extends these studies to show that activation, of p42/p44 MAPK in cardiac cells by PE, similarly results in an enhancement of the transcriptional activation ability of CBP and p300. This indicates that the activity of CBP can be directly targeted by specific signaling pathways in cardiac as well as neuronal cells and identifies PE as an agent able to produce this effect. Moreover, it suggests that, during the hypertrophic response, CBP and p300 are not simply passive partners being recruited to the DNA via phosphorylation of DNA-bound factors such as GATA4. Rather they represent targets for these signaling pathways and will induce enhanced transcriptional activation following PE treatment. Interestingly, the predominant effect of PE involves the C-terminal domain of CBP and the N-terminal domain of p300 even though these regions are non-homologous to one another (for review see Refs. 3Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 29Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal region of p300 was only weakly activated by PE whereas PE had no effect at all on the activity of the N-terminal region of CBP. Hence, the same signaling pathway can target two different regions of these closely related molecules to enhance their transcriptional activating ability. It is likely that the enhanced transcriptional activating ability of p300 and CBP is mediated via phosphorylation induced by the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. Evidently, the putative phosphorylation sites targeted by the p42/p44 MAPK pathway are likely to be located at the N terminus of p300 whose activity is enhanced by PE (this report) and at the C terminus of CBP whose activity is enhanced by NGF (26Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and by PE (this report). Interestingly, the region of CBP from 1961 to 2039, which mediates the strongest response to PE was also identified as one of two regions at the C terminus of CBP involved in its response to NGF (26Liu Y.Z. Chrivia J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32400-32407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) whereas amino acids 2009 to 2117 were found to be able to mediate activation by calcium in neuronal cells (38Hu S.-C. Chrivia J. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because the PE and NGF effects involve p42/p44 MAPK (26 and this report), whereas the calcium effect requires other kinases such as CaM kinase II and CaM kinase IV (38Hu S.-C. Chrivia J. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), this indicates that a small C-terminal region of CBP acts as a target for different kinase-activated signaling pathways. Although the exact sites for phosphorylation by these pathways remain to be identified, it has been demonstrated that p42/p44 MAPK can phosphorylate CBP in vitro on at least two sites within the region 1891–2441 (47Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated that CBP and p42/p44 MAPK enzymes directly associated with one another and that CBP becomes phosphorylated following NGF treatment (48Liu Y.Z Thomas N.S.B. Latchman D.S. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of p300, serine 89 within the N-terminal region targeted by PE has been shown to be phosphorylated by PKC (49Yuan L.W. Gambee J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40946-40951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In view of the potential involvement of PKC in the effects we observe, it will be of interest to determine whether this residue is targeted by PE and is responsible for its stimulatory effect. Although the precise sites that are phosphorylated on CBP and p300 following PE treatment remain to be identified, it is already clear that the transcriptional activating ability of these critical co-activators is stimulated by the hypertrophic agent PE in a p42/p44 MAPK-dependent manner in cardiac cells and that this is effect is likely to play an important role in the ability of PE to induce specific gene expression during the hypertrophic response."

Alanine mutations of membrane-proximal basic amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin identified arginine 357 as a critical residue for both ezrin and moesin interaction. Finally, BIAcore affinity analysis confirmed that N-terminal moesin interacts specifically with L-selectin cytoplasmic tail, with relatively high affinity (Kd≈40 nm). Based on these findings, although moesin and ezrin bind to a similar region of the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin, moesin binding is dependent on PKC activation, which suggests that ezrin and moesin are regulated differently in lymphocytes.

L-selectin is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein composed of a C-type calcium-dependent lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, two short consensus repeats, a membrane-proximal cleavage site, a transmembrane domain, and a short 17-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (1Gonzalez-Amaro R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 389-429PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). L-selectin is directly involved in the primary steps of leukocyte recruitment, where leukocytes tether and subsequently roll along mucin-like endothelial cell ligands (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6382) Google Scholar). Regulation of L-selectin expression is poorly understood; however, recent studies on the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin have implicated its role in regulating cell surface levels and localization on the cell membrane. The membrane-proximal and membrane-distal domains of L-selectin cytoplasmic tail have been reported to independently regulate L-selectin surface expression and function, respectively. The membrane-distal region of L-selectin has been shown to interact with the cytoskeletal protein, α-actinin (3Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Truncation of the C-terminal 11 amino acids of human L-selectin (known as LΔcyto) abrogates interaction with α-actinin. Although carbohydrate ligand binding remains unaltered, 300.1 pre-B cells expressing LΔcyto cannot adhere to high endothelial venules (derived from in vitro frozen section assays) or roll along L-selectin ligands (4Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Antibody- or ligand-mediated cross-linking of wild-type L-selectin, but not LΔcyto, promotes associations with the actin-based cytoskeleton, demonstrating that the membrane-distal domain of L-selectin mediates interactions with the cytoskeleton and plays a role in L-selectin avidity (5Evans S.S. Schleider D.M. Bowman L.A. Francis M.L. Kansas G.S. Black J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3615-3624PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis clearly demonstrates normal distribution of LΔcyto on microvilli of 300.1 pre-B cells (3Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting that the remaining membrane-proximal six amino acids (RRLKKG) are involved in anchoring L-selectin to microvilli. Cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain-swap experiments between L-selectin and CD31/CD44 reveal that localization of L-selectin on microvilli plays an important role in the initial capture (or tethering) of leukocytes to the endothelium (6Stein J.V. Cheng G. Stockton B.M. Fors B.P. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which is the first characterized stage of the “multistep adhesion cascade” (7Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin has been shown to interact with calmodulin, in a calcium-independent manner, and point mutations L358E and K359E (in L-selectin) prevent this interaction (8Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In resting human neutrophils, constitutive association of calmodulin with the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin is thought to alter the topology of the extracellular membrane-proximal cleavage domain of L-selectin, rendering it resistant to proteolysis. PMA1 stimulation, or incubation with calmodulin antagonists, releases calmodulin from L-selectin cytoplasmic tail and results in L-selectin shedding. Therefore, the release of calmodulin from L-selectin is assumed to alter the topology of the cleavage domain, permitting it to be cleaved. Calmodulin antagonists have been shown more recently to induce the shedding of other transmembrane proteins, suggesting that this mechanism is not specific to L-selectin (9Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have developed a method for analyzing intracellular proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin (Fig. 1B). By using affinity purification chromatography, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin interacts with members of the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) family of proteins (10Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Ezrin can associate constitutively with L-selectin tail, whereas moesin only associates with L-selectin tail under PMA-stimulating conditions. Alanine mutation analysis of the membrane-proximal region of L-selectin cytoplasmic tail demonstrates that R357A is critical for both moesin and ezrin interaction. In addition we show that treatment of lymphocytes with the PKC inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, significantly reduces the interaction of moesin, but not ezrin, with L-selectin. Finally, we demonstrate specific interactions between purified N-terminal moesin and L-selectin tail to be specific, as measured by BIAcore affinity analysis (Kd ≈40 nm). We discuss the differing roles that ezrin and moesin may have with respect to L-selectin surface expression/localization on naive lymphocytes. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Naive murine lymphocytes were isolated as described previously (11Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes were obtained from pooled axilliary, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes or spleens of 6–8-week-old BALB/c mice. The following antibodies were obtained from the various suppliers indicated in parentheses: anti-human HMG-1 (rabbit polyclonal, PharMingen); anti-human moesin and ezrin (goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-human EF-1α (mouse monoclonal, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-murine CPERM (mouse monoclonal 297S, kind gift from S. Tsukita, Kyoto Japan); anti-bovine calmodulin (mouse monoclonal, kind gift from D. Sacks). All protein samples were resolved using 4–12% gradient Bis-Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX/Invitrogen). Further resolution of ezrin and moesin was performed using 3–8% gradient Tris acetate gels (NOVEX/Invitrogen). Polyacrylamide gels were either transferred to nitrocellulose or silver-stained (Bio-Rad silver stain Plus kit), according to manufacturers' instructions. All proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P) at a constant 25 V for approximately 1 h, using a pre-prepared transfer buffer system that contained 10% methanol (NOVEX/Invitrogen). Calmodulin was detected following pretreatment of PVDF membrane with PBS containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (to chemically cross-link transferred proteins to the membrane) for 45 min, prior to incubation with blocking solution (5% (w/v) powdered milk (Marvel) in PBS). Incubation with ∼1 μg/ml primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) was performed routinely at room temperature for 1 h (or overnight at 4 °C) with gentle agitation. Anti-CPERM antibodies were used neat as tissue culture supernatant. Prior to the addition of secondary antibody, filters were washed 2 times for 7 min in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, followed by a single wash for 7 min in PBS. To reduce background signal, all filters were blocked in blocking solution for a further 45 min prior to the addition of secondary antibody. All secondary antibodies for Western blotting (i.e. rabbit anti-goat, rabbit anti-mouse, and swine anti-rabbit) were purchased from DAKO as horseradish peroxidase conjugates and used routinely at a dilution of 1:3,000 in blocking solution and used at similar incubation conditions as for primary antibody. Filters were washed as described above prior to addition of ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Peptides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Peptide purity was assessed by mass spectroscopy and high pressure liquid chromatography.

Peptides were coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose, and coupling efficiency was monitored according the manufacturers' protocol. Columns were washed in calcium and magnesium free PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) NaN3 and stored at 4 °C. Depending on the affinity purification procedure, scrambled, mutated, and affinity columns were stacked on top of each other (see Fig.1B). This construction minimized the time required for cell extracts flowing through the scrambled peptide column to be transferred to either mutant and (or) affinity columns. For every affinity purification procedure ∼2 × 108 lymphocytes were harvested and washed in ice-cold calcium and magnesium-free PBS. Cells were resuspended in 15 ml of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum, in the absence or presence of 500 nm PMA, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (with occasional swirling to prevent cells from settling). In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 1 μm of the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 for 20 min at 37 °C, prior to stimulation with PMA. After stimulation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using 5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); 150 mm NaCl; 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; 1 mm sodium pervanadate; 2 mm EDTA) in CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were left on ice for 30 min and subsequently clarified by micro-centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 10 times using buffer A (25 mmHEPES (pH 7.4); 50 mm NaCl; 5% (v/v) glycerol; 1 mm sodium pervanadate; 2 mm EDTA containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture). The entire diluted supernatant was applied to the column construct (pre-equilibrated in buffer A) (Fig. 1B, step 1), followed by a thorough wash of at least 10 column volumes of buffer A (Fig. 1B, step 2). The scrambled peptide column and the affinity column were subsequently detached from one another. The affinity column was subjected to sequential increasing concentrations of NaCl in buffer A (i.e. 100, 250, and 500 mm and 1 mNaCl) (Fig. 1B, step 3). Any bound material remaining on the affinity column after the 1 m NaCl wash was eluted using an ethanolamine-based elution buffer (0.5 m NaCl; 0.5m ethanolamine (pH 8.0)). The scrambled and mutant peptide columns were subjected to a single elution step using ethanolamine-based elution buffer (Fig. 1B, step 4). All elutions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained for analysis. Protein bands of interest were excised for mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 1B, step 5). Following silver stain analysis, fractions containing proteins of interest were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie (Invitrogen/NOVEX), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein bands of interest were identified, excised with a sterile razor, and placed in a 0.5-ml Treff (Scotlab) tube. SDS and Coomassie were removed by incubating the gel slice three times with 500 μl of wash buffer containing 200 mmammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 50% (v/v) acetonitrile for 30 min at 30 °C. The gel slice was reduced with 200 μl of reducing buffer (20 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm ABC, 50% (v/v) acetonitrile) for 1 h at 30 °C and then washed four times in wash buffer. Cystines were subsequently alkylated with freshly prepared alkylating buffer (5 mm iodoacetamide, 200 mmABC, 50% (v/v) acetonitrile) for 20 min in darkness at room temperature. The gel slice was washed four times in a modified wash buffer (50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 20 mm ABC) and then incubated in 500 μl of neat acetonitrile for 15 min. The gel slice was subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge, re-hydrated in 30 μl of 5 mm ABC containing ∼60 ng of methylated porcine trypsin (Promega), and allowed to digest for 16–24 h at 37 °C. Digested samples were subsequently analyzed by MALDI-mass spectrometry. Human N-terminal moesin (residues 1–297) was overexpressed and purified according to a protocol published previously (12Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) (The expression plasmid encoding the open reading frame of N-terminal moesin was a kind gift from A. Bretscher, Cornell, NY). Association and dissociation reactions involving N-terminal moesin and biotinylated L-selectin cytoplasmic tail were studied by surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The general principles of this method were reviewed recently (13Szabo A. Stolz L. Granzow R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To avoid covalent inactivation of essential side chains, the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin was synthesized as a biotinylated peptide (conjugated to Arg-356) and immobilized on the sensor surface using a non-covalent sandwich system. The peptide was coupled via the N-terminal biotin moiety to streptavidin-coated sensorchip (sensorchip SA BIAcore AB). For the analysis of the interaction between the N-terminal domain of human moesin and immobilized L-selectin peptide, purified N-terminal moesin was injected at different concentrations in 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 (HSP-P, BIAcore AB) with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The binding andKd values were analyzed by monitoring the optical resonance from the injection start time. The dissociation reaction was monitored while flushing the L-selectin-moesin complex with HBS-P. Data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation software (version 3.0.2). Regeneration of the sensor surface was achieved by injection of 100 mm NaOH followed by subsequent re-loading of the sensor surface with 1 μm biotinylated L-selectin cytoplasmic tail. All measurements were monitored at 25 °C. A peptide comprising the short cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin was synthesized and used to construct an affinity column (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 17 amino acids that constitute the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin contribute to an overall pI of ∼10.2 (Fig.1B). Producing an affinity column with relatively high basicity could prove problematic because of nonspecific interactions with proteins derived from cell extracts. This problem was circumvented by synthesizing a peptide (with a similar pI) containing a scrambled sequence of the cytoplasmic tail (chosen randomly) and immobilizing it onto a similar support (TableI). The scrambled peptide column was assembled on top of the affinity column and served to pre-clear extracts of any nonspecifically interacting proteins (Fig. 1B, step 1). By using this approach, unbound material leaving the scrambled column immediately entered the affinity column, minimizing the requirement for transfer steps. After the cell extract had passed through the column construct, a thorough low salt wash (at least 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mm NaCl) followed to remove any unbound material (Fig. 1B, step 2). Prior to fractionation the column construct was unassembled and the affinity column was subjected to a stepwise non-linear series of elutions with increasing NaCl concentration (i.e. 100, 250, and 500 mm and 1 m NaCl), followed by a final elution step, using an ethanolamine-based elution buffer to remove any bound material (Fig. 1B, step 3). The entire contents of the scrambled peptide column was subjected to a single elution step using an ethanolamine-based elution buffer (Fig. 1B, step 4). Eluates from the affinity column were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Extracts derived from untreated and PMA-stimulated lymphocytes were individually fractionated on the affinity column. The elution profile of each fractionated extract was determined by SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining (Fig. 2). This procedure facilitated identification of proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin primarily under PMA-stimulating conditions. The majority of proteins in extracts from untreated and PMA-activated lymphocytes eluted from the affinity column at 100 mm NaCl, giving rise to ∼15 protein bands (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3–5). Fractionation of extracts derived from untreated or PMA-stimulated lymphocytes (overall) produced different elution profiles. The most obvious differences between the two fractionated extracts occurred at the 250 and 500 mm NaCl elutions. At these NaCl concentrations, some protein bands were visible only in extracts fractionated from PMA-stimulated lymphocytes (Fig. 2 compareA and B, lanes 8–10 and 13–15). Differences in elution profiles were also observed at 1 mNaCl (Fig. 2, compare A and B, lanes 17–20). Because our main interest was to identify proteins from PMA-stimulated cells that associate with the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin, we focused on obtaining microsequences of proteins fractionated from lymphocytes that were stimulated with PMA. Fractions containing the protein bands of interest (Fig. 2B, see asterisks) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, identified with colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (NOVEX/Invitrogen), and excised for microsequencing by MALDI-mass spectrometry. Of the four proteins excised from colloidal Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels, amino acid sequences were obtained from three bands (see Table II). The proteins identified were moesin (Fig. 2B, lane 8, ∼70 kDa), Elongation Factor 1α (EF-1α) (Fig. 2B, lane 18, upper band, ∼52 kDa) and HMG-1 (Fig. 2B, lane 18, lower band, ∼30 kDa). Antibodies directed against the three proteins were used for immunoblotting and verified the identity of all three proteins and, in parallel, assessed whether they specifically bound to the affinity column or not (Fig. 3). Both moesin and HMG-1 eluted specifically from the affinity column, and not the scrambled peptide column, at 100 and 500 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 3A, upper and middle blots, compare lanes 1 and 3 with lane 6). EF-1α was shown to interact with the scrambled peptide column (Fig.3A, lower blot, lane 6) and was therefore considered to interact nonspecifically with the affinity column. Although we observe EF-1α eluting from the affinity column, immunoblotting clearly demonstrated a greater amount of this protein binding to the scrambled peptide column.Table IIAmino acid sequences derived from gel-purified, trypsin-digested fragments identified by MALDI mass spectroscopySize of proteinPeptides identifiedName of protein (GenBankTM accession number)30 kDaHPDASVNFSEFSKHMG-1 (L38477)PKIKGEHPGLSIGDVAKKLKEKYEKDIAAYRYYVTIIDAPGHRQLIVGVNKMDSTEPPYSQKR52 kDaIGGIGTVPVGREF-1α (M22432)RGNVAGDSKFAVRDMRSGYLAGDKLLPQRLNKDQWEERKAPDFVFYAPRRKPDTIEVQQMK70 kDaAQQELEEQTRRALELEQERMoesin (P26041)QEAEEAKEALLQASRKTQEQLASEMAELTARISQLEMARESEAVEWQQKDRSEEERTTEAEKNERALTSELANARDESKQRIDEFESM Open table in a new tab We next analyzed the same fractionated cell extracts to determine whether ezrin, another member of the ERM family of proteins, was interacting with the affinity column. Immunoblotting with anti-ezrin polyclonal antibody detected ezrin in the 100 mm NaCl fraction (Fig. 3B, upper blot, lane 1), and as with moesin, ezrin did not bind to the scrambled peptide column (Fig. 3B, upper blot, lane 6). These results indicate that both ezrin and moesin bound specifically to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Under slightly altered wash conditions (i.e. using 100 mm NaCl instead of using 50 mm NaCl), we found calmodulin associating with the affinity column and eluting at 250 mm NaCl (Fig. 3B, lower blot, lane 2). The relatively acidic nature of calmodulin meant that at 50 mmNaCl wash conditions calmodulin would associate with the scrambled peptide column (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that this approach has led to the identification of novel L-selectin tail-interacting proteins, as well as validating this approach by identifying a protein previously reported to interact with L-selectin tail (i.e. calmodulin). Comparison of anti-moesin and anti-ezrin immunoblots of extracts fractionated from untreated and PMA-stimulated lymphocytes revealed that moesin interacts with L-selectin only under PMA-stimulating conditions (Fig.4A), whereas ezrin interacts with L-selectin tail irrespective of pre-treatment of lymphocytes with PMA (Fig. 4B). We next assessed whether Ro 31-8220, an inhibitor of all known PKC isoforms, could inhibit PMA-induced recruitment of moesin to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Lymphocytes were pre-treated with or without 1 μm Ro 31-8220 and subsequently stimulated with PMA as before. Extracts fractionated from each lymphocyte preparation revealed that Ro 31-8220 considerably reduced the interaction of moesin with L-selectin cytoplasmic tail affinity column (Fig. 4C, upper blot, compare lane 1 with 2). The interaction of ezrin with the affinity column, however, remained unaffected by this treatment (Fig. 4C, bottom blot, compare lane 1with 2). These results indicate that the PMA-induced recruitment of moesin to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin is dependent on PKC activity. Interestingly, immunoblotting of crude extracts of lymphocytes using the monoclonal antibody 297S (which detects the presence of C-terminal threonine-phosphorylated ERM proteins) detected no difference in the levels of phosphorylated ezrin or moesin in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 1 and 3). The lysis conditions used in these procedures liberated all detectable activated moesin and ezrin into the soluble, rather than the insoluble, fraction of the lysates (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 1 and 3 withlanes 2 and 4). Activated ERM proteins are generally considered to interact with type I integral membrane proteins via their N terminus and with F-actin via their C terminus, which is how they cross-link cell adhesion molecules with the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton (14Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Ezrin, radixin, and moesin become activated upon phosphorylation of C-terminal threonine 567, 564, and 558, respectively, which disrupts intramolecular associations between the N and C termini (15Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 297S, which is specific for the C-terminally phosphorylated ERM proteins (CPERM), detected an enrichment of CPERM in fractions specifically eluting from the affinity column (Fig.5C, lane 4). This demonstrates that some, if not all, of the ERM proteins interacting with the affinity column are in an activated, phosphorylated form. During occasional purification procedures, we detected ezrin binding to the scrambled peptide column (Fig. 5A, lane 3). This form of ezrin was not detected by monoclonal antibody 297S (Fig. 5C, lane 3) and is therefore considered to be inactivated and is interacting nonspecifically with the scrambled peptide column. It is interesting to note that the relative amount of CPERM proteins present in lymphocyte extracts (or the “load”) is negligible with respect to the total amount of moesin and ezrin detected by the anti-moesin and anti-ezrin polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 5, compare lane 1 inA–C), clearly demonstrating that the affinity column can specifically enrich for CPERM proteins. Previous reports (16Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 17Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr.

L-selectin carries three sets of di-basic residues along its cytoplasmic tail. Single alanine mutations were introduced into one of the two basic residues along the cytoplasmic tail to address whether such mutations would impair ERM binding. Peptides were synthesized and used to construct alanine mutant peptide affinity columns (Table I). The mutant peptide column was introduced between the scrambled peptide column and the affinity column (Fig. 6). Proteins unab"

In an erg7 deletion strain or in wild-type cells treated with an inhibitor of oxidosqualene cyclase, the substrate of Erg7p, oxidosqualene, accumulated mostly in lipid particles. Storage in lipid particles of this intermediate produced in excess may provide a possibility to exclude this membrane-perturbing component from other organelles.

OSCs may be regarded as phylogenetic markers insofar as they form a variety of cyclic triterpenoids in plants, whereas their only cyclization product in nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, yeast, and other fungi is lanosterol (1Nes W.D. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1990; 24: 283-327Google Scholar). During the last 20 years studies on OSCs focused on several biochemical, molecular biological, and cell biological aspects. Hundreds of inhibitors were synthesized and tested for their effect on this enzyme (2Abe I. Rohmer M. Prestwich G.D. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2189-2206Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 3Corey E.J.

During these studies, however, the important question as to the subcellular localization of this enzyme was surprisingly ignored. This aspect is essential because localization of enzymes involved in the sterol biosynthetic pathway may contribute greatly to the understanding of coordination and regulation of this pathway and of sterol traffic among organelles (16Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Leber R. Zinser E. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys.

Subcellular localization of yeast OSC, which is encoded by theERG7 gene, stimulated our interest not only because Erg7p is one of the most important enzymes of sterol biosynthesis that has not been localized so far, but also because targeting of the protein to its proper cellular environment may help to explain its mode of action and to design new inhibitors of OSC. As an example, we reported recently that some OSC inhibitors that undergo metabolic transformations in the yeast exhibit different effects because of different subcellular distribution of target proteins and metabolizing enzymes, respectively (20Milla P. Viola F. Ceruti M. Rocco F. Cattel L. Balliano G. Lipids. 1999; 34: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The question as to the subcellular localization of yeast OSC was first addressed more than 30 years ago by Shechter et al. (21Shechter I. Sweat F.W. Bloch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 220: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These authors compared properties of yeast and mammalian enzymes and concluded that the yeast enzyme was soluble, whereas the mammalian enzyme was bound to microsomes. Properties of the apparently soluble yeast OSC, however, turned out to be quite different from “true” soluble cytosolic enzymes. These results suggested that yeast OSC may be a particle-bound enzyme that becomes soluble during cell disruption and fractionation of the homogenate. Experiments in our laboratory (22Balliano G. Viola F. Ceruti M. Cattel L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed that the occurrence of the two forms (soluble and membrane-bound) of OSC in yeast, which can be distinguished by their sedimentation properties, largely depends on the protocol used for the preparation of the microsomal fraction. A clue to the understanding of yeast OSC localization came from the biochemical characterization of the so-called lipid particles, a subcellular compartment highly enriched in triacylglycerols and steryl esters which harbors several enzymes of lipid metabolism (17Leber R. Zinser E. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these proteins, two enzymes of ergosterol biosynthesis, namely sterol Δ24-methyltransferase (Erg6p) and squalene epoxidase (Erg1p), were identified as typical lipid particle proteins. It has to be mentioned, however, that Erg6p is almost exclusively localized to this compartment, whereas Erg1p partitioned between lipid particles and the endoplasmic reticulum (24Leber R. Landl K. Zinser E. Ahorn H. Spök A. Kohlwein S.D. Turnowsky F. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recently, the yeast OSC, Erg7p, was also identified as a lipid particle protein by a mass spectrometry approach (23Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the distribution of the protein between lipid particles and the endoplasmic reticulum or other organelles was not determined. In the present study, we provide biochemical and cell biological evidence supporting the localization of OSC in yeast lipid particles. We demonstrate by enzyme measurements and immunological methods that only marginal amounts of OSC are present in the endoplasmic reticulum. The consequence of an erg7 deletion and the inhibition of OSC by the inhibitor U14266A (3β-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)-androst-5-en-17-one) (25Field R.B. Holmlund C.E. Whittaker N.F. Lipids. 1979; 14: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) on the subcellular deposition of the precursors oxidosqualene and dioxidosqualene as well as the effect of anaerobiosis on the subcellular distribution of Erg7p are discussed. The wild-type strainSaccharomyces cerevisiae FL100 (MATa ura3–1 trp1–1) and the erg7 mutant (MATa erg7 ura3–1 trp1–1) were kindly provided by F. Karst, Colmar, France (26Servouse M. Karst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were grown aerobically or anaerobically to the early stationary phase at 30 °C in YPD medium containing 1% yeast extract (Oxoid, England), 2% peptone (Oxoid), 2% glucose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 20 μg/ml ergosterol added from a stock solution of 2 mg/ml ergosterol in ethanol:Tween 80 (1:1; v/v). Inocula (0.5 ml/100 ml of culture medium) were made from precultures grown aerobically or anaerobically for 18 or 22 h, respectively. For the construction of Erg7p-GFP, the GFP(S65T) sequence and the selectable marker kanMX6 were inserted into the chromosomal DNA of the coding region of ERG7 at the N terminus and the C terminus, respectively. The fragment for insertion was amplified by PCR with the plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6-PGAL1-GFP(S65T) for N-terminal, or with the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 for C-terminal tagging (27Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Primers used for amplification are shown in Fig.2. PCR was performed as described previously (23Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR fragments were ethanol precipitated, and 400–700 ng was used for transformation of FY1679 applying the high efficiency lithium acetate transformation protocol (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 43: 177-200Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown in YPD at 30 °C overnight and then spread on YPD plates containing 200 mg of G418 (Invitrogen) per liter. After incubation for 2–3 days, large colonies were transferred to fresh YPD-G418 plates. Clones that yielded colonies were considered as positive transformants and checked further for correct integration of the respective fusion cassette. Correct replacement was verified by analytical PCR of whole yeast cell extracts (29Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ERG7-GFP-expressing cells were harvested after 16 h (YPD), immobilized under agarose, and stained with the lipophilic dye Nile Red as described (30Kohlwein S.D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 511-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS4d confocal microscope. GFP fluorescence was monitored at 488 nm excitation by using a 525/50 band pass filter. Nile Red fluorescence was excited by the 547 nm line of the Ar/Kr laser, attenuated to 5% of total output power, and detected using a 590 nm long pass filter. Transmission images were recorded using Nomarski (differential interference contrast) optics. Because of the weak GFP signal, cells were scanned sequentially for GFP and Nile Red fluorescence. Images were edited using Adobe Photoshop. Lipid particles and vacuoles were obtained at high purity by the method of Leberet al. (19Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast cells were grown in rich medium (YPD) to the late exponential phase and converted to spheroplasts (31Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were washed twice with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 1.2 m sorbitol and then homogenized in breaking buffer containing 10 mm MES/Tris (pH 6.9), 12% Ficoll 400, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 0.5 g of cell wet weight/ml. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was overlaid with breaking buffer and centrifuged for 1 h at 28,000 rpm (100,000 × g) in an SW-28 swing-out rotor. The floating layer containing lipid particles and vacuoles was collected from the top of the gradient and suspended in breaking buffer. Lipid particles were separated from vacuoles by two additional sequential flotation steps in (i) 10 mm MES/Tris (pH 6.9), 8% Ficoll 400, 0.2 mm EDTA, and (ii) 10 mm MES/Tris (pH 6.9), 0.25 m sorbitol, 0.2 mm EDTA at 28,000 × g for 30 min, each. The floating layer from the top of the last gradient contains lipid particles at high purity; vacuoles are obtained in the pellet at all three flotation steps. For the preparation of cytosol and microsomal fractions, yeast cells were grown in YPD and converted to spheroplasts as described by Daumet al. (31Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were homogenized (19Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was subjected to sequential centrifugations at 30,000 × g for 30 min, 40,000 × gfor 30 min, and 100,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting pellets were used as 30,000 × g, 40,000 ×g, and 100,000 × g microsomes, respectively. To obtain highly purified 30,000 × gmicrosomes the respective pellet was subjected to two additional washing steps by suspending in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) and centrifugation at 30,000 × g. The particle-free 100,000 × g supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. Protein was quantitated by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins of microsomal and cytosolic fractions were precipitated from the aqueous phase with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) and solubilized in 0.1% SDS and 0.1m NaOH. Prior to protein analysis of the lipid particle fraction, samples were delipidated. Nonpolar lipids were extracted with 2 volumes of diethyl ether, the organic phase was withdrawn, residual diethyl ether was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and proteins were precipitated from the extracted aqueous phase as described above. Western blot analysis with antisera against Erg7p and marker proteins was performed as described by Leber et al. (24Leber R. Landl K. Zinser E. Ahorn H. Spök A. Kohlwein S.D. Turnowsky F. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To raise an antiserum against yeast OSC, a rabbit was immunized with a peptide of 31,123 Da (Erg7p-459–730) corresponding to the 271 C-terminal amino acids of S. cerevisiae Erg7p. The peptide was overexpressed in Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells (Stratagene) transformed with a pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen, Germany) containing 879 bp of the ERG7 gene. For this purpose, the ERG7 gene ofS. cerevisiae strain S288C (MATα) (33Johnston M. Andrews S. Brinkman R. Cooper J. Ding H. Dover J. Du Z. Favello A. Fulton L. Gattung S. Geisel C. Kirsten J.

Wohldman P. Waterston R. Wilson R. Vaudin M. Science. 1994; 265: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR starting from the chromosomal yeast DNA purified according to the method of Davis et al. (34Davis R.W. Thomas M. Cameron J. St. John T.P. Scherer S. Padgett R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). We used a sense primer 31 bases long, complementary to the antisense strand 42 bases upstream the start codon and an antisense primer 29 bases long, complementary to the sense strand 45 bases downstream the stop codon, including the recognition sequences for HindIII andSpeI (underlined): sense primer: 5′-CCC AAGCTT ACCTTACCAATAACCGTCGCCC antisense primer: 5′-GG ACTAGT TAGTTTCTAATTGTTGCAGCC. In a 50-μl PCR 100 ng of chromosomal DNA was amplified with 0.5 unit of DNA Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 30 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 3.5 min at 72 °C, each) in the presence of 100 pmol of each primer, 10 nmol of each dNTP, and 2 mm Mg2+. The resulting 2,300-bp PCR product was digested with HindIII and SpeI and ligated into the plasmid pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The recombinant plasmid was used to transformE. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). The sequence of the cloned gene was determined at BioPark Bioindustry Park Canavese (Colleretto Giacosa, Italy) using the same primers as for PCR; it matched unambiguously the published ERG7 gene (GenBank accession number U23488). To amplify the C-terminal part of the ERG7 gene coding for the peptide Erg7p-459–730 in the expression vector pQE-30, theERG7 DNA was transferred from pBluescript II KS to a pUC-18 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by cutting both vectors using restriction endonucleases KpnI and XbaI. The DNA fragment corresponding to Erg7p-459–730 was excised from pUC-18 withPstI with cleavage sites in the internal sequence ofERG7 at position 1,373 and in the sequence of the polylinker of pUC-18. The resulting 879-bp fragment was ligated into the pQE-30 polylinker with PstI, in-frame with the ATG and the His6 tag of the vector. The recombinant vectors were used to transform E. coli XL1-blue cells, and the transformed clones were screened for the presence of the gene in the correct orientation by cutting asymmetrically with KpnI andSpeI. Clones containing the DNA in the correct orientation showed, as expected, two bands of 0.9 and 3.5 kilobase pairs. The peptide Erg7p-459–730 was expressed in E. coli XL1-blue cells grown on Terrific Broth (TB) containing 0.1 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.0125 μg/ml tetracycline, and 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as inducer. The protein was found in inclusion bodies and solubilized with 1% SDS in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8). The protein was purified further after binding to a Co2+ Talon metal chelating resin (CLONTECH) by elution with 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 0.1% SDS and 250 mmimidazole. Prior to immunization the protein was purified on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and the band with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa was eluted from gel slices with an electroeluter model 422 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This isolate was used to immunize rabbits by standard procedures (31Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral lipids of yeast homogenate and isolated subcellular fractions were extracted according to Folchet al. (35Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of ergosteryl esters and triacylglycerols was carried out as described by Leber et al. (24Leber R. Landl K. Zinser E. Ahorn H. Spök A. Kohlwein S.D. Turnowsky F. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Nonsaponifiable lipids of homogenate, 30,000 × gwashed microsomes, and lipid particles were prepared by hydrolyzing 0.5 ml of total lipid extract (containing ∼400, 100, and 40 μg of lipid, respectively) with 10% (w/v) methanolic KOH (1 ml) for 1 h at 80 °C. Nonsaponified lipids were extracted three times with 1 ml of diethyl ether. The extracts were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were dissolved in 1 ml of methanol and analyzed on an HPLC Merck Hitachi with a C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm; Lichrospher 100 RP-18, Merck), equipped with a Shimatzu CBM-10A. The column was eluted with methanol at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 210 nm. Sterols and sterol precursors were quantified by comparison with standards. Sterol biosynthesis in whole yeast cells was followed by incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids as described before (36Balliano G. Viola F. Ceruti M. Cattel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed cells (10–20 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 5 ml of 25 mmKH2PO4/NaOH buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml Tween 80, incubated with 2 μCi of [2-14C]acetate (50 mCi/mm) and shaken for 2 h at 30 °C. Then, cells were harvested by centrifugation and saponified in 50% ethanol containing 15% KOH for 2 h at 80 °C. Nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of light petroleum and separated on silica gel plates (Merck) usingn-hexane/ethyl acetate (85:15; v/v) as developing solvent and authentic standards of ergosterol, lanosterol, dioxidosqualene, oxidosqualene, and squalene. Radioactivity in separated bands was measured using a System 2000 Imaging Scanner (Packard). 3S-2,3-[14C]Oxidosqualene was prepared by incubating a pig liver S10 preparation with [14C]mevalonate as described by Popjak (37Popjak G. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 15: 393-454Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.1 mm of the OSC inhibitor U14266A (25Field R.B. Holmlund C.E. Whittaker N.F. Lipids. 1979; 14: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After 3 h of incubation the reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of 15% KOH in methanol, and lipids were saponified at 80 °C for 30 min. The nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted three times with 2 volumes of light petroleum and separated by two-step TLC on silica gel plates (20 × 20 cm, 0.5-mm layer). The plates were first developed in light petroleum to a height of about 10 cm above the origin. After drying, the plates were developed to 15 cm above the origin with n-hexane/ethyl acetate (90:10; v/v). Radioactive bands corresponding to 2,3-oxidosqualene were scraped off and eluted with dichloromethane. The extract was brought to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and 3S-2,3-[14C]oxidosqualene was dissolved in benzene. OSC activity in total yeast homogenate (6 mg of protein/ml), lipid particles (0.03 mg of protein/ml), microsomes (0.5 mg of protein/ml), and cytosol (5 mg of protein/ml) was determined as described elsewhere (36Balliano G. Viola F. Ceruti M. Cattel L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ml of the different subcellular fractions were incubated with 3S-2,3-[14C]oxidosqualene (5,000 cpm, 25 μm) in the presence of Tween 80 (0.2 mg/ml) and Triton X-100 (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm MES/Tris (pH 6.9) and 0.2 mm EDTA for 30 min at 35 °C under vigorous shaking in a water bath. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 15% KOH in methanol, and lipids were saponified at 80 °C for 30 min. The nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of light petroleum and separated on silica gel plates using dichloromethane as developing solvent. Radioactivity in 2,3-oxidosqualene and lanosterol was counted using a System 2000 Imaging Scanner (Packard). The amount of product formed was used for the calculation of the enzyme activity. Distribution of OSC activity among subcellular fractions was determined by measuring the enzyme activity in different compartments isolated from a wild-type yeast strain cultivated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Results summarized in TableI revealed that OSC activity was 230-fold enriched in lipid particles prepared from aerobically grown cells. This high enrichment over the homogenate resembles typical markers of lipid particles such as steryl esters, triacylglycerols, and Erg6p (TableII). An almost 100-fold enrichment of OSC activity was also observed in lipid particles prepared from anaerobically grown cells. Among the microsomal fractions recovered at multiple g-forces, only 30,000 × gmicrosomes, the fraction with the highest enrichment of “classical” microsomal markers (38Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), contained minor activity (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2317754217,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is caused by the dysfunction of mismatch repair genes, such as hMLH1, hMSH2. Loss of hMLH1 expression and methylation of CpG sites in hMLH1 promoter are frequently present in sporadic colorectal cancer with MSI. In this study, by transient transfection assay with constructs containing different lengths of hMLH1 promoter and a luciferase reporter gene, we located a proximal region of hMLH1 promoter, which plays a main role in regulating the gene. The fact that luciferase activities were high in all host cell lines regardless of their hMLH1 expression levels indicates that the transcription machinery is intact even in non-expressing cells. When hMLH1 promoter was in vitro methylated before transfection, the luciferase activities in the transfectants were significantly reduced. This observation indicates that methylation causes the inhibition of hMLH1 promoter activity. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we identified a CCAAT box in this region, which specifically bound transcription factor CBF. Mutations in CCAAT box not only inhibited its binding to CBF factor, but also reduced its ability to drive the expression of luciferase gene. The role of CBF in activating transcription was further substantiated by inhibition of promoter activity with a plasmid expressing a dominant negative CBF-B mutant. Methylation at a CpG site two base pairs upstream of the CCAAT box inhibited the binding of CBF to CCAAT box. We conclude that methylation of an adjacent CpG site inhibits binding of the CBF transcription to the corresponding CCAAT box, and is one of the causes of hMLH1 gene silencing in colon cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2328429450,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases involved in the transduction of a variety of signals. There is increasing evidence to indicate that specific PKC isoforms are involved in the regulation of distinct cellular processes. In glioma cells, PKC α was found to be a critical regulator of proliferation and cell cycle progression, while PKC ε was found to regulate adhesion and migration. Herein, we report that specific PKC isoforms are able to differentially activate extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) in distinct cellular locations: while PKC α induces the activation of nuclear ERK, PKC ε induces the activation of ERK at focal adhesions. Inhibition of the ERK pathway completely abolished the PKC-induced integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Thus, we present the first evidence that PKC ε is able to activate ERK at focal adhesions to mediate glioma cell adhesion and motility, providing a molecular mechanism to explain the different biological functions of PKC α and ε in glioma cells."

Here we investigated the effect of MC on apoptosis. MC induced apoptosis, preceded by serine 15 phosphorylation and accumulation of p53. MC failed to cause apoptosis in p53-deficient MG63 cells, whereas ectopic expression of p53 in MG63 cells restored the response to MC. Therefore, MC-induced apoptosis was dependent on p53. MC also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at 16–24 h. Accumulation of p53 and p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 was not changed by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK or overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK at 8 h after MC treatment, whereas the accumulation was suppressed at 24 h. These results suggest that MC induces accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 via a p38 MAPK-independent (early) and p38 MAPK-dependent (late) pathway. SB203580 repressed MC-induced apoptosis. MC induced p38 MAPK activation in p53 expressing cells but not in p53-deficient cells, indicating that the p38 MAPK activation was dependent on early p53 activation.

Cancer Res. 1968; 28: 727-738PubMed Google Scholar). Although most of the biological effects of MC and other PAHs are considered to be mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (1Nebert D.W. Puga A. Vasiliou V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 685: 624-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism of carcinogenesis by MC is still unknown. AhR is a ligand-activated member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) family of transcription factors that regulates multiple genes including members of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP1A1) family through a xenobiotic responsive element. The induced CYP1A1 acts on PAHs to produce reactive oxygen species and metabolizes PAHs to genotoxic (DNA damaging) metabolites (4Safe S.H. Pharmacol.

These reactive oxygen species and the metabolites can cause oxidative DNA damage and form adducts with DNA, starting the mutagenic chain of events responsible for tumor initiation (1Nebert D.W.

Phosphorylation of p53, especially at serine 15, represents an early cellular response to a variety of genotoxic stresses and promotes both accumulation and functional activation of p53 (12Shieh S.Y.

Transfected cells were cultured in fresh medium containing 1 mg/ml (HepG2) or 800 μg/ml (MG63) G418. The stable transfectants were obtained by selection for G418 resistance and confirmed by Western blotting analysis. To avoid clonal variation, three randomly selected clones were tested.

Briefly, HepG2 cells were exposed to MC for 24 h and then lysed with lysis buffer 1. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-p53 (DO-1) or control antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). The eluates from the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting using a specific antibody against phosphorylated p38 MAPK. HepG2 cells were transfected with SRE3-luc containing three tandem repeats of serum response element (SRE) and a control backbone vector, Fos-40-luc reporter plasmids (0.05 μg) (24Masutani H. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Ait-Si-Ali S. Groisman R. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6. Transfected cells were serum-starved for 48 h, pretreated with or without PD98059, and then stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Luciferase gene expression, normalized by Renilla luciferase activity, was analyzed using an assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with a luminometer. Serum response through SRE of the c-fos gene was reported to be mostly dependent on ERK (25Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We first studied the effect of a representative PAH, MC, on cell growth and viability in HepG2 cells. Proliferation of HepG2 cells was completely suppressed by exposure to 10 μm MC (Fig.1A). MC decreased cell viability to almost 25% of that of the control by 72 h (Fig.1B). We next tested whether the cell death induced by MC was due to apoptosis, using PI staining to quantitate the number of cells with a subdiploid DNA content. As shown in Fig.2A, at 72 h after MC treatment, a significant number of cells (85.3%) had entered into the terminal stages of apoptosis, localizing in the subdiploid DNA peak. Because caspase-3(-like) protease plays an essential role in executing apoptosis, we then examined the caspase-3(-like) protease activity in HepG2 cells cultured with various concentrations of MC. As shown in Fig. 2B, 5 μm MC caused a substantial induction of caspase-3(-like) protease activity in HepG2 cells. Pretreatment with Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, decreased the number of apoptotic cells by about 60–70% (Fig.2C). Because MC is known as a high affinity ligand of AhR, we next tested whether AhR is involved in the process, using ANF, an antagonistic ligand of AhR (26Wilhelmsson A. Whitelaw M.L. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19028-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, B andC, the MC-induced apoptosis and caspase-3(-like) protease activation were suppressed by cotreatment with ANF, whereas ANF itself did not cause apoptosis (data not shown). Because genotoxic reagents such as CDDP induce p53 activation (8Ueno M. Masutani H. Arai R.J. Yamauchi A. Hirota K. Sakai T. Inamoto T. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. Nikaido T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35809-35815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and MC was reported to cause DNA damage, we then examined the level of p53. The p53 protein level was augmented at 1 h after treatment with MC (Fig.3A, middle panel). Because the phosphorylation of the serine 15 residue of p53 is known as a very early step in the activation of p53 (12Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), we assessed the amount of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 after MC treatment, using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated serine 15 residue of p53. The phosphorylation at serine 15 was induced at about 1 h after treatment with MC and peaked at 24 h (Fig.3A, upper panel). The kinetics of the induction coincided with the accumulation of p53, consistent with a previous report (12Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, induction of both p53 and p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 after MC treatment was inhibited by the addition of ANF, whereas ANF itself did not change the level of p53. We next analyzed whether the accumulation of p53 induced by MC is due to decreased p53 protein degradation using a calpain/proteasome inhibitor, LLnL, which stabilizes p53 protein by inhibiting its degradation by the proteasome (27Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from LLnL-treated cells demonstrated equivalent amounts of p53 protein. In contrast, MC induced an increase in the level of phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (Fig. 3A, upper panel), whereas there was barely any detectable p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 in lysates from untreated cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that phosphorylation at serine 15 results in the accumulation of p53 via inhibition of the protein degradation. To determine whether p53 mediates the apoptosis evoked by MC, we used p53-deficient human osteocarcinoma MG63 cells to examine the effect of MC on cell growth and viability. MC did not suppress cell growth and viability (Fig. 4,A and B). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type p53 caused a significant induction of caspase-3(-like) protease activity (Fig. 5A) and apoptosis (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Induction of caspase-3(-like) protease activity and apoptosis by MC in p53-deficient MG63 cells transfected with wild type p53.A, overexpression of p53-induced caspase-3 activation by MC in MG63 cells.

B, overexpression of p53-induced apoptosis after MC treatment. MG63 cells, stably transfected with indicated vectors, were treated with 10 μm MC for 48 h, stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry to quantitate cells with a subdiploid DNA content. This is representative of two independent experiments. The results are shown as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate cultures. *, p< 0.05 when compared with MG63-pCMV-neo.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because p53 is phosphorylated by various protein kinases, we first monitored the activation of three members of the MAPK family, p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK, by Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognize the activated phosphorylated forms of the three kinases. As shown in Fig.6, we found that exposure to MC induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK but not JNK. MC-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK occurred at about 16 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 6, A and D). As shown in Fig.6B, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was inhibited by the addition of ANF. As expected, ANF itself did not change the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. We then tested the involvement of p38 MAPK in the activation of p53 by MC. Pretreatment with 1–10 μm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, markedly inhibited the accumulation of p53 and the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (Fig. 7A) at 24 h. Next, whether p38 MAPK is involved in the early p53 activation, we pretreated with up to 20 μm SB203580. Pretreatment with 20 μm SB203580 failed to suppress the accumulation of either p53 or p53 phosphorylated at 8 h after MC treatment (Fig.7B), suggesting that MC induces accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 via p38 MAPK-independent (early) and p38 MAPK-dependent (late) pathways. To further test the role of p38 MAPK in p53 phosphorylation, we used a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK (p38(AGF)). Overexpression of p38(AGF) specifically blocked anisomycin and MC-induced p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 7C). Overexpression of p38(AGF) abrogated the accumulation of both p53 and phosphorylated p53 at 24 h following MC treatment (Fig. 7D). In addition, p38 MAPK was co-precipitated with p53 in response to MC treatment (Fig.7E). Pretreatment with 500 nm wortmannin, which effectively inhibits DNA-PK or ATM, inhibited p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 at 4 h after 10–30 μm etoposide (positive control) and 2–6 h after 10 μm MC treatment (Fig.7F). We then asked whether p38 MAPK regulates p53-mediated apoptosis. We analyzed caspase-3 activation by Western blot analysis and the number of apoptotic cells by flow cytometric analysis. Pretreatment with 1–10 μm SB203580 inhibited MC-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis by about 40–70% (Fig. 8,A and B). Pretreatment with PD98059 did not inhibit MC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8C), whereas pretreatment with PD98059 clearly inhibited serum-induced c-fos gene activation (positive control). As in Fig. 2, B andC, caspase-3 activation was inhibited by the addition of ANF (Fig. 8A). These results collectively showed that p38 MAPK plays a role in MC-induced p53 activation and apoptosis. We then asked whether the p38 MAPK activation was dependent on early p53 activation. We examined activation of p38 MAPK in the MG63 cells transfected with either wild type p53 (MG63-wtp53) or control expression vectors (MG63-pCMV-neo). As shown in Fig.9, MC induced activation of p38 MAPK in the MG63 cells expressing wild type p53 but not in control cells. We here first demonstrated the mechanism of apoptosis by MC. We showed that MC treatment leads to apoptosis preceded by the activation of caspase-3(-like) protease in HepG2 cells. This is quite similar to the action of another genotoxic PAH, benzo(a)pyrene (28Salas V.M. Burchiel S.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MC also caused p53 induction and phosphorylation at the serine 15 residue of p53 in HepG2 cells. In the p53-deficient cell line MG63, MC did not induce apoptosis (Fig. 4). In contrast, MC induced caspase-3(-like) protease activity and apoptosis in MG63 cells transfected with wild type p53 (Fig. 5). Hence, these results suggest that p53 mediates MC-induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Phosphorylation of serine 15, a key phosphorylation target during the p53 activation process, is critical for p53-dependent transactivation and represents an early cellular response to a variety of genotoxic stresses (12Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Mutation at serine 15 impaired the apoptotic activity of p53 (29Unger T. Sionov R.V. Moallem E. Yee C.L. Howley P.M. Oren M. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggesting a pivotal role for serine 15 phosphorylation in the induction of apoptosis. Previous reports showed that MC induces DNA single strand breaks in CHO-KI cells (30Park J.K. Lee J.S. Lee H.H. Choi I.S. Park S.D. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and DNA rearrangements in Balb/c 3T3 cells (31Honma M. Mizusawa H. Sasaki K. Hayashi M. Ohno T. Tanaka N. Sofuni T. Mutat. Res. 1994; 304: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Metabolites of PAHs such as MC and benzo(a)pyrene are capable of binding to cellular macromolecules including DNA (32Harris C.C. Genta V.M. Frank A.L. Kaufman D.G. Barrett L.A. McDowell E.M. Trump B.F. Nature. 1974; 252: 68-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 activation and phosphorylation of serine 15 seems to be a downstream response to MC-induced DNA damage. The present results show that p53 plays important roles in host defense against MC-induced genotoxicity by mediating the induction of apoptosis. p53-deficient mice are extremely susceptible to radiation-induced tumorigenesis that is associated with the accumulation of DNA damage (33Kemp C.J. Wheldon T. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). MC itself inactivates the p53 gene in Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts (34Albor A. Flessate D.M. Soussi T. Notario V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4502-4507PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of p53 suppressor function by mutation is a universal step in the development of human cancer (35Harris C.C. Environ. Health. Perspect. 1996; 3: 435-439Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the potent carcinogenicity of MC is partly due to the induction of p53 mutation by its potent genotoxicity, resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage, which should have been eliminated by p53. In this study, we found that MC induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK but not JNK. Pretreatment with a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, but not PD98059 significantly inhibited the accumulation of p53 at 24 h after MC treatment and apoptosis (Fig. 7, Band C). In addition, expression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK suppressed p53 accumulation, suggesting a role for p38 MAPK in MC-induced p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Interestingly, we showed that p38 MAPK was present in the imunoprecipitates obtained with anti-p53 antibody from MC-treated HepG2 cells, consistent with a previous report of direct interaction between p53 and p38 MAPK (36She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidences suggest a role of p38 MAPK in p53 phosphorylation. p38 MAPK phosphorylates p53 at serine 33 (37, 38) in response to UV or osmotic shock. In this study, SB203580 or expression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK also suppressed accumulation of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 at 24 h after MC treatment, indicating the role of p38 MAPK in serine 15 phosphorylation. However, it is controversial whether p38 MAPK directly phosphorylates serine 15. A recent report showed that p38 MAPK phosphorylates p53 at serine 15 in response to UV irradiation (36She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) or resveratrol (39She Q.B. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Chen N.Y. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1604-1610PubMed Google Scholar). Another report showed that p38 MAPK is involved in integrated N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 including serine 15, although p38 MAPK does not directly phosphorylate serine 15 (40). Serine 15 can be phosphorylatedin vitro by DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR, and in vivo in response to IR and UV radiation (12Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). In our study, suppression of the accumulation of p53 and p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 by SB203580 or expression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK (data not shown) was not detected at 8 h after MC treatment (Fig. 7B). However, pretreatment with a selective inhibitor of DNA-PK or ATM, wortmannin, inhibited the p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 by MC at 2–6 h (Fig. 7F). These results indicate that MC induces accumulation of p53 and phosphorylated p53 at serine 15 in a p38 MAPK-independent (early) and p38 MAPK-dependent (late) pathway. The mechanism of the serine 15 phosphorylation by p38 MAPK should be investigated further. Recently, p53 phosphorylation at serine 46 was reported to be important for UV- or radiation-induced apoptosis (41Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The role of p53 phosphorylation at serine 46 in MC-induced apoptosis needs to be analyzed. In addition, the mechanism of p38 MAPK activation is currently unknown. We investigated whether p38 activation is dependent on the early activation of p53, by examining p38 MAPK activation in the p53-deficient MG63 cells. MC did not activate p38 MAPK in p53-deficient MG63 cells, whereas it induced p38 MAPK activation in p53 overexpressing MG63 cells (Fig. 9). These results suggest the requirement of early p53 activation for p38 MAPK activation and the apoptosis, indicating a functional regulation (link) between p53 and p38 MAPK (Fig. 10). ANF, a competitive inhibitor of AhR (26Wilhelmsson A. Whitelaw M.L. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19028-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked 1) the MC-induced apoptosis, 2) the caspase-3(-like) protease activity, and 3) the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. Therefore, MC-induced apoptosis appears to be dependent on a functional AhR. Oxidative stress and oxidized metabolites generated by AhR-regulated drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 (CYP1A1) may be responsible for p38 MAPK activation. MC-induced p38 MAPK activation and p53 accumulation were suppressed in thioredoxin overexpressed cells. 2Y.-W. Kwon, J. Yodoi, and H. Masutani, unpublished observations. Thioredoxin may scavenge excess reactive oxygen species. Alternatively, thioredoxin may be involved in a negative feedback mechanism of p38 MAPK activation (42Hashimoto S. Matsumoto K. Gon Y. Furuichi S. Maruoka S. Takeshita I. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Horie T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further work is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanism leading to the activation of p38 MAPK and serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 after MC treatment. It is also reported that thioredoxin directly binds and inhibits the activity of apoptosis signal-regulated protein kinase (ASK-1) (43Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to speculate that oxidative stress or oxidized metabolites activate the upstream signaling molecules such as ASK-1 (Fig. 10). To further investigate the protective mechanism against MC-induced oxidative stress and carcinogenesis, we are currently analyzing the effect of MC in thioredoxin transgenic mice and the upstream pathway to p38 MAPK activation.

In particular, UQ is a crucial electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Recently, it was shown thatclk-1 mutants of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans do not synthesize UQ9 but instead accumulate demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ9), a biosynthetic precursor of UQ9 (the subscript refers to the length of the isoprenoid side chain). DMQ9 is capable of carrying out the function of UQ9 in the respiratory chain, as demonstrated by the functional competence of mitochondria isolated from clk-1mutants, and the ability of DMQ9 to act as a co-factor for respiratory enzymes in vitro. However, despite the presence of functional mitochondria, clk-1 mutant worms fail to complete development when feeding on bacteria that do not produce UQ8. Here we show that clk-1 mutants cannot grow on bacteria producing only DMQ8 and that wormcoq-3 mutants, which produce neither UQ9 nor DMQ9, arrest development even on bacteria producing UQ8. These results indicate that UQ is required for nematode development at mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial sites and that DMQ cannot functionally replace UQ at those non-mitochondrial sites.

Benard C. Hekimi S. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). clk-1 encodes a 187-amino acid protein that is localized in mitochondria (5Felkai S. Ewbank J.J. Lemieux J. Labbe J.C. Brown G.G. Hekimi S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and that is homologous to the yeast protein Coq7p, which has been shown to be required for UQ biosynthesis (6Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). clk-1 has also been shown to be necessary for UQ biosynthesis in worms (7Jonassen T. Larsen P.L.

Indeed, UQ9 is entirely absent from mitochondria purified from worm and mouse clk-1 mutants (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J.

Instead, these mitochondria accumulate demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ9), which is an intermediate in the synthesis of UQ9 (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K.

Consistently, recent evidence suggests that clk-1 encodes a DMQ hydroxylase (10Stenmark P. Grunler J. Mattsson J. Sindelar P.J. Nordlund P. Berthold D.A. J. Biol.

Similarly, DMQ9 is capable of sustaining electron transport in eukaryotic mitochondria, as the function of purified mitochondria (5Felkai S. Ewbank J.J. Lemieux J. Labbe J.C. Brown G.G. Hekimi S.

In addition, synthetic DMQ2 has been shown to function in vitro as a co-factor for electron transport from worm complex I and, albeit more poorly, from complex II (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A.

Finally, it was found that in the absence of any exogenous UQ the oxygen consumption of mouse embryonic stem cells with a deleted mclk1 gene is only reduced by 35% (9Levavasseur F. Miyadera H.

Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although, dietary UQ is generally not capable of reaching mitochondria (reviewed in Ref. 1Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), this has been interpreted to suggest that DMQ9 is insufficient for normal mitochondrial function and that dietary bacterial UQ8 can reach the mitochondria and function there in trace amounts (7Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).To resolve these issues, we have generated a strain carrying a knockout mutation in the nematode gene coq-3, which encodes a methyltransferase required for UQ synthesis, and whose inactivation does not lead to DMQ accumulation in yeast (12Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find thatcoq-3 worms are not able to complete development even on bacteria that contain UQ8. These results indicate that 1) dietary UQ cannot complement a UQ deficiency in the absence of DMQ, 2) the growth impairment of clk-1 mutants without a dietary supply of UQ is due to a non-mitochondrial requirement for UQ, and 3) DMQ cannot functionally replace UQ at the non-mitochondrial sites.DISCUSSIONOur results suggest that UQ is necessary for C. elegansgrowth and development at different subcellular locations, in particular it appears to be necessary at sites distinct from the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fig. 3). Indeed, for its respiratory function in the mitochondria, endogenous DMQ9 can functionally replace endogenous UQ9, as indicated by the observation that clk-1 mutant mitochondria do not appear to contain UQ9 but are functionally competent (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). On the other hand, coq-3mutants, in which a failure to manufacture UQ9 and DMQ9 is expected, display a much more severe phenotype thanclk-1 mutants. Thus, at some still unknown site or sites, distinct from the respiratory chain, endogenous DMQ9, or dietary DMQ8, cannot functionally replace endogenous UQ9, while dietary UQ8 can. In fact,clk-1 mutants, which have functional mitochondria and make DMQ9, cannot develop and grow without dietary UQ8, even in the presence of dietary DMQ8 fromubiF bacteria.This model is consistent with the findings by numerous studies on UQ uptake and metabolism in other systems, such as rodents (1Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). What has been found is that dietary UQ appears to be taken up only poorly (2–3% of the initially ingested ubiquinone), and the majority is then distributed to the plasma membrane, the lysosomes, and the Golgi, with only minute quantities, if any at all, appearing in the mitochondria. Given that every cell endogenously produces UQ, it is possible that no active uptake system exists to assimilate this rather complex lipid.Our studies clarify the roles of endogenous and dietary UQ in the worm's biology. Also, we demonstrate for the first time the functional importance of UQ at non-mitochondrial locations for an organism's viability. Action of dietary UQ at non-mitochondrial sites could underlie the beneficial effects of dietary UQ for patients with mitochondrial diseases (1Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For example, UQ has been found to participate in reactions that regulate the redox state of the cell at the plasma membrane (28Morre D.M. Lenaz G. Morre D.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1513-1521PubMed Google Scholar). Disease states that arise from deficient mitochondria are often found to increase cellular oxidative stress, and dietary UQ could stimulate a protective function at the plasma membrane (28Morre D.M. Lenaz G. Morre D.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1513-1521PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in bacteria, quinones have recently been found to act as the primary signal of the redox state of the cell (29Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). InE. coli, UQ negatively modulates the phosphorylation status and function of ArcB, an important global regulator of gene expression. The eventual discovery of additional roles for UQ in eukaryotes, and in particular as a signaling cue, will help to better understand the pleiotropic effects of mutations in genes that affect UQ, includingclk-1.Finally, we note that the coq-3 and clk-1 mutant strains provide genetic models to identify compounds that could selectively replace ubiquinone at the mitochondria and/or at non-mitochondrial sites. The development of such bio-available ubiquinone mimetics could be of great medical interest. Ubiquinone (UQ)1 is a prenylated benzoquinone that is an essential co-factor in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where its function is best characterized. UQ is also found in many other locations in the cell, such as the lysosome and Golgi membranes, as well as in nuclear and plasma membranes (1Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The exact role of UQ at these extramitochondrial sites is being actively explored (e.g. Refs. 2Santos-Ocana C. Villalba J.M. Cordoba F. Padilla S. Crane F.L. Clarke C.F. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 3Gille L. Nohl H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The gene clk-1 of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans affects many physiological rates, including embryonic and post-embryonic development, rhythmic behaviors, reproduction, and life span (4Branicky R. Benard C. Hekimi S. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). clk-1 encodes a 187-amino acid protein that is localized in mitochondria (5Felkai S. Ewbank J.J. Lemieux J. Labbe J.C. Brown G.G. Hekimi S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and that is homologous to the yeast protein Coq7p, which has been shown to be required for UQ biosynthesis (6Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). clk-1 has also been shown to be necessary for UQ biosynthesis in worms (7Jonassen T. Larsen P.L.

Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Indeed, UQ9 is entirely absent from mitochondria purified from worm and mouse clk-1 mutants (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol.

Instead, these mitochondria accumulate demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ9), which is an intermediate in the synthesis of UQ9 (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M. Kita K.

Consistently, recent evidence suggests that clk-1 encodes a DMQ hydroxylase (10Stenmark P. Grunler J. Mattsson J. Sindelar P.J. Nordlund P. Berthold D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33297-33300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which converts DMQ to ubiquinol. In Escherichia coli, DMQ8 is able to sustain respiration in isolated membranes although at a lower rate than Q8 (11Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, DMQ9 is capable of sustaining electron transport in eukaryotic mitochondria, as the function of purified mitochondria (5Felkai S. Ewbank J.J. Lemieux J. Labbe J.C. Brown G.G. Hekimi S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial enzymes (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), from clk-1 worm mutants appears to be almost intact compared with the wild type. In addition, synthetic DMQ2 has been shown to function in vitro as a co-factor for electron transport from worm complex I and, albeit more poorly, from complex II (8Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A.

Finally, it was found that in the absence of any exogenous UQ the oxygen consumption of mouse embryonic stem cells with a deleted mclk1 gene is only reduced by 35% (9Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that clk-1 mutants are unable to grow on a UQ-deficient bacterial strain despite the presence and the activity of DMQ9 (7Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although, dietary UQ is generally not capable of reaching mitochondria (reviewed in Ref. 1Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), this has been interpreted to suggest that DMQ9 is insufficient for normal mitochondrial function and that dietary bacterial UQ8 can reach the mitochondria and function there in trace amounts (7Jonassen T.

JKTBP proteins are composed of two RNA-binding domains arranged tandemly and a glycine- and tyrosine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain and are more closely related to hnRNP D/AUF1 and type A/B hnRNP/ABBP-1 and more distantly related to hnRNPs A1 and A2 (18Tsuchiya N.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are three isoforms of JKTBP, 1 and 2 (major forms) and 1Δ6 (a minor form), which are abundant in HeLa and HL-60 cells and in tissues, especially in brains and testes (18Tsuchiya N. Kamei D.

Nishina Y. Horiguchi H. Matsui M. Kamma H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recombinant JKTBP binds preferentially to poly(A) and poly(G) (18Tsuchiya N. Kamei D. Takano A. Matsui T. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and supposedly to an AU-rich element of the 3′-untranslated region of mRNA (21Doi A. Shiosaka T. Takaoka Y. Yanagisawa K. Fujita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This study reports that the predominant isoform JKTBP1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a pathway consisting of a 25-residue shuttling sequence and Trn-1 and of the interaction of the cytoplasmic shuttling JKTBP with mRNA. HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C as described (18Tsuchiya N. Kamei D. Takano A. Matsui T. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Balb/c 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum (Dainippon Pharmaceutical) and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For inhibition of transcription and protein synthesis, HeLa cells were cultured with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) or 100 μm5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; Calbiochem) for 3 h in the presence of 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) (5Piñol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Approximately 104 HeLa cells were seeded on 15-mm glass coverslips and grown for 1 day. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Mg2+- and Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min. After preincubation with Mg2+- and Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with 4000-fold diluted rabbit anti-GST-JKTBP1 serum in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C (19Kamei D. Tsuchiya N. Yamazaki M. Meguro H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 200-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-biotin conjugate (Wako Pure Chemicals) in the same buffer and with 500-fold diluted streptavidin-Cy3 conjugate (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature for each step. The nucleus was stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) in Mg2+- and Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. HeLa subcellular fractions were prepared as described (22Hel Z. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5579-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer by 20 strokes using a type A pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 760 × g at 4 °C for 3 min. The supernatant fluid was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl, 75 mm NaCl, 175 mm sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and sonicated in a Model UR-20P Handy Sonic (Tomy Seiko) at the maximum scale three times for 10-s periods. The resultant supernatant was used as the nuclear fraction. Proteins were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, Schleicher & Schüll). The membranes were incubated with 5000-fold diluted rabbit anti-GST-JKTBP1 serum at 4 °C overnight (19Kamei D. Tsuchiya N. Yamazaki M. Meguro H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bound IgG was detected using 20,000-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). Signals were developed using the ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The blots were reprobed successfully with 1000-fold diluted anti-hnRNP A1 monoclonal antibody 4B10 and anti-hnRNP C monoclonal antibody 4F4 (4Piñol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1991; 253: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Bound IgG was detected using 2500-fold diluted sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Signal intensity was measured in a Max Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). A pair of primers was designed for the 5′-end of the coding sequence of JKTBP1 (23 nucleotides, ATG GAG GAT ATG AAC GAG TAC AG) and the 3′-untranslated region sequence (TCA ATG TCG TCC TGC AAG ATG) linked with aSmaI linker at their 5′-ends. With the Titan One-tube reverse transcription-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 500 ng of HL-60 total RNA and 0.4 μm primers was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and then processed by PCR in 35 cycles. After agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR product, the minor band DNA (810 bp) was further amplified with the same pair of primers and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, cloned into pBluescript SK(−), and then sequenced. The sequence determined was identical to JKTBP1 except for deletion of nucleotides 773–943. The cDNA clone that compared with the JKTBP genomic sequence was identified as a variant lacking exon 6 and called JKTBP1Δ6 (19Kamei D. Tsuchiya N. Yamazaki M. Meguro H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The JKTBP whole coding regions of pGEX-4T-JKTBP2, pGEX-4T-JKTBP1, and pGEX-4T-JKTBP1Δ6 were subcloned into the pEGFP-C vector (CLONTECH) (19Kamei D. Tsuchiya N. Yamazaki M. Meguro H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants JKTBP-(227–341), JKTBP-(227–398), and JKTBP-(226–408) were prepared by PCR with pJKTBP as a template and a pair of primers that were designed for the amino- and carboxyl-terminal 5–7-amino acid sequences with an EcoRI linker attached at their 5′-ends. Numbering of amino acid residues was adopted from JKTBP2 (see Fig. 3). The amino-terminal deletion mutants JKTBP-(226–420), JKTBP-(323–420), JKTBP-(396–420), and JKTBP-(398–420) were prepared by PCR with pJKTBP as a template and a pair of primers that were designed for the amino-terminal 5–6-amino acid sequences with an EcoRI linker attached at the 5′-end and for the 3′-untranslated region sequence (CCGGGTCGACTCGTCCTGCAAG, JKTBP 3′-untranslated region primer; italics indicate the SalI linker sequence). All of the PCR products were inserted into the pEGFP-C-GST vector, which was prepared by inserting the GST gene portion (XhoI-EcoRI fragments) of pGEX-6Ps (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) into the pEGFP-C3 vector. Plasmids were purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.21-1.52Google Scholar). Various JKTBP deletion mutants, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP A1-(1–195)/UP1 were each expressed as a fusion protein with GST by culturing Escherichia coli BL21 cells carrying pGEX-6P2-JKTBP1, pGEX-4T-JKTBP deletion mutants, pGEX-6P2-hnRNP A1, and pGEX-6P3-UP1 with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 10 h at 25 °C. The cells were collected and suspended in buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, and 200 μg/ml lysozyme. The cell suspension was sonicated 15 times for 10-s periods and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was subjected to glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as described (18Tsuchiya N. Kamei D. Takano A. Matsui T. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Kamei D. Tsuchiya N. Yamazaki M. Meguro H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For removing a GST portion from a fusion protein, a preparation (1 μg of protein) was digested with 0.01 unit of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and the digest was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. HeLa cells (4 × 106 cells) suspended in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium were transfected with EGFP-JKTBP plasmids (50 μg) by electroporation (200 V, 1180-microfarad capacitance, and low ohm in a Cell-Porator, Invitrogen). About 1 × 105 cells were grown on a 15-mm glass coverslip, and the rest were grown for analysis of expression of EGFP-JKTBP fusion proteins. For in vivoimport assay, after 24 h, the subcellular distributions of EGFP-JKTBP fusion proteins were studied by fluorescence microscopy. Heterokaryon assay was performed as described by Cáceres et al. (26Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The above-cultured cells were overlaid with 8 × 104 NIH3T3 cells and cultured for 3 h. They were then fused by exposure to 100 μl of 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3400 (Polyscience) in RPMI 1640 medium for 2 min at 37 °C and, after washing, incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h in the presence of cycloheximide added to the culture 15 min before cell fusion. The cells were fixed and stained with 25 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) and studied by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescent signals and cell images recorded with a cooled CCD camera (SenSys 1400, Photometrics Ltd.) were pseudo-colored. Expression of EGFP-JKTBP fusion proteins was checked by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-GFP serum (CLONTECH). HeLa cells on a 15-mm coverslip were permeabilized by treatment with 40 μg/ml digitonin transport buffer for 5 min as described by Adam et al. (27Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The import reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 8 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 0.1 μmGST-JKTBP-(226–420) as an import substrate with or without 3 μm competitor, and 5 μl of 4× transport buffer (80 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 8 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm sodium acetate, 440 mm potassium acetate, and 4 mm EGTA) containing 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin was overlaid on the cells and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After the reaction, the cells were fixed and probed with 0.5 μg/ml diluted rabbit anti-GST IgG overnight at 4 °C, and then bound IgG was detected using goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-biotin conjugate and streptavidin-Cy3 conjugate as described above. Anti-GST IgG was prepared by GST-Sepharose affinity chromatography of anti-GST-peptidylarginine deiminase serum (28Nakashima K. Hagiwara T. Ishigami A. Nagata S. Asaga H. Kuramoto M. Senshu T.

Growing HeLa cells were harvested and disrupted in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 75 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) by sonication 15 times for 10-s periods; and after centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, the resultant supernatant was used to interact with immobilized JKTBP. GST-tagged JKTBP produced by E. coliin the extract was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (20-μl packed volume) by mixing at 4 °C for 1 h, and the beads were washed three times with buffer C containing 1 m NaCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol and twice with binding buffer without Nonidet P-40. The beads were mixed with HeLa cell extract (6 mg) in a total volume of 1.5 ml of binding buffer without Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 4 h and washed with binding buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and were analyzed by immunoblotting using 1000-fold diluted anti-transportin monoclonal antibody D45 (29Siomi M.C. Fromont M. Rain J.C. Wan L. Wang F. Legrain P. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4141-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking was performed as described by Piñol-Roma et al. (30Piñol-Roma S. Adam S.A. Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HeLa cells grown on a 10-cm dish were washed, immersed in 2 ml of cold Mg2+- and Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2and 0.5 mm MgCl2, and irradiated with UV light at 254 nm at a dose of 65 mJ/cm2. The cells were replaced in buffer A with 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmvanadyl adenosine, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Tween 40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The cells were scraped off and homogenized by four passages thorough a 25-gauze needle with a syringe. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, the resultant supernatant was brought to 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA and called the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was suspended in buffer B and 10 mm vanadyl adenosine, sonicated four times for 10-s periods, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was adjusted to 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA and called the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic and nuclear poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared by two repeats of oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography (0.18 g; Collaborative Research), and the precipitated RNAs were digested with a mixture of RNase A1 (25 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (0.25 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. The digests were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-JKTBP serum. For examination of whether the nuclear localization of JKTBP is perturbed by RNA synthesis inhibition, HeLa cells were treated with or without actinomycin D for 3 h in the presence of cycloheximide and stained with anti-JKTBP serum. As shown in Fig.1A, in the untreated cells, the JKTBP signal was mostly confined to the nucleus stained with DAPI (panel a), whereas in the treated cells, the JKTBP signal was found uniformly throughout the cells (panel b), indicating that RNA synthesis inhibition results in cytoplasmic accumulation of JKTBP. Next, we treated cells with a reversible inhibitor of RNA synthesis, DRB (Fig. 1B). Like actinomycin D, DRB also resulted in JKTBP accumulation in the cytoplasm (panels a and b). After removal of the drug by culturing cells at 37 °C for 1 h, the cytoplasmic JKTBP signal decreased, and the signal was found only in the nucleus, like that in the untreated cells, whereas at 4 °C, the cytoplasmic signal persisted (panels c and d). These results suggest that JKTBP shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. To further examine the two JKTBP1 and JKTBP2 isoforms for subcellular localization in cells treated with or without actinomycin D, we prepared their cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and analyzed them by immunoblotting using anti-JKTBP serum. On the blots of whole cell lysates, two major bands of ∼53 kDa (JKTBP2) and 38 kDa (JKTBP1) and at least two minor bands of ∼48 and 36 kDa were detected. No appreciable difference in the JKTBP contents between the untreated and treated cells was observed (Fig. 1C). In the untreated cells, the relative amounts of JKTBP1 recovered in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were 25 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 1C,upper panel, lanes 1–3). In the treated cells, the percentage of JKTBP1 in the cytoplasmic fraction increased to 50% (lanes 4–6). Unlike JKTBP1, JKTBP2 was recovered only in the nuclear fractions from the untreated and treated cells. The minor proteins of 48 and 38 kDa became obscure in the subcellular fractionation. hnRNPs A1 and C as controls for polymerase II transcription-dependent and -independent nuclear localization, respectively, were detected on the same blots. Upon actinomycin D treatment, hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm increased (middle panel), whereas hnRNP C was always recovered only in the nuclear fraction of the untreated and treated cells (lower panel), as reported previously (5Piñol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the increased amount of cytoplasmic JKTBP1 was not due to leakage from the nucleus. In the DRB-treated cells, cytoplasmic JKTBP increased compared with that in the untreated cells (Fig. 1D,lanes 1–6). Upon deprivation of the drug, the increased cytoplasmic JKTBP1 decreased to a low level at 37 °C, but not at 4 °C (lanes 8–12). This indicated that the accumulated cytoplasmic JKTBP1 was re-imported into the nucleus. The three JKTBP isoforms are depicted in Fig. 2A. JKTBP1 and JKTBP2 have been characterized previously (18Tsuchiya N. Kamei D. Takano A. Matsui T. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Kamei D. Tsuchiya N. Yamazaki M. Meguro H. Yamada M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and JKTBP1Δ6 was characterized by cDNA cloning in this work. A JKTBP1Δ6 cDNA encodes a 244-residue polypeptide (27,161 Da) and is generated by alternative splicing of exon 6. JKTBP1Δ6 produced by in vitro transcription and translation was ∼36 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). JKTBP1Δ6 produced by cells was found as a minor 36-kDa band on the immunoblots (Fig. 1C). To determine the nucleocytoplasmic movements of the three distinct isoforms, we prepared plasmid constructs consisting of three JKTBP cDNAs fused to a 3′-end of the EGFP gene and used them to transfect HeLa cells. After 22 h of cell cultivation, expression of the three EGFP-tagged JKTBP isoforms was confirmed as proteins with the expected molecular masses on the immunoblots probed with anti-GFP serum (Fig.2B). Parallel cultures were incubated with or without actinomycin D in the presence of cycloheximide for 3 h, and then their subcellular localization were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent signal of control EGFP was found diffusely in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the untreated and treated cells (Fig. 2, C and D, panel a). The signals of EGFP-tagged JKTBP1 and JKTBP1Δ6 were confined solely to the nucleus in the untreated cells (Fig. 2C, panels c and d), whereas following actinomycin D treatment, the JKTBP1 and JKTBP1Δ6 signals appeared to be distributed evenly over the cells (Fig. 2D, panels c andd). The JKTBP2 signal was always retained in the nucleus before and after treatment (Fig. 2, C and D,panel b). These results indicated that JKTBP1 and JKTBP1Δ6 differed in nucleocytoplasmic movement from JKTBP2. First, we searched for potential NLSs of JKTBP by sequence homology. Sequence homologous to neither basic type NLSs nor the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence of M9 was present in JKTBP. To delineate an NLS sequence of JKTBP, N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were prepared by PCR with parent JKTBP cDNAs as a template. All of the mutants are represented according to JKTBP2 numbering (Fig. 3A). The mutant cDNAs were fused to the 3′-end of an EGFP-GST gene encoding an EGFP-GST fusion protein. In these constructs, a tripartite fusion gene of EGFP, GST, and mutant genes rather than a bipartite fusion gene of EGFP and mutant genes was constructed because the smallest mutant gene examined encoded a 23-residue peptide. These constructs were used to transfect HeLa cells and were expressed for 22 h. Expression of all EGFP-GST mutant fusion proteins with the expected sizes was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP serum (Fig. 3B). In parallel cultures, the subcellular localization of mutant proteins was studied by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3C). The fluorescent signal of control EGFP-GST (∼58 kDa) spread out from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (panel a). In the C-terminal deletion mutants 227–341, 227–398, and 226–408, the signals were all confined to the cytoplasm (panels b–d), indicating that the 12 C-terminal residues are indispensable for the nuclear localization of JKTBP. In the N-terminal deletion mutants 226–420, 323–420, 396–420, and 398–420, the signals were located in the nucleus (panels e–h). These results indicate that the 23-residue C terminus has NLS activity. A single amino acid substitution of Gly404 with Ala in JKTBP-(226–420) reduced its nuclear localization weakly, but significantly (data not shown). We next examined whether the NLS sequence has nuclear export signal activity. For heterokaryon assay, HeLa cells were labeled with EGFP-tagged JKTBP and EGFP-GST-tagged N-terminal deletion mutants and then fused with unlabeled mouse NIH3T3 cells. After cell fusion, cell culture was continued for 1 h in the absence of new protein synthesis. In the het"
https://openalex.org/W2149773101,"We have reported recently that the mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine(4a) (5-HT4(a)) receptor undergoes dynamic palmitoylation (Ponimaskin, E. G., Schmidt, M. F., Heine, M., Bickmeyer, U., and Richter, D. W. (2001) Biochem. J. 353, 627–663). In the present study, conserved cysteine residues 328/329 in the carboxyl terminus of the 5-HT4(a)receptor were identified as potential acylation sites. In contrast to other palmitoylated G-protein-coupled receptors, the additional cysteine residue 386 positioned close to the COOH-terminal end of the receptor was also found to be palmitoylated. Using pulse and pulse-chase labeling techniques, we demonstrated that palmitoylation of individual cysteines is a reversible process and that agonist stimulation of the 5-HT4(a) receptor independently increases the rate of palmitate turnover for both acylation sites. Analysis of acylation-deficient mutants revealed that non-palmitoylated 5-HT4(a) receptors were indistinguishable from the wild type in their ability to interact with Gs, to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase activity and to activate cyclic nucleotide-sensitive cation channels after agonist stimulation. The most distinctive finding of the present study was the ability of palmitoylation to modulate the agonist-independent constitutive 5-HT4(a) receptor activity. We demonstrated that mutation of the proximal palmitoylation site (Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser) significantly increases the capacity of receptors to convert from the inactive (R) to the active (R*) form in the absence of agonist. In contrast, the rate of isomerization from R to R* for the Cys386 → Ser as well as for the triple, non-palmitoylated mutant (Cys328 → Ser/Cys329→ Ser/Cys386 →Ser) was similar to that obtained for the wild type.

Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Two of the most common modifications involve acylation with myristate (N-myristoylation) and palmitate (S-acylation). Myristic acid is usually attached co-translationally to the NH2-terminal glycine residue in an amide linkage byN-myristoyltransferase (4Boutin J.A. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 5Gordon J.I. Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Gokel G.W. J. Biol.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to myristate, which generally remains attached to the polypeptides until protein degradation, palmitic acid is added post-translationally and turns over rapidly as a protein itself (7Omary M.B Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4715-4718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the cellular palmitoylated proteins, polypeptides involved in signal transduction (e.g. receptors, G-protein α-subunits, and adenylyl cyclases) are prevalent. With the finding that palmitoylation states of several proteins may be dynamically regulated, it is now widely accepted that repeated cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation could have important functional consequences for signaling (9Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Mumby S.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 the functions of palmitoylation cover the wide spectrum of their biological activities: from coupling to G-proteins and regulated endocytosis to receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (9Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Mumby S.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Bouvier M. Loisel T.P. Hebert T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example, the palmitoylation state of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) regulates the synergistic action of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and β-adrenergic receptor kinase involved in receptor phosphorylation and desensitization in response to ligand binding (13Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Moffett S. Rousseau G. Lagace M. Bouvier M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The long term agonist stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor, which promotes receptor phosphorylation, also increases receptor depalmitoylation, resulting in decreased signaling through the receptor (15Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 10: 15923-15932Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A mutation that prevents palmitoylation of the αA2-adrenergic receptor has been found to strongly inhibit receptor down-regulation (16Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For the bovine rhodopsin, abolition of palmitoylation by mutagenesis impairs its all-trans-retinal stimulatory activity, demonstrating the importance of palmitoylation for dark adaptation (17Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings show that receptor acylation plays differing functional roles at different receptor-G-protein interfaces, suggesting that there is no common function applicable to all GPCRs. Therefore, an analysis of the functions of palmitoylation is necessary for each individual receptor to understand its signaling mechanism. Five-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) mediates physiological functions in both the central nervous system and the periphery of vertebrates through a large number of receptors. With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a cation channel, all other 5-HT receptors belong to the GPCR family. Among the 13 known genes coding for 5-HT GPCRs, only 3 (5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7) are positively coupled to G-proteins (Gs) that stimulate adenylate cyclases (18Fangi L. Dumuis A. Sebben M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Hoyer D. Martin G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The 5-HT4 receptor is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including brain, colon, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract, and heart (20Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Baumgarten H.G. Göthert M. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Serotoninergic Neurons and 5-HT Receptors in the CNS. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1997: 439-465Google Scholar, 21Eglen R.M. Wong E.H.F. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, the 5-HT4 receptor contributes to the control of acetylcholine and dopamine secretion, facilitates cognitive performance and is also implicated in anxiety (22Bonhomme N. Cador M. Stinus L. Le Moal M. Spampinato U. Brain Res. 1995; 675: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Marchetti-Gauthier E. Roman F.S. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Soumireu-Mourat B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Barnes N.M. Sharp T. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 5-HT4 receptor is thought to be involved in various central and peripheral disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and atrial fibrillation (25Wong E.H. Reynolds G.P. Bonhaus D.W. Hsu S. Eglen R.M. Behav. Brain Res. 1996; 73: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Workman A.J. Rankin A.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 436-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The wide distribution of 5-HT4 receptors is paralleled by the existence of many 5-HT4 splicing variants. Functional expression has been reported for five COOH-terminal and one internal splice variants in humans (27Bender E. Pindon A. van Oers I. Zhang Y.-B. Gommeren W. Verhasselt P. Jurzak M. Leysen J. Luyten W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 478-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In mouse, four 5-HT4receptor isoforms, 5-HT4(a), 5-HT4(b), 5-HT4(e), and 5-HT4(f), have been cloned (28Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar). All these variants, except the internal splice product in humans, share the same sequence up to Leu358 followed by an unique COOH terminus. Because the COOH-terminal tail seems to be involved in the fine tuning of the coupling of GPCRs to G-proteins, it has been proposed that a diversity of function can be attributed to the different splicing variants of 5-HT4 receptor (29Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Eglen R.M. Clark R.D. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Parmentier M.L. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that the 5-HT4(a) receptor undergoes palmitoylation. Our data also demonstrated that palmitoylation of the 5-HT4(a) is a reversible process and that agonist stimulation of the receptor increases the turnover rate for receptor-bound palmitate (31Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study we explored the functional role of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation in serotonin-mediated signaling. By site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Cys328/Cys329 as potential acylation sites in the 5-HT4(a) receptor. In contrast to most other palmitoylated GPCRs, an additional cysteine residue Cys386located in the very distal portion of the COOH-terminal domain was also identified as a palmitoylation site. Whereas the coupling with the Gs protein, agonist-promoted cAMP production as well as intracellular distribution of non-palmitoylated receptor mutants were unaffected, our experimental data provide clear evidence for a functional role of palmitoylation in the modulation of constitutive activity on the 5-HT4(a) receptor. We demonstrate that mutation of the proximal palmitoylation site (Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser) significantly increases the capacity of the receptor to convert from the inactive (R) to the active (R*) form in the absence of a agonists. In contrast, the rate of isomerization from R to R* for the Cys386 → Ser as well as for the triple, non-palmitoylated mutant (Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser/Cys386 →Ser) was similar to that obtained for the wild type.

Enzymes used in molecular cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), GR113808A was a gift from GlaxoWellcome (Stevenage, United Kingdom). BIMU8 was kindly provided by Boehringer (Ingelheim, Germany). SB 207266 ((N-1-butyl-4-piperinylmethyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-[1,3]-oxazino[3,2-a]indole-10-carboxamide, hydrochloride) was obtained from Laboratoires Fournier-Debat (Daix, France), and ML 10375 (2-(cis-3,5-dimethylpiperidino)ethyl 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate) was obtained from M. Langlois (CNRS-BIOCIS, Châtenay-Malabry, France). TC-100 insect cell medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), trypsin versene, fetal calf serum (FCS), 2× YT medium, Cellfectin®, and Lipofectin® reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). TC-100 medium without l-methionine and l-glutamine was from PAN Biotech GmbH (Aidenbach, Germany). Cell culture dishes were purchased from Nunc (Wiesbaden, Germany). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The polyclonal antiserum AS9459, raised against the COOH-terminal peptide of m5-HT4(a) receptor, has been described previously (31Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All basic DNA procedures were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The construction of recombinant baculovirus coding for the m5-HT4(a) receptor has been described previously (31Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the expression in COS-7 cells, the m5-HT4(a) cDNA was cleaved from pFastBac plasmid (Invitrogen) with XbaI andHindIII endonucleases to yield the 1.1-kb fragment containing the entire coding sequence. The fragment was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create the blunt ends and then ligated to thePmeI site in the multiple cloning site of the pTracer-CMV2 donor plasmid (Invitrogen). The 5-HT4(a) mutants with the substitution of serine for cysteines 328/329; 346; 386; 328/329 and 346; 328/329 and 386; and 346 and 386 were performed in pFastBac/5-HT4(a) plasmid using an oligonucleotide containing the mutation(s) corresponding to the above substitutions by standard PCR protocols, using the overlap extension technique. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding for 5-HT4(a) mutants were constructed, purified, and amplified as described previously (33Veit M. Nürnberg B. Spicher K. Harteneck K. Ponimaskin E. Schultz G. Schmidt M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by double-stranded dideoxy DNA sequencing at the level of the final plasmid. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were grown in TC-100 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (complete TC-100). For expression, Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106) grown in 35-mm dishes were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding for wild type or mutated 5-HT4(a) receptors at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. After 48 h, cells were labeled with Tran35S-label (50 μCi/ml) in TC-100 medium without methionine or with [3H]palmitic acid (300 μCi/ml) in TC-100 medium for the time periods indicated in the figure legends. For the pulse-chase experiments, cells were subsequently incubated in complete TC-100 medium supplemented with 100 μm unlabeled palmitate and 50 μm sodium pyruvate. In some experiments, BIMU8 was added to the final concentrations as indicated in figure legends. After labeling (or chase), cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) and lysed in 600 μl of NTEP buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was pelleted (5 min, 20,000 × g), and antibodies AS9459 were added to the supernatant at a dilution of 1:60. After overnight agitation at 4 °C, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added, and samples were incubated under gentle rocking for 2 h. After brief centrifugation, the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold NTEP buffer, and the immunocomplexes were released from the beads by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in nonreducing electrophoresis sample buffer (62,5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 20% glycerol, 6% SDS, 0,002% bromphenol blue). Radiolabeled polypeptides were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 12% acrylamide gels and visualized by fluorography using Kodak X-Omat AR films. Quantification of fluorograms was carried out by means of a SnapScan1236 scanner and Gel-Pro Analyzer version 3.1 software. The amount of [3H]palmitate incorporated was calculated relative to the expression of the various proteins as indicated by its [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling. Agonist-promoted binding of [35S]GTPγS to different G-proteins induced by stimulation of 5-HT4(a) receptors was performed according to the method described previously (34Ponimaskin E. Behn H. Adarichev V. Voyno-Yasenetskay T.A. Offermanns S. Schmidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes from Sf9 cells expressing the 5-HT4(a) receptor wild type or acylation-deficient mutants and G-protein α subunits (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Gq, Gs, and G12) together with β1γ2 subunits were resuspended in 55 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm GDP. After adding [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 30 nm, samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of BIMU8. The reaction was terminated by adding 600 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm GDP, and 100 μm GTP for 30 min on the ice. The samples were incubated for 20 min with 150 μl of a 10% suspension of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) preincubated with nonimmune serum to remove nonspecific bound proteins. Samples were agitated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5–10 μl of appropriate Gα subunits-directed antiserum preincubated with 100 μl of 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times and boiled in 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS; 4 ml of Ecolite+ was then added and radioactivity measured by scintillation spectrometry. Electrophysiological measurements were performed using the method described previously by Heine et al. (35Heine M. Ponimaskin E.G. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; (web publication ahead of print)DOI10.1007/s004240100690www.link.springer.dePubMed Google Scholar). Currents were measured in the whole cell patch-clamp mode. Borosilicate glass pipettes were fire polished and had a final series resistance of 4–8 megohms. For measurements we used the discontinuous single-electrode voltage clamp amplifier SEC-05L from NPI Electronic (Tamm, Germany), which was connected to a computer through an ITC-16 interface from Instrutech Corp. (Great Neck, NY). Data were acquired and stored by Pulse-PulseFit 8.31 software from HEKA (Lambrecht, Germany) and data analysis was performed with Igor-WaveMetrics software. The temperature of the superfusing solution was stabilized at 25 ± 0.2 °C controlled with a Peltier control unit from ESF Electronic (Göttingen, Germany). Recordings were performed in TC-100 medium without FCS. In this medium it was possible to hold cells for 4–7 h. The standard pipette solution contained 110 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa2ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.25. The high Ca2+-buffered pipette solution (15.31 nm free Ca2+ as calculated by Patcher's Power Tools software (Francisco Mendez, Göttingen, Germany)) allowed us to exclude side effects of Ca2+ ions on channel activation kinetics, as described by Lüthi and McCormick (36Luthi A. McCormick D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The osmolarity of the pipette solution was 20 mosmol below the osmolarity of the TC-100 medium. The 5-HT4(a) receptor was stimulated by 0.1–10 μm serotonin (5-HT) by pressure application (PDES 2L-unit from NPI Electronic) from pipettes with a diameter of 3–5 μm. The activation time constants (τ) were estimated by an exponential fitting. Statistical values were given as means ± S.E. The cDNA encoding for the wild type or mutated 5-HT4(a) receptors in pTracer-CMV2 plasmid was introduced into COS-7 cells by electroporation as described previously (37Claeysen S. Sebben M. Journot L. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 25: 19-25Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in EP buffer (50 mmK2HPO4, 20 mmCH3CO2K, 20 mm KOH, 26.7 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) containing 25–2000 ng of receptor cDNA. The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 15 μg/transfection using pTracer vector. After 15 min of exposure at room temperature, 300 μl of cell suspension (107 cells) were transferred to a 0.4-ml electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and pulsed using a Gene-Pulser apparatus (setting 1000 microfarads, 280 V). Afterward, cells were diluted in DMEM (106 cells/ml) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) and plated on 15-cm dishes or into 12-well clusters at the desired density. Six h after transfection, the complete medium was exchanged by DMEM without dFBS containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine to label the ATP pool. After overnight incubation, cAMP accumulation was measured as described previously (38Dumuis A. Bouhelal R. Sebben M. Cory R. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 880-887PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from transfected cells plated on 15-cm dishes and grown for 24 h in DMEM with 10% dFBS as described previously (39Ansanay H. Sebben M. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 298: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, harvested in PBS, and centrifuged at 4 °C (200 × g for 4 min). The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.32 msucrose and homogenized 10 times with a glass-Teflon potter at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (5 mg of protein in 1 ml of solution), and stored at −80 °C until use. To perform radioligand binding studies with [3H]GR 113808 (specific activity: 83 Ci/mmol), 100 μl of membrane suspension prepared as described above was diluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (2–20 μg of protein), containing 10 mm pargyline and 0.01% ascorbic acid. Samples were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with 100 μl of [3H]GR 113808 and 50 μl of buffer or competing drugs. For saturation analysis assays, various concentrations of [3H]GR 113808 (0.001–1 nm) were used. For competition binding experiments, the [3H]GR 113808 concentrations were kept at 0.15 nm. The receptor densities were estimated using the specific radioligand [3H]GR 113808 at a saturating concentration (0.4–0.6 nm,Kd = 0.12 nm) as described previously (38Dumuis A. Bouhelal R. Sebben M. Cory R. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 880-887PubMed Google Scholar). 5-HT (0.5 μm) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. COS-7 cells were maintained as a monolayer culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. For the expression of the 5-HT4(a) receptor, the cells grown on coverslips were washed once with OptiMEM without FCS and then transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000. At 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3% in PBS) for 15 min and washed three times with PBS, and unreacted paraformaldehyde was quenched with 50 mm glycine for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS) and then incubated for 1 h with the first antibody AS9459 diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The second antibody (Fluor 594, (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany), diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin) was adsorbed successively to the cells for 1 h. Unbound antibodies were washed off after every step with PBS. Coverslips were finally mounted in 90% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were monitored under a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss) at a magnification of 630 with appropriated filter sets. The dose-response curves were fitted by the equation y = ((ymax −ymin)/1 + (x/EC50)nH +ymin), where EC50 is the concentration of agonist producing a response equal to 50% of the maximum, ymax and ymincorrespond to the maximal and minimal values, andnH to the Hill coefficient, by using Kaleidagraph software. Competition and saturation experiments were analyzed by nonlinear regression using LIGAND software. Saturation experiments were also analyzed according to Scatchard. Statistical significant differences were determined with the StatView Student program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) with Student's ttest. Given that the 5-HT4(a) receptor contains covalently bound palmitic acid (31Ponimaskin E.G. Schmidt M.F. Heine M. Bickmeyer U. Richter D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 627-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we sought to identify potential acylation site(s) by construction of a series of mutant receptors where serine was substituted for cysteine residues at the receptor carboxyl terminus (Fig.1A). All substitution mutants along with the wild type receptor were expressed in Sf9 insect cells by the baculovirus system and labeled with either Tran35S-label or [3H]palmitic acid followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Results of the [35S]Met labeling demonstrated that all mutants were expressed at the levels comparable with those of the 5-HT4(a) wild type control (Fig. 1B), which allows for a quantitative comparison of palmitoylation levels in the different products. The amount of [3H]palmitate incorporated into each of these mutants was calculated by densitometry of fluorograms in relation to the expression level of the various proteins as indicated by its [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling (40Ponimaskin E. Schmidt M.F. Virology. 1998; 249: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Of the four cysteine residues at the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, Cys328/Cys329 are highly conserved among GPCRs and also correspond to the site that has been shown to be palmitoylated. However, replacement of these cysteine residues with serine did not completely abolish palmitoylation. Incorporation of [3H]palmitate into Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser mutant was 43.7 ± 4.8% (n = 4). Replacement of Cys346 alone or in combination with Cys328/Cys329 did not significantly affect the relative palmitoylation efficiency of the resulting mutants as compared with the wild type (100% for the wt and 104 ± 6.3% for the Cys346 → Ser) and Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser construct (43.7 ± 4.8% for the Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser and 38.1 ± 3.9% for the Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser/Cys346 → Ser), respectively (Fig. 1A). A single mutation of Cys386 located very close to the COOH-terminal end, however, resulted in a decreased palmitoylation as compared with the wild type. The relative palmitoylation value demonstrated that incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the Cys386 → Ser mutant was 61.5 ± 5% (n = 4). When Cys386 was mutated together with Cys346, relative palmitoylation efficiency (57.4 ± 5.6%) was similar to the Cys386 → Ser receptor (61.5 ± 5%). In contrast, simultaneous substitution of Cys328/Cys329 and Cys386 led to a complete elimination of any detectable [3H]palmitic acid incorporation (Fig. 1B). Absence of palmitoylation on the Cys328 → Ser/Cys329 → Ser/Cys386 → Ser mutant was also confirmed after prolonged (up to 6 weeks) gel ex"

https://openalex.org/W2113944758,"A growing body of evidence now suggests that programmed cell death (PCD) occurs via non-apoptotic mechanisms as well as by apoptosis. In contrast to apoptosis, however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of non-apoptotic PCD remain only poorly understood. Here we show that ceramide induces a non-apoptotic PCD with a necrotic-like morphology in human glioma cells. Characteristically, the cell death was not accompanied by loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytosolic release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, or the activation of the caspase cascade. Consistent with these characteristics, this ceramide-induced cell death was inhibited neither by the overexpression of Bcl-xL nor by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. However, strikingly, the ceramide-induced non-apoptotic cell death was inhibited by the activation of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway through the expression of a constitutively active version of Akt. The results for the first time indicate that the Akt kinase, known to play an essential role in survival factor-mediated inhibition of apoptotic cell death, is also involved in the regulation of non-apoptotic PCD."

The molecular mechanisms that control cell cycle entry of SMCs in response to vascular injury are not well understood. Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding) is a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcription regulators that are known to promote cell cycle progression. Thus, we investigated the role of Id2 in SMC growth and cell cycle regulation. The results demonstrated that overexpression of Id2 resulted in a significant enhancement of SMC growth via increased S-phase entry. A possible mechanism of Id2-enchanced SMC growth is via regulation of p21 expression, as overexpression of Id2-inhibited transcriptional activity of a 2.3-kb p21 promoter/luciferase reporter construct as well as p21 protein levels. Id2 enhancement of SMC growth and inhibition of p21 expression were dependent on phosphorylation of Id2 by cyclin E/cdk2, as an Id2 cDNA containing a mutation in the cdk2 phosphorylation site (serine 5) failed to regulate SMC cell cycle progression or p21 promoter activity. The mechanism of cyclin E/cdk2 control of the Id2 effect may in part involve regulation of nuclear transport; unlike wild-type Id2, the Id2 mutant was not transported to the nucleus. Finally, in a rat carotid model of arterial injury, Id2 was expressed in a temporal pattern that parallels the kinetics of cellular proliferation. In summary, these results provide evidence that the Id2 protein is integrated into the cell cycle regulatory cascade that results in SMC proliferation following vascular injury and suggest that this effect is at least in part via a cdk2-dependent inhibition of p21 gene expression.

Lasorellaet al. (10Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) identified a unique role for Id2 in cell cycle regulation. Id2 is able to bind the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and Rb-related proteins and functions as an antagonist to the growth suppressive effects of these proteins. Through this mechanism, Id2 was able to reverse p16- and p21-induced cell cycle arrest. In contrast, Id1 and Id3 did not bind to or inhibit the function of Rb, providing evidence that specific members of the Id family have unique roles in regulating proliferation (10Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Given the established paradigm for Id function, it is appealing to hypothesize that the Id proteins also affect cellular proliferation via their ability to dimerize and block transactivation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Indeed, recent evidence (11Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B.

Our results demonstrated that overexpression of an Id2 cDNA in cultured SMC-enhanced S-phase entry and cell growth. Mutation of a consensus cdk2 phosphorylation site of Id2 (serine 5) abolished this enhancement of proliferation and resulted in inhibition of S-phase entry. Although wild-type Id2 blocked transactivation of the p21 promoter and decreased p21 protein levels in cultured SMCs, this effect was lost following mutation of the cdk2 phosphorylation site. A possible mechanism by which cdk2 phosphorylation regulates Id2 function is via regulation of nuclear transport, as mutation of Ser-5 resulted in exclusion of Id2 protein from the nucleus. In support of a role for Id2 in SMC growthin vivo, we noted an up-regulation of Id2 protein in the vessel wall of the rat carotid artery following a balloon injury in a spatial and temporal pattern consistent with the kinetics of cellular proliferation in this model. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a unique link between Id2 and the cell cycle in the SMC proliferative response to injury. Primary rat aortic SMCs were obtained from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) with 10% FBS, 10 units of penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Following the establishment of a cultured line, the SMC phenotype was confirmed using antibody staining against smooth muscle α-actin and myosin heavy chain. To induce SMC quiescence, the medium was changed to serum-deprived medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 (1:1) supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then stimulated with medium containing 10% FBS and harvested at specific time points following serum addition. Cell harvests were lysed using protein loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). Fifty micrograms of protein from each cell lysate were run on an 18% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA), and blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 4% nonfat milk. Blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following antibodies at 1:200 dilution: rabbit polyclonal anti-Id2 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-p21 antibody (BD PharMingen, Carlsbad, CA). Blots were washed twice and incubated in PBS containing a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were visualized using a chemiluminescent detection substrate (Luminol Reagent, Santa Cruz). A full-length, wild-type Id2 cDNA and an Id2 cDNA with a Ser-5 → Ala mutation (Id2S5A) were generated using RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from cultured rat SMCs. To make Id2S5A, an AG→GC mutation was inserted at nucleotides 76–77 of the forward primer. The PCR products were inserted into theHindIII and XbaI sites of pRc/RSV (Invitrogen) to make pRcId2 and pRcId2S5A or the plasmid p3XFLAG14 (Sigma) to make pFId2 and pFId2S5A. The plasmid p21Luc was constructed as follows: a 2.3-kb fragment of the human p21 promoter was obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). This promoter was subcloned into the plasmid pGL3 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, using the XhoI andMluI sites on pGL3. Transfections were performed using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The adenoviral vector AdId2, which contains a full-length Id2 cDNA under the control of a CMV promoter, was a gift from Dr. Mark Israel (Dept. of Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco). Rat aortic SMCs were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) value of 100 with AdId2 or AdGal control. Cultured rat aortic SMCs were transfected with 5 μg of linearized plasmid (pRc/RSV control or pRcId2). Forty-eight hours after transfection, 400 μg/ml G418 (Cellgro, Alexandria, VA) was added to the culture medium. G418-resistant cells were pooled and passaged further in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. After 3–4 weeks in selection medium, SMCs stably transfected with either pRc/RSV or pRcId2 plasmids were plated onto 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/well. Cells were grown in DF10 for 5 days, then counted using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay (Celltiter Aqueous 1 reagent, Promega). Absorption at 492 nm was converted to cell number using a previously generated standard curve of absorption versus SMC number. Overexpression of Id2 in pRcId2 stables was confirmed by Western blotting. Rat aortic SMCs were co-transfected with 2 μg of the LacZ reporter plasmid pSVGal (Promega) and 4 μg of either pRc/RSV, pRcId2, or pRcId2S5A. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the medium was changed to serum-deprived medium and the cells were incubated for an additional 72 h. Cells were pulsed with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24 h followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Transfected cells were identified by staining with RedGal reagent (Research Organics, Cleveland, OH) for 4 h at 37 °C. When sufficient gal staining was achieved, cells were incubated in 2 n HCl for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in PBS. Following two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with a biotinylated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Cells were washed twice and incubated in ABC Elite solution for 30 min. BrdUrd-positive cells were identified using a DAB peroxidase substrate. Transfected cells were counted in each well using bright field microscopy. For each sample, the percent transfected cells traversing S-phase was the percent RedGal-positive cells that were also BrdUrd-positive. The experiment was performed in triplicate for a total of three repeats, and the results were combined for statistical analysis. Rat aortic SMCs were transfected with 1 μg of p21Luc and 6 μg of either pRc/RSV, pRcId2, or pRcId2S5A. Following transfections, cells were incubated in medium containing 10% FBS for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. The transfections and luciferase assays were repeated in triplicate in three separate runs. Luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to total sample protein using a protein assay (Bio-Rad) and reported as a percentage of control promoter activity. Rat aortic SMCs were plated on sterile coverslips and transfected with 0.5 μg of an E47 expression vector and 0.5 μg of either pFlId2 or pFlId2S5A. Thirty-six hours after transfection cells were fixed with methanol/acetone for 1 min, washed, and incubated with 10 μg/ml of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-FLAG antibody (M-2, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed, mounted, and examined under fluorescence. Male 300-g Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Labs, Indianapolis, IN) were subjected to balloon arterial injury as previously described (13Matsumura M.E., Li, F. Berthoux L. Wei B. Lobe D.R. Jeon C. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At 1, 6, 14, 28, and 60 days (n = 5 for each time point) following injury, the rats were given an overdose of intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine, pressure perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the injured left and control right carotids were removed and postfixed for 2 h, dehydrated in a graded alcohol/xylene series, and paraffin-embedded. Five-micron sections were stained using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) as follows. Sections were blocked for 30 min in secondary serum followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-Id2. Slides were washed twice with PBS and incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:2000 in 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were then incubated for 30 min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide followed by Vectastain Elite ABC Reagent for 30 min. Slides were washed twice and incubated with diaminobenzamine peroxidase substrate (Sigma) for 2 min, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). To examine whether Id2 has direct effects on SMC growth, cultured SMCs transfected with pRc/RSV or pRcId2 were selected for neomycin resistance to obtain a stably transfected population of cells. Following selection, resistant cells (∼150,000 in each transfection) were pooled to avoid clonal variation and assayed for cell number. Overexpression of Id2 in stably transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot (Fig.1, inset). Compared with control stable transfectants, SMCs overexpressing Id2 demonstrated a 41% increase in cell number 5 days after plating (Fig. 1; 4625versus 6513; p < 0.001), demonstrating that Id2 expression enhances SMC proliferation. To confirm that the increase in the SMC number seen with Id2-overexpressing cells reflected enhanced cell cycle activity, the effect of Id2 overexpression on BrdUrd uptake was assayed. Results suggested that the enhanced SMC number noted with stable wild-type Id2 overexpression may in part be due to the enhancement of cells entering S-phase, as Id2-transfected cells demonstrated an 81% increase in BrdUrd uptake versus control cells (Fig.2, 24 versus 16% for control,p = 0.01). Previous studies have demonstrated that Id2 contains a consensus cdk2 phosphorylation site (Ser-5), which is phosphorylated by cdk2 in late G1 (14Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Id2 contains a consensus cdk2 phosphorylation site at serine 5. Prior results suggested that cyclin E/cdk2 phosphorylates Ser-5 in late G1, an event that was essential for Id2 enhancement of U2OS carcinoma cells. To determine whether the cdk2 site at Ser-5 is important for Id2 enhancement of SMC proliferation, an Id2 cDNA containing a serine to alanine mutation at Ser-5 (pRcId2S5A) was created. This mutation has previously been shown to be incapable of being phosphorylated by cyclin E/cdk2 (14Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The effect of pRcId2S5A on S-phase entry of SMCs was compared with wild-type pRcId2-transfected SMCs using the BrdUrd assay. In contrast to SMCs overexpressing wild-type Id2, cells overexpressing Id2S5A did not differ from control (Fig. 2; 14 versus 13%;p is not significant), providing evidence that the cdk2 phosphorylation site in Id2 is necessary for the enhanced S-phase entry of Id2-overexpressing cells. Western blotting of cell lysates from SMCs transfected with Id2 or Id2S5A confirmed that these results were not due to an effect of the Ser-5 mutation on the level of protein expression, as the wild-type Id2 and Id2S5A plasmids yielded bands of equal intensity when probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of Id2 (Fig. 2, inset). Previous studies have identified a role for Id2 in regulating Rb function. This function is not shared by other members of the Id family (Id1 or Id3) (10Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); however, Id1 is known to regulate p21 gene expression (12Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine whether Id2 also inhibits p21 gene expression and whether the cdk2 phosphorylation site is essential for this effect, cultured SMCs were transiently co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a 2.3-kb fragment of the human p21 promoter (p21Luc) and either pRc/RSV, pRcId2, or pRcId2S5A. The results demonstrated that pRcId2 resulted in a 62% decrease in luciferase activityversus control (p = 0.001) whereas pRcId2S5A resulted in luciferase activity, which was not statistically different from control (p = 0.580, Fig.3 a). Thus, Id2 inhibits p21 gene expression via a mechanism dependent on its cdk2 phosphorylation site. To confirm that the effect of Id2 on p21 promoter activity results in an alteration of p21 protein levels, SMCs were infected with an adenoviral vector containing a full-length Id2 cDNA (AdId2) or a control AdLacZ virus. Forty-eight hours after infections, Western blotting of cell lysates was performed. Results demonstrated a decrease in p21 protein levels in AdId2-infected cells. In addition, p53 levels were not affected by AdId2 infection, confirming that the control of p21 by Id2 is via a p53-independent mechanism (Fig. 3 b). Results of prior studies suggested that bHLH factors are necessary for translocation of the Id proteins to the nucleus (15Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed the effect of Ser-5 on nuclear transport. FLAG-tagged Id2 or Id2S5A were co-transfected into SMCs with an expression vector contained a full-length coding region of E47, a bHLH known to both contain a nuclear localization signal as well as interact with Id2 (15Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Results demonstrated that wild-type Id2 is localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, Id2S5A is excluded from entry into the nucleus (Fig.4 B). These data suggest that the cdk2 phosphorylation site at Ser-5 is necessary for the interaction of Id2 with factors that allow nuclear transport. Given the established paradigm of Id proteins as dominant-negative regulators of bHLH function, we used immunoprecipitation to identify differential binding partners of Id2 and Id2S5A. However, we were unable to identify HLH factors that differentially interacted with either Id2 or Id2S5A, including E47, which immunoprecipitated with both constructs (data not shown). Given that SMC proliferation plays a key role in neointimal formation following experimental vascular injury, we sought to examine the expression of Id2 in the vessel wall following balloon injury of the rat carotid. Results demonstrated that the Id2 protein was not detected in the normal rat carotid (Fig.5 A) or 24 h following balloon injury (Fig. 5 B). Six days after injury, the Id2 protein was detected diffusely throughout the medium and in scattered neointimal vascular SMCs (Fig. 5 B). Fourteen days after balloon endothelial denudation, Id2 staining was noted throughout the neointimal layer with continued expression within the medium (Fig.5 D). Twenty-eight days after injury, Id2 was still expressed in the neointima although in a lower percentage of cells (Fig.5 E). Sixty days after injury, no Id2 protein was detected (Fig. 5 F). Thus, balloon endothelial denudation induces Id2 protein expression in medial and neointimal cells during vascular lesion formation. The pattern of Id2 expression following balloon injury in this model closely parallels the spatial and temporal pattern of SMC proliferation in this model (3Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Id2 is induced during periods of peak SMC growth in vivo, similar to that seen in cultured vascular SMCs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cell cycle regulation in SMCs is critical to understanding and intervening in SMC growth, which is the hallmark of vascular proliferative disorders. The present study provides evidence that the HLH protein Id2 is an important factor in regulating cell cycle progression in SMCs. Results demonstrated that overexpression of Id2 enhances S-phase entry and proliferation of SMCs, possibly through regulation of levels of the p21 cdk inhibitor. Furthermore, the consensus cdk2 phosphorylation site (Ser-5) of Id2 is essential for p21 inhibition and growth enhancement. These data are the first to implicate Id2, a member of the HLH family of transcription factors, in the regulation of growth and cell cycle activity in SMCs. Recent studies provide evidence that Id2 regulates cell cycle progression through mechanisms that do not involve the classic paradigm of bHLH antagonism. In U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, Id2 directly interacted with Rb and Rb-related pocket proteins (10Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and functioned as an antagonist to their growth suppressive effects. This novel mechanism was not seen with Id1 or Id3, suggesting that the Id proteins do not regulate cell growth via entirely redundant mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrated that Id1 inhibited p21 expression in HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (12Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The results of the present study are the first to demonstrate that Id2 also inhibits the expression of the p21 gene. Whether Id2 has effects on Rb function in SMCs is unknown. Nonetheless, these data provide evidence that Id2 regulates cell cycle progression through at least two different mechanisms. In addition to the effects of Id2 on cell cycle protein expression and function, Id2 is integrated into the cell cycle via yet another mechanism. The N terminus of Id2 contains a conserved, functional site for cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin A/cdk2 phosphorylation. Previous studies have demonstrated that both cyclin E and cyclin A/cdk2 enzymes can phosphorylate at the Ser-5 residue of Id2 in vitro. In vivoId2 is phosphorylated on Ser-5 late in G1 coincident with peak cyclin E activity, suggesting that Ser-5 is a substrate for cyclin E/cdk2 phosphorylation in vivo (14Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Results of the present study demonstrate that the cdk2 phosphorylation site on Id2 is essential for Id2 enhancement of SMC growth and Id2 inhibition of p21 expression. Our data suggest that the mechanism of this effect may in part involve regulation of nuclear transport of Id2, as the cdk2 phosphorylation site mutant was excluded from the nucleus. A possible explanation for the difference in nuclear transport of wild-type Id2versus the cdk2 phosphorylation site mutant is that bHLH partnering is regulated by this site. However, we were unable to define a bHLH factor that demonstrated differential binding characteristics between wild-type Id2 and the Id2 mutant. The expression pattern of Id2 in the rat carotid following arterial injury is consistent with its role as a cdk2-dependent regulator of p21. Cyclin E and cdk2 are not detected in the medium of uninjured rat carotid arteries but are abundantly expressed 36 h after injury. Medial expression then declines, and by 10 days, protein expression peaks and is localized to the neointima (17Wei G.L. Krasinski K. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Andres V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that like cyclin E/cdk2, Id2 is initially expressed in the media. At this time p21 levels remain low (18Yang Z.Y. Simari R.D. Perkins N.D. San H. Gordon D. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7905-7910Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and proliferation is high (3Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). Id2 protein is subsequently abundantly expressed in the neointima when cyclin E and cdk2 are also abundant, and p21 expression is inhibited. Interestingly, Id2 is also expressed in the neointima of the injured rat carotid 14 and 28 days after injury, a time when the proliferative index is declining (3Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent contradiction could be explained by the fall in cyclin E/cdk2 levels and our data demonstrating that the cyclin E/cdk2 phosphorylation site of Id2 is essential for Id2-induced SMC proliferation. Although Id2 protein is detected within the neointima as late as 28 days after injury, it is likely that the majority of Id2 after 10–14 days is present in the unphosphorylated form, rendering it inactive as an inhibitor of p21 expression and an enhancer of SMC proliferation. The role of Id2 at these late time points is unknown. As the Id class of HLH factors is known to also regulate differentiation in a variety of cell types, it is interesting to speculate that Id2 may have additional but currently unknown roles in regulating the SMC phenotypic modulation seen after vascular injury. In summary, the results of the present study provide evidence that the helix-loop-helix factor Id2 enhances SMC proliferation at least in part via a cdk2-dependent inhibition of p21 gene expression. Further understanding of the factors that regulate Id2 expression and function in response to vascular injury and additional targets for Id2-induced effects on SMC proliferation will not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vascular lesion formation, but may also provide potential targets for limiting the SMC proliferative response to vascular injury.

In the present study, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of the Cu(II)-bound and the metal-free types of Bm at a high resolution of 1.6 and 1.8 Å, respectively, which are complexed with a Bm resistance determinant from Bm-producing S. verticillus, designated BLMA.

A family of Bm is different from one another in the terminal amine moiety. The Fe(II)-bound Bm complex, in conjunction with the reducing agent and oxygen, causes a nucleotide sequence-specific DNA cleavage (2Burger M.R. Peisach J. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

In addition, recent studies have shown that Bm can cleave the unusual tertiary structures of RNA (7Magliozzo R.S. Peisach J. Ciriolo M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 428-432PubMed Google Scholar, 8Carter B.J. de Vroom E. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Hecht S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9373-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To clarify the correlations between the structure and DNA-cleaving function of the Bm molecule, it is necessary to determine the tertiary structure of Bm. However, the x-ray crystallographic analysis of Bm had not been successful until our group (9Maruyama M. Kumagai T. Matoba Y. Hayashida M. Fujii Y. Hata Y. Sugiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9992-9999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) determined the x-ray crystal structure of Bm complexed with the transposon Tn5-carried Bm-binding protein. Within the last several years, in fact, the detailed molecular interactions of Bm with DNA have been mainly studied with NMR spectroscopy (6Wu W. Vanderwall D.E. Turner C.J. Kozarich J.W. Stubbe J.

We have cloned and sequenced a gene, designated blmA, which confers resistance to Bm, from Bm-producing S. verticillus (11Sugiyama M. Thompson C.J. Kumagai T. Suzuki K. Deblaere R. Villarroel R. Davies J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The gene blmAhas been shown to encode an acidic protein with a strong affinity for Bm. The Bm-binding protein, designated BLMA, has been physicochemically characterized (12Sugiyama M. Kumagai T. Matsuo H. Bhuiyan M.Z.A. Ueda K. Mochizuki H. Nakamura N. Davies J.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have determined the crystal structure of BLMA at a high resolution of 1.5 Å by the single isomorphous replacement method including the anomalous scattering effect (13Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J.E. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At a 2.3-Å resolution, another group (14Dumas P. Bergdoll M. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2483-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of the Shble protein, which is a Bm-binding protein from tallysomycin-producingStreptoalloteichus hindustanus (15Stackebrandt E. Rainey F.A. Ward-Rainey N.L. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 479-491Crossref Scopus (1328) Google Scholar, 16Gatignol A. Durand H. Tiraby G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both research groups have independently given a model in which the dimeric formation of the protein generates two pockets for binding to Bm. The Escherichia coli transposon Tn5 carries a gene, designated ble, that confers resistance to Bm. Theble gene product, designated BLMT, has been determined to be a Bm-binding protein, like BLMA (17Kumagai T. Nakano T. Maruyama M. Mochizuki H. Sugiyama M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Adam E. Volkert M.R. Blot M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of BLMT shares sequence homology (21%) with BLMA. We have determined the x-ray crystal structures of BLMT uncomplexed and complexed with the metal-free Bm at 1.7- and 2.5-Å resolutions, respectively (9Maruyama M. Kumagai T. Matoba Y. Hayashida M. Fujii Y. Hata Y. Sugiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9992-9999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Structural analysis has shown that Bm complexes with BLMT via a binding pocket formed by BLMT dimerization. Furthermore, the structural study of BLMT, complexed with the metal-free Bm, has suggested that an axial ligand for a metal ion in the Bm molecule may be the primary amine in the β-aminoalanine moiety of Bm. In this study, because BLMAs complexed with the metal-bound Bm and the metal-free Bm were successfully crystallized, we determined the former and latter crystal structures at 1.6 and 1.8 Å, respectively. The high resolution crystallographic analysis of Cu(II)-bound Bm complexed with BLMA allowed the conclusions about the axial ligand for the metal ion. Furthermore, this high resolution analysis also showed that the occupation ratio of the cis-trans isomers with regard to the bithiazole moiety of Bm, accommodated in each of two pockets in the BLMA dimer, is different. In addition, a binding experiment in solution between metal-free Bm and BLMA demonstrated that the binding of the first Bm molecule to a pocket in the BLMA dimer gives rise to cooperative binding of the second Bm molecule to the other pocket. We discuss the solution binding data showing cooperativity between the binding sites in light of the structural results. BLMA, overproduced using an E. coli host vector system, was purified according to the methods described previously (13Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J.E. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Kawano Y. Kamiya N. Davies J. Sugiyama M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For the crystallization of BLMA complexed with metal-free Bm, the protein was dissolved in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of Bm A2 (bleomycin having the γ-aminopropyldimethylsulfonium moiety as a terminal amine is called bleomycin A2) sulfate (a gift from Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.) for 1 h at room temperature. The molar ratio of Bm A2was suitable for complete binding to BLMA. Crystals of the BLMA· metal-free Bm complex were obtained by vapor diffusion at 25 °C using the hanging-drop method (20McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals.1st ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar) with a precipitant solution of 17.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 with 0.2 m ammonium acetate and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 5.6). The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P21, with unit cell dimensions a = 35.5 Å, b = 83.4 Å, c = 43.2 Å, and β = 105°. Diffraction data were collected on an R-AXIS IIc image plate system and processed with Process (21Higashi T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 253-257Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the BLMA·metal-free Bm complex was solved by the molecular replacement method using the programs in X-PLOR (22Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The start model was a dimeric BLMA structure uncomplexed with Bm, which was refined at a resolution of 1.5 Å (13Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J.E. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All of the model building was done on a Silicon Graphics work station with the program Xfit in the XtalView program suit (23McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Refinements were initially carried out using X-PLOR with very tight non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints, followed by higher resolution refinement with SHELXL (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). At late stages of refinement, NCS restraints were relaxed as guided by the crystallographic R factor andRfree (25Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3863) Google Scholar) and finally ignored. The solvent molecules were positioned into stereochemically reasonable peaks using ςA-weighted Fo −Fc and 2Fo −Fc electron density maps. The final model, refined at a 1.8-Å resolution, had excellent geometry with no NCS restraints. The topology and the parameter files for the Bm molecule were originally written by us in our laboratory. The parameters for the metal-binding domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the valeryl moiety in the linker domain of the Bm A2 molecule were made with reference to the crystal structures of the P-3A·Cu(II) complex (26Iitaka Y. Nakamura H. Nakatani T. Muraoka Y. Fujii A. Takita T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 1070-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), 3-(2′-phenyl-2,4′-bithiazole-4-carboxamide)propyl dimethylsulfonium iodide (27Kuroda R. Neidle S. Riordan J.M. Sakai T.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4753-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 4-amino-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-n-valeric acid (28Nakamura H. Takita T. Umezawa H. Muraoka Y. Iitaka Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1974; 27: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), respectively. The parameters for other parts (threonine in the linker domain and gulose and mannose in the sugar domain) of the Bm molecule were prepared using the energy minimization structure with the program CAChe. The Bm A2 hydrochloride copper complex (a gift from Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.) was used as the Cu(II)·Bm. The crystals of BLMA, complexed with the Cu(II)·Bm, were obtained by vapor diffusion at 25 °C using the hanging-drop method with the precipitant solution of 30.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 with 0.2 m ammonium acetate and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0. Data were collected on an R-AXIS IIc image plate system and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space groupP21 with unit cell dimensions a= 35.7 Å, b = 83.5 Å, c = 43.1 Å, and β = 106° and were isomorphous with the BLMA·metal-free Bm crystal. The crystal structure of the BLMA·Cu(II)·Bm complex was resolved by rigid body refinement of the BLMA·metal-free Bm structure against the BLMA·Cu(II)·Bm data. The model was built using the program XtalView and refined to a 1.6-Å resolution using X-PLOR (22Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). After the convergence on X-PLOR, further refinements were performed with the program SHELXL (23McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The solvent molecules were positioned as described above. Although a molecule positioned just below the putative equatorial plane of Bm initially seemed to be a water molecule, judging from the unusually lowB factor of the molecule, it was replaced by chloride ion. Because this replacement resulted in a slight decrease in Rfactor, it is accurate to think that the molecule assigned to the position is chloride ion. For copper and chloride ions, anisotropic temperature factors are introduced. Data collection and the refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The solution (10 μl) containing Bm A2 sulfate was added at a final range of 0.02 to 2.5 μm to 3 ml of 1 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.12 μm of the BLMA dimer. To estimate the protein concentration, the molar absorption coefficient (ε280 = 3.86 × 104m−1 cm−1), calculated from the number of Trp and Tyr residues in BLMA, was employed. The precise concentration of Bm A2 sulfate was determined by the potentiometric pH titration method using 0.1 m NaOH. The experiment was done at 25 °C using a spectrofluorophotometer (model RF-500, Shimadz, Japan) under the condition of λ excitation = 245 nm, λ emission = 332 nm, slit width at excitation = 10 nm, and slit width at emission = 10 nm, due to six Trp residues in the BLMA dimer. The fluorescent intensity in solution of the protein is progressively quenched by the dose of increasing concentrations of Bm. This quenching is related to Trp65 in the Bm-binding pockets. Assuming that the level of fluorescence of the quenched protein, caused by the binding of the first Bm to the BLMA dimer, is the same as that by the binding of the second Bm, the quenched fluorescence must be proportional to the concentration of Bm bound to the protein. The estimated ratio of fluorescent intensity for the fully Bm-bound dimeric BLMA against the Bm-free dimeric BLMA was 0.226. Because the degree of the quenched fluorescent intensity by the dose of overexcess concentrations of Bm is not accurately obtained from the experiment, this parameter was handled as variable for the simulation of the two dissociation constants. The final 2Fo − Fc maps for the current Bm-complexed model show that the electron density is of high quality (data not shown). Like Pro residues, almost all aromatic amino acid residues have a low density hole through the center of the rings, as expected for the maps at a resolution of 1.6 Å. Fig. 2a shows the crystal structure of BLMA complexed with Cu(II)·Bm. The topology of BLMA complexed with Bm is almost the same as that of the Bm-uncomplexed protein determined previously at a 1.5-Å resolution (13Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J.E. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The monomeric BLMA molecule consists of three α-helices (α1, α2, and α3) and two β-pleated sheets, in addition to an N-terminal β-strand (β1). The BLMA monomer has two very similar domains connected to the α2-helix. The N-terminal domain is composed of the α1-helix and one β-pleated sheet comprising four β-strands (β2–β5). The C-terminal domain consists of the α3-helix and one β-pleated sheet comprising five β-strands (β6–β10) (13Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J.E. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The current model contains two monomeric BLMA molecules and two Cu(II)·Bm molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two monomeric BLMA molecules, related by the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, form the dimeric structure, and a dimer accommodates two Cu(II)·Bm molecules (2:2 complex). In this study, one monomeric BLMA molecule, which takes a large conformational change at the type I β-turn composed of the residues from Ser100 to Gly103, was designated subunit A. The partner's monomer was designated subunit B. In addition, to discuss the binding mode between Bm and BLMA in detail, the protein dimer structure was divided into four regions, designated I to IV, as shown in Fig. 2a. This figure shows that regions I and III consist of the N-terminal domain of subunits A (blue) and B (red), respectively. Region II consists of the C-terminal domain of subunit A and the N-terminal β-strand of subunit B. Region IV is composed of the C-terminal domain of subunit B and the N-terminal β-strand of subunit A. The dimer form, generated by alternate arm exchange of the monomeric BLMA molecule, results in two large concavities and two grooves (Fig.2b). Two Cu(II)·Bm molecules are accommodated in the two Bm-binding pockets. To distinguish the two Bm molecules accommodated in each of the pockets, the Bm accommodated between regions I and IV is designated Bm-I. The other Bm molecule, accommodated between regions II and III, is called Bm-II. Interestingly, the electron density map of the bithiazole moiety of Bm-II shows that the orientation of the two thiazolium rings takestrans-conformation (Fig.3b), whereas that of Bm-I shows the mixture of cis- and trans-conformations (Fig. 3c). In many cases, the most aromatic residues are in the interior of protein. However, the long groove surface of BLMA has aromatic residues, such as Phe33A(B), Phe33A(B), Phe38A(B), His49A(B), Trp65B(A), and His117B(A), suggesting that the groove exhibits strong hydrophobicity (Fig. 2b). The BLMA dimer has 12 Asp and 8 Glu residues. The negative charge, brought by these amino acids, is neutralized by interactions with the positively charged residues and by a positive electrostatic potential through the helix-dipole effect. However, the Asp45 and Glu122 residues are not neutralized by the interactions mentioned above. A cleft crossing vertically to the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis is observed on the interface of the BLMA dimer. The negatively charged residues, such as Asp45, Glu122, Asp32, and Glu67, are in the cleft (Fig. 2c). The asymmetric unit of the Bm-uncomplexed BLMA crystal contains one subunit. The crystallographic 2-fold axis relates two subunits in a dimer. Deviation from symmetry may not be detected due to the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (13Kawano Y. Kumagai T. Muta K. Matoba Y. Davies J.E. Sugiyama M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the content of an asymmetric unit of the Bm-complexed BLMA crystals is a full dimer. The high resolution analysis at 1.6 Å enabled us to analyze the deviation from symmetry. Subunits A and B are aligned in a rigid body superposition to fit the main-chain atoms of each Met1–Glu122 residue (Fig.4). The positional root mean square deviation of the main-chain atom pairs is 0.44 Å. Primarily, the marked conformational difference observed between both subunits is found at the type I β-turn from Ser100A(B) to Gly103A(B). When compared with the Bm-uncomplexed BLMA, the type I β-turn of subunit A shifts more largely toward the bithiazole moiety of Cu(II)·Bm than that of subunit B. Another remarkable conformational difference between subunits A and B is observed at the type II′ β-turn region composed of residues from Arg43A(B) to Ile46A(B), which is positioned far from the Bm-binding sites. The type II′ β-turn of subunit B, which interacts with the N-terminal β-strand from subunit A, takes a stable structure. However, the type II′ β-turn of subunit A, having no interaction with the N-terminal β-strand of subunit B, is flexible. BLMA complexed with Cu(II)·Bm is aligned with the protein uncomplexed with Bm using a least squares rigid body superposition (Fig. 5a). The positional root mean square deviation between both structures is 0.82 Å for the main-chain atoms. Primarily, the major conformational change that occurred by binding to Bm is observed at the type I β-turn region of each protein subunit, composed from Ser100A(B) to Gly103A(B) (Fig. 5a). When compared with the Bm-uncomplexed BLMA, the type I β-turn in the Bm-complexed protein shifts about 5.4 Å for Pro101A and about 3.6 Å for Pro101B, respectively, toward the bithiazole moiety of Cu(II)·Bm. This conformational difference is generated by the hydrophobic interaction between the bithiazole moiety and Pro101A(B). Pro101A shifts more closely to the penultimate thiazolium ring than Pro101B. The turn region, in the Bm-uncomplexed BLMA, is moderately flexible, whereas this region is conformationally rigid due to the binding of Bm to BLMA. In addition, the B factors of the region in subunit A are lower than those in subunit B. These observations suggest that Bm-II, accommodated in a pocket with a marked conformational change, binds more strongly to BLMA than Bm-I accommodated in the other pocket. Because the type II′ β-turn composed of the residues from Arg43 to Ile46 in one subunit of the Bm-uncomplexed BLMA dimer interacts with the N-terminal β-strand of the subunit of the partner, the β-turn can take a stable structure. On the other hand, although the β-turn composed from Arg43 to Ile46 in subunit B of the Bm-complexed BLMA dimer interacts with the N-terminal β-strand of subunit A, that in subunit A has no interaction with the N-terminal β-strand of subunit B. This suggests that the connectivity between regions I and II is weaker than that between regions III and IV. The two points mentioned above are local conformational changes. From the generous comparison between Bm-uncomplexed and -complexed BLMA, it is obvious that all conformational changes in the widely spread sphere are found in regions II and IV but not in regions I and III (Fig.5b). The upper sphere in regions II and IV seems to rotate around the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, together with the large conformational change of the type I β-turn composed from Ser100A(B) to Gly103A(B) (Fig.5b). The side chains of charged residues such as Glu30, Arg42, Arg47, Glu76, Glu77, Arg80, and Glu99, located on the protein surface, give the large conformational change. Some of these changes may be affective for Bm binding. Furthermore, residues such as Lys31, Arg36, Ile66, and Thr119 are disordered in the Bm-uncomplexed and -complexed BLMA. Residue Glu105 in the Bm-uncomplexed BLMA is also disordered, whereas Glu105A(B) in the Bm-complexed structure is stable due to formation of hydrogen bonds with the Nδ1 atom of His117A(B) and the Nε1 atom of Trp65B(A). To investigate whether each of the two Bm-binding pockets may express a different affinity for Bm, the dissociation constants of each pocket for the antibiotic in solution were measured. In this study, we defined the dissociation constants for the first and second Bm bindings to each of the two Bm-binding pockets in the BLMA dimer ((BLMA)2) as Kd1 and Kd2, respectively, shown in the following Reactions 1 and 2 and Equations 1 and 2. (BLMA)2+Bm⇄Kd1(BLMA)2·BmREACTION1(BLMA)2·Bm+Bm⇄Kd2(BLMA)2·(Bm)2REACTION2Kd1=[Bm][(BLMA)2]/[(BLMA)2·Bm][M]…Equation 1 Kd2=[Bm][(BLMA)2·Bm]/[(BLMA)2·(Bm)2][M]…Equation 2 The Kd1 andKd2 values obtained by the non-linear least squares method were 630 (±60) and 120 (±10) nm, respectively. Fig. 6 shows that the quenched fluorescent intensity (ΔF) of the protein at the given concentrations of Bm is plotted against the logarithmic concentration of free Bm, which is not bound to the protein. The observed points are agreeably positioned on a solid line obtained by simulation. Assuming that the binding affinity of BLMA for the first Bm is the same as that for the second Bm,Kd2 must be equal to 4 timesKd1. WhenKd1 andKd2 are assumed to be half and twice the average value of [(Kd1·Kd2)1/2], respectively, the calculated curve is expressed as a dotted line in Fig. 6. The most interesting aspect of this solution experiment is that the affinity for the second binding to the pocket of BLMA is about 20 times more favorable than that for the first binding, indicating the existence of cooperativity in the binding of Bm with BLMA. The structure of BLMA is a dimer with two Bm-binding pockets composed of two large concavities and two long grooves. Each pocket accommodates one Bm molecule. Because the binding mode between BLMA and Bm is almost the same in each pocket, especially for the metal-binding and sugar domains of Cu(II)·Bm, the following description is mainly focused on one pocket formed between regions II and III. The linker, metal-binding, and sugar domains of Cu(II)·Bm are buried in the large concavity (Fig. 2, b andd) and stabilized by forming a large number of hydrogen bonds with the protein atoms (Fig.7a). The amino group, which is attached to the pyrimidine ring in the metal-binding domain of Cu(II)·Bm, interacts with the hydrogen bonds to two backbone-carbonyl oxygens from Gly113A and Thr62A. The carbonyl oxygen of the pyrimidinylpropionamide moiety of Bm forms hydrogen bonds with the Tyr86A hydroxyl group. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the terminal amide group of the pyrimidinylpropionamide moiety form a number of hydrogen bonds with the Ser51B hydroxyl group and the Arg52B carbonyl oxygen, respectively. These atoms also form hydrogen bonds with the protein atoms via water molecules. However, other components of the metal-binding domain, such as β-aminoalanine and β-hydroxyhistidine, make no polar interactions with the protein atoms. In the sugar domain of Cu(II)·Bm, the mannose moiety, but not the gulose one, contributes to the binding to the protein. In detail, the nitrogen atom of the carbamoyl group, attached to the 3′-hydroxyl oxygen of the mannose moiety, forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the Asp60A and with the Asp60A side-chain carboxylate via Wat679. In contrast, the oxygen atom of the carbamoyl group forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the amino group of the β-aminoalanine moiety of Bm. By forming the hydrogen bond, the 4′-hydroxyl group also interacts with the Arg109Aguanidino group. The linker domain of Cu(II)·Bm, which connects the bithiazole moiety and the metal-binding d"

Cephalosporin acylase (CA) is a recently identified member of the N-terminal hydrolase family that is activated from an inactive precursor by autoproteolytic processing, generating a new N-terminal residue, which is either a Ser or a Thr. The N-terminal Ser or Thr becomes a nucleophilic catalytic center for intramolecular and intermolecular amide cleavages. The gene structure of the open reading frame of CAs generally consists of a signal peptide followed by the α-subunit, a spacer sequence, and the β-subunit, which are all translated into a single polypeptide chain, the CA precursor. The precursor is post-translationally modified into an active heterodimeric enzyme with α- and β-subunits, first by intramolecular cleavage and second by intermolecular cleavage. We solved the first CA precursor structure (code 1KEH) from a class I CA from Pseudomonas diminuta at a 2.5-Å resolution that provides insight into the mechanism of intramolecular cleavage. A conserved water molecule, stabilized by four hydrogen bonds in unusual pseudotetrahedral geometry, plays a key role to assist the OG atom of Ser1βto generate a strong nucleophile. In addition, the site of the secondary intermolecular cleavage of CA is proposed to be the carbonyl carbon of Gly158α (Kim, S., and Kim, Y., (2001)J. Biol. Chem., 276, 48376–48381), which is different from the situation in two other class I CAs. Autocatalytic proteolytic cleavage is a frequently observed post-translational modification in proteins.

Many protein systems are modified by intramolecular and/or intermolecular cleavages from precursors to be active enzymes. N-terminal (Ntn)1 hydrolases form a novel class of hydrolytic enzymes that are activated from an inactive precursor polypeptide by autoproteolytic processing, generating a new N-terminal residue (1Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The newly generated Ntn residue of the processed chain carries out two catalytic functions, i.e. it is both a nucleophile and a proton donor. The Ntn hydrolase superfamily was defined by SCOP (structural classification of proteins) as containing four layers of α-helices and β-sheets in an αββα fashion (2Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). There were five known families of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily: class II glutamine amidotransferases, penicillin G acylase, penicillin V acylase, proteasome subunit, and glycosylasparaginase (GA) (2Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported by identifying the αββα motif in cephalosporin acylase that cephalosporin acylase also belongs to one family of Ntn hydrolase superfamily (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several Ntn hydrolases are activated through autoproteolytic processing by Ser, Thr, or Cys residues. The autoproteolytic processing was observed to occur in an intramolecular manner in several Ntn hydrolases including glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, penicillin G acylase, proteasome b subunit (PS), GA, and cephalosporin acylase (CA) (4Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ditzel L. Huber R. Mann K. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The structures of the precursors of GA and of PS were determined, and autoproteolytic mechanisms for intramolecular cleavage by Thr residue are proposed (6Ditzel L. Huber R. Mann K. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, those two Ntn hydrolases, GA and PS, proceed to autoproteolysis along different paths even if the same amino acid, Thr, is used as a key nucleophile for autoproteolysis: a water enhances the nucleophilicity of the Thr Oγ at the +1 position in PS, whereas the carboxylate of Asp151 at the −1 position promotes the nucleophilicity of the Thr152 at the +1 position in GA. It is known that the intramolecular proteolysis proceeds to an N→O or N→S acyl shift (8Tikkanen R. Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L.

The resulting N-terminal Ser, Thr, or Cys residue becomes exposed to solvent to play the role of the nucleophilic catalytic center for Ntn hydrolases (1Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J.

The gene structure of the open reading frame of CAs varies with each enzyme but generally consists of a signal peptide followed by an α-subunit, a spacer sequence, and a β-subunit. The genes of CAs are translated into an inactive single precursor peptide that is post-translationally modified into an active enzyme with one α-subunit and one β-subunit (11Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All known CAs use either Ser or Thr as a key nucleophile to carry out both autoproteolysis and enzymatic deacylation. It was suggested that the nascent polypeptide of cephalosporin acylase is autoproteolytically activated through a two-step autocatalytic process upon folding (5Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The first step is an intramolecular cleavage of the precursor at the start of β-subunit, resulting in an α-subunit, a spacer peptide attached to the C terminus of the α-subunit, and a β-subunit. The second step is an intermolecular event, which may be mediated by the newly generated N-terminal Ser or Thr of β-subunit by intramolecular cleavage. The second event results in a further cleavage at the second scissile bond and finally releases the spacer peptide (11Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Lee Y.S. Kim H.W. Park S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39200-39206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Presently, the mechanism of the intramolecular cleavage of CA is not yet understood, and furthermore, it is not even clear which residue of the spacer peptide is cleaved during the secondary intermolecular cleavage (11Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Lee Y.S. Kim H.W. Park S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39200-39206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CA has so far only been used to a limited extent to produce 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), which is a backbone chemical in synthesizing semisynthetic cephalosporins. Because of the poor efficiency of CAs in generating 7-ACA, the majority of 7-ACA is obtained in industry by an expensive chemical process from cephalosporin C using expensive toxic compounds, which causes environmental safety problems. Therefore, CA has been a target for protein engineering to modify its substrate specificity so as to carry out a more efficient enzymatic conversion of cephalosporin C to 7-ACA with cephalosporin C as substrate (13Binder R. Brown J. Romancik G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tischer W. Giesecke U. Lang G. Roder A. Wedekind F. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

A class I CA from Pseudomonas diminuta KAC-1 (CAD) is an Ntn hydrolase, and the Ser1β of CAD, 2The notation of amino acid sequence in precursor CAD is identical to CAD up to the residue 158α (3Kim Y.

The α-subunit is represented by attaching “α” at the end of the residue number, and the β-subunit is represented by putting “β” at the end of the residue number. Additionally, the spacer residue is represented by putting “s” at the end of a residue number, such as 159s. The spacer sequence of precursor CAD, which is from residue 159s to 169s in this structure, was included as part of α-subunit in the previous study (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G.

For example, residues 159–169 were described as 159α–169α in the previous study (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G.

The site of the secondary intermolecular cleavage is not yet clearly defined. In the current report, we describe the first precursor structure of CA, which explains the mechanism of the intramolecular autoproteolysis of the protein. This structure reveals that one conserved water, present both in precursor CAD and CAD, plays a key role in assisting the OG atom of Ser1β so that the nucleophilic OG atom can carry out an attack on the scissile carbonyl carbon of Gly169s. The conserved water is hydrogen bonding with four surrounding residues in an unusual pseudotetrahedral geometry. On the other hand, sites of secondary intermolecular cleavage were proposed in the other two class I CAs (5Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li Y.

However, our data propose that the secondary intermolecular cleavage may occur at the carbonyl carbon of Gly158α, which is different from the report on the other known two class I CAs.

The S1βA precursor CAD concentration was 10 mg ml−1 in a storage buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl). The S1βA precursor CAD crystals grew overnight at 21 °C from hanging drops containing 3 μl of protein solution (10 mg ml−1 S1βA precursor CAD, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mmNaCl) and 3 μl of reservoir solution (20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mmmagnesium acetate, and 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5) by the vapor diffusion method against a 500-μl reservoir solution. The S1βA precursor CAD crystals grew under very similar conditions as the native CAD crystals (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and they belong to the same space group P41212 with almost identical unit cell dimensions. There is a single chain precursor of 77 kDa/asymmetric unit and 57% solvent content. Crystals were transferred to a cryo-solution containing 23% (w/v) PEG 8000, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 200 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium cacodylate for 3 days before flash-cooling in a 100 K gaseous nitrogen stream. The long soaking time of the S1βA precursor CAD crystal in the cryo-solution improved crystal quality tremendously by reducing mosaicity. Data set for a S1βA precursor CAD crystal was collected to a resolution of 2.5 Å at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) 5.0.2 beamline from the frozen crystals using a wavelength of 0.91 Å. All data were indexed and integrated using DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar). The S1βA precursor CAD structure yielded an excellent initial crystallographic model based on the CAD structure, and only minor adjustments are needed in the course of refinement. The Fo −Fc difference Fourier maps provided an excellent guide to locate spacer residues (see Fig. 1). Only the spacer residues were built using XtalView/Xfit (19McRee D. J. Struct.

In the S1βA precursor CAD structure, 86.6, 12.6, and 0.5% of the main chain dihedral angles are in the most favorable, the additionally allowed, and generously allowed regions, respectively. Only one residue, Phe177β, which is positioned in the active site, is located in a disallowed region, in agreement with the observation of Herzberg and Moult (23Herzberg O. Moult J.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously reported that the S1βA mutant protein completely lost intramolecular autoproteolytic activity (17Kwon T.H. Rhee S. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 2000: 79-81Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To obtain a non-processed CAD precursor for structure determination, the S1βA CAD mutant protein was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and the size of non-cleaved precursor CAD was confirmed by SDS-PAGE from cell extract of the S1βA mutant of precursor CAD (data not shown). A 77-kDa S1βA protein, which contains an α-subunit, a spacer, and a β-subunit, appeared as a single band that corresponds to non-processed CAD (data not shown). The structure of the S1βA precursor CAD was determined to a 2.5-Å resolution (Table I). In the course of the structure refinement, the Fo −Fc difference Fourier map, with all the spacer residues omitted for phase calculation, showed clear positive density for spacer sequence prior to adding any information of these backbone residues in the unbiased map (Fig. 1). The 11 residues of the spacer from 159s to 169s (EGDPPDLADQG) were easily built into the Fo − Fcdifference map using O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) and were refined using CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar) to an Rcryst of 20.3% and an Rfree of 23.7% (TableI). (The sequence of spacer peptide and the determination of the secondary intermolecular cleavage site will be discussed below.) The structure of S1βA precursor CAD is shown in ribbon diagrams (Fig. 2,A and B). The red spacer structure adopts a loop conformation (P-loop) and is attached at two ends: one end is linked to the α-helical end of an α-subunit (Gly158α), and the other is attached to the start of β-strand of a β-subunit (Ser1β). The overall conformation of the precursor CAD structure is very similar to CAD structure (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) such that a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.18 Å is obtained after superimposing 672 common Cα atoms. The Cαs of the nine active site residues of CAD, which interact directly with the substrate (16Kim Y. Hol W.G.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), glutaryl-7-ACA (GL-7-ACA), superimpose onto the corresponding Cα atoms of precursor CAD with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.22 Å. This indicates that conformational change is negligible in the active site before and after autoproteolysis. Even the crucial Ser1β hardly changes position after activation, with an r.m.s. deviation of all common Ala/Ser1β atoms in the two structures of 0.06 Å and a shift in position of the Cβ atom of 0.11 Å (Fig. 3). Apparently, the conformation of the active site is virtually fully established in precursor CAD.Figure 3Superposition of CAD and S1βA precursor CAD structures. Nine interacting residues with the substrate (16Kim Y. Hol W.G.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), GL-7-ACA, are superimposed onto each other. Active site residues are shown in ball-and-stick models. The S1βA precursor CAD is shown ingray, and the CAD structure is shown in black. The mutation of Ser1β to Ala is labeled as S1βA in the precursor CAD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The key difference between precursor and mature enzyme is that the P-loop of the precursor proceeds through the substrate-binding site (16Kim Y. Hol W.G.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) so that it blocks binding of GL-7-ACA (Fig.4). The side chain of the precursor residue, Gln168s, occupies the binding site of the four-membered β-lactam ring that is fused to a six-membered ring of GL-7-ACA, but the binding pocket for the glutaryl side chain of GL-7-ACA remains unoccupied. In addition, the carboxylic side chain of the precursor residue, Asp154s, is located at the same position a carboxyl group that is attached to a six-membered ring of GL-7-ACA occupies when the substrate is placed into the tentative binding site of precursor CAD (Fig. 4). Once the spacer is cleaved at one end by intramolecular cleavage, the spacer peptide becomes free to move its C-terminal end elsewhere. After the first intramolecular cleavage step, the key nucleophile for enzymatic catalysis (Ser1β) is liberated to be functional for enzymatic reaction. As a result, the substrate-binding site is available for substrate (GL-7-ACA), and also probably for intermolecular cleavage of the spacer peptide at the secondary cleavage site. In the CAD structure (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the nucleophilic OG atom of Ser1β is making a hydrogen bond with a water molecule (WAT1 in Fig. 5A), which in its turn makes two additional hydrogen bonds, one with the main chain NH of Val70β and another with the OD1 atom of Asn244β. The latter residue, which plays a key role in the chemical catalysis of CAs (3Kim Y. Yoon K.H. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.J.G. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), is conserved among four classes of CAs (CA I–IV), including penicillin G acylase, that go through the same path of chemical catalysis (29Duggleby H.J. Tolley S.P. Hill C.P. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Moody P.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The Ala1β residue of the S1βA precursor CAD can be modeled as Ser1β, based on the structural comparison of active site conformations between S1βA precursor CAD and mature CAD as represented in Fig. 3. The OG atom was added to the residue Ala1β of the S1βA precursor CAD, resembling the torsional geometry of the OG atom of Ser1β residue in CAD structure as shown in Fig.5A, thereby resulting in a model of Ser1β in the S1βA precursor CAD (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, water WAT1 of CAD (Fig. 5A) is also present at the same location in precursor CAD (Fig. 5B), but in the latter, it is forming four hydrogen bonds in pseudotetrahedral geometry with the main chain NH of Val70β, the OD1 of Asn244β, the carbonyl oxygen of Gln168s, and the OG of S1βA. The conserved water (WAT1) of S1βA precursor CAD shown in Fig.5B functions similarly to a member of the catalytic triad of serine proteases (30Stryer L. Biochemistry.4th edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1995: 222-227Google Scholar). During catalysis by serine proteases, the OG atom of Ser is polarized to become a catalytic nucleophile by the proton acceptors such as His and Asp (30Stryer L. Biochemistry.4th edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1995: 222-227Google Scholar). In precursor CAD, the conserved water donates its two hydrogens to two hydrogen acceptors (the carbonyl oxygen of Gln168s and OD1 of Asn244β) and accepts two hydrogens from the hydroxyl group of Ser1β and the main chain NH of Val70β, thereby assisting in carrying out the nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the serine in intramolecular cleavage. Given the closely similar conformations of Ser1β in CAD and Ala1β in S1βA precursor CAD, we are assuming in the following discussion that the OG of Ser1β in S1βA precursor CAD adopts a position, which is close to that observed in the Ser1β of CAD (Fig. 5, A and B). On the basis of the conformation of the conserved water WAT1 in Fig. 5,A and B, we would propose a plausible mechanism for the intramolecular cleavage of precursor CA (Fig.6, A and B). The overall schematic summary shown in Fig. 6A is that the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of Gly169s by the OG atom of Ser1β results in an ester formation between th"

We have now investigated the outcome of ectopic CRBP expression in MTSV1-7 cells, a SV40 T antigen-transformed human breast epithelial cell line devoid of endogenous CRBP expression. We found that: (i) CRBP did not inhibit adherent cell growth but suppressed foci formation in post-confluent cultures and colony formation in soft agar; (ii) this effect was due to CRBP inhibition of cell survival, as demonstrated by viability and TUNEL assays of cells in soft-agar or plated on polyHEMA-coated dishes; (iii) CRBP inhibited protein kinase B/Akt activation in cells in suspension but not in adherent cells and the CRBP suppression of anchorage-independent growth was mimicked by cell treatment with the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002; (iv) CRBP enhanced retinyl ester formation and storage but did not regulate retinoic acid synthesis or retinoic acid receptor activity. Ectopic CRBP-mediated inhibition of anchorage-independent cell survival and colony formation in the absence of significantly altered responses to either retinol or retinoic acid was also documented in T47D human breast cancer cells. In conclusion, the data suggest two novel and linked CRBP functions in mammary epithelial cells: inhibition of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway and suppression of anchorage-independent growth."
https://openalex.org/W1999119465,"In many embryonic tissues, type IIA procollagen is synthesized and deposited into the extracellular matrix containing the NH2-propeptide, the cysteine-rich domain of which binds to bone morphogenic proteins. To investigate whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) synthesized during development and disease can cleave the NH2 terminus of type II procollagens, we tested eight types of enzymes. Recombinant trimeric type IIA collagen NH2-propeptide encoded by exons 1–8 fused to the lectin domain of rat surfactant protein D was used as a substrate. The latter allowed trimerization of the propeptide domain and permitted isolation by saccharide affinity chromatography. Although MMPs 1, 2, and 8 did not show cleavage, MMPs 3, 7, 9, 13, and 14 cleaved the recombinant protein both at the telopeptide region and at the procollagen N-proteinase cleavage site. MMPs 7 and 13 demonstrated other cleavage sites in the type II collagen-specific region of the N-propeptide; MMP-7 had another cleavage site close to the COOH terminus of the cysteine-rich domain. To prove that an MMP can cleave the native type IIA procollagen in situ, we demonstrated that MMP-7 removes the NH2-propeptide from collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix of fetal cartilage and identified the cleavage products. Because the N-proteinase and telopeptidase cleavage sites are present in both type IIA and type IIB procollagens and the telopeptide cleavage site is retained in the mature collagen fibril, this processing could be important to type IIB procollagen and to mature collagen fibrils as well.

Sci. 1985; 460: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and type IIA during skeletal development. We have shown that the type IIA form of type II procollagen retains the NH2-propeptide when synthesized during chondrogenesis and in other embryonic tissues where type II collagen is made, such as notochord, aorta, kidney, and skin (2Oganesian A.

In type I, and presumably type II and type III procollagens, the NH2-propeptide is removed from the procollagen by a specific N-proteinase characterized by Prockop and colleagues (12Prockop D.J. Sieron A.L. Li S.W. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Eyre and colleagues (13Wu J.-J. Lark M.W. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5625-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that MMP-31 (stromelysin) can cleave type II collagen at two locations in the amino telopeptide just a few amino acids COOH-terminal of the N-proteinase cleavage site, thereby acting as a telopeptidase, suggesting the possibility that MMP-3 also can release the propeptide region. The ability of other MMPs to cleave this region is not known. We have shown recently that the cysteine-rich domain of type IIA procollagen NH2-propeptide binds to members of the TGF-β superfamily, TGF-β1 and BMP-2, thereby predicting an important function for the NH2-propeptide in the extracellular matrix (3Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the NH2-propeptide in the extracellular matrix could have significant effects on the binding or presentation of the BMPs. Support for this hypothesis comes from BMP-binding proteins that are involved in dorsal-ventral patterning: chordin inXenopus and sog in Drosophila. Chordin and sog are homologues containing the same cysteine-rich domain as the collagen NH2-propeptide and bind to BMP-4 and decapentaplegic, respectively (14Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 15Marques G. Musacchio M. Shimell M.J. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. Cho K.W. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Binding of these BMPs to chordin or sog inhibits interaction of the BMP with its cellular receptors. Furthermore, enzymic cleavage of chordin by the Xenopus enzyme xolloid and sog by the Drosophila enzyme tolloid serves to activate the bound BMP (14Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 15Marques G. Musacchio M. Shimell M.J. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. Cho K.W. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The type IIA pN-procollagen containing the cysteine-rich domain is deposited in the extracellular matrix providing potential localization of BMP in the insoluble compartment of the extracellular matrix. In analogy to cleavage of chordin and sog, the NH2-propeptide could be liberated by cleavage from the pN-procollagen. Cleavage of the procollagen in different domains would theoretically produce two different types of fragments. If cleavage takes place at the telopeptide the trimeric NH2-propeptide would be released; if cleavage takes place near the BMP-binding domain, monomeric cysteine rich domains could be liberated. Likely candidates for extracellular cleavage of pN procollagen are the MMPs and astacin proteinases such as tolloid and BMP-1 (procollagen C-proteinase). The purpose of this study was to determine the cleavage specificity of the potentially relevant MMPs. We tested MMPs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14 and found that MMPs 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14 were capable of specific cleavage of the type IIA procollagen NH2-propeptide at various sites. All enzymes cleave in domains common to both type IIA and type IIB procollagen, whereas MMPs 7 and 13 also cleave in the type II-specific minor helix and MMP-7 cleaves in the type IIA-specific cysteine-rich domain. In preliminary studies, we observed that recombinant propeptides of type IIA procollagen expressed in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells are secreted as monomers. To study the cleavage of a trimeric propeptide domain, we utilized a previously characterized chimera consisting of the propeptide domain of IIA procollagen linked to a surfactant protein D (SPD) sequence that encodes a contiguous coiled-coil trimerization domain and a C-type lectin domain (16Zhang P. McAlinden A. Li S. Schumacher T. Wang H. Hu S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein is secreted as a trimeric protein with a triple-helical minor helix and can be readily isolated by saccharide affinity chromatography on maltosyl-agarose. Triple-helical type II procollagen N-propeptide was prepared as a fusion protein with the neck region and lectin domain of rat SPD 2A. McAlinden, P. Zhang, J. G. Bann, E. C. Crouch, and L. J. Sandell, manuscript in preparation. (16Zhang P. McAlinden A. Li S. Schumacher T. Wang H. Hu S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, a IIA-SPD chimeric construct was synthesized by linking the cDNA encoding exons 1–8 of the human type II procollagen gene to the cDNA encoding the neck region and the carbohydrate recognition domain of rat SPD (Fig. 1, C and D). PCR overlap extension was used to create IIA-SPD cDNA in pGEM-3Z (17Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generated construct was excised from pGEM-3Z and ligated into the multiple cloning site of pEE14 (18Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this vector, stably transfected clones of Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cell were established using methionine sulfoximine as a selectable marker. To obtain IIA-SPD, the clones were cultured in glutamine-free Glasgow's minimum essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma) with 100–1000 μm methionine sulfoximine (Sigma). The purification of IIA-SPD followed the method previously used for recombinant rat SPD (18Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, medium from cultured cells was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Following recalcification, IIA-SPD was isolated by affinity chromatography on maltosyl-agarose (Bio-Rad). Recombinant human MMPs 1 (collagenase-1), 3 (stromelysin-1), 7 (matrilysin), 8 (neutrophil collagenase, collagenase-2), and 14 (catalytic domain, MT1-MMP) were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Recombinant human MMPs 2 (gelatinase A) and 9 (gelatinase B) were provided by Dr. Robert Senior (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Purified rat MMP-13 (collagenase-3) was obtained from Dr. John Jeffrey (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). Except for MMP-7 lacking propeptide domain and the catalytic domain of MMP-14, all the MMPs were activated by the incubation with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 1–24 h at 37 °C. For cleavage experiments, IIA-SPD and recombinant rat SPD were dialyzed against MMP cleavage buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and adjusted to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl. Cleavage was performed by incubating the substrates with each MMP at 37 °C for 24 h or as indicated, at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 w/w (for MMPs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 14) or 1:100 (for MMPs 7, 9, and 13). The ratios were determined by the efficiency of cleavage for the respective enzymes. The cleavage was then terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. The cleaved products of IIA-SPD were analyzed by silver staining and Western blotting. After the incubation with MMPs, the substrates were loaded onto 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Gradipore, North Ride, New South Wales, Australia) and electrophoresed under reducing conditions with 0.1m dithiothreitol, together with standard proteins (Benchmark™ prestained protein ladder, Invitrogen). The proteins were then visualized on the gel by silver staining. Western blot analysis was performed to determine which parts of the recombinant protein were contained in each fragment. For this, the samples were loaded under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, depending on the antibodies used. Proteins on the gel were then transferred to a supported nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) overnight at 30 V in Tris/glycine transfer buffer, pH 8.3, containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1% dry milk in PBS, containing the primary antibody. Rabbit antisera against recombinant human IIA-glutathioneS-transferase (2Oganesian A. Zhu Y. Sandell L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used as a primary antibody to detect the exon 2-encoded region in the propeptide domain of IIA-SPD (Fig. 1D) (IIA antiserum). Chicken IgY reactive with the region encoded by exons 3–8 of human type II procollagen, which includes NH2-propeptide and telopeptide domains of type IIB procollagen (Fig. 1D), was obtained from the yolks of the eggs from the chickens immunized with a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (3Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) containing this area (anti-IIE3–8). The specificity of this antibody against rat SPD or exon 2-encoded region of type IIA procollagen was confirmed (data not shown). The neck region and carbohydrate recognition domain in IIA-SPD was detected by SPD antiserum (19Crouch E. Parghi D. Kuan S.F. Persson A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L60-L66PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). For the detection of exon 2-encoded region, the samples were analyzed under nonreducing conditions because IIA antiserum does not strongly react with the reduced epitopes. For the other two antibodies, the samples were analyzed under reducing conditions with 0.1 mdithiothreitol as for gel staining. The primary antibodies were used at the concentrations of 1:1000 (IIA and SPD antisera) or 1:500 (anti-IIE3–8) in 1% dry milk in PBS. After washing in PBS, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase at the concentration of 1:2000 in 1% dry milk in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The analyses were accomplished by chemiluminescence on autoradiography films (ISO-MAX, Scimart, St. Louis, MO), using enhanced chemiluminescent reagents for horseradish peroxidase (SuperSignal™ West Pico, Pierce). NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed to determine the exact cleavage sites. Cleaved fragments were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene membrane (Sequi-Blot PVDF membrane, Bio-Rad). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, excised, then sequenced with an ABI 473A protein sequencer equipped with the model 610A data analysis software. For the bands with multiple sequences, initial and repetitive yields were used to assign identity of the cleavage site. Tissues from a 9-week gestation human fetus (provided by the Central Laboratory for Human Embryology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) were frozen in OCT compound (Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN), and 10-μm-thick sections were prepared with a cryostat and placed on a polylysine coated glass slides (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After initial preliminary experiments to establish enzyme to substrate levels, time of digestion, and washing conditions, 12 serial sections were subjected to MMP-7 digestion. They were divided into three sets of four serial sections. In each set, three sections were incubated with 50 μl of MMP cleavage buffer containing 5, 10, or 20 ng/μl MMP-7. The other one was treated with the same buffer containing both 10 ng/μl MMP-7 and 20 mm EDTA and served as a control (EDTA control). After the incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the sections were washed in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 60 min to remove the cleaved fragments. After MMP-7 treatment, the sections were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS solution for 10 min at room temperature. They were then treated with 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (type III, Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and blocked with 10% (v/v) normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Double immunostaining was performed. To detect type IIA NH2-propeptide, antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:400. To detect the major triple-helical domain, rat antiserum against bovine type II collagen (a gift from Dr. Michael Cremer, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN) was used at the concentration of 1:40. The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight in PBS containing the designated sera with 1% (v/v) normal donkey serum. Two other sections were incubated with normal rabbit and rat sera at the same concentrations and served for the normal sera control. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated sequentially with secondary antibodies for the respective primary antibodies: cyanine 3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment with a dilution of 1:200 and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 fragment with a dilution of 1:100. Finally, the sections were washed in PBS and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). All the normal sera and the secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Because MMP-7 does not cleave fibrillar type II collagen (data not shown), cleavage by MMP-7 in the exon 2–8-encoded region of native type IIA procollagen was evaluated quantitatively by the fluorescence intensity. Immunoreactivity for the exon 2-encoded region in NH2-propeptide was compared with that for the major triple-helical domain of type II collagen (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence intensity was measured by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The images for quantification were collected with a Bio-Rad MicroRadiance confocal microscope system mounted on a Nikon E800 upright fluorescence microscope, using Bio-Rad LaserSharp 2000 software (version 3.1). Confocal FITC images were collected at the excitation of 488 nm by the argon gas laser, obtaining fluorescence with a 515 ± 30 nm band pass filter. For cyanine 3, excitation was at 514 nm and a 600 nm long pass filter was used. For these, a Nikon 60× (1.4 numeric aperture) oil immersion objective was used. Because type IIA procollagen was found at high levels at the periphery of the developing cartilage, the change of the fluorescence following MMP-7 treatment was evaluated in this area. On each section, three fields of 205 × 205 μm were randomly chosen, and five images were obtained in each field with the optical sectioning of 2 μm thickness and stored in a format of 256 × 256 full frame with a pixel depth of 8 bits. The images were obtained in the same manner for the MMP-7-treated sections, EDTA control sections, and normal sera control sections. To obtain an overview of the staining, lower magnification images of the sections were obtained with a Nikon 20× (0.75 numeric aperture) dry objective and stored in a format of 1024 × 1024 full frame with a pixel depth of 8 bits. The overlaid images were generated using LaserSharp software. In each field, three images from the middle three layers obtained by optical sectioning were used for quantitative evaluation. Using LaserSharp software, the intensity values of all the pixels were averaged on each image for both cyanine 3 and FITC, and their ratio was obtained. The ratios were then compared among the MMP-7-treated sections and the EDTA controls by one-way factorial analysis of variance on a Statview software package (version 5.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). When necessary, Bonferroni and Dunn's procedure was employed as a post hoc test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Bone and cartilaginous tissues were obtained from a 6-week gestation human fetus. Two hundred milligrams wet weight of tissues were homogenized at 4 °C in 2 ml MMP cleavage buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, using an overhead stirrer (Wheaton Science, Millville, NJ). For cleavage, 2 μg of MMP-7 was added to the homogenate and incubated at 37 °C under continuous agitation. Four hundred microliters of the homogenate were obtained at 0, 2, and 12 h, and 800 μl was recovered at 24 h. In each aliquot, the cleavage was terminated by addition of EDTA at a final concentration of 20 mm, then the samples were stored at −80 °C. Analysis of cleavage products was performed by Western blot with anti-IIE3–8. The 24-h sample was further analyzed with IIA antiserum to identify the bands containing exon 2-encoded region. For these, 400 μl of the homogenate was centrifuged at 21,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was obtained. After desalting and concentration the supernatant was loaded on a gel. Western blotting was done as described. Either reducing or nonreducing conditions were used for the analysis, depending on the antibodies. Under reducing conditions, recombinant rat SPD and IIA-SPD (Fig.1, C and D) appeared as bands of 43 and 47 kDa, respectively (Fig.2). None of the MMPs tested showed detectable cleavage of recombinant rat SPD under the conditions used in this study (Fig. 2A). IIA-SPD was efficiently cleaved by MMPs 3, 7, 9, 13, and 14, whereas MMPs 1, 2, and 8 did not show significant cleavage (Fig. 2B). Because rat SPD was resistant to MMP cleavage, we inferred that cleavage of IIA-SPD occurred within the procollagen domain. Accordingly, our subsequent experiments focused on the cleavage of IIA-SPD by MMPs 3, 7, 9, 13, and 14. The cleavage patterns for these MMPs were similar (Fig.2B). Two bands of ∼17 and 20 kDa were common to all, and these MMPs also generated an additional band of ∼25 kDa. MMPs 7 and 13 generated components of higher apparent molecular mass, between 34 and 30 kDa. Next, the time course of the cleavage was studied for all the MMPs. The results for MMPs 9 and 14 are shown in Fig.3. MMP-9 digested IIA-SPD completely at 24 h (Fig. 3A), whereas MMP-14 did not cleave the protein completely even at 48 h (Fig. 3B). In the cleavage by MMP-9, a faint band at 32 kDa was seen only for the first 1 h of incubation, but all the other bands appeared at 0.5 h and remained unchanged up to 48 h. The pattern of cleavage by MMP-14 was consistent throughout the incubation period. For both of these enzymes, the fragment at 20 kDa was likely derived from a preferred cleavage sites, as this band was more prominent than the others. Similarly, MMPs 3, 7, and 13 showed a consistent pattern of cleavage from 0.5 to 48 h (data not shown). From the result of control incubations in which the activity of MMPs was inhibited by addition of 20 mm EDTA, it was confirmed that all of the products are generated by MMP cleavage, not from the action of contaminating proteinases. All the major bands visualized by gel staining were recognized by at least one of the three antibodies used in this study, confirming they were cleavage products of IIA-SPD. For each MMP, these bands were numbered sequentially according to their molecular sizes. Four major bands were identified following cleavage with MMP-3 (Fig.4A). In Western blot analysis, bands 1 and 2 were recognized by both IIA antiserum and anti-IIE3–8, whereas bands 3 and 4 were detected only by SPD antiserum. From the results, MMP-3 was inferred to cleave IIA-SPD at two sites between the epitopes for anti-IIE3–8 and those for SPD antiserum (Fig.1D), generating two pairs of fragments. Subsequently, bands 3 and 4 were subjected to amino acid sequencing as they contained the epitopes for the SPD antiserum. The results of microsequencing showed that each of the bands contained two fragments cleaved at consecutive sites (Table I). The analysis of band 3 revealed two cleavage sites at Ala156-Gln157and Gln157-Met158 at the ratio of 1:2. Interestingly, the former is the procollagen N-proteinase cleavage site (20Dombrowski K.E. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16545-16552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Band 4 contained two fragments cleaved in N-telopeptide region at Ala169-Gln170 and Val173-Met174 at the ratio of 1:1. This is consistent with the previously reported result on cleavage of the mature form of native bovine type II collagen (13Wu J.-J. Lark M.W. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5625-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IThe amino acid sequences determined in the MMP cleaved fragments of IIA-SPDEnzymeMMP-3MMP-7MMP-9MMP-13MMP-14Band 168LATASGQ87IKDIVGPK90IVGPK(1:1)Band 287IKDIVGPK157QMAGGFDE90IVGPK158MAGGFDE(1:1)(1:1)Band 3157QMAGGFD174MQGPMDSA157QMAGGFDE158MAGGFD175QGPMDSA(1:2)(3:1)Band 4170QLGVMQGPMD*158MAGGFDE173VMQGPM174MQGPMD*(1:1)Band 5158MAGGFDEK174MQGPMDBand 6171LGVMQGPMDThe glutamine residue at the NH2-terminal of the secreted form of type IIA procollagen was numbered as the first amino acid.

Digestion by MMP-7 produced six bands as seen by gel staining (Fig.4B), and bands 3–6 showed the same pattern of immunostaining as that with MMP-3, i.e. bands 3 and 4 were detected by both IIA antiserum and anti-IIE3–8, and bands 5 and 6 were recognized only by SPD antiserum. Therefore, MMP-7 appears to have two cleavage sites at or near the sites of cleavage for MMP-3. In contrast, the top two bands were unique for MMP-7. Band 1 was recognized by anti-IIE3–8 and SPD antiserum but not by IIA antiserum, and the cleavage for this band should occur between the epitopes for IIA antiserum and those for anti-IIE3–8 (Fig. 1D). Band 2 was recognized only by SPD antiserum, and the cleavage between anti-IIE3–8 recognition sites and the SPD antiserum recognition sites could generate this band, upstream of the MMP-3 cleavage sites. Subsequently, bands 1, 2, 5, and 6 were subjected to amino acid sequencing (Table I). The results showed that band 1 contained one fragment cleaved at Asp67-Leu68 in the exon 2-encoded region, and band 2 contained two fragments cleaved at Asp86-Ile87 and Asp89-Ile90 at an equal ratio. The analysis of band 5 revealed the cleavage at Gln157-Met158and that of band 6 showed another site in N-telopeptide region at Gln170-Leu171. MMP-9 cleavage produced three bands (Fig. 4C). Among them, band 1 was detected by both IIA antiserum and anti-IIE3–8, and bands 2 and 3 were visualized only by SPD antiserum (Fig. 4C). The pattern was similar to that with MMP-3, and the cleavage sites with MMP-9 were considered to be same or close to those with MMP-3. The lower two bands recognized by SPD antiserum were subjected to amino acid sequencing (Table I). The analysis of band 2 presented two consecutive cleavage sites at Ala156-Gln157 and Gln157-Met158 in an equal amount. These are the same cleavage sites recognized by MMP-3. Band 3 with MMP-9 contained two consecutive sites in N-telopeptide region at Val173-Met174 and Met174-Gln175 at the ratio of 3:1. MMP-1"

The adenine binding site was revealed by sequence alignment for a prevalent cluster of aptamers, and its structure and interactions with adenine were probed by RNase digestion studies, lead cleavage, boundary determination experiments, and truncated sequences studies. A new purine binding motif was functionally and structurally characterized and compared with other RNAs specific to purine or adenylated compounds. The affinity for adenine and the specificity for other related targets were quantified. This work suggests that the adenine binding site is composed of two independent secondary structure elements forming a bipartite binding site that interacts with adenine in a new mode of purine recognition. Such binding is of great interest because the imidazole moiety is not trapped in the binding site, and would easily be available for catalytic activity.

The RNA world hypothesis assumes that modern life forms arose from a molecular ancestor in which RNA molecules both stored genetic information and catalyzed chemical reactions. Today, DNA, from which genetic information flows, is considered a modified RNA, more stable than RNA except under acidic conditions, and therefore more capable of conserving and transfering information (1Joyce G.F. Orgel L.E. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 3-25Google Scholar). Furthermore, the central role of RNA in contemporary metabolism still includes informational and catalytic properties; a lot of cellular RNAs are involved in key cellular functions, and some of them are catalytic RNAs. Although the RNA world hypothesis remains difficult to understand up to a point, the explanatory means remain powerful (1Joyce G.F. Orgel L.E. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 3-25Google Scholar, 2Sutherland J.D. Whitfield J.N. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11595-11626Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Contemporary transfer RNA contains a rich collection of functionalized bases created by post-transcriptional modification (3Limbach P.A. Crain P.F. McClosey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2183-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). RNA might gain chemical functionalities by using catalytic building blocks such as imidazole, and thiol, amino, and carboxylate groups, etc. as cofactors (4Maurel M.-C. J. Evol. Biol. 1992; 2: 173-188Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5Cedergren R. Grosjean H. Biosystems. 1987; 20: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), like many coenzymes that are nucleotide derivatives. By chemical modifications nucleotides could acquire all of the functional groups of amino acids. Moreover, primeval nucleotides were not necessarily restricted to the standard nucleotides as we know them today. Thus, modified nucleotides may have played a role in primeval catalysis (6White H.B. J. Mol. Evol. 1976; 7: 493-496Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 7Trémolières A. Biochimie (Paris). 1980; 62: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have already shown that an N6-ribosyl adenine, which is likely to have formed under prebiotic conditions (8Fuller W.D. Sanchez R.A. Orgel L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), is equivalent to histidine in the model reaction ofp-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis (9Maurel M.-C. Ninio J. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This mode of linkage leaves the imidazole portion of adenine free to react (10Maurel M.-C. Convert O. Origins Life Evol. Biosph. 1990; 20: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the same way we showed that when adenine is placed in a favorable microenvironment, the catalytic efficiency of adenine is heightened (11Maurel M.-C. Décout J.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 190-195Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Décout J.L. Vergne J. Maurel M.-C. Macromol. Chem. Phys. 1995; 196: 2615-2624Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Ricard J. Vergne J.

Such a favorable microenvironment could be provided by an RNA adenine binding site. Of further significance is the discovery that abasic hammerhead ribozymes can be rescued by the addition of exogenous bases that restore the catalytic activity (15Peracchi A. Beigelman L. Usman N. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11522-11527Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or that imidazole can rescue a cytosine mutation in a self-cleaving ribozyme (16Perrotta A. Shih I.-H. Been M.D. Science. 1999; 286: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To this end, we have explored the possibility that regular ribonucleic acids bind adenine specifically with the aim of forming a plausible primitive equivalent of the catalytic site of an enzyme.In vitro selection or SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) experiments using RNA have shown that nucleic acid molecules with specific molecular recognition and functional properties can be isolated from complex pools of random sequences by repeated rounds of selection and amplification (17Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8264) Google Scholar). RNA molecules isolated by such processes can bind proteins, nucleic acids, or smaller ligands, and some of them can display biological activities with possible therapeutic significance (18Illangasekare M. Sanchez G. Nickles T. Yarus M. Science. 1995; 267: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Carnes J. Frolova L. Zinnen S. Drugeon G. Phillippe M. Justesen J. Haenni A.L. Leinwand L. Kisselev L.L. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RNA aptamers that bind nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleic bases have already been isolated. Aptamers for purine compounds, ATP, theophylline, and xanthine/guanine have their own distinctive mode for purine base recognition (20Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 21Jenison R.D. Gill S.C. Pardi A. Polisky B. Science. 1994; 263: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 22Kiga D. Futamura Y. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Adenine is a highly plausible prebiotic molecule, and therefore adenine-binding aptamers could mimic substrate binding by early ribo-organisms that had eaten adenine “food” synthesized abiotically. With regards to the question of whether the adenine ring and specifically its imidazole moiety may have played a role in biochemical evolution of enzymes and coenzymes, it is of crucial interest to isolate RNA aptamers to adenine with high affinity and specificity and to look for specific sequences and structure patterns involved in adenine recognition. AnN6-adenine-linked Sepharose column, which differs from the classical purine-agarose column previously used for the selection of the above mentioned RNA aptamers by linkage at position 6 of the base, was used in the present experiments. The adenine ring was linked to the affinity column for selection by itsN6-nitrogen atom to maintain the ability of the ring to interact with RNA. This column was prepared by coupling to EAH-Sepharose 4B, theN6-(5-carboxypentyl)adenine synthesized from 6-chloropurine and 6-aminocaproic acid. Here we report the isolation of a new RNA aptamer motif, a bipartite RNA site that binds the adenine target. The chemical reagents used for preparing the affinity column were from Sigma Aldrich. EAH-Sepharose 4B was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. To a solution of 6-chloropurine (1 g; 6.47 mmol) in anhydrous ethanol (15 ml) was added 6-aminocaproic acid (1.87 g; 14.3 mmol) and then triethylamine (1.5 ml). The solution was heated under reflux for 40 h and then evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water, and theN6-(5-carboxypentyl)adenine was precipitated by the addition of a concentrated hydrochloric acid solution to decrease the pH to 4.5. The solid was filtered off and washed with water and then with diethylether.N6-(5-carboxypentyl)adenine was finally purified by crystallization from an ethanol-water mixture at 3:1 (0.98 g; 3.95 mmol; yield, 61%). The characteristics ofN6-(5-carboxypentyl) adenine are: melting point, 240–241 °C; 1H NMR (300 MHz, Me2SO-d6), δ ppm: 12.80 (1H, b s,1CO2H or N9-H), 12.02 (1H, b s, N9-H or CO2H), 8.15 (1H, s, C2-H or C8-H), 8.06 (1H, s, C8-H or C2-H), 7.69 (1H, b s, N6-H), 3.45 (2H, s, CH2), 2.19 (2H, t, J = 7.0 Hz, CH2), 1.54 (4H, m, 2 CH2), 1.32 (2H, d,J = 7.3, CH2); 13C NMR (75 MHz, Me2SO-d6): 174.5 (C=O), 154.4, 152.4, 149.4, 138.7, 118.5, 33.7, 28.9 (2 CH2), 26.0, 24.3.

To a solution ofN6-(5-carboxypentyl)adenine (5 mg; 20 μmol) in a 1:1 mixture of dioxane:phosphate-buffered water (pH 7.2; 5 ml) were added successively EAH-Sepharose (5 ml),N-hydroxysuccinimide (19 mg; 165 μmol), and 1-ethyl-3, 3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (46 mg; 240 μmol). The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, and the resin was filtered off and washed with water and then ethanol. It was stored in a 80:20 water:ethanol mixture (Fig. 1). The coupling efficiency determined using the reaction with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (23Antoni G. Presentini R. Neri P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was 85%, and the concentration of adenine in the column was estimated to be 3.4 mm based on titration with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. 8-Azidoadenine and 8-thioadenine used as adenine competitors were synthesized from the corresponding 2′-deoxyadenosine derivatives by deglycosylation in water at pH 3 (aqueous hydrochloric) and 40 °C (24Laayoun A. Décout J.L. Lhomme J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 4989-4990Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 8-Azido-2′-deoxyadenosine and 2′-deoxy-8-thioadenosine were prepared from 8-bromo-2′-deoxyadenosine. The characteristics of 8-azidoadenine are: 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) δ 8.07 (1H, s, H2); 7.07 (2H, s, NH2).13C NMR (Me2SO-d6) δ 153.2, 151.4, 149.5, 147.1, 117.5.

The sequence of primer 1 (P1) is 5′-GCGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGGATACTACACGTG-3′ (T7 promoter sequence in bold), and that of primer 2 (P2) is 5′-CGGAAGCTTCTGCTACATGCAATGG-3′. The 95-nucleotide-long template (T) consists of a random sequence of 50 nucleotides (N)50flanked by two primer-binding regions (17Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8264) Google Scholar, 25Ciesiolka J. Illangasekare M. Majerfeld I. Nickles T. Welch M. Yarus M. Zinnen S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Its entire sequence is 5′-CGGAAGCTTCTGCTACATGCAATGG(N)50CACGTGTAGTATCCTCTCCC-3′. A 2-ml PCR reaction performed with each primer at 1 μm (P1 and P2) and T at 0.14 μm (about 1.7 × 1014 random molecules) yielded a random population of 6.8 × 1014 double-stranded DNA molecules carrying the T7 promoter sequence. This DNA pool was ethanol-precipitated and submitted to in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase, yielding ∼22.4 nmol of random single-stranded RNA molecules complementary to T. This random RNA pool was purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol deproteinization followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in water. The RNA was desalted using a Lida ultra-spin ultrafilter (Poly Labo) to eliminate unincorporated and co-precipitated nucleotides, and finally the RNA was suspended in binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) The random RNA pool was subjected to affinity chromatography on the adenine-Sepharose column. During each round of selection, 50–300 μg (1015 molecules) of RNA were applied onto the equilibrated column in binding buffer after a denaturation/renaturation step (RNA, 0.12–0.65 mg/ml in binding buffer heated for 1 min at 65 °C and cooled slowly to room temperature). The column was washed with 5–7 volumes of binding buffer. Adenine-bound RNAs were recovered by eluting with elution buffer (3.7 mm adenine, 100 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.3). After chromatography, the column was re-equilibrated for further use with 7–10 volumes of washing buffer (100 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, pH 7.3) followed by 10–12 volumes of binding buffer. The eluted RNAs were detected and quantified by measuring theA260 nm of the eluted fractions and by electrophoresis detection. Aliquots of all of the fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. After staining with ethidium bromide the RNA concentrations were estimated by quantifying spot intensities with an NIH Image analyzer. By this method it was possible to estimate the RNA concentration in eluted fractions and to avoid interference between the adenine of the elution buffer and the eluted RNA, because both absorb at 260 nm. The pooled RNA was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Lida ultraspin ultrafilter and subjected to a reverse transcription in 100–200 μl using AMV-reverse transcriptase followed by PCR with Tfl DNA polymerase (6–12 amplification cycles), both supplied by the Access reverse transcription-PCR kit from Promega. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension in water, the newly selected double-stranded DNA library produced the RNA pool for the next round of selection byin vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. As soon as the eluted RNA population became detectable by electrophoresis, two counter-selection rounds were performed on a Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., 1 ml) before proceeding to the other selection rounds, to avoid the artifactual amplification of Sepharose-binding RNAs. The RNA pool was applied to the Sepharose column and washed with binding buffer. The washed RNA population, without affinity for Sepharose, was recovered and amplified by reverse transcription-PCR followed by T7 RNA polymerase in vitrotranscription. To screen for RNA molecules with affinity for adenine, the RNA population eluted from the column was cloned after conversion of RNA to DNA by reverse transcription-PCR. From isolated clones, plasmids were prepared and the cloned DNAs sequenced. After plasmid purification andin vitro transcription of the PCR-amplified inserted fragments, individual RNAs were prepared for further analyses. Individual RNAs were deposited on the adenine column to check whether they are able to bind adenine, the function for which they had been selected. The affinity of RNAs for adenine was evaluated with unlabeled RNA and [3H]adenine (0.05 μm, 21 Ci/mmol). The 200-μl binding reaction mixture was filtered through Microcon YM-10 molecular cut-off filters (10,000). An aliquot of 20 μl was counted without filtering to establish the total activity of the mixture. After centrifuging the filter for 3 min, 20% of the binding reaction mixture had passed through the filter. The filtrate was combined with the retentate and centrifuged again (22Kiga D. Futamura Y. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The bound adenine was the difference in counts between the applied mixture (free adenine plus complexed adenine to RNA) and the filtrate (free adenine corrected for the efficiency of filtration). TheKd was determined graphically by plotting the fraction of bound adenine as a function of RNA in the assay, takingKd to be equal to the RNA concentration for 50% adenine binding. It was also evaluated by comparing the distribution of the experimental values to the theoretical curve, considering the equilibrium reaction of one RNA molecule complexing one adenine molecule (Fig. 3). The 50% adenine binding method is possible when theKd is much higher than the adenine concentration; otherwise it is determined using the equilibrium constant equation. The specificity of the RNA was studied by radioligand displacement measurements (26Martin R.L. Renosto F. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), using unlabeled potential competitors with [3H]adenine (18 μm) and RNA (18 or 27 μm). The fraction of adenine complexed to RNA was determined by equilibrium filtration as a function of competitor concentration, thus allowing the calculation of the competitor dissociation constants (Kdc). The concentration of RNA in water is assumed to be 1 mg/ml for an absorbance at 260 nm = 30. Before performing the binding measurements, the RNA (24 or 72 μm) was renatured in binding buffer by warming to 60 °C for 1 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. The aim of these experiments was to probe secondary and tertiary structure elements of selected aptamers and to locate the nucleotides involved in adenine binding. Reactions were performed as described elsewhere (27Conway L. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Knapp G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The specificity of RNase V1, RNase T1, RNase T2, and RNase A served to probe RNA secondary structure. 5′-Radiolabeled aptamers were submitted to limited digestion by each enzyme, and digestion patterns were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two enzymatic digestion conditions were performed simultaneously: one without adenine in the reaction mixture and the other in the presence of adenine (1.23 mm). Therefore, it was possible to probe RNA single- or double-stranded regions and to detect nucleotides protected from RNase hydrolysis by direct interaction with adenine or by a conformational change, thus highlighting the adenine-binding site. Adenine aptamers were also probed by lead-induced chemical cleavage in order to highlight single-stranded regions and to compare the results with the RNase mapping experiments. 5′-Radiolabeled aptamers were submitted to cleavage by various amounts (from 0 to 1 mm) of lead acetate during 1 h at room temperature in HEPES 100 mm, pH 7.3, NaCl 50 mm, and MgCl2 5 mm. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of EDTA 10 mm, and the sample were ethanol-precipitated with glycogen added as carrier. Then 10,000 dpm of each sample were loaded on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and radiolabeled fragments were detected by autoradiography. The aim of these experiments was to determine the minimal sequence requirement for adenine binding in order to localize the adenine binding core. Adenine-binding RNA was 32P-labeled, either at its 5′ terminus with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or at its 3′ terminus with T4 RNA ligase and [5′-32P]pCp, and purified on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Conway L. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Knapp G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Purified labeled RNA (1 nmol) was suspended in 400 μl of alkaline hydrolysis buffer (50 mm NaHCO3-Na2CO3, pH 9.2) and subjected to random cleavage (100 °C, 10 min). Hydrolyzed RNA was then ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in binding buffer. The mixture was then denatured and renatured as described above under “Selection Procedure” and deposited onto the adenine-Sepharose column. Unbound RNA fragments were washed with 8 column volumes of binding buffer, and adenine-bound fragments were recovered by elution with 4 column volumes of elution buffer. Washed and adenine-bound fractions were pooled separately, ethanol-precipitated (glycogen was used as carrier), and suspended in loading buffer (1 volume of formamide, 1 volume of water, and 0.5 volume of blue-orange loading dye). 100,000 dpm were then loaded on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and after migration the gel was exposed for autoradiography. By comparing the patterns of 12 E4 RNA fragments that were washed or bound to the adenine-Sepharose column, it was possible to know the minimal length of the fragments able to bind the adenine target. Single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides allowing the synthesis of various truncated or mutated versions of RNA 12 E4 [91] were supplied by Genset. RNAs were prepared by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription, except RNA 12 E4 (37) which was synthesized by Genset. All of these RNA sequences are shown on Fig. 4. RNA 12 E4 [a] and RNA 12 E4 [b] are two mutated versions of RNA 12 E4 in which the unpaired sequence, AUUGGACC, of the hairpin loop II is replaced by CAGUCGUA and GCAUCUGA, respectively. RNA 12 E4 [46] and RNA 12 E4 [37] are composed of the first 46 and the last 37 nucleotides of the RNA 12 E4 sequence. These sequences correspond to the minimal independent sequence elements determined by boundary analysis. RNA 12 E4 [40] is a 40-nucleotide-long RNA composed of hairpin loops I and II. RNA 12 E4 [47] is a 47-nucleotide-long RNA composed of hairpin loops I and II linked in 3′ to bulge III (Fig. 4). In vitro selection began with a pool of RNAs with a random sequence of 50 nucleotides flanked by two primer-binding regions. The RNAs in binding buffer were loaded onto the adenine-Sepharose column. The unbound or weakly bound RNAs were washed from the column. The RNAs that specifically bound to the adenine moiety were affinity-eluted with the binding buffer containing adenine. In the first four rounds, the amounts of RNA in the affinity-eluted fractions were too small to be detected either by spectrophotometry or by gel electrophoresis. In the fifth round, a significant amount of RNA was eluted. From the fifth selection round to the 12th and last selection round, fractions of the eluted RNAs were pooled and collected for subsequent cloning. Several individual clones were sequenced. Column washing volumes were increased from the 9th to the 12th selection round to recover RNA aptamers that bind adenine with a higher affinity. Eighteen different sequences were obtained after cloning (Fig. 2A). The isolated RNA aptamers were classified according to their sequence similarities. As we can see in the sequence alignment (Fig.2A), a group of aptamer sequences form a cluster in which eight invariant nucleotides (marked with asterisks) are shared by all sequences. These invariant nucleotides are assumed to be crucial for adenine binding. When deposited on the column, aptamers of this cluster displayed varying level of binding (Fig.2B). Their efficiency to bind the column varied roughly from less than 10 to 80% for RNA 12 E4, which was therefore chosen for further studies. To investigate the effects of adenine protonation states on RNA 12 E4 binding, several affinity chromatographies were made at various pH values ranging from 4 to 10. For pH = 4 and pH = 5, HEPES buffer was replaced by acetate buffer, and for pH = 9 and pH = 10, HEPES buffer was replaced by glycine buffer. RNA 12 E4 binding efficiency remains constant (80%) for pH values varying from 5 to 9. In this pH range, adenine remains in its uncharged form. Thus, this argues that RNA 12 E4 also keeps its conformation able to bind the target in this pH range. At lower (pH = 4) or higher (pH = 10) values, RNA 12 E4 binding efficiency decreases to 0%. At pH = 4, adenine N1 is partially protonated (pKa = 4.1), and it would have been expected that such a positive charge would have been attracted by negatively charged RNA. Nevertheless, at such a low pH, the adenosine residues of RNA 12 E4 must also be positively charged, inducing dramatic conformational changes of RNA structure thus explaining the loss of adenine binding. At pH = 10, adenine is partially negatively charged because of its deprotonated N9 (pKa = 9.8). This negative charge would be repelled by the RNA negative backbone, thus explaining the loss of binding, but it is more probable that the aptamer conformation is compromised at a high pH value. The binding properties of RNA 12 E4 were determined by equilibrium filtration analysis with [3H]adenine as described under “Materials and Methods.” The size fractionation membranes of the filters used, retain RNA-adenine complexes above the membrane, whereas free adenine partitions freely into both the retentate and the filtrate. RNA 12 E4 displays a dissociation constant for adenine of 10 μm. The titration curve is presented in Fig.3. To study the importance of structural parts of the adenine involved in interaction with the RNA, different bases or adenine analogs were checked for their ability to form a complex with RNA 12 E4 by evaluating their constant, Kdc. A comparison ofKdc values for analogous molecules can therefore bring information about the contribution of their different parts to the binding. Adenine analogs and their respectiveKdc values are listed in TableI.Table IAffinity constants of adenine analogsKdc is evaluated by the “radioligand displacement measurement” method with adenine 18 μm, RNA 18 or 27 μm, and competitor 13.5, 18, 36, 54, 90, 180, or 270 μm. Prior to the binding study, RNA 72 μmis renatured. 6-MAP, 6-methylaminopurine; Ade, adenine. Open table in a new tab Kdc is evaluated by the “radioligand displacement measurement” method with adenine 18 μm, RNA 18 or 27 μm, and competitor 13.5, 18, 36, 54, 90, 180, or 270 μm. Prior to the binding study, RNA 72 μmis renatured. 6-MAP, 6-methylaminopurine; Ade, adenine. The good affinity for adenine compared with the purine molecule shows the important role of the 6-NH2 group in the interaction of adenine with the RNA 12 E4 aptamer. Such amino group effect is also found with 4-aminopyrimidine, indicating the contribution of hydrogen bonding to complex formation. This is probably why hypoxanthine, which is devoid of a 6-NH2 group, has a low affinity compared with adenine. The amino group is even more effective when it is a secondary amine-NHCH3 as found in 6-methylaminopurine. In this case (relative affinity to adenine is about 6), the methyl group brings an additional hydrophobic binding effect and/or a positioning effect of the molecule. However, the presence of an NH2 group as in cytosine or 4-aminopyrimidine is not sufficient to provide good affinity; the purine ring is mandatory. The contribution of the purine ring of adenine to binding is low, although it is higher than that of the pyrimidine or of the imidazole moieties, in which binding alone could not be detected, in agreement with the lower hydrophobic stacking ability of each separated ring. Thus, the specificity should lie both in the structure of the overall purine ring, acting by hydrophobic stacking interactions, and in the 6-NH2 group anchoring point, which increases the affinity by hydrogen bonding. The imidazole part of adenine must not be N9-substituted with a bulky group like ribose as seen in adenosine, which is not a good competitor (its ribose moiety probably sterically interferes with binding). It is interesting to note that adenine substitutions at position 8 have smaller effects; the addition of a 8-azido group increases theKd to 110 μm, and the addition of a 8-thiol function increases the Kd only to 28 μm. The differences in RNA 12 E4 affinity between adenosine and 8-substituted adenine derivatives should be due to the differences in the position of the substitutions on the ring and/or to their volume. The 8-azido substitution is more significantly disruptive than the 8-thiol substitution, which should also be due to differences in their steric interferences and/or to the effects of the azido group on the electronic structure in the adenine ring. An additional hydrogen bond could also be formed with 8-thioadenine. 12 E4 RNA sequence was computed on the m-fold RNA folding server 2On the Web at bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/∼mfold/rna/form1.cgi. to yield a secondary structure model (Fig. 4). As described above, a simple alignment of sequences reveals eight invariant nucleotides. They could interact directly with adenine, or they might also be involved in the binding sit"

Harding J.J. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The leading senile cataract hypothesis is that aged non-native crystallin molecules overwhelm the binding capacity of the small heat shock protein α-crystallin (also found in the lens), resulting in aggregation and formation of light scattering centers (2Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Detailed molecular information from selected crystallin domains and proteins is needed to model their unfolding and characterize their likely ensemble biophysical properties, particularly the early unfolding intermediates that have been hypothesized to bind to α-crystallin (3Das K.P. Choo-Smith L.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33209-33212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a first step toward providing detailed molecular information on a major human lens crystallin involved in cataract, we have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal domain from human γS-crystallin. The crystallins are a well studied family of proteins for which there are several three-dimensional structures (4Slingsby C. Norledge B. Simpson A. Bateman O.A. Wright G. Driessen H.P.C. Lindley P.F. Moss D.S Bax B. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 3-29Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as well as thermodynamic and kinetic data on folding/unfolding (5Mayr E.-M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Palme S. Slingsby C. Jaenicke R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Trinkl S.

The polypeptides of the ∼13-member βγ-crystallin superfamily each comprise similar ∼10-kDa N- and C-terminal domains that are themselves formed from two symmetrically organized Greek key motifs. In all cases, the N- and C-terminal domains pair about a similar pseudo-2-fold axis, with the domains in monomeric γ-crystallins being covalently connected, whereas domain swapping can lead to dimerization in β-crystallins (8Bax B. Lapatto R. Nalini V. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Mahadevan D. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. Nature. 1990; 347: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). There are seven genes coding for γ-crystallins in vertebrate lenses (9Lubsen N.H. Aarts H.J.M. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1988; 51: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and they consist of the closely related γA-γF family and the more distantly related but more conserved γS-crystallin. The expression patterns of the family of γ-crystallins appear to be correlated with the formation of the decreasing refractive index gradient from the center to the cortex of the adult lens (4Slingsby C. Norledge B. Simpson A. Bateman O.A. Wright G. Driessen H.P.C. Lindley P.F. Moss D.S Bax B. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 1997; 16: 3-29Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10de Jong W.W. Lubsen N.H. Kraft H.J. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1994; 13: 391-442Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The propensity of certain γ-crystallins to easily form a concentrated phase (11Broide M.L. Berland C.R. Pande J. Ogun O.O. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5660-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), such as the high Tc γ-crystallins that are enriched in the core region of the lens, probably reflects their “attractive” interactions (12Tardieu A. Vérétout F. Krop B. Slingsby C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 21: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). γS-crystallin, located in the low refractive index outer regions of the lens, is characterized by more repulsive intermolecular interactions (13Skouri-Panet F. Bonneté F. Prat K. Bateman O.A. Lubsen N.H. Tardieu A. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 89: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the stability of these long-lived structural proteins, along with their solution intermolecular interactions that govern solubility and phase separation behavior, are areas of cataract research. Several x-ray structures of γA-F crystallins are now known, and they all show very similar two-domain pairing about a hydrophobic interface that contributes toward stability (14Chirgadze Y.N.

David L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2268-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Human and bovine γS-crystallins and their isolated domains are very stable and show two-state unfolding, allowing detailed quantitative thermodynamic properties of the proteins to be evaluated (19Wenk M. Herbst R. Hoeger D. Kretschmar M. Lubsen N.H. Jaenicke R. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Computer simulations of heat-induced unfolding of bovine γB-crystallin also indicate high stability and furthermore suggest that the first stage of unfolding involves the dissociation of the paired domains (20Purkiss A.G. Slingsby C. Goodfellow J.M. Protein Peptide Lett. 2000; 7: 211-217Google Scholar). Conformational changes to aging crystallins can derive from a variety of covalent changes. Oxidation of cysteine and methionine residues have been detected in human crystallins (21Hanson S.R.A. Hasan A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Deamidation of human γ-crystallins is correlated with aging (22Hanson S.R.A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Ma Z. Hanson S.R.A. Lampi K.J. David L.L. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and with increased insolubilization of crystallins, particularly γS (21Hanson S.R.A. Hasan A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Deamidation alters the charge balance, adding a negative charge to a previously neutral area, but it is also thought to mark the nonenzymic formation of isomers such as β-aspartate that would alter the backbone covalent structure (24Aswad D.W. Paranandi M.V. Schurter B.T. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 2000; 21: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). So far for γS-crystallin, only the C-terminal domain of the bovine protein has been solved by x-ray crystallography (25Basak A.K. Kroone R.C. Lubsen N.H. Naylor C.E. Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showing how two domains self-associate to form a dimer in an analogous way to that of the native two-domain γ-crystallins, although the pairing is less symmetrical. Surprisingly, one of the domains has an altered conformation in its tyrosine corner, a usually highly conserved feature of most β-sandwich proteins (26Hemmingsen J.M. Gernert K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In fact, the tyrosine corner has been proposed as a possible folding nucleus in a prokaryote protein with a related βγ-crystallin fold (27Bagby S. Go S. Inouye S. Ikura M. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although this has not been universally supported (28Hamill S.J. Cota E. Chothia C. Clarke J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because it is unclear to what extent the lattice interactions in the crystal structure influenced pairing and conformation, further three-dimensional structures are required. Here we show that the C-terminal domains of human γS-crystallin pair about a slightly distorted 2-fold axis to form a dimer with both tyrosine corners in a nonstandard conformation. The human γS-crystallin C-terminal domain (HGSC)1 was cloned in the pET3a vector essentially as described for the C-terminal domain of calf γS-crystallin (25Basak A.K. Kroone R.C. Lubsen N.H. Naylor C.E. Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The novel initiation codon was introduced in the human γS sequence (19Wenk M. Herbst R. Hoeger D. Kretschmar M. Lubsen N.H. Jaenicke R. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) at a position that replaced the first glycine in the linker sequence by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the following primers: GTTCATCTGCCTCATATGGGCCAGTATAAG (forward) and GGATCCATGTCATTACTCCACAATG (reverse). The HGSC plasmid DNA, coding for residues 91–177 (topologically equivalent to residues 86–172 of γB-crystallin) was transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS competent cells. Colonies were picked to inoculate and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking in 10 ml of 2YT medium (5 g/liter NaCl, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 16 g/liter peptone 140) with 10 μl of ampicillin (100 mg/ml) and 15 μl of chloramphenicol (34 mg/ml). Large scale growth was performed with an overnight culture of 500 ml of 2YT medium containing 250 μl of ampicillin (50 mg/ml) after inoculation at 100:1 from the 10-ml overnight growths. The flasks were shaken at 37 °C and induced by the addition of 250 μl isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside after the culture was grown to an A550 of 0.4–0.6 (3–4 h). Growth was continued overnight, whereupon cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm glucose with a protease inhibitor (5 μl of Pefabloc (Merck)) and frozen at −20 °C. The highly expressed protein was isolated from the soluble fraction. Whole cell lysate was prepared from the thawed pellet by addition of DNase I and MgCl2 to the suspension giving final concentrations of 10 μg/ml and 10 mm, respectively, followed by sonication on ice using 10-s pulses with cooling in between. The pellet was spun down at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C before dialyzing the supernatant overnight at 4 °C with stirring against buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The solution was then filtered through a 0.4-μm nitrocellulose filter followed by a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filter before being loaded onto a Hiload 16/10 Q Sepharose High Performance column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The column was run at 4 ml/min on a Gradifrac with the following program: 1) 20 ml of 100% buffer A; 2) gradient from 0–70% buffer B (buffer B was buffer A with 1 m NaCl) over 160 ml; 3) 60 ml of 100% buffer B; and 4) 100 ml of 100% buffer A. The HGSC peak eluted at about 15% buffer B, in line with the predicted pI of 6.0. The identity of the protein was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry with the measured mass of 10,412 being in close agreement with the calculated mass of 10,414 and indicating that the initiating methionine had been cleaved. The HGSC protein fractions were concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and equilibrated against 25 mmBis-Tris-propane HCl, pH 7.5, using an Amicon (Millipore, Watford, Hertfordshire, UK) cell equipped with a YM3 membrane. The concentrated protein was stored at −20 °C. The size of the protein was estimated using chromatography on a Superose 12HR 10/30, using 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane HCl, 0.2m NaCl, pH 6.5 or 8.0, as running buffer. The HGSC eluted at 15.3 ml, over a wide range of protein concentration application (0.2–6.5 mg/ml) at both pH 6.5 and 8.0. For comparison, full-length bovine γS-crystallin at pH 8.0 elutes at 14.4 ml, in agreement with the monomeric nature of the C-terminal domain of human γS in solution, as determined using ultracentrifugation (19Wenk M. Herbst R. Hoeger D. Kretschmar M. Lubsen N.H. Jaenicke R. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with conditions for crystal growth optimized from Hampton (Laguna Niguel, CA) Crystal Screen II condition 13, with polyethylene glycol monomethylether 2000 as precipitant. 1 μl of protein at ∼10 mg/ml 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane HCl, pH 7.5, was added to 1 μl of well solution containing 0.2m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 20–28% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 2000. The optimum crystals, formed at 24% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 2000 after 4 days growth at room temperature, were hexagonal bipyramidal with dimensions of ∼0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm3. Intensity data to 2.4 Å were collected from a cryo-cooled (100 K) crystal using the Daresbury SRS source at Station 9.6 using an ADSC imaging plate. No cryoprotectant was added. The data were processed using the program MOSFLM (29Powell H.R. Acta Cryst. 1999; D55: 1690-1695Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Scaling was carried out with the program SCALA (30Evans P.R.

The crystals were either space group P6122 or P6522 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit assuming a solvent content of 61% (Vm = 3.15 Å3/dalton).

Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a search model. Data from 15–2.4 Å were used in both the rotation and translation function searches with a Patterson cut-off radius of 15 Å and a radius of integration of 0.75% (the maximal distance from the center of mass being 21.5 Å). A successful solution was found indicating two molecules in the asymmetric unit, using the P6522 space group, with a correlation coefficient of 63.7 and an R factor of 42.3%. Refinement of the structure was undertaken using CNSsolve version 0.9 (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

The reflections were divided, at random, into working and test (7.5% of the data) sets, to allow both the crystallographic and free R factors to be followed. The test set of reflections was excluded from the map calculations. Early in refinement, the noncrystallographic symmetry at the dimer interface was maintained by use of restraints (initial noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were 20 kcal/mol). Both simulated annealing and minimization methods were tried for refinement, with a maximum likelihood target using amplitudes. The refinement method giving the best reduction in the R factors for a cycle was chosen, and individual isotropic B-factor refinement was then undertaken. In each cycle, both 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc electron density maps were calculated, and manual rebuilding was undertaken using the program O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added using the CCP4 (35Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) programs PEAKMAX and WATPEAK to select potential sites. Some later rounds of refinement were undertaken using the CCP4 programs REFMAC (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and ARP_WARP (37Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) interspersed with CNSsolve refinement. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were lowered to 5 kcal/mol and finally removed. The final values for a crystallographic R factor of 21.6% and for a free R factor of 26.4% were obtained after 35 cycles of refinement. The final solution contains two molecules of human γS-crystallin C-domain (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, together with 90 water molecules. The statistics after refinement are given in TableII. Electron density for all the residues is visible, with just some side chain density remaining unclear. The Ramachandran plot from PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows 86.2% of the residues in the most favored regions and 13.8% in the additional allowed regions.

Thornton J.M. NACCESS. Computer Program, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London, UK1993Google Scholar) was used to calculate solvent accessible surface areas using the default probe radius of 1.4Å. The figures were produced using the programs MOLMOL (40Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and POVRAY version 3.1. The refined electron density shows that the two molecules of the HGSC in the asymmetric unit have a very similar structure (backbone root mean square deviation of 0.29 Å), and they are very similar to bovine γB-crystallin C-terminal domain (BGBC) (backbone root mean square deviation of 0.8 Å). The two HGSC domains form a dimer with a rotation of 176.5° between the two chains (red in Fig. 1A). This 2-fold pairing of two C-terminal domains is similar to the N- and C-terminal domain pairing in other polypeptides of the βγ-crystallin family and is considered to reflect the origin of the family from an ancestral homodimer of single domains (41Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the ancestral homodimer model is provided by the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of bovine γB-crystallin in which the C-terminal tyrosine was deleted. The two domains paired about a slightly distorted noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (BGBC,blue in Fig. 1A) and are readily superposed on the native 2-domain γB-crystallin (42Norledge B.V. Mayr E.-M. Glockshuber R. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Jaenicke R. Driessen H.P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, when the C-terminal domain of bovine γS-crystallin was solved, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit were found to pair in a broadly similar way (BGSC,green in Fig. 1A), but the 2-fold is distorted by around 20 °C (25Basak A.K. Kroone R.C. Lubsen N.H. Naylor C.E. Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The residues in the interface between the two domains in HGSC are shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that the residue numbers used here are based on the alignment of the domain to γB-crystallin not from the γS-crystallin sequence (Fig.1B). In common with other βγ-crystallin paired domain interfaces, there is a central hydrophobic patch (shown ingreen) surrounded by polar residues that make specific interactions. For example, in the HGSC dimer, there are two ion pairs between Asp147 and Arg168 on each side of the noncrystallographic axis, whereas in the BGSC distorted dimer, only one ion pair can form (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 25Basak A.K. Kroone R.C. Lubsen N.H. Naylor C.E. Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cluster of interactions is close to the 2-fold axis: each Gln143 and Glu172 side chain interacts with backbone polar atoms of its symmetrically related partner, and each Arg142interacts with its symmetrically related partner side chain. The only sequence difference between the two species at the interface is Val130 in human that replaces alanine in the bovine and is likely to contribute to the differing symmetries. It is apparent from a superposition of three kinds of γ-crystallin C-terminal domain dimers that there are two regions, calculated using difference distance plots (43Purkiss A.G. Contax: Protein Distance Difference Plots.(luing.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/bpurk01/work/contax 2.html)Date: 1999Google Scholar), where the domain conformation differs: the tyrosine corners and a dimer-dimer interface region (Fig. 1A). When tyrosine corners from four C-terminal domains of members of the βγ-crystallin superfamily (HGSC, BGSC, BGBC, and the C-terminal domain of bovine βB2-crystallin) are compared, HGSC has a backbone conformation that follows that of the BGSC A chain rather than the more common conformation seen in BGBC and the C-terminal domain of bovine βB2-crystallin. Fig. 3Ashows a comparison of the HGSC tyrosine corner with that from BGBC. The unusual conformation is centered near residue 148 where γB has proline and γS has lysine. In the “standard” conformation, the tyrosine (151) hydroxyl oxygen hydrogen bonds with the main chain N-H of Asp147 (bond length, 2.4 Å). In HGSC, the tyrosine hydrogen bonds with the main chain N-H of Lys148 (bond length, 1.96 Å). The new corner conformation results in different positions for the exposed positive charges of lysines 148 and 149 (Fig.3A). There are three different interdimer interfaces present in the crystal lattice (Fig. 4). The solvent accessible surface areas have been calculated for the single HGSC chains, for the AB dimer on its own (Chains A and B together), and for the AB dimer with its symmetrically related partners. These data are shown in TableIII. When the amounts of buried surface area in the three lattice interfaces are compared with the area buried within the dimer, it can be seen that the interface between the chains in the dimer buries 10.9% of the monomer surface, whereas lattice interfaces 1, 2, and 3 bury 9.3, 6.6, and 2.8%, respectively. Interface 1 is thus nearly as extensive as the dimer interface and is similar to one of the four lattice interfaces found in the bovine lattice (data not shown). His117, a residue in the long loop region between strands c and d of the first Greek key motif, participates to some extent in all three interfaces (Fig. 4).Table IIISolvent-accessible surface areasInterface typeFirst chainSecond chainSurface area buriedChain typeSABuriedChain typeSABuried/Å2/Å2/Å2/Å2/Å2Single domainA5112.3N/AB5152.6N/AN/ADimerA4555.9556.4B4582.7569.91126.31A4635.4476.9B4676.4476.2953.12A4773.5338.8B4818.4334.2673.03B5008.3144.3B5008.3144.3288.6 Open table in a new tab It is residues in the smaller HGSC interface 3 that show the major conformational differences when compared with other γ-crystallin C-terminal domains (Fig. 4C). Only one of the residues that differs between the human and the bovine sequences is involved in lattice interactions for the human form. This is tyrosine 103 that interacts with conserved glutamine 101 in interface 3, whereas this residue is a histidine in the bovine protein. The solvent accessibilities of Cys109 (Cys114 in γS numbering) 3.7 Å2 and Cys124 (Cys129 in γS numbering) 0.0 Å2 are low because they are buried in the domain core with their SG atoms 13 Å apart. There is no indication of oxidation. The exposure of the amide containing amino acids, calculated for the A chain from an AB dimer, are ranked in order of accessibility: Gln87(92) 130.0 Å2; Gln115(120), 105.1 Å2; Gln101(106), 100.1 Å2; Asn138(143), 97.2 Å2; Gln165(170), 50.9 Å2; Gln91(96), 30.6 Å2; and Gln143(148), 18.4 Å2 (Fig.5). The least accessible, Gln143(148), is buried in the dimer interface and would likely be packed against the N-terminal domain in the intact two-domain γS molecule. The side chain of Asn138(143), a residue shown to be deamidated in human cataract (44Takemoto L. Boyle D. Mol. Vision. 2000; 6: 164-168PubMed Google Scholar), is not involved in hydrogen bonding to either backbone or side chain atoms of neighboring residues; therefore deamidation will not destabilize the molecule by disruption of hydrogen bonds. At neutral pH, the C-terminal domain of γS-crystallin has a charge of −1, and the addition of another negative charge by deamidation of Asn138(143) may contribute to a decrease in stability. Charged residues within 10 Å (chosen as a value for the limit of electrostatic effects), which may be perturbed by the addition of a negative charge are: Glu114(119), Glu135(140), Arg140(145), and Arg168(173). The most important of these interactions is likely to be that of Asn138(143) with Glu114(119) because the closest atoms of these two residues are the termini of the side chains (7.2 Å apart). The two-domain human γS-crystallin was modeled using the complete bovine γB-crystallin as a template, with the C-terminal domain replaced by the human γS coordinates and the residues in the N-domain mutated to match the human γS sequence. In this model, the only residue on the N-terminal domain that is within 10 Å of Asn138(143) is Met69(73), with the main chain carbonyl of Asn138(143) being 8.8 Å from the side chain of Met69(73). This interaction with methionine is also seen in the x-ray structures of bovine γD-, γE-, and γF-crystallins, but at a distance of 6.3–6.5 Å, and it is the only residue from the N-terminal domain within 10 Å of Asn138(143). Deamidation of Asn138(143) is thus unlikely to perturb electrostatic interactions in the N-terminal domain. Two other amide containing residues are involved in lattice contacts: Gln115(120) and Gln101(106). Gln115(120) hydr"

The subunit composition of mammalian eIF3 is quite complex. Purified functional mammalian eIF3 has been reported to consist of 10 distinct polypeptides p170, p116, p110, p66, p48, p47, p44, p40, p36, and p35 (13Hershey J.W.B. Asano K. Naranda T.

Likewise wheat germ eIF3 also consists of 11 non-identical subunits (4Burks E.A. Bezerra P.P. Le H. Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

All five subunits of yeast eIF3 have corresponding homologues in both mammalian and wheat germ eIF3 (5Browning K.S. Gallie D.R. Hershey J.W.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Maitra U. Merrick W.C. Norbury C.U.

In mammalian eIF3, these homologues are p170, p116, p110, p44, and p36, respectively (5Browning K.S. Gallie D.R. Hershey J.W.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Maitra U. Merrick W.C. Norbury C.U. Trends Biochem.

However, the S. cerevisiae genome has no structural homologues of the mammalian eIF3 subunits p66, p48, p47, p40, and p35. This was quite surprising in view of the well accepted notion that the basic translation machinery, including the pathway of translation initiation, is highly conserved between yeast and mammals (17Donahue T.F.

The question therefore arises as to what specific functions do these additional mammalian eIF3 subunits play in eIF3 function during translation initiation. Interestingly, data base searches revealed that the genome of the fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, contains structural homologues of four of the five mammalian eIF3 subunits, p66, p48, p47, and p40 (18Bandyopadhyay A.

In addition to theint6+ gene, the S. pombe gene encoding the structural homologue of the mammalian eIF3 subunit p66/eIF3d has been cloned (22Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This gene, namedmoe1+ (microtubule overextended) (22Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, strains deleted of moe1+ (Δmoe1) are also viable and show only moderate inhibition in growth rate ofS. pombe cells (22Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moe1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that shows 41% identity and 58% similarity in amino acid sequence to the p66/eIF3d subunit of mammalian eIF3. Furthermore, mammalian eIF3-p66/eIF3d polypeptide can functionally substitute for fission yeast Moe1 in a Δmoe1 S. pombe strain (22Chen C.R. Li Y.C. Chen J. Hou M.C. Papadaki P. Chang E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we have cloned and expressed the fission yeast homologue of the budding yeast eIF3 core subunit Prt1p, designated spPrt1 (the corresponding mammalian homologue is the p116/eIF3b subunit). We show that Moe1/eIF3d as well as spInt6/eIF3e physically associate with the eIF3 core subunit spPrt1 in fission yeast in a protein complex that is similar in size to multisubunit mammalian eIF3. The effects of deletion of moe1+ on global translation initiation as well as on other physiological processes were investigated. Additionally, it was observed that the presence of both Moe1 and spInt6 is required for the stable association of eIF3 subunits into a protein complex in fission yeast cells. The implications of these observations in relation to eIF3 function are discussed. The strains used in this study (Table I) were derived from wild-type strain 972h−.

Open table in a new tab Exponentially growing cultures of yeast cells (70 ml each) were harvested at an A600 of 0.4 and washed with NET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The washed cells, resuspended in 200 μl of NET buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors that included leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, were lysed by vortexing with an equal volume of glass beads. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min, and immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C by incubating aliquots of each cell lysate (0.5 mg of protein) with either 5 μg of anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) coupled with Protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or 5 μg of anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) that was preincubated with protein G-agarose in NET buffer. Following incubation, beads were washed 3 times with NET buffer. The washed beads containing bound proteins were suspended in 50 μl of 1% SDS gel loading buffer and heated in a boiling water bath for 3 min. The released polypeptides in 10 μl of heated sample were resolved in 0.1% SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. The separated polypeptides were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. Exponentially growing cultures of yeast strains (70 ml each) were harvested, washed with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and then lysed by vortexing with glass beads in buffer B containing a mixture of protease inhibitors as described above. Each lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the clear supernatant was centrifuged in a TLA 100.3 fixed angle rotor (Beckman) for 45 min at 100,000 rpm. The postribosomal supernatant was stored at 0 °C while the ribosomal pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of NET buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and the mixture of protease inhibitors as described above. After incubation at 0 °C for 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged again at 100,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant containing ribosomal salt-wash proteins was dialyzed against 600 ml of NET buffer containing 70 mm NaCl and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 3 h. Both the postribosomal supernatant and dialyzed ribosomal 0.5 m KCl-wash proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Ribosomal 0.5m KCl-wash proteins (500 μg each) were also analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. The coding sequence of the fission yeast homologue of the S. cerevisiae eIF3 subunit Prt1p/eIF3b, and the fission yeast protein spInt6/eIF3e were PCR amplified using appropriate primers and a fission yeast cDNA library (ZAP2, Stratagene) as a template. The PCR products were cloned in pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) in-frame with the glutathioneS-transferase fusion tag. Both the constructs were sequenced to ensure error-free DNA synthesis. For preparation of polyclonal antibodies to the fission yeast proteins spPrt1 and spInt6, these two proteins were first expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in bacteria. Both recombinant proteins were in the inclusion bodies in the bacterial lysates. The recombinant proteins were purified from inclusion bodies by first washing each pellet with sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), then with sonication buffer containing 1 m urea. Each washed pellet was then suspended in sonication buffer containing 8 m urea and incubated overnight at 4 °C to dissolve the insoluble recombinant protein. The dissolved proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the band corresponding to each fusion protein was excised and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against each protein following standard protocols. Each antisera was affinity purified against the respective antigens immobilized on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Methods used for (a) measuring the rate of in vivo protein synthesis, (b) polysome profile analysis, and (c) detecting the association of Moe1 and other fission yeast eIF3 subunits to 40 S particles were as described (18Bandyopadhyay A. Matsumoto T. Maitra U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4005-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The protein Prt1p is a bona fide subunit of budding yeast eIF3. Mutation in the PRT1 gene leads to severe defects in the translation function of eIF3 both in vivo and in vitro (23Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Keierleber C. Wittekind M. Qin S.L. McLaughlin C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fission yeast S. pombe genome contains the structural homologues of Prt1p, designated spPrt1, as well as of the other four eIF3 core subunits. Among these fission yeast structural homologues of the eIF3 core subunits, the only one that has been cloned and characterized so far is the protein called Sum1 (25Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene sum1+ was originally identified in a genetic screen designed to isolatesuppressors of uncontrolled mitosis (25Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sum1 is the fission yeast structural homologue of the mammalian eIF3 core subunit p36/eIF3i (the corresponding budding yeast homologue is Tif34p (5Browning K.S. Gallie D.R. Hershey J.W.B.

Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Additionally, in this work we have cloned and expressed in E. coli the coding sequence of the fission yeast homologue of the budding yeast eIF3 core subunit Prt1p, and raised antibodies against the purified protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The availability of antibodies to spPrt1 and Sum1 has allowed us to perform coimmunoprecipitation experiments to investigate whether spInt6 and Moe1, the two non-core eIF3 subunits that have no homologues in the budding yeast genome, associate with these two core eIF3 subunits of fission yeast. Our assumption is that association of these non-core subunits with the core subunits spPrt1 and Sum1 represents association with the multisubunit fission yeast eIF3 complex. We constructed two fission yeast strains, designated UM 210 and UM 201 (Table I). The strain UM 210 expresses both GFP epitope-tagged Sum1 (GFP-Sum1) and Myc epitope-tagged spInt6 (Myc-spInt6), whereas the strain UM 201 expresses only Myc-spInt6. Cell-free extracts from UM 210 and UM 201 were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP (Fig.1A) or anti-Myc (Fig.1B) antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were examined for the presence of the two eIF3 core subunits spPrt1 and GFP-Sum1 as well as Moe1 and Myc-spInt6 by Western blot analysis. The anti-GFP antibody immunoprecipitated GFP-Sum1 from cell-free extracts of UM 210 as expected (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and3). The precipitated immunocomplex contained, in addition to GFP-Sum1, Moe1, and Myc-spInt6 polypeptides as well as spPrt1, another core subunit of eIF3 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1and 3). The specificity of coimmunoprecipitation by anti-GFP antibody was demonstrated by our observation that anti-GFP antibody did not immunoprecipitate spPrt1, Moe1, or Myc-spInt6 unless GFP-Sum1 was present in the lysate (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2and 4). Similar results were obtained when extracts of UM 210 and UM 201, both of which expressed Myc-spInt6, were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Under these conditions, the immunocomplex precipitated from cell extracts derived from either strain contained, in addition to Myc-spInt6, spPrt1, and Moe1 polypeptides (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, the immunocomplex precipitated from extracts of UM 210 also contained GFP-Sum1 polypeptide (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These results show that in fission yeast, both Moe1 and spInt6 polypeptides are present in a complex with at least two eIF3 core subunits, spPrt1 and GFP-Sum1. An important property of mammalian eIF3 is that in cell lysates, eIF3 is found almost exclusively bound to 40 S ribosomal particles (7Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Scheinbuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) from which the initiation factor can be dissociated by treatment with 0.5m KCl-containing buffer. We examined whether Moe1, like its mammalian homologue p66, can associate with 40 S ribosomal particles as a component of fission yeast eIF3. For this purpose, cell-free extracts of wild-type fission yeast SP6 were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation and the gradient fractions were examined for the presence of Moe1, spPrt1, and spInt6 by Western blot analysis. A 43 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·mRNA·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) formed in vitro (27Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and analyzed in a parallel gradient tube, served as a marker for the 40 S particles while in another parallel gradient, a preformed 80 S initiation complex (80 S·AUG·Met-tRNAf) was analyzed to indicate the lower boundary of the polysomes (Fig.2A). Western blot analysis of each gradient fraction showed that Moe1, spPrt1, and spInt6 sedimented at a position where the 43 S preinitiation complex also sedimented (Fig. 2B, top three panels). Further confirmation that spPrt1, Moe1, and spInt6 sedimented with the 40 S particles is derived from the observation that the gradient fractions containing these polypeptides specifically included only 18 S rRNA, a known constituent of 40 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2B, last panel). These observations indicate that Moe1 and spInt6 associate with 40 S particles in fission yeast. It should be noted that in addition to its association with 40 S particles, a fraction of the eIF3 subunits also sedimented bound to 80 S ribosomes and/or polysomes indicating that a small fraction of eIF3 is associated with 80 S ribosomes and/or polysomes. Additionally, the presence of eIF3 subunits in the lighter fractions suggests that in cell-free extracts, a fraction of eIF3 subunits may be present as free polypeptides. We also investigated whether both Moe1 and spInt6 associate with the ribosomal particles as constituents of the eIF3 protein complex. For this purpose, ribosomes were isolated from extracts of UM 210 and then treated with 0.5 m KCl to dissociate the bound proteins. The ribosomal 0.5 m KCl-wash proteins and the postribosomal supernatant protein fractions were then analyzed by Western blot (Fig.1C). A major fraction of both Moe1 and Myc-spInt6 was present in the ribosomal salt-wash protein fraction whereas only a minor fraction of these two proteins was found in the postribosomal supernatant fraction (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1and 2). A similar distribution was observed for the eIF3 core subunits, spPrt1 and GFP-Sum1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and2). Furthermore, when the ribosomal salt-wash proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibody, the precipitated immunocomplex contained, in addition to Myc-spInt6, spPrt1, GFP-Sum1 as well as Moe1 (Fig. 1C, lane 4). When similar immunoprecipitation was carried out using ribosomal salt-wash proteins derived from lysates of wild-type SP6 fission yeast cells, which did not express any Myc-tagged polypeptide, neither Moe1 nor spPrt1 was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1C, lane 3). These results suggest that Moe1 and Myc-spInt6 were bound to ribosomes as components of the eIF3 protein complex. Further confirmation for this conclusion came from the observations that when the ribosomal 0.5 m KCl-wash protein fraction from wild-type (UM 210) cells were subjected to size fractionation by centrifugation in 15–40% glycerol gradients, a significant fraction of spPrt1, GFP-Sum1, Moe1, and Myc-spInt6 sedimented at a position corresponding to an apparent Mr of about 400,000 (Fig. 3A). Purified functional mammalian eIF3, a protein complex of 10 subunits, run in a parallel gradient, sedimented at a similar position (Fig.3B). These results indicate that spPrt1, GFP-Sum1, Moe1, and Myc-spInt6 are part of a higher molecular weight protein complex, which presumably represents the multisubunit fission yeast eIF3 consisting of the core and non-core subunits. It should be noted that in addition to sedimenting as a higher molecular weight protein complex, a small fraction of the eIF3 subunits also sedimented near the top of the gradient. Presumably they represent free eIF3 polypeptides. Our observation that Moe1 is a constituent of fission yeast eIF3 protein complex prompted us to examine the function of Moe1 in translation initiation using a Δmoe1 fission yeast strain. Exponentially growing cultures of a Δmoe1 strain (UM 108) and a wild-type strain (SP6) were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and the rate of protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of [35S]methionine into polypeptide chains over a 30-min period. The rate of protein synthesis in Δmoe1 cells was about 30–40% slower than in wild-type cells (Fig. 4, panel A). This slower rate of methionine incorporation into cellular proteins in UM 108 cells is in keeping with the reduced growth rate of these cells when compared with wild-type strains (22Chen C.R. Li Y.C.

The protein that binds to this site is the multifunctional transcription factor CTCF, which consists of 727 amino acids and contains a domain of 11 zinc finger motifs that is flanked by 267 amino acids on the N-terminal side and 150 amino acids on the C-terminal side. Depleting HeLa cell nuclear extract of endogenous CTCF specifically reduced transcriptional activity from the APPpromoter. However, transcriptional activity was restored by replenishing the depleted extract with recombinant CTCF. Deleting 201 amino acids from the C-terminal end of CTCF had no detrimental effect on transcriptional activation, whereas deleting either 248 or 284 amino acids from the N-terminal end abolished transcriptional activation. Competing endogenous CTCF in vivo was accomplished by cotransfecting COS-1 cells with a plasmid overexpressing CTCF constructs and a reporter plasmid containing the APPpromoter. Under these conditions, an N-terminal deletion of CTCF reduced expression from the APP promoter, whereas the C-terminal deletion had no effect. These results demonstrate that CTCF activates transcription from the APP promoter and that the activation domain is located on the N-terminal side of the zinc finger domain.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 289-296Google Scholar). The proximal APP promoter is devoid of CCAAT and TATA boxes but contains a prominent initiator element associated with the main transcriptional start site (+1). The integrity of this initiator element is essential for both start site selection and optimal transcriptional activity (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar). In addition, an intact nuclear factor binding site designated APBβ is essential for effective transcription from the APP promoter (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar, 14Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21229-21233Google Scholar). The core recognition sequence for this binding site is located between positions −82 and −93 (Fig. 1C), and its elimination reduces transcriptional activity by ∼70–90% (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar,14Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21229-21233Google Scholar). The nuclear factor that activates transcription from APBβ was identified as CTCF (15Vostrov A.A Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 72: 33353-33359Google Scholar), a nuclear regulatory protein comprising 727 amino acids (16Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Google Scholar). It contains a centrally located DNA binding domain with 11 zinc finger motifs that is flanked by 267 amino acids on the N-terminal side and 150 amino acids on the C-terminal side (Fig. 1,A and B). Selective deletions from the N- and C-terminal sides of the zinc finger domain showed that the N-terminal end of the zinc finger domain was aligned toward the transcriptional start site (15Vostrov A.A Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 72: 33353-33359Google Scholar). CTCF was first described as a factor that binds to the chicken c-MYC promoter (17Lobanenkov V.V. Nicolas R.H. Adler V.V. Paterson H. Klenova E.M. Polotskaja A.V. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1743-1753Google Scholar) and to the silencer element of the chicken lysozyme gene (18Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Köhne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Google Scholar, 19Burcin M.R. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D.F. Lottspeich F. Filippova G.N. Lobanenkov V.V. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Google Scholar). CTCF binds to diverse sequences by utilizing different combinations of essential zinc fingers (16Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Google Scholar, 19Burcin M.R. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D.F. Lottspeich F. Filippova G.N. Lobanenkov V.V. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Google Scholar). Consequently, a defined DNA recognition sequence cannot readily be recognized. The function of CTCF in gene regulation is also diverse. For example, CTCF binds to the chicken lysozyme silencer 2.4 kilobase pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site. Here it synergistically represses transcription in conjunction with the thyroid hormone receptor or the retinoic acid receptor (18Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Köhne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Google Scholar, 20Köhne A.C. Baniahmad A. Renkawitz R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 747-755Google Scholar). Another example of synergistic repression is provided by the coordinate action of CTCF and the thyroid hormone receptor on the TRE-containing rat genomic element 144 (21Awad T.A. Bigler J. Ulmer J.E. Hu Y.J. Moore J.M. Lutz M. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V.V. Filippova G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27092-27098Google Scholar, 22Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5710-5723Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTCF has been found to directionally block enhancer activation by binding to the insulator element at the 5′ end of the chicken β-globin gene locus (23Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Google Scholar). Similar CTCF -binding sequences were identified in a variety of insulators from diverse vertebrate species, suggesting a widespread role for CTCF in the regulation of enhancer-activated genes (23Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Google Scholar). CTCF also binds to the proximal promoter of the chicken c-MYCgene where it acts either as a transcriptional repressor or activator (17Lobanenkov V.V. Nicolas R.H. Adler V.V. Paterson H. Klenova E.M. Polotskaja A.V. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1743-1753Google Scholar, 24Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Google Scholar, 25Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. U S. Carne A.F. Lee R.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Goodwin G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 466-474Google Scholar). In the human and mouse c-myc, genes CTCF binds to divergent sequences that coincide with RNA polymerase pausing sites within the transcribed region of the genes (16Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Google Scholar). The above examples illustrate that CTCF primarily acts as a negative regulator of transcription. In contrast, some of our previous studies (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar, 14Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21229-21233Google Scholar, 15Vostrov A.A Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 72: 33353-33359Google Scholar, 26Yang Y. Quitschke W.W. Vostrov A.A. Brewer G.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2286-2298Google Scholar) have provided indirect evidence implicating CTCF as a transcriptional activator of the APP promoter. The mechanism by which CTCF exerts its diverse regulatory effects remains unclear. However, it is likely to involve interactions with specific secondary factors. We provide here direct evidence both in vitro and in vivo that CTCF activates transcription from the APP promoter and that this activation requires the N-terminal end of the molecule. The cDNA encoding human CTCF was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA library derived from the human retinoblastoma cell line Y79 (CLONTECH) (27Quitschke W.W. Fochtman L.J. Taheny M.J. Vostrov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3370-3378Google Scholar). Deletions from the 5′ end were introduced at restriction sitesAccI (position 965) and Bsu36I (position 1216), resulting in primary translation products with N-terminal transcriptional start sites at positions Met-249 and Met-285, respectively. Deletions from the 3′ end were introduced at restriction sites BglII (position 2142) and PstI (position 1867), yielding translation products with C-terminal deletions at positions Asp-617 and Cys-525, respectively (Fig. 1, A andB). Expression of CTCF and its deletion constructs in yeast was accomplished with the Pichia Expression Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cDNA encoding full-length CTCF or its N- and C-terminal deletions was excised from plasmid pGEM 7Z(−) (Promega) and cloned either into theEcoRI site of plasmid pHIL-D2 or between theBamHI and NotI sites of plasmid pCIP3.5 (Invitrogen). Both are vectors that direct intracellular recombinant protein expression in P. pastoris. The vectors containing the CTCF cDNA constructs in the correct orientation were transformed into Pichia strain KM71 by electroporation. Positive clones were amplified, induced for recombinant protein expression, and screened for the presence of CTCF by mobility shift electrophoresis. Recombinant CTCF proteins were extracted and purified from P. pastoris as described (27Quitschke W.W. Fochtman L.J. Taheny M.J. Vostrov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3370-3378Google Scholar) with some modifications. Pichia cells (10–15 g) were mixed with 25 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads, adjusted to a total volume of 50 ml with buffer F (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, 1 m urea, and 10 μmZnSO4), and homogenized with the Bead Beater apparatus (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartensville, OK). Cell debris was pelleted at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was supplemented with 3 m KCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. The lysate was further clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. CTCF was purified from the extracts by single step SP cation exchange chromatography. Briefly, a 1-ml HiTrap SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with buffer F containing 200 mm KCl. Cleared extract was loaded on the column, and proteins were eluted with a linear concentration gradient of KCl (0.2–1 m) in buffer F. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the CTCF binding activity was monitored by mobility shift electrophoresis. Fractions containing the peak activity were concentrated ∼10-fold with a Microcon-30 centrifugal device (Millipore). It must be noted that the presence of 1 m urea is necessary for successful concentration. In the absence of urea, CTCF and especially some truncated forms of the protein are prone to bind to the concentrator's membrane. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal part of CTCF were prepared as described elsewhere (26Yang Y. Quitschke W.W. Vostrov A.A. Brewer G.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2286-2298Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity-purified on recombinant CTCF attached to a Ni2+-chelating column (28Gu J. Stephenson C.G. Iadarola M.J. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 257-262Google Scholar). Specifically, recombinant full-length CTCF containing a His tag at its N terminus was expressed in P. pastoris and purified as described above. The protein was loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) charged with NiSO4. The column was first washed with 3 volumes of buffer E (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 500 mm KCl and then with 3 volumes buffer E containing 300 mm KCl. Rabbit anti-CTCF serum (10 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of buffer E containing 400 mm KCl and loaded on the column. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer E containing 200 mm KCl. Antibody was eluted with 3 ml of 4 m MgCl2. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against 500 ml of buffer D (40 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) with one change of dialysis buffer. Antibody was concentrated with a Centriplus-30 centrifugal device (Millipore) to a final volume of 0.4 ml. The resulting antibody recognized a single CTCF band on Western blots of whole HeLa cell nuclear extract. Antibody titer was determined by mobility supershift electrophoresis, which was performed as described elsewhere (26Yang Y. Quitschke W.W. Vostrov A.A. Brewer G.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2286-2298Google Scholar) using 2 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract and increasing amounts of the affinity purified antibody. Under these conditions 0.3 μl of the antibody was sufficient to completely shift the band corresponding to the oligonucleotide-CTCF binding complex. Nuclear extract from HeLa cells was prepared as described elsewhere (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar, 29Heberlein U. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 331: 410-415Google Scholar). To deplete CTCF from nuclear extract, 60 μl of the affinity-purified antibodies were added to 400 μl of the extract and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and mixed with 80 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with buffer D. The extract was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and gently stirred periodically to keep the resin in suspension. The resin was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The extract was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. A control sample of native HeLa cell nuclear extract was subjected to exactly the same procedure except that in the initial incubation buffer D was used in place of the antibodies. This control preparation is referred to as whole nuclear extract. The double-stranded oligonucleotide APBβ-80WT (15Vostrov A.A Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 72: 33353-33359Google Scholar) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This oligonucleotide contained the APP promoter sequence from position −110 to −64, which includes the APBβ core recognition sequence for CTCF (Fig. 1C). Recombinant CTCF was diluted with buffer F containing 500 mm KCl. The binding reaction was assembled by first mixing 0.5 μl of diluted CTCF and 1 μl of CTCF-depleted nuclear extract with binding buffer (buffer D), supplemented with 5 μg of yeast tRNA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and CHAPS to a final concentration of 2.5% in a total volume of 16 μl. Alternatively, the control reaction mixtures contained a total of 1 μl of HeLa nuclear extract (whole or depleted) with no CTCF added. The mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 1 μl of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (20 ng per binding reaction; 50,000–200,000 cpm) in binding buffer. The final binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then supplemented with 1.5 μl of fetal calf serum and electrophoresed in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 100–150 constant voltage. The gels were dried, and the amount of bound and free oligonucleotide was quantitated with a GS-250 PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Binding activity was expressed in mobility shift units (msu). One msu was designated as the amount of protein that completely binds 1 ng of 80-mer oligonucleotide APBβ-80WT during mobility shift electrophoresis. Special conditions were employed in the binding reactions for mobility shift electrophoresis in experiments dealing with in vitrocompetition of native CTCF with purified recombinant CTCF proteins. In this case the binding conditions were adjusted to reproduce exactly the conditions of the corresponding in vitro transcription reaction (see below). Recombinant CTCF was diluted with buffer F containing 500 mm KCl, and 0.7 μl was mixed with 2 μl of depleted nuclear extract, 5 μg of yeast tRNA, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). The volume was adjusted to 8 μl with buffer E bringing the final KCl concentration to 100 mm,and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 min. Subsequently, 25 ng of labeled 80-mer oligonucleotide APBβ-80WT was added to this mixture. This represented approximately the same molar amount of APBβ CTCF-binding sequence present in 2 μg of the plasmid DNA that was used in the in vitro transcription reaction (see below). This mixture was preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C. During this time, in a separate tube, 2 μl of whole nuclear extract was mixed with 5 μg of yeast tRNA and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and adjusted to a total volume of 8 μl with buffer E. After an additional minute at 25 °C the mixtures were combined, and the binding reaction was continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by mobility shift electrophoresis as described above. We optimized our in vitrotranscription protocol (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar) to better suit the aims of this study. The reaction buffer contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 75 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. Our preliminary tests indicated that the highest in vitrotranscriptional activity from the APP promoter was achieved at a 75 mm KCl concentration. We also found that up to 0.75 μl of 1 m urea could be added to a 16-μl reaction mixture without significantly affecting the activity of either theAPP or β-actin promoters. The in vitrotranscription reaction mixture contained 4 μl of nuclear extract, 2 μg of the plasmid APP(−488) (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar), which is based on reporter plasmid pCAT2bGAL (31Quitschke W.W. Goldgaber D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17362-17368Google Scholar), and 600 μm of each NTP in a total volume of 16 μl. Recombinant CTCF was diluted with buffer F containing 500 mm KCl. The same volume of 0.5 μl of diluted CTCF or buffer F was added to all the reaction samples to maintain a constant concentration of urea. The sample volume was balanced with buffers D and E to bring the final KCl concentration to 75 mm. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, 0.4 μg of poly(A) was added to the samples as a carrier, and RNA was purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA was eluted with 30 μl of RNase-free H2O, which yielded ∼23 μl of eluate. The eluate was combined with 6 μl of 5× annealing buffer containing 75 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1.5 m NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 60 mm DTT, and 1 μl (3 pmol, 50,000–200,000 cpm) of each of the primers specific for APPand β-actin promoter transcripts (13Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 99 °C for 5 min and at 75 °C for 20 min and then transferred to 48 °C. To the annealing mixture was added 10 μl of a reverse transcriptase reaction mixture containing 12.5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm DTT, and 6 mm of each of the dNTPs, supplemented with 20 units of avian myoblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and 20 units of RNasin (both Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction was continued at 48 °C for 90 min and stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The primer extension products were separated on a 6% sequencing gel and quantitated with a GS-250 PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). In experiments where native CTCF was competed with purified recombinant CTCF proteins, the reaction mixture was assembled in a modified way to allow for preliminary binding of the recombinant CTCF to the APBβ site. Briefly, 0.7 μl of buffer F containing 500 mm KCl and recombinant CTCF at the desired dilution were combined with 2 μl of depleted HeLa cell nuclear extract and 2 μg of reporter plasmid. The volume of the sample was adjusted to 8 μl with buffer E. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, 2 μl of whole HeLa cell nuclear extract, 3 μl of buffer D, and 2 μl of buffer E were added to each sample. The transcription reaction was carried out at 30 °C, and the products were analyzed as described above. The rationale for these competition experiments was to analyze the effect of intracellular recombinant CTCF expression on the expression from a cotransfected APPpromoter construct. The APP promoter from position −488 to +100 was cloned into the polycloning site of plasmid pCAT2bGAL (31Quitschke W.W. Goldgaber D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17362-17368Google Scholar), which is located immediately upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The plasmid also contains the β-galactosidase gene, which is transcribed from the β-actin promoter and serves as an internal control for experimental variations. For the expression of CTCF by transient transfection, full-length CTCF, N-terminal deletion Met-285, and C-terminal deletion Cys-525 were provided with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag on the 5′ end of the respective CTCF cDNA constructs. The reading frame for GFP was obtained from plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), which was cut at restriction site BsrG1 and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. This operation eliminated the stop codon and the codon for the C-terminal amino acid of the GFP reading frame. The blunt-ended fragment was then cloned in-frame to the 5′ end of the three CTCF constructs. The resulting CTCF constructs, GFP-FL, GFP-M285, and GFP-C525 were subcloned into the polycloning site of plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), which is located downstream from the CMV promoter. As a control, the entire GFP reading frame alone was also cloned into the same position of plasmid pcDNA3.1. The cell line COS-1 was used for the in vivo competition of endogenous CTCF with recombinant CTCF expressed from transiently transfected pcDNA3.1 plasmid constructs. This cell line displays an ∼10-fold higher transfection efficiency (about 50%) than HeLa cells. In addition it has been transformed to express the SV40 large T antigen. This allows for the episomal replication of plasmid pcDNA3.1, which contains the SV40 origin of replication. These properties allow for a consistently high level of expression of recombinant CTCF from transfected plasmids. COS-1 cells were grown to about 70% confluence in 25-cm2flasks and were then transfected with 2 μg of plasmid mixture per flask using the FuGENE reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The plasmid mixture contained the APP reporter plasmid (APP(−488)) and the CTCF expression vector (pcDNA3.1) at a molar ratio of 4:1. This ratio was found to be optimal both for CTCF expression and APPpromoter activity. The FuGENE/plasmid mixture was left on the cells for about 16 h. The cells were then examined by fluorescence microscopy and harvested. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described elsewhere (14Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21229-21233Google Scholar). The CAT activities resulting from the APP promoter construct was normalized to identical β-galactosidase activities. Subsequently, in each experiment theAPP promoter activity obtained with the cotransfected control GFP expression plasmid was assigned the value 100%. HeLa cell nuclear extract supports in vitro transcription from both the β-actin and APPpromoters. Transcription from the β-actin promoter depends on a CCAAT and TATA box as well as a serum-response element (32Danilition S.L. Frederickson R.M. Taylor C.Y. Miyamoto N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6913-6922Google Scholar, 33Quitschke W.W. Lin Z.-Y. DePonti-Zilli L. Paterson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9539-9546Google Scholar). In contrast, the APP promoter is TATA-less, which indicates that the two promoters are transcribed by different mechanisms. Transcription from the β-actin promoter is initiated at one primary start site, whereas the APP promoter is initiated at multiple sites from position +1 to −4 (Fig. 2B, lane 1). When HeLa cell nuclear extract was depleted of CTCF by immunoprecipitation, transcription from the APP promoter was drastically reduced to a level corresponding to 23% of the activity observed with the non-depleted extract (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and5). When whole nuclear extract was mixed with increasing amounts of CTCF-depleted extract, there was a gradual decline in the transcriptional activity from the APP promoter (Fig.2B, lanes 2–4). In all cases transcriptional activity from the β-actin promoter remained unaffected (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4). The decrease in transcriptional activity was paralleled by a comparable decrease in binding activity to the APBβ site (Fig.2A, lanes 1–5). To determine whether purified recombinant CTCF expressed in the yeast strain P. pastoris supports transcriptional activity from the APP promoter, depleted nuclear extract was replenished with increasing amounts of full-length recombinant CTCF. Mobility shift electrophoresis showed that binding to the APBβ site increased proportionally to the amount of CTCF added (Fig.3A, lanes 1–5). In a similar manner, transcriptional activity from the APP promoter was restored to levels approximating those of whole nuclear extract, whereas the transcriptional activity from the β-actin promoter remained unaffected. Incidentally, no CTCF binding activity can be detected in control Pichia extracts, and such extracts do not support transcription from the APP promoter (data not shown). These results demonstrate that CTCF activates transcription from the APP promoter in vitro and that the recombinant version of the protein expressed in P. pastoriscan replace endogenous CTCF depleted from HeLa cell nuclear extract. The domains of CTCF that are located to the N- and C-terminal side of the zinc finger domain are not essential for DNA binding (2"
https://openalex.org/W1981817912,"In vivo light exposure results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several rod outer segment (ROS) proteins (Ghalayini, A. J., Guo, X. X., Koutz, C. A, and Anderson, R. E. (1998) Exp. Eye Res. 66, 817–821). We now report the presence of Src in ROS and its increased association with bleached ROS membranes. Immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine revealed that tyrosine kinase activity recovered from light-adapted ROS membranes was twice that recovered from dark-adapted ROS. Other experiments revealed the presence of both bleached rhodopsin and arrestin in immunoprecipitates of LROS, suggesting the formation of a multimeric complex containing Src, arrestin, and bleached rhodopsin. Additionally, when immobilized Src homology domains 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3, respectively) were used to study the association of Src with ROS membranes, only bleached opsin and arrestin were found to associate with the SH2 domain of Src. These data strongly suggest that Src through its SH2 domain interacts with bleached rhodopsin and arrestin either directly or indirectly. Similar results were also obtained when dark-adapted and light-adapted retinas were used instead of ROS membranes. Our data strongly suggest that light exposure in vivo activates Src and promotes its association through its SH2 domain with a complex containing bleached rhodopsin and arrestin. A hypothesis for the functional significance of this phenomenon is presented. In vivo light exposure results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several rod outer segment (ROS) proteins (Ghalayini, A.

These data strongly suggest that Src through its SH2 domain interacts with bleached rhodopsin and arrestin either directly or indirectly. Similar results were also obtained when dark-adapted and light-adapted retinas were used instead of ROS membranes. Our data strongly suggest that light exposure in vivo activates Src and promotes its association through its SH2 domain with a complex containing bleached rhodopsin and arrestin. A hypothesis for the functional significance of this phenomenon is presented. phospholipase Cγ rod outer segment(s) Src homology 2 Src homology 3 phosphotyrosine binding domain G-protein-coupled receptor glutathione S-transferase guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate light-adapted ROS dark-adapted ROS Tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in many cellular functions including growth, development, proliferation, and survival. Several extracellular signals including insulin, growth factors, mitogens, and others produce their intracellular effects through the activation of the appropriate receptor tyrosine kinases or nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (1Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Google Scholar). This activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of key intracellular proteins that are either enzymes or play the role of adaptor proteins between other intracellular signaling proteins (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). In the case of receptor tyrosine kinases, receptor activation causes a rapid autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which leads to association of these receptors with key intracellular proteins, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of these target proteins. Among the enzymes that are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation are Ras-GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ),1phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein-tyrosine phosphatases including the ubiquitous SHP-2, and a growing list of other enzymes (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar, 3Feng G-S. Hui C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Google Scholar, 4Nishibe S. Wahl I. Hernández-Sotomayer S.M.T. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G.

Although most of the current information regarding the biological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation involves receptor tyrosine kinases and nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that are stimulated by growth factors and mitogens, there is recent evidence indicating the involvement of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the generation of tyrosine phosphorylation-based signals (for a recent review, see Ref.6Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Google Scholar). One such example is the angiotensin II receptor (AT1), a seven-transmembrane receptor with no intrinsic kinase activity, which has been shown to induce rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins including PLCγ1 (7Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Google Scholar, 8Marrero M.B. Scheifer B. Paxton W.G. Scheifer E. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15734-15738Google Scholar), Shc, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and focal adhesion kinase (9Tsuda T. Kawahua Y. Shii K. Koide M. Ishida Y. Yokoyama M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 44-48Google Scholar, 10Malloy C.J. Taylor D.S. Weber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7338-7345Google Scholar, 11Schorb W. Peeler T.C. Hadigan N.N. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19626-19632Google Scholar). Other studies (12Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Lutrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Google Scholar) have demonstrated the involvement of Src in GPCR activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. More recently, the formation of a signaling complex between Src, β-arrestin, and β2-adrenergic receptor has been reported (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-660Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we have shown that light adaptation in vivostimulates tyrosine phosphorylation in rod outer segments (ROS) of rat retina (14Ghalayini A.J. Guo X.X. Koutz C.A. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 361234Google Scholar, 15Ghalayini A.J. Guo X.X. Koutz C.A Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 817-821Google Scholar). The most likely mediator of such an effect of light in ROS is rhodopsin. This would imply that rhodopsin bleaching, similar to the activation of other GPCRs, stimulates an intracellular tyrosine kinase, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of key intracellular ROS enzymes and proteins. More recently, we have reported the association of Src with ROS membranes following light exposure in vivo(16Ghalayini A.J. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 394427Google Scholar). In the current study, we have investigated the identity of the tyrosine kinase that may be activated by light. Our studies show that Src binds specifically to ROS membranes obtained from retinas exposed to light in vivo. We also demonstrate that this membrane-associated form of Src is the activated form of this enzyme. We present additional evidence that Src associates specifically with bleached rhodopsin and arrestin in immune complexes obtained with anti-Src and that this association is specifically mediated by the SH2 domain of Src. Albino Sprague-Dawley rats were dark-adapted overnight and sacrificed either under dim red light, or following 30 min of light exposure (∼300 lux). ROS were prepared on a discontinuous sucrose gradient from either dark- or light-adapted retinas as previously described (17Organisciak D.T. Xie A. Wang H.M. Jiang Y.L. Darrow R.M. Donoso L.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 503: 773-779Google Scholar) with some modification. Retinas were homogenized in 1.5 ml of 47% sucrose solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Retinal homogenates were transferred to 5-ml centrifuge tubes and sequentially overlaid with 1.0 ml of 42%, 1.0 ml of 37%, and 1.5 ml of 32% sucrose solutions dissolved in buffer A. The gradients were spun at 82,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The 32/37% interfacial sucrose band containing ROS membranes was harvested; diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate; and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The ROS pellets obtained were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmorthovanadate and stored at −20 °C. The non-ROS band designated band II (37/42% interface) and the remainder of the retina were also saved for comparison with ROS. All procedures were carried out under dim red light for dark-adapted retinas and in room light for light-adapted retinas. Protein was determined by the BCA reagent from Pierce. SDS-PAGE was performed using 7.5 or 10% gels according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were transferred to plastic backed nitrocellulose sheets (0.2 μm) or Immobilon P membranes using a Genie electroblotter (Idea Scientific Company, Minneapolis, MN) for 2–3 h. Membranes were blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl), pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% crystalline grade bovine serum albumin. Incubations with primary antisera were performed for 2–3 h at room temperature. Immunoreactions were detected either with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by either alkaline phosphatase substrate nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate,p-toluidine salt or enhanced chemiluminescence substrates (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). In some experiments, immunoblots were stripped by incubation in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.7, containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 1 h at 50 °C with gentle agitation. Blots were reblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and probed as described above. Densitometric scan of immunoblots was performed using ONE-Dscan software (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA). ROS membranes (100 μg) were solubilized in 0.2 ml of buffer B, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100 with or without 0.1% SDS; mixed thoroughly; and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any particulate material. The cleared supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose/protein G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The suspension was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the precleared supernatant was incubated with anti-Src (5 μg) and 50 μl of protein A-agarose (4 mg/ml) or protein G-agarose for 3–4 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, washed (four times) with 0.4 ml of buffer B. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-opsin (1:2000) or anti-arrestin (1:2000). Typically, ROS membranes (100 μg) or “whole retinal” homogenates were solubilized in buffer B without SDS as described above. The cleared supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose/protein G-agarose or GST-agarose for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The suspension was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the precleared supernatants were incubated with PY99-agarose (40 μg) or normal mouse IgG-agarose (40 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, washed (three times) with 0.4 ml of buffer B (without SDS) and two times with 50 μl of kinase assay buffer. Tyrosine kinase activity in the immune complex was assayed as previously described (19Bell M.W. Desai N. Guo X.X. Ghalayini A.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2006-2019Google Scholar) using exogenously added Raytide EL as substrate in kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% Brij 35, and 5 μg of Raytide EL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of ATP mix (0.2 mm ATP and 30 mm MgCl2) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 35 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 120 μl of 10% phosphoric acid, and the reaction mixture was applied to a 2.5-cm diameter Whatman P81 filter paper and washed 5 × 10 min in 5 ml of 0.5% phosphoric acid. Radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Enzyme activity is expressed as difference between counts incorporated into Raytide using either PY99-agarose or normal mouse IgG-agarose. ROS membranes or retinal homogenates from dark- and light-adapted retinas were solubilized in buffer B without SDS as previously described, and equal aliquots based on total protein were precleared with 20 μg of GST-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with either 20 μg of GST-agarose (control) or 20 μg of SH2-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The agarose beads were centrifuged briefly at 2000 × g and washed four times with buffer B, and the associated proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with either anti-opsin or anti-arrestin. ROS membranes (100 μg) were solubilized in 0.2 ml of buffer B, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100; mixed thoroughly; and centrifuged at 27,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (solubilized membranes) was removed, and the detergent-insoluble pellet was washed a second time with the same buffer, centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the final pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by immunoblot analysis. Eyes were fixed in perfix (20% isopopropyl alcohol, 2% trichloroacetic acid, 4% paraformaldehyde, and 2% zinc chloride) for 48 h; dehydrated in 70, 80, 95, and 100% ethanol for 45 min each; and embedded in paraffin. For immunocytochemistry, sections were dewaxed and rinsed sequentially with water and phosphate-buffered saline, and endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by incubation at room temperature for 20 min with H2O2 (0.05%). Sections were blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Incubations with anti-Src (N terminus; 2.5 μg/ml), or anti-arrestin (1:4000) were carried out for 2 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. After rinsing the sections (three times) with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain kit; Vector Laboratories). After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (three times), immunoreactions were developed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.06% diaminobenzidine and 0.01% H2O2 for 7–20 min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed in tap water, and the reaction was visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert photomicroscope. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99), polyclonal anti-Src (C terminus amino acids 509–533), polyclonal anti-Src (N terminus amino acids 3–18), SH2, SH3, and SH2-SH3 fusion proteins coupled to GST-agarose corresponding to Fyn were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). SH2-GST-agarose corresponding to the SH2 domain of Src was obtained from Calbiochem. Clone 28, a monoclonal antibody to activated Src (20Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Koji-Owada M. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Hisaaki Kawakatsu (University of California, San Francisco). Polyclonal anti-bovine arrestin was a gift from Dr. Igal Gery at the National Eye Institute (Bethesda, MD). Monoclonal anti-opsin antibody (Rho 4D2) was a gift from Dr. Robert Molday (University of British Columbia). Immunoblot analyses of retinal homogenates, non-ROS membranes, and ROS membranes from dark- (D) and light-adapted (L) retinas with anti-Src are shown in Fig. 1A. LROS membranes were significantly enriched in the amount of Srcover DROS. Densitometric scanning of the immunoblot showed a 6.6-fold enrichment of LROS over DROS. No detectable light-dark differences were observed between retinal homogenates or non-ROS membranes (band II), indicating that Src association with ROS membranes is light-dependent and that it occurs specifically in ROS. Fig. 1B shows the enrichment of arrestin (an independent indicator of light adaptation) in LROS over DROS. In addition, anti-arrestin recognized a band (*) of ∼85 kDa, which was also recognized by anti-opsin (not shown), thus indicating that this may represent an opsin-arrestin aggregate. The enrichment of opsin in both DROS and LROS (Fig. 1C) over the other membrane fractions further validates the specificity of the membrane association of Src with LROS. Coomassie Blue-stained gel of all fractions used is shown in Fig. 1D. In other experiments, we compared both the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation and amount of Src associated with DROS and LROS membranes (Fig.2). Immunoblots of DROS and LROS with PY99 show that tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins was increased in LROS over DROS in response to in vivo light exposure (Fig. 2A). The most pronounced increases were observed with proteins of apparent molecular mass of ∼60, 70, 80, 110, 120, and 160 kDa. The 60-kDa protein showed the highest extent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Densitometric scanning of the blot showed that this represents a 1.9-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of LROS over DROS. A reprobe of the same immunoblot with anti-Src antibody identified the 60-kDa protein as Src (Fig. 2B). Densitometric scans of anti-Src immunoblot showed a 2.3-fold increase in the amount of Src associated with LROS, indicating that the increase in phosphotyrosine immunoreaction represents the increase in the amount of Src associated with LROS and not an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Src. Other membranes (non-ROS) obtained from the same gradient (DII and LII) showed no apparent difference in either phosphotyrosine or Src content (Fig. 2,A and B, respectively), indicating the specificity of the effect of light on photoreceptor ROS membranes. The extent of enrichment of Src in LROS over DROS varied from 1.6- to 3.8-fold (Fig. 2C). In other experiments, PY99 immunoprecipitates from DROS and LROS were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Src and assayed for tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 3A, Src was recovered in PY99 immunoprecipitates from both DROS and LROS (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), while it was absent in control immunoprecipitates with normal mouse IgG (lanes 1 and 2). When PY99 immunoprecipitates were assayed for tyrosine kinase activity using exogenously added Raytide as substrate, LROS immunoprecipitates showed twice the activity of DROS immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B). In other experiments, we compared the amount of Src associated with DROS and LROS using two different antibodies: a peptide-specific anti-Src and a monoclonal antibody, designated clone 28, that recognizes only the activated form of Src (20Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Koji-Owada M. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of D and LROS is shown in Fig.4. Clone 28 recognized Src in LROS membranes, whereas immunoreaction was barely detectable in DROS, indicating that the activated form of Src preferentially associates with LROS and not DROS. Densitometric scans of the immunoblot showed a 4.6-fold enrichment of activated Src in LROS over DROS (Fig.4A). When the same immunoblot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Src, a similar increase in the amount of Src was observed in LROS over DROS (Fig. 4B). Densitometric scans showed a 3.3-fold increase in LROS over DROS. DROS and LROS were immunoprecipitated with clone 28 to identify any associated proteins in the immunoprecipitate. When the immunoblot was sequentially probed for arrestin and Src, they were both detected in the immunoprecipitates from DROS and LROS (Fig.4C); however, more of both Src and arrestin were recovered from LROS than DROS. In an attempt to determine how Src associates with ROS membranes, solubilized DROS and LROS were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-opsin. As shown in Fig.5A, opsin was detected only in immunoprecipitates of LROS, with the monomer and dimer of opsin being the predominant form in the immunoprecipitates. This indicates that Src associates specifically with bleached rhodopsin in ROS membranes. Arrestin was also detected in immunoprecipitates of LROS but was absent from immunoprecipitates with normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 5B). These results indicate the presence of a multimeric complex containing Src, bleached rhodopsin, and arrestin. When whole retinal homogenates from dark- and light-adapted retinas were immunoprecipitated with anti-opsin, Src was only detected in light-adapted immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5C). In other experiments, tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from “whole retina” were affinity-eluted from PY99-agarose with phenylphosphate, and the eluates were either assayed for tyrosine kinase activity or subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Src or anti-opsin (Fig.6). As shown, Src was recovered in phenylphosphate eluates from both dark- and light-adapted retinas; however, only the eluates from light-adapted retinas contained opsin indicating a light-dependent association between Src and opsin (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and4). Neither Src nor opsin was detectable in control eluates using GST-agarose instead of PY99-agarose (Fig. 6A,lanes 1 and 3). When eluates from PY99 immunoprecipitates were assayed for tyrosine kinase activity using exogenously added Raytide, light-adapted retinas had 1.5-fold the activity of dark-adapted retinas (Fig. 6B), indicating that activated Src is specifically associated with bleached rhodopsin either directly or indirectly. In other experiments, we tested the interaction of Src fusion proteins with DROS and LROS as well as dark- and light-adapted “whole retinal” homogenates (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7A, both bleached opsin and arrestin were found to associate with Src SH2 domain (lane 4), whereas neither opsin nor arrestin was detected in DROS (lane 2). Control incubations of DROS and LROS with GST-agarose (lanes 1 and 3) also showed the absence of opsin and arrestin, indicating the specificity of interaction of Src SH2 domain with bleached opsin. Similar results were obtained when dark- and light-adapted “whole retinal” homogenates were used to test the interaction with the Src SH2 domain (Fig.7B). Comparison of the interaction of different Src domains with dark- and light-adapted “whole retinal” homogenates showed that bleached opsin associates predominantly with the SH2 domain of Src and to a much lower extent with the SH3 domain (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the amount of opsin recovered from SH2-SH3 fusion protein was similar to that recovered with SH2 fusion protein, suggesting that bleached rhodopsin interaction with Src occurs predominantly through the SH2 domain of Src. A cytoskeletal enriched fraction obtained from DROS and LROS was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Src and anti-arrestin (Fig.8). As shown, the light-adapted cytoskeletal pellet was significantly enriched with Src and arrestin over the dark-adapted pellet, indicating that light exposure specifically promotes the association of Src and arrestin with the ROS cytoskeleton. Immunocytochemistry of sections from dark- and light-adapted albino rat retinas are shown in Fig. 9. In the outer retina, immunoreaction was detected throughout the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor cells in both dark- and light-adapted retinas. However, immunoreaction with light-adapted sections was much more pronounced that of dark-adapted sections (Fig. 9A), possibly indicating exposure of a specific Src epitope in response to light. No apparent difference in immunoreaction of this antibody with dark- and light-adapted retinal homogenates was observed (Fig. 9C), suggesting that this is unlikely to represent an increase in the amount of Src protein in the light. However, we cannot rule out that the observed difference in immunocytochemistry represents a light-dependent modification of Src. Sections incubated in the absence of primary antibody showed no reaction (not shown). As a positive control, immunolocalization of arrestin in dark- and light-adapted sections is shown in Fig. 9B. Arrestin was present predominantly in the inner segments of photoreceptors of dark-adapted retinas but was present only in the outer segment of light-adapted retinas, in agreement with previous reports (22McGinnis J.F. Whelan J.P. Donoso L.A. J. Neurosci Res. 1992; 3: 584-590Google Scholar). The translocation of arrestin between the inner and outer segments is quite evident; however, Src shows only differences in the intensity of reaction and not localization in response to light. These results suggest that Src might either translocate from the cytosol to the disc membranes/cytoskeleton or undergo a conformational change exposing a specific epitope in response to light. We have previously reported that light stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of photoreceptor ROS in rat retina in vivo(15Ghalayini A.J. Guo X.X. Koutz C.A Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 817-821Google Scholar). In the current report, we have observed that light exposure of albino rats promotes a specific association of Src with LROS membranes purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. LROS membranes were enriched 1.6–6.6-fold with Src over DROS membranes. Arrestin, which has been documented to bind to bleached and phosphorylated rhodopsin (21Kühn H. Prog. Retinal Res. 1984; 3: 123-156Google Scholar) was similarly enriched in these same membranes over DROS. LROS membranes also showed a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins ranging in size from 60 to 140 kDa. The 60-kDa protein was identified as Src by sequential probing first with PY99 followed by anti-Src. Densitometric scanning of both blots revealed a similar increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and amount of Src (1.9- and 2.3-fold, respectively) associated with LROS, indicating that the apparent increase in the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of Src simply represents the increase in the amount of Src associated with LROS. The identity of the 60-kDa protein was further verified by immunoprecipitation with PY99. These immunoprecipitates recovered Src from both DROS and LROS. Moreover, tyrosine kinase activity in PY99 immunoprecipitates from LROS was twice that of DROS, indicating that Src recovered from LROS is the activated form of the enzyme. In other experiments, we investigated if the membrane-associated Src is an activated form of Src. There are two known phosphorylation sites on Src, which are Tyr419 and Tyr530 (for a review, see Ref. 23Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Tyr530 is an autoregulatory (inhibitory) phosphorylation site and that the unphosphorylated Tyr530 is the activated (open configuration) form of Src (20Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Koji-Owada M. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Google Scholar, 23Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Google Scholar). We have used monoclonal antibodies (clone 28), which specifically recognize the activated form of Src (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-660Google Scholar,20Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Koji-Owada M. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Google Scholar), to probe DROS and LROS. Our results showed a significant immunoreaction of clone 28 with LROS but not DROS, whereas polyclonal anti-Src recognized Src in DROS and LROS. This indicates that the increase in membrane association of Src with LROS represents an increase in the activated form of Src. This was further verified by immunoprecipitation of both DROS and LROS with clone 28. Activated Src was present only in LROS immunoprecipitates, whereas it was absent from DROS immunoprecipitates. These findings indicate that light promotes the association of activated Src (unphosphorylated Tyr530) with ROS membranes. However, we cannot rule out that this activation may also involve tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr419. To investigate the mechanism of light-dependent membrane association of Src with ROS membranes, DROS and LROS were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src. Immunoprecipitates from LROS were significantly enriched with rhodopsin over DROS, indicating that light specifically increases the association of Src with bleached rhodopsin. In other experiments, PY99 immunoprecipitates from dark- and light-adapted retinas showed the presence of both Src and bleached opsin in light-adapted retinas, whereas only Src was recovered from dark-adapted retinas. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase activity in PY99 immunoprecipitates from light-adapted retinas was 1.5-fold higher than dark-adapted retinas. These observations taken together suggest that light exposure promotes the formation of a complex that contains Src, arrestin, and bleached rhodopsin in photoreceptor outer segments and that activated Src is associated with bleached opsin. Studies with SH2 and SH3 binding domains also demonstrated the association of bleached opsin with Src SH2 domain. These observations would indicate that opsin may interact with Src SH2 domain either directly or indirectly through an adaptor protein. The presence of both rhodopsin and arrestin in immunoprecipitates of LROS with activated Src suggests a light-dependent formation of a multimeric complex containing rhodopsin, arrestin, and activated Src. The specific intermolecular mechanism of association of these proteins remains to be elucidated. Src can putatively interact with other signaling molecules (receptors, adaptor proteins, or enzymes) through its SH2 and SH3 domains, catalytic domain (24Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V.

Neurosci Res. 1992; 3: 584-590Google Scholar). The association of Src with bleached opsin or arrestin could occur through any of these mechanisms. Our observation using ROS membranes and “whole retinal” homogenates strongly suggest that this association involves the SH2 domain binding to either bleached opsin, arrestin, or a yet unidentified protein that forms a complex with opsin and arrestin. To date, there is no evidence of tyrosine phosphorylation of either rhodopsin or arrestin; however, such a modification has not been addressed rigorously. Recent studies (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-660Google Scholar), have shown the presence of a trimeric complex consisting of Src, β-arrestin, and the β2-adrenergic receptor, whose formation is stimulated by isoproterenol. This interaction was shown to be mediated by the SH3 region of Src binding to a proline-rich region in the N terminus of β-arrestin. Visual arrestin does not contain the proline rich sequence present in β-arrestin, indicating that its interaction with Src may involve a different module of protein-protein interaction or an interaction mediated by rhodopsin. Other reports have shown that β-arrestin as well as visual arrestin interact with the catalytic domain of Src (24Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Google Scholar). Additionally, Src has been recently shown to interact directly with the β3-adrenergic receptor through its SH3 domain (25Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Google Scholar). These observations along with our current observations clearly suggest several mechanisms for agonist-mediated interaction between Src, arrestins, and GPCRs. The specific module of interaction may depend on cell type, receptor type, and stimulus. Immunocytochemistry of Src in photoreceptor cells shows a significant increase in intensity of reaction in light-adapted sections over dark-adapted sections, suggesting a light-dependent conformational change resulting in the exposure of the N terminus of Src. On the other hand, arrestin is immunolocalized in a more dramatic fashion to the outer segments of light-adapted sections. In this regard, our observations of 1) both Src and arrestin being enriched in a Triton X-100-insoluble, cytoskeleton-enriched fraction of LROS (Fig.8) and 2) the light-dependent formation of a complex containing Src, arrestin, and bleached opsin (Figs. 4, 5, and 7) support the hypothesis that the interaction of bleached opsin, Src, and arrestin may be indicative of a light-mediated translocation of photoreceptor proteins between the inner and outer segment and/or a light-mediated membrane/cytoskeleton association within the outer segment. A recent report demonstrates a light- and GTPγS-dependent association of transducin α subunit and the rod cGMP-phosphodiesterase with detergent-resistant “lipid rafts” isolated from bovine ROS (26Seno K. Kishimoto M. Abe M. Higuchi Y. Mieda M. Owada Y. Yoshiyama W. Liu H. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20813-20816Google Scholar). We have recently reported the association of transducin α subunit with caveolin, a scaffolding protein enriched in detergent-resistant microdomains obtained from bovine ROS (27Elliott M.H. Desai N. Ghalayini A.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 184Google Scholar). These results along with our current observations regarding Src and arrestin may suggest a role for detergent-resistant lipid rafts in the recruitment and formation of signaling complexes within photoreceptor outer segments in a light-dependent manner. The consequence of light activation of tyrosine phosphorylation in photoreceptor outer segments remains unknown. Our data suggest that Src is a light-activated tyrosine kinase in photoreceptor cells and may, in part, be responsible for the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in ROS membranes. Several putative Tyr(P) substrates have been identified in ROS, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (28Guo X.X. Ghalayini A.J. Chen H. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1873-1882Google Scholar), SHP-2 (29Bell M.W. Alvarez K. Ghalayini A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2331-2340Google Scholar), transducin α (19Bell M.W. Desai N. Guo X.X. Ghalayini A.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2006-2019Google Scholar), and PLCγ1, which binds to bleached ROS membranes in vitro and translocates from the inner and outer segments of photoreceptors in response to light adaptationin vitro (30Ghalayini A.J. Weber N. Rundle D.R. Koutz C.A. Lambert D. Guo X.X. Anderson R.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 171-178Google Scholar). The possible regulation of the former enzymes by light in vivo is currently under investigation. A recent report has demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors in response to epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor treatment of photoreceptor cells in culture (31Fontaine V. Kinkl N. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 23: 9662-9672Google Scholar). In nonocular tissue, the epidermal growth factor receptor has been shown to associate with Src and to be regulated by it (32Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Google Scholar). Other reports have shown that the photoreceptor cGMP-gated channel is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (33Molokanova E. Trivedi B. Savchenko A. Kramer R.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9068-9076Google Scholar,34Molokanova E. Maddox F. Luetje C.W. Kramer R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 12: 4786-4795Google Scholar). Functionally, in vivo light-activated tyrosine phosphorylation could serve to establish an intracellular communication network between the outer and inner segments of photoreceptors. This intracellular communication is likely to be important in the maintenance of the functional/structural polarization of photoreceptor cells. The hypothesis we propose can be summarized as follows: light → rhodopsin → activation of tyrosine kinase (Src) in the inner segment → tyrosine phosphorylation of other cytosolic photoreceptor proteins in the inner segment → direct recruitment/transport of cytosolic signaling molecules to ROS (e.g.PLCγ1) or recruitment/transport of cytosolic proteins (e.g. arrestin) through their association with an adaptor molecule that is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.10). Tyr(P) residues on these cytosolic proteins bind to SH2 or PTB binding domains present in an integral ROS protein at the base of the outer segment or cytoskeletal element present throughout the photoreceptor, which ultimately leads to their transport from the inner to the outer segment. Alternatively, light → rhodopsin → activation of tyrosine kinase (Src) → translocation/membrane association of Src with ROS → tyrosine phosphorylation of an integral ROS membrane protein/cytoskeletal component providing high affinity binding sites (Tyr(P)) for signaling proteins with either an SH2 domain (e.g.PLCγ1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or SHP-2) or a PTB. In either model, Tyr(P) residues generated in a light-dependent manner provide a module for protein-protein interaction between cytosolic photoreceptor proteins and integral membrane/cytoskeletal components of ROS. This module provides docking sites for transport of cytosolic proteins between the inner and outer segment either through association with the cytoskeleton or an integral ROS protein. Depending on the identity of the signaling protein recruited, the outcome will either modulate the photoresponse (light adaptation/turn-off; e.g. PLCγ1 or arrestin translocation) or contribute to other light-regulated (entrained) events that are important for the maintenance of structural integrity of photoreceptor cells (disc shedding/morphogenesis)."

Ceramide accumulation reveals a bifurcation in integrin function, as it abolished agonist-induced adhesion to planar surfaces, yet had little effect on homotypic aggregation. We increased cellular ceramide content by treating polymorphonuclear neutrophils with sphingomyelinase C and controlled for loss of sphingomyelin by pretreatment with sphingomyelinase D to generate ceramide phosphate, which is not a substrate for sphingomyelinase C. Pretreatment with the latter enzyme blocked all the effects of sphingomyelinase C. Ceramide generation caused a Ca2+ flux and complete degranulation of both primary and secondary granules and increased surface β2-integrin expression. These integrins were in a nonfunctional state, and subsequent activation with platelet-activating factor or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine induced β2-integrin-dependent homotypic aggregation. However, these cells were completely unable to adhere to surfaces via β2-integrins. This was not due to a defect in the integrins themselves because the active conformation could be achieved by cation switching. Rather, ceramide affected cytoskeletal organization and inside-out signaling, leading to affinity maturation. Cytochalasin D induced the same disparity between aggregation and surface adhesion. We conclude that ceramide affects F-actin rearrangement, leading to massive degranulation, and reveals differences in β2-integrin-mediated adhesive events."
https://openalex.org/W2137178756,"Protein metabolism in eukaryotic organisms is defined by a synthesis-degradation equilibrium that is subject to regulation by hormonal and nutritional signals. In mammalian tissues such as skeletal muscle, glucocorticoid hormones specify a catabolic response that influences both protein synthetic and protein degradative pathways. With regard to the former, glucocorticoids attenuate mRNA translation at two levels: translational efficiency, i.e.translation initiation, and translational capacity, i.e.ribosome biogenesis. Glucocorticoids may impair translational capacity through the ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70 S6K), a recognized glucocorticoid target and an effector of ribosomal protein synthesis. We demonstrate here that the reduction in growth factor-activated p70 S6K activity by glucocorticoids depends upon a functional glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and that the GR is both necessary and sufficient to render p70 S6K subject to glucocorticoid regulation. Furthermore, the DNA binding and transcriptional activation but not repression properties of the GR are indispensable for p70 S6K regulation. Finally, a mutational analysis of the p70 S6K carboxyl terminus indicates that this region confers glucocorticoid sensitivity, and thus glucocorticoids may facilitate autoinhibition of the enzyme ultimately reducing the efficiency with which T389 is phosphorylated.

Their mechanism of action involves recognition by the cytosolic, ligand-inducible glucocorticoid receptor (GR),1 which, in the absence of hormone, is inactive by virtue of its interaction with a heat shock protein 90-based chaperone complex. When complexed with its ligand, the GR undergoes a conformational transformation that promotes its subsequent transport into the nucleus. Therein, the GR interacts with discrete glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) within the promoter region of target genes. This mode of action may lead to the hormone-dependent induction or repression of responsive genes, which is further modulated by cell background, GRE context, and accessory transcription factors (1Miner J.N.

The activation of p70 S6K derives from a complex series of phosphorylations involving some 13 reported sites (7Grammer T.C. Cheathem L. Chou M.M. Blenis J.

A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1A). These phosphorylations occur in a hierarchical manner commencing with phosphorylation of a cluster of at least four carboxyl-terminal sites localized within the presumptive autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain (19Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S.J. Totty N.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events have been suggested to transform the conformation of the protein so as to disrupt a putative interaction between the autoinhibitory region and the substrate recognition pocket. As a result, additional internal phosphorylation sites are exposed to activating kinases. Among the internal sites, phosphorylation of Thr229 (21Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.-W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), Ser371 (20Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A.

Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) are essential for p70 S6K activity as a single alanine substitution at any one site prevents activation of the kinase. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr229 facilitates phosphorylation of Thr389 and vice versa (24Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 25Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, the strong, synergistic phosphorylation of Thr229 and Thr389 is a critical determinant of the extent of p70 S6K activation (24Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The Thr229 kinase has been identified as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1 (24Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T.

Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar)), which is an important activating kinase for many AGC superfamily kinases. However, Thr389 kinase, provisionally dubbed PDK2, remains uncharacterized. p70 S6K serves a critical function in governing the G1-to-S-phase transition, which may in turn, reflect p70 S6K-mediated regulation of ribosome biogenesis. During cell proliferation, an increase in cellular components required for protein synthesis is necessary to support the increase in cell mass that precedes mitosis (reviewed in Refs. 27Neufeld T.P. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 28Polymenis M. Schmidt E.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The surge in ribosomal protein mRNA translation that accompanies cell growth may be attributable to a distinctive 5′ polynucleotide sequence designated TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine), which is a feature common to many ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs (29Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar,30Terada N. Patel H.R. Takase K. Kohno K. Nairn A.C. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11477-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This structural element is sufficient to confer mitogen-stimulated translational induction to heterologous mRNAs (31Jefferies H.B.J. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Importantly, the preferential selection of TOP mRNAs correlates closely with activation of p70 S6K. For example, in embryonic stem cells deleted of endogenous p70 S6K, the translation of TOP mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins is not augmented in cells exposed to serum (32Kawasone H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fruit fly variants harboring a partial loss-of-functiondS6K (the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian p70 S6K) allele display a grossly reduced body size resulting from diminished overall cell size rather than cell number (33Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hagen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Although the phenotype of the p70 S6K knock-out mouse is relatively mild, these animals exhibit a reduced body and organ size (34Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the available data are consistent with an important role for p70 S6K in the control of ribosome biogenesis and cell size determination. We demonstrate here that the glucocorticoid-liganded form of the GR attenuates growth factor-stimulated activation of p70 S6K through dephosphorylation of (Ser/Thr)Pro sites localized to the carboxyl-terminal pseudosubstrate autoregulatory domain of the kinase. These dephosphorylations give rise to a net dephosphorylation of Thr389, perhaps by stabilizing an autoinhibited or less active protein conformation. The results imply that the GR may be an important modulator of ribosome biogenesis, and insofar as glucocorticoids modulate protein metabolism in skeletal muscle, GR-mediated control of the S6 phosphorylation pathway may, in part, represent a component of the molecular basis of glucocorticoid excess-associated myopathies.

The D3E S429D variant was created using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis strategy (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) in which the D3E-p70 S6K cDNA was amplified so as to include the desired point mutation as well as an XbaI site 5′ of the amino-terminal HA tag and an EcoRI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The mutagenized PCR product was then cloned into the pRK7 expression vector by virtue of newly introduced XbaI and EcoRI sites. ΔCT104 was created through amplification of an HA-p70 S6K fragment comprising amino acids 1–398. This fragment was mutagenized so as to include an XbaI site 5′ of the HA epitope and a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site just 3′ to Ser398. The fragment was subsequently cloned into pRK7, generating ΔCT104, in which the putative autoinhibitory domain, which extends from amino acids 399 to 502, has been deleted. All rat GR variants were cloned into the pS6R expression plasmid. N525 (36Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R.

COS7 and HEK293 cells (Dr. Anthony Pegg, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine) and spontaneously differentiating rat L6 and mouse C2C12 skeletal myoblasts (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well and cultured in the presence of serum for 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for an additional 24 h, and cells were assayed subsequently. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing the human insulin receptor (CHO-IR; Joseph Avruch, Harvard Medical School) were cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. CHO-IR cells were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg each of plasmid DNA encoding p70 S6K and GR variants as indicated in the legend of relevant figures using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free Ham's F12 medium for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of dexamethasone as indicated. Cells were subsequently stimulated for 30 min with insulin and then assayed. Cellular protein was prepared initially by harvesting cells in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm benzamidine, 800 nm leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4). Solubilization of cell membranes was facilitated by rocking extracts on an orbital rocker for an additional 20 min. Cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and subjected to Western analysis as described previously (38Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C221-C228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each immunoblot presented, samples from each condition were pooled from either duplicate or triplicate assays prior to electrophoresis. Thus, the depicted Western blots accurately reflect mean immunoreactivity for a given experiment. This procedure has been detailed elsewhere (5Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity of endogenous or ectopically expressed p70 S6K was determined in anti-p70 S6K or anti-HA immune complexes, respectively, by measuring 32P incorporation into a synthetic peptide (AKRRRLSSLRA) derived from the region of S6 phosphorylated naturally. Because, in the cell system employed here, the expression levels of different p70 S6K constructs was somewhat variable between treatment conditions, when p70 S6K was expressed ectopically, kinase activity determinations were normalized for protein expression levels. Although glucocorticoid hormones affect a number of biological processes, often the control of discrete physiologic events is observed within a defined subset of glucocorticoid-sensitive cell types. Indeed, the regulation of p70 S6K by glucocorticoids has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle (40Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E76-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in interleukin-2-dependent T lymphocytes (4Monfar M. Blenis J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1107-1115PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a previous study, p70 S6K activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts was shown to be completely insensitive to glucocorticoid treatment (4Monfar M. Blenis J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1107-1115PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that, in this particular cell line, some component essential for glucocorticoid action is lacking. In contrast, in cultures of undifferentiated myoblasts, glucocorticoids repress p70 S6K activation (5Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We rationalized that the relative glucocorticoid sensitivities observed in various cell types may reflect the presence or absence of the GR. In the present study, the ability of glucocorticoids to repress p70 S6K activity was examined in four cell lines. Two lines were found to be completely insensitive to glucocorticoids insofar as p70 S6K regulation was concerned (COS7 and HEK293), whereas C2C12 and L6 myoblasts exhibited mild (∼10% inhibition, C2C12) to moderate (35–50% inhibition, L6) sensitivities (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, analysis of unstimulated cell extracts prepared from each of the four cell types revealed that the responsiveness of p70 S6K to glucocorticoids was not only related to the presence of the GR but perhaps also to the activity of the receptor, as indicated by the greater extent of GR down-regulation observed in L6 versusC2C12 cells (cf. Fig. 2, A and B). The absence of endogenous GR immunoreactivity observed in COS7 (monkey) and HEK293 (human) lysates (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3 and4–6, respectively) was not because of an inability of the antibody to recognize the GR from different species, as it displays broad cross-reactivity with GR homologs from rat to human (41Al-Mohaisen M. Cardounel A. Kalimi M. Steroids. 2000; 65: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whereas no change in p70 S6K content was observed following 4 h of hormone treatment, it did appear that in C2C12 and L6 cells exposed to glucocorticoid for 24 h, the levels of p70 S6K protein were diminished (Fig. 2B, lanes 9–12). Nevertheless, in C2C12 and L6 cells treated with glucocorticoid, the multiple electrophoretic forms of p70 S6K redistributed to forms of higher mobility (Fig. 2B) indicating that p70 S6K was dephosphorylated. Such an effect was not observed in COS7 or HEK293 cells. Whereas in L6 cells expression of GR was down-regulated following administration of dexamethasone, GR expression was only minimally affected in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2B). The reduction in GR protein was related temporally (Fig. 2B) and has been shown to occur at both the level of gene transcription (42Cidlowski J.A. Cidlowski N.B. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 43Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7284-7291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and post-translationally (44Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Hence, the relative sensitivity of p70 S6K to regulation by glucocorticoids is related to the availability of the GR, presumably to mediate this regulation. Surprisingly, however, GR regulation of p70 S6K appears to be stronger in L6 cells compared with C2C12 cells, despite relatively less endogenous receptor. The primary mode of glucocorticoid action entails recognition of the hormone by the GR, which converts the receptor into an activated transcriptional modulator. The partial GR agonist RU486 (also called mifepristone) competes with natural and synthetic glucocorticoids for binding to the GR. The resultant RU486-liganded GR is efficiently imported into the nucleus but manifests a generalized defect in transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, this form of activated GR remains sufficient for transcriptional repression in certain cell systems and promoter contexts (45Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 46Liden J. Delaunay F. Rafter I. Gustafsson J. Okret S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dexamethasone, a pure glucocorticoid agonist, inhibited IGF-I-stimulated activation of p70 S6K in a dose-related fashion within 4 h of exposure to the steroid (Fig. 3A) with 50% inhibition achieved at a concentration of 1 μm. To tentatively address the requirements for GR function in this effect, the potential for RU486 to exhibit glucocorticoid-mimetic or antiglucocorticoid properties was evaluated. Cells treated with RU486 alone consistently displayed slight elevations in p70 S6K activity (10–20%; Fig. 3A). Importantly, incubation of cultured myoblasts with RU486 prior to dexamethasone completely abrogated glucocorticoid regulation of p70 S6K (Fig. 3B). The implications of these findings are 2-fold: (i) p70 S6K inhibition by glucocorticoids requires the GR; and (ii) the glucocorticoid antagonism elicited by RU486 suggests that GR-mediated regulation of p70 S6K may involve transcriptional enhancement rather than repression, the latter of which could result from ligand activation of the GR by either dexamethasone or RU486. To begin to evaluate biochemically the regulation of p70 S6K by the GR, the ability of an ectopically expressed GR to recapitulate natural p70 S6K control (i.e. as observed in endogenous systems) was examined. A derivative of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with the insulin receptor (CHO-IR) displays two features critical for evaluating exogenous GR regulation of p70 S6K: (i) the cell line expresses nominal levels of endogenous GR, and (ii) both endogenous and exogenously expressed p70 S6K are robustly activated in these cells when treated with low nanomolar concentrations of insulin (Ref. 48Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and Fig.4A), an effect that is completely inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with rapamycin. The CHO-IR cells were cotransfected with the full-length, wild-type GR and a p70 S6K variant that bears an amino-terminal HA epitope tag. In this coexpression system, the endogenous pool of GR was clearly insufficient to modulate ectopically expressed p70 S6K (Fig. 4B) as no effect on p70 S6K activity was observed in dexamethasone-treated cells transfected with empty vector. Alternatively, when overexpressed, ectopic GR inhibited p70 S6K activity to an extent similar to that observed in L6 myoblasts and did so in a dexamethasone-dependent manner (cf. Fig.4, B and C). In both the natural (L6) and ectopic expression (CHO-IR) systems utilized in this study, the extent of inhibition of p70 S6K by glucocorticoids ranged reproducibly from 35 to 50%. Moreover, this regulation was strictly dependent on the presence of glucocorticoid. As mentioned above, prolonged activation of the GR leads to its homologous down-regulation both through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms (49Webster J.C. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This phenomenon would explain the glucocorticoid-dependent reduction in transfected GR protein observed under most conditions utilized in this study (e.g. Fig. 4C). Monfar and Blenis (4Monfar M. Blenis J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1107-1115PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of interleukin-2-stimulated p70 S6K activity is abrogated in T cells administered the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated the sufficiency of actinomycin D to prevent the glucocorticoid-induced dephosphorylation of p70 S6K in L6 myoblasts (16Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest that p70 S6K is regulated by glucocorticoids in a transcriptionally dependent manner. To explore the transcriptional properties of the GR essential for p70 S6K inhibition, a series of GR variants was individually cotransfected with HA-p70 S6K into the CHO-IR cells (Fig.5). The consequences of glucocorticoid-dependent activation of the individual mutants was examined subsequently by immunoprecipitation of the exogenously expressed kinase using an antibody to the HA epitope present at the amino terminus of the expressed protein. The N525 GR variant displays a carboxyl-terminal truncation resulting in omission of amino acids 526–795 of the full-length rat GR (see Fig.1B). The deletion removes the ligand binding domain (LBD) and activation function 2 (AF-2), an agonist-dependent core transcriptional activation domain. Furthermore, the absence of the LBD renders N525 constitutively active with regard to transcriptional activation mediated"
https://openalex.org/W2327820374,"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) are frequently associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, leading to the expression of NPM-ALK, a fusion protein linking nucleophosmin and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase. In ALCLs, dimerization of NPM-ALK leads to constitutive autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase, necessary for NPM-ALK oncogenicity. To investigate whether NPM-ALK, like other oncogenic tyrosine kinases, can inhibit drug-induced apoptosis, we permanently transfected NPM-ALK into Jurkat T-cells. As in ALCLs, NPM-ALK was expressed as a constitutively kinase-active 80 kDa protein, and could be detected by immunocytochemistry in nucleoli, nuclei and cytoplasm. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (assessed by cell morphology and annexin V-FITC binding) was significantly inhibited in two independent NPM-ALK-expressing clones (5.2+/-1.8 and 7.5+/-0.8% apoptosis), compared to control vector-transduced cells (36+/-6.7%). Similar results were observed with etoposide. In contrast, Fas-induced apoptosis was not inhibited. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was delayed in doxorubicin-, but not anti-Fas-treated transfectant cells, indicating that apoptosis inhibition occurred upstream of mitochondrial events. Using NPM-ALK mutants, we demonstrated that inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis: (1) requires functional kinase activity, (2) does not involve phospholipase C-gamma, essential for NPM-ALK-mediated mitogenicity and (3) appears to be phosphoinositide 3-kinase independent, despite a strong Akt/PKB activation observed in wild type NPM-ALK-expressing cells. These results suggest that the NPM-ALK antiapoptotic and mitogenic pathways are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2322095085,"The E2F1 transcription factor controls cell proliferation and apoptosis. E2F1 activity is negatively regulated by the retinoblastoma (RB) protein. To study how inactivation of Rb and dysregulated E2F1 affects the developing retina, we analysed wild-type and Rb(-/-) embryonic retinas and retinal transplants and we established transgenic mice expressing human E2F1 in retinal photoreceptor cells under the regulation of the IRBP promoter (TgIRBPE2F1). A marked increase in cell proliferation and apoptosis was observed in the retinas of Rb(-/-) mice and TgIRBPE2F1 transgenic mice. In the transgenic mice, photoreceptor cells formed rosette-like arrangements at postnatal days 9 through 28. Complete loss of photoreceptors followed in the TgIRBPE2F1 mice but not in the Rb(-/-) retinal transplants. Both RB-deficient and E2F1-overexpressing photoreceptor cells expressed rhodopsin, a marker of terminal differentiation. Loss of p53 partially reduced the apoptosis and resulted in transient hyperplasia of multiple cell types in the TgIRBPE2F1 retinas at postnatal day 6. Our findings support the concept that cross-talk occurs between different retinal cell types and that multiple genetic pathways must become dysregulated for the full oncogenic transformation of neuronal retinal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972174938,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a heparin-binding protein that participates in both the complement and hemostatic system. We investigated the interaction between C4BP and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), an endocytic receptor involved in the catabolism of various heparin-binding proteins. Both plasma-derived C4BP and recombinant C4BP consisting of only its α-chains (rC4BPα) bound efficiently to immobilized LRP, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Complementary, two distinct fragments of LRP, i.e. clusters II and IV, both associated to immobilized rC4BPα, and binding could be inhibited by the LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein. Further analysis showed that association of rC4BPα to LRP was inhibited by heparin or by anti-C4BP antibody RU-3B9, which recognizes the heparin-binding region of the C4BP α-chains. In cellular degradation experiments, LRP-expressing fibroblasts effectively degraded125I-labeled rC4BPα, whereas their LRP-deficient counterparts displayed a 4-fold diminished capacity of degrading125I-rC4BPα. Finally, initial clearance of C4BP in mice was significantly delayed upon co-injection with receptor-associated protein. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the α-chains of C4BP comprise a binding site for LRP. We propose that LRP mediates at least in part the catabolism of C4BP and, as such, may regulate C4BP participation in complement and hemostatic processes.

Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). C4BP binds the complement protein C4b, which results in enhancement of factor I-mediated degradation of C4b and inhibition of the classical pathway C3 convertase (C4b2a) complex (1Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In plasma, C4BP may serve as a carrier protein for at least two other plasma proteins: the vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant Protein S and serum amyloid P component (1Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, C4BP may interact with coagulation factor VIII as well (2Koppelman S.J. van 't Veer C. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 2653-2660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the C4BP molecules (∼80%) consist of seven identical α-chains and a unique β-chain, whereas other isoforms lack either one of the α-chains or the β-chain (3Sanchez-Corral P. Criado G.O. Rodriguez D.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar). The β-chain is involved in the interaction with Protein S (4Hillarp A. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12759-12764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and complex formation with serum amyloid P component (SAP) and complement proteins is mediated by the α-chains (5Schwalbe R.A. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21749-21757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hessing M. van 't Veer C. Bouma B.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2632-2637PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the α-chains have been found to contain binding sites for bacterial surface proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes (7Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlback B. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar) and heparin (8Hessing M. Vlooswijk R.A. Hackeng T.M. Kanters D. Bouma B.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 204-208PubMed Google Scholar). The heparin interactive site, which overlaps with the C4b interactive site, encompasses a cluster of positively charged amino acids involving Arg residues at positions 39, 64, and 66 (9). The average plasma concentration of C4BP is ∼260 nm (150 μg/ml) (10Griffin J.H. Gruber A. Fernandez J.A. Blood. 1992; 79: 3203-3211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although its levels may increase up to 4-fold during inflammation, infection, or tissue damage (11Saeki T. Hirose S. Nukatsuka M. Kusunoki Y. Nagasawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Barnum S.R. Dahlback B. Complement Inflamm. 1990; 7: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasma levels represent a balance between C4BP production and removal. At present, little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms that control the removal of C4BP from the circulation. The notion that C4BP is able to interact with heparin opens the possibility that C4BP may interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) exposed at the cellular surface. Alternatively, C4BP may interact with cellular receptors like the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which is known to recognize heparin-binding proteins. LRP, also known as the α2-macroglobulin receptor, is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family of endocytic receptors (13Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neels J.G. Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1998; 12: 219-240Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It consists of a noncovalently linked heavy and light chain. The 85-kDa light chain comprises the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, whereas the ligand binding regions are located within the 515-kDa heavy chain (15Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The heavy chain contains four domains enriched in low density lipoprotein receptor class A domains, generally referred to as clusters I–IV. It has been reported that clusters II and IV play a prominent role in ligand binding to the receptor (16Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). LRP is widely distributed among tissues, such as liver, brain, and placenta, and is expressed in an array of cell types including parenchymal cells, Kupffer cells, neurons, astrocytes, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts (17Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). LRP has traditionally been reported as a receptor that is involved in hepatic clearance of numerous proteins (18Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), although recent studies demonstrate that LRP contributes to cellular signaling processes as well (19Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Herz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E157-E162Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Ligands bound by LRP belong to a spectrum of structurally and functionally unrelated proteins (13Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neels J.G. Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.

These include apolipoproteins, lipases, proteinases, proteinase/inhibitor complexes, Kunitz-type inhibitors, matrix proteins, and several others. The mechanism by which binding to LRP is mediated varies between ligands. First, ligands (e.g.α2-macroglobulin/protease complexes) may bind directly from the circulation to LRP (20Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, binding may be promoted by so called accessory proteins. This possibility is exemplified by the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, which facilitates internalization of urokinase complexed with its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by LRP (22Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A.

Furthermore, LRP-mediated degradation may be preceded by sequestration of the ligands by HSPG. Examples hereof include β-amyloid precursor protein (24Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I.

In the present study, we assessed binding of C4BP to LRP by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) employing purified components. Our data show that C4BP is able to interact with LRP with moderate affinity, and that binding involves the C4BP α-chain and the cluster II and IV regions of LRP. Furthermore, we found that LRP mediates the delivery of rC4BPα to the intracellular degradation pathway in mouse fibroblast cells, and that the initial clearance of C4BP in mice is delayed upon co-injection with the LRP-antagonist receptor-associated protein. Our data suggest that LRP contributes to the catabolism of the complement protein C4BP.

Plasma-derived C4BP (pd-C4BP) and Protein S were purified as described (28Hessing M. Kanters D. Hackeng T.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb.

Recombinant C4BP, consisting of the α-chains but lacking the β-chain (rC4BPα), was produced using stably transfected baby hamster kidney cell lines, purified until homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography as reported previously (30van de Poel R.H.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14543-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and stored in 125 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at −20 °C. Purified rC4BPα was labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce) as described (8Hessing M. Vlooswijk R.A. Hackeng T.M. Kanters D. Bouma B.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 204-208PubMed Google Scholar). Free Na125I was removed by chromatography on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in 125 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 125I-labeled rC4BPα was stored in small aliquots at −20 °C. Specific radioactivity was 4.0 (± 1.3) × 105 cpm/pmol rC4BPα (mean ± S.E.; n = 6). Each radiolabeled rC4BPα preparation was compared with unlabeled rC4BPα for binding to immobilized LRP employing SPR. In all cases labeled and unlabeled preparations displayed similar sensorgrams, demonstrating that both association and dissociation characteristics were unchanged upon labeling. On one occasion, this was investigated in more detail by determining affinity constants, which proved to be similar for radiolabeled and unlabeled rC4BPα (3.5 and 55.2 nmversus 5.6 and 66.2 nm, respectively). Purified full-length LRP (31Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. S. K.

RU-3B9 Fab fragments were prepared using the ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (Pierce) as instructed. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V) was obtained from Sigma. Proteins were quantified by a BCA protein assay (Pierce) using albumin as a standard. Binding studies were performed employing a Biacore2000 biosensor system, and SPR analysis was done essentially as described (26Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Mertens K. ter Maat H.

LRP or rC4BPα was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at the indicated densities using the amine-coupling kit as instructed by the supplier. Routinely, a control channel was activated and blocked using the amine-coupling reagents in the absence of protein. Binding to coated channels was corrected for binding to noncoated channels (<5% of binding to coated channels). SPR analysis was performed in 125 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at 25 °C at indicated flow rates. Regeneration of the surface of the LRP sensor chip was performed by subsequent application of 100 mmH3PO4 and 25 mm CaCl2. The rC4BPα sensor chip was regenerated using 100 mmH3PO4. For analysis of association and dissociation curves of the sensorgrams, BiaEvaluation software was used (Biacore AB). Interaction constants were determined by performing nonlinear global fitting of data corrected for bulk refractive index changes. Data were fitted to various models available within the software. For binding of rC4BPα to immobilized LRP, a model describing the interaction between rC4BPα and two independent binding sites (heterologous ligand, parallel reactions) was found to provide the best fit of the experimental data. Accuracy of the fits was judged from residual plots and statistical parameters employing previously described equations (35Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. van der Meijden P.Z.

Cellular degradation of rC4BPα was examined using mouse fibroblast cell lines MEF-1 (American Tissue Culture Collection, CRL-2214), or their counterparts, which are genetically deficient for LRP, PEA-13 (American Tissue Culture Collection, CRL-2216). MEF-1 and PEA-13 cells have been isolated from embryos resulting from the mating of mice heterogenous for LRP gene disruption (36Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MEF-1 cells express LRP endogenously, whereas PEA-13 cells have been demonstrated to contain two (via homologous recombination) disrupted alleles for the LRP gene. Cells were seeded at least 48 h before the experiment and grown to 90–95% confluence in 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Before incubation, cells were extensively washed with DMEM/F-12 medium.125I-labeled rC4BPα was mixed with nonlabeled rC4BPα to a 1:1 molar ratio, and the mixture was then added to the cells in a final volume of 250 μl in incubation medium (DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 2 mmCaCl2). Final concentration of rC4BPα was 100 nm. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed three times with 500 μl of incubation medium to remove nonbound material. Subsequently, incubation was allowed to proceed at 37 °C in a volume of 250 μl. At indicated time points, samples were taken to determine the amount of degraded material. Degraded material is defined as the radioactivity that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. In all experiments a control was included in which the amount of degradation was examined in the absence of cells. We used 14–16-week- old C57BL/6J mice. Three to six mice were housed in each cage and fed a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. Mice were injected intravenously with pd-C4BP (10.9 mg/kg) alone or in combination with GST-RAP (30 mg/kg) into the tail vein. Blood samples were collected in polypropylene Eppendorf tubes, containing approximately 0.1 volume of 129 mm trisodium citrate, at indicated time points from anesthetized mice by retro-orbital venous plexus puncture. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation of the blood at 2500 × g for 20 min at room temperature. Residual C4BP was determined using an immunosorbent assay specific for human C4BP. For each time point, 3 mice were used. Binding of pd-C4BP to LRP was investigated by SPR analysis using purified components. An increase in response was observed when pd-C4BP (30 nm) was passed over immobilized LRP (7 and 11 fmol/mm2), demonstrating that pd-C4BP is able to associate with LRP (Fig.1A). As the highest response is observed at the highest density of LRP, binding appears to be dose-dependent. Replacement of pd-C4BP solution by buffer resulted in a gradual decline of the response, indicating that pd-C4BP dissociates from LRP and that binding is reversible (Fig.1A). In plasma, C4BP is able to associate with other plasma proteins, like Protein S and SAP. Our data therefore do not fully exclude that the observed response originates from traces of Protein S or SAP present within the pd-C4BP preparation. However, no additional response was observed upon subsequent injection of anti-Protein S or anti-SAP antibodies after injection of C4BP preparations (data not shown). In addition, no association of purified Protein S to immobilized LRP was detected (Fig. 1A). Apparently, the observed increase in response originates from binding of C4BP to LRP. To further characterize the interaction between C4BP and LRP, SPR analysis was performed employing purified recombinant C4BP that consists only of the α-chains (30van de Poel R.H. Meijers J.C. Rosing J. Tans G. Bouma B.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14543-14548Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, recombinant rC4BPα (2–30 nm) efficiently associated to immobilized LRP (11 fmol/mm2) in a dose-dependent manner. Binding appeared to be similar for plasma-derived and recombinant C4BP. The interaction between rC4BPα and immobilized LRP was studied in more detail by assessment of the apparent association and dissociation rate constants, which are summarized in TableI. Experimental data were fitted most appropriately using a model describing the interaction of rC4BPα with two classes of binding sites (heterologous ligand, parallel interactions). The resulting apparent affinity constants (Kd(app)) values were 2.4 ± 1.9 nm and 71.4 ± 42.5 nm, respectively. These data demonstrate that LRP is able to bind the C4BP α-chain with moderate affinity in a reversible and dose-dependent manner. The observation that C4BP interacts with two different binding sites may suggest heterogeneity of LRP because of its immobilization. Alternatively, LRP may comprise distinct regions that are able to interact with C4BP α-chains. To identify LRP regions involved in binding C4BP α-chains, purified recombinant receptor fragments were used. These fragments, designated cluster II and IV, respectively, have been established to encompass the ligand binding domains of LRP (16Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When either cluster (200 nm) was incubated with immobilized recombinant rC4BPα (10 fmol/mm2), reversible binding of cluster II and IV to rC4BPα was observed (Fig.2A). The specificity of the interaction was subsequently assessed by investigating the binding of cluster II or IV to immobilized rC4BPα in the presence of various concentrations of the LRP-antagonist GST-RAP. Indeed, GST-RAP (0–750 nm) efficiently interfered with binding of either cluster (150 nm) to immobilized rC4BPα (Fig. 2B). Thus, both recombinant LRP fragments encompassing the ligand binding domains, i.e. clusters II and IV, comprise a binding site for rC4BPα, and binding is inhibited in the presence of GST-RAP. The observation that LRP recognizes C4BP in a system employing purified components prompted us to investigate the contribution of LRP to the delivery of rC4BPα to the intracellular degradation pathway. This was addressed in experiments using mouse fibroblast cells genetically deficient for LRP (i.e. PEA-13 cells), or their counterparts expressing LRP endogenously (i.e. MEF-1 cells) (36Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Employing LRP-expressing MEF-1 cells, an increase in the amount of degraded 125I-labeled rC4BPα was observed in time (Fig. 3). However, when degradation was examined in the presence of 1 μm GST-RAP, the amount of 125I-labeled rC4BPα degraded was markedly reduced (Fig. 3), indicating that the degradation process involves a GST-RAP-sensitive receptor. In the presence of LRP-deficient PEA-13 cells, the amount of rC4BPα degraded was similar to that of MEF-1 cells in the presence of the LRP antagonist GST-RAP (Fig. 3). Together, these data strongly suggest that the cellular uptake and transport of 125I-rC4BPα to the intracellular degradation pathway involves a LRP-dependent pathway. To investigate whether LRP also contributes to the clearance of C4BPin vivo, human pd-C4BP (10.9 mg/kg) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of C57BL/6J mice in the absence or presence of GST-RAP (30 mg/kg). At indicated time points, blood samples were collected, and plasma was subsequently analyzed for residual C4BP content. As shown in Fig. 4, human pd-C4BP was cleared in mice in a biphasic manner with an initial half-life of ∼50 min, whereas, in the presence of GST-RAP, pd-C4BP was cleared at a slower rate (approximate half-life of 60 min). At the 15- and 30-min time points, the content of C4BP was significantly higher (p = 0.0026 and p = 0.0098, respectively) in the presence of GST-RAP than in the absence of this LRP-antagonist. Apparently, inhibition of GST-RAP-sensitive receptors, like LRP, is associated with a delay in initial clearance of C4BP. It has been reported that binding of the C4BP α-chains to C4b is strongly ionic strength-dependent, whereas binding of streptococcal M proteins to these α-chains is of more hydrophobic nature (9Blom A.M. Berggard K. Webb J.H. Lindahl G. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5328-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of the α-chain/LRP interaction, association of rC4BPα (20 nm) to immobilized LRP (11 fmol/mm2) was examined in 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), supplemented with various concentrations of NaCl (25–150 mm). As shown in Fig.5, association of rC4BPα to LRP was sensitive to the concentration of NaCl. Optimal association was observed at 35 mm NaCl, whereas association was reduced over 6-fold at NaCl concentrations exceeding 100 mm. To further examine the effect of NaCl on the rC4BPα/LRP interaction, the apparent association and dissociation rate constants were determined employing 50 mm NaCl. As for the assessment of the rate constants in the presence of 125 mm NaCl, binding of rC4BPα to LRP involved two classes of binding sites (TableI). With regard to the calculated rate constants, no significant differences were found, except for the class 2 association rate constant. Class 2 kon(app) de"

The C-propeptide domain of procollagen participates in the association of the two proα1 and one proα2 chains to initiate triple helix formation from the COOH terminus of the protein (5Doege K.J.

A number of functions have been proposed for the α1(I) N-propeptide in the biogenesis of type I collagen, including prevention of premature intracellular molecular association and facilitation of transcellular transport and secretion, conversion of procollagen to collagen, regulation of extracellular fibrillogenesis, and feedback regulation of procollagen synthesis. However, none of these functions has been established unequivocally, and some have been questioned. Lee et al. (8Lee S.T. Lee S. Peters D.P. Hoffman G.G. Stacey A. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24126-24133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied the secretion of mutated type I procollagen, generated from human cDNA genes that were transfected into Chinese hamster lung, Mov-13, and COS-7 cells. Whereas wild-type (WT)1 procollagen was secreted efficiently, proteins lacking either the entire N-propeptide (139 amino acids) or the majority of it (114 amino acids) were secreted poorly from Chinese hamster lung cells. In contrast, the WT and mutant proteins were secreted equally well by Mov-13 and COS-7 cells. Because Chinese hamster lung cells are epithelial-like, whereas Mov-13 and COS-7 cells are fibroblast-like, the failure of the former to secrete a collagen lacking N-propeptides may be unrelated to the structure of the protein. In all cases, triple helical assembly of the transfected gene products occurred normally. Similar experiments indicated that murine proα1 chains (marked by a substitution of Ile for Met-822) with a deletion of exon 2 were secreted normally and without post-translational overmodification by 3T6 cells (9Fenton S.P. Protein Engineering to Study Collagen Structure and Junction. University of Melbourne, 1996Google Scholar). Exon 2 encodes 65 of the 129 amino acids in the murine α1 N-propeptide, which comprise the “globular” domain of the propeptide, and include all 10 of the conserved cysteines. A great deal of evidence points to a correlation between synthesis of the molecular chaperone, HSP47, and type I collagen (10Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Nagata K. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). HSP47 has been postulated to promote triple helix formation in the endoplasmic reticulum by binding and stabilizing partially folded triple helical intermediates of procollagen, thus inhibiting the intracellular aggregation and degradation of the precursor and facilitating its transcellular transport and secretion (12Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, interactions between HSP47 and peptide sequences in the N-propeptide have also been demonstrated (14Hu G. Gura T. Sabsay B. Sauk J. Dixit S.N. Veis A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The latter observations are supported by studies in which Mov-13 fibroblasts were stably transfected with a control or a mutant Col1a1 gene that lacked exon 2. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that binding of HSP47 to the mutant collagen was reduced compared with the control, thus implicating the N-propeptide indirectly in binding to HSP47 (9Fenton S.P. Protein Engineering to Study Collagen Structure and Junction. University of Melbourne, 1996Google Scholar). Because failure to remove the N-propeptide from procollagen results in formation of abnormal collagen fibrils, both in humans with type VII Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (15Smith L.T. Wertelecki W. Milstone L.M. Petty E.M. Seashore M.R. Braverman I.M. Jenkins T.G. Byers P.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 51: 235-244PubMed Google Scholar) and in animals with dermatosparaxis (16Lenaers A. Ansay M. Nusgens B. Lapière C.M. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 533-543Google Scholar), consideration has been given to the role of the N-propeptide in regulating both NH2-terminal proteolysis and fibrillogenesis. There is good evidence that the triple helical conformation of collagen is required for efficient proteolysis by procollagen N-proteinase (PNP; 2), but the role of the N-propeptide in the proteolytic event is uncertain. An indication that the N-propeptide is not essential for proteolysis is provided by the demonstration that a recombinant homotrimeric protein, composed of three proα2(I) chains with shortened triple helices, was at least partially cleaved by exogenous PNP (17John D.C.A. Watson R. Kind A.J. Scott A.R. Kadler K.E. Bulleid N.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Proα2(I) chains naturally lack the sequence encoded by exon 2 in proα1(I). However, these results leave open the possibility that the presence or conformation of the N-propeptide could modulate this proteolytic event. A feedback regulatory role for the N-propeptide, after its release from procollagen by PNP, was originally suggested by the observation that bovine dermatosparactic fibroblasts, which have a defect in PNP activity, synthesize higher amounts of collagen than control cells (18Wiestner M. Krieg T. Hörlein D. Glanville R.W. Fietzek P. Muller P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7016-7023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a feedback inhibitory effect, a bacterial collagenase-resistant fragment of the N-propeptide reduced collagen synthesis when it was added to bovine or human fibroblasts (18Wiestner M. Krieg T. Hörlein D. Glanville R.W. Fietzek P. Muller P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7016-7023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that this collagenase-resistant peptide specifically inhibited the translation of types I and III mRNA in a cell-free translation system (19Paglia L. Wilczek J. Diaz de Leon L. Martin G.R. Hörlein D. Muller P. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Hörlein D. McPherson J. Goh S.H. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6163-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that the transfection of bovine nuchal ligament cells with a plasmid encoding the N-propeptide selectively reduced endogenous collagen synthesis by these cells (21Fouser L. Sage E.H. Clark J. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10158-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for these effects are still not understood. The C-propeptides have also been implicated in feedback regulation of procollagen synthesis (22Wu C.H. Walton C.M. Wu G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2983-2987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Katayama K. Seyer J.M. Raghow R. Kang A.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7097-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but no recent confirmation of this activity has been reported. In view of the uncertain role of the N-propeptide in the biogenesis and regulation of type I collagen synthesis, we performed a targeted deletion of exon 2 in the Col1a1 collagen gene and generated mice that lacked the NH2-terminal, globular half of the N-propeptide encoded by this exon (Fig.1). We were encouraged in this endeavor by the realization that in the absence of exon 2, fusion of exons 1 and 3 would preserve the reading frame of the protein. Furthermore, the finding that the protein encoded by a proα1(I) cDNA gene that lacked exon 2 was secreted, at least by fibroblast-like cells, gave us some assurance that the phenotype of the mutant mouse would not be embryonic lethal on the basis of an inability to secrete type I procollagen. Mouse lines were established on both a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background and on a pure 129 OlaHsd/Sv background. As described in this report, adult mixed background mice that lack the amino acid sequence encoded by exon 2 of the proα1(I) chain are normal in appearance and are fertile. To the extent that these mice have been studied, it would therefore appear that none of the functions ascribed to the N-propeptide has been compromised sufficiently by its absence to prevent adequate synthesis of type I collagen or to hinder its function as a fiber-forming protein. However, homozygous mutant 129 background mice were generated at only 64% of the frequency predicted by Mendelian ratios. The N-propeptide may therefore perform some essential function in embryonic development which is subject to the influence of genetic modifier genes. Murine 129 genomic clones, containing fragments of the Col1a1 gene, were kindly provided by Dr. H. Wu and were assembled to form a 14.2-kbEcoRI fragment. This sequence, and the 13.2-kbEcoRI-SphI exon 2Δ targeting construct derived from it, are shown in Fig. 2. Exon 2 was deleted by restriction of an appropriate clone of Col1a1 at flanking BamHI and KpnI sites and subsequent ligation of the blunt ended chains, a procedure that recreated aBamHI site in place of the KpnI site. A PGK-Neo expression cassette, flanked by loxP sites, was then inserted in the BamHI site to generate a targeting construct with ∼ 6.2 kb of 5′- and ∼ 6.8 kb of 3′-sequence identity with the endogenous allele. The exon 2Δ targeting construct also contains a silent mutation within exon 7 which created a newXhoI restriction endonuclease cleavage site but did not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. The generation and utility of the XhoI mutation have been described previously (24Hormuzdi S.G. Penttinen R. Jaenisch R. Bornstein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hormuzdi S.G. Strandjord T.P. Madtes D.K. Bornstein P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). E14TG2a HPRT-embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129 OlaHsd mice (a gift from Dr. T. Doetschman) were cultured on neomycin-resistant STO cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, 4.5 g/liter). The medium was supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (ES-qualified, Invitrogen), 0.1 mm (β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, nonessential amino acids (0.1 mmeach, Invitrogen), and 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Invitrogen). Generation of cells containing the exon 2Δ allele was performed essentially as described previously (26Kyriakides T.R. Zhu Y.-H. Smith L.T. Bain S.D. Yang Z. Li M.T. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. LaMarca M. McKinney C.E. Ginns E.I. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were electroporated with 30 μg of linearized targeting exon 2Δ DNA and 24 h later were subjected to selection in media containing 400 μg/ml G418. Surviving colonies were picked 8–10 days later and were screened by Southern blotting for correct targeting of the mutation to the locus (Fig.3). The strategy for screening can be discerned from Fig. 2, which also shows the relevant restriction sites, sizes of the diagnostic DNA fragments, and the fragments used in the preparation of Probes 1 and 2. Because we had previously reported a strong correlation between karyotypic abnormality and poor germ line transmission (27Liu X. Wu H. Loring J. Hormuzdi S. Disteche C.M. Bornstein P. Jaenisch R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we determined the karyotypes of correctly targeted clones and selected those with a normal complement of chromosomes for blastocyst injections. Chimeric mice, generated after blastocyst injections of ES cell clones, were bred to produce heterozygous exon 2ΔNeo mice. These mice were then bred with 129 SvCPS1 mice expressing the Crerecombinase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (kindly provided by Michael Bender, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) to produce homozygous and heterozygous exon 2Δ mice. Mice were genotyped by both PCR and Southern blot analysis. Primers P1 (5′-GACCTGCATTTAAGGATTTGAGGG-3′) and P1′ (5′-TCTGAGTTTGGTGATACTGGGGAG-3′) (Fig.4A) amplify a 550-bp fragment of genomic DNA from the WT and a 257-bp fragment from the exon 2Δ allele. Southern analysis was performed onBamHI-XhoI digests of DNA with Probe 1. COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids (0.1 mmeach). 1.5 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA using an Invitrogen Cell-Porator (800 microfarads, 150 V). Stable transfectants were selected in media containing G418 (800 μg/ml), which was added 24 h after electroporation. For the transfection studies shown in Fig. 5,XbaI-EagI fragments of the WT and exon 2Δ alleles were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The XbaI site is located 5′ to the translation initiation codon, and the EagI site is located in exon 10. The exon 2Δ construct also contained the XhoI mutation in exon 7 (Fig. 5A). The Stratascript RT-PCR kit was utilized to identify mRNA derived from expression of the pcDNA3 constructs. Conditions recommended by the manufacturer were followed. 300 ng of primer P3′ (5′-GCTAGTCGACATCGATCAGGAAGCAAAGTTTCCTCCAAG-3′) was used for synthesis of the first strand cDNA (Fig. 5A). 10 pmol each of primers P3 (5′-CCACTGCCCTCCTGACGCATG-3′) and P3′ were then used for amplification of the cDNA. The underlined portion of P3′ is a polylinker sequence used in other cloning experiments; the remainder of the primer is derived from the Col1a1 cDNA sequence and is complementary to the sequence that overlaps the exon 5-6 boundary. RNA was prepared from lungs of WT and exon 2Δ mice using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. RT-PCR was performed using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). Five μg of RNA and 150 ng of random hexamers were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min followed by incubation on ice for 2 min. First strand buffer, dNTPs (0.5 mm each), and 250 units of reverse transcriptase were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzyme was inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. PCR was then performed with Hotstar Taq(Qiagen), using the forward primer 5′-CCACGCATGAGCCGAAGCTAACCCC-3′, located in exon 1, and the reverse primer 5′-CCGGGCTTGCCAGCTTCCCCATCATC-3′, located in exon 9. 35 cycles of amplification were performed at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Skin, lung, heart, kidney, muscle, and tail were harvested from male mice at 8 weeks of age. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy. Electron microscopy was performed as described previously (26Kyriakides T.R. Zhu Y.-H. Smith L.T. Bain S.D. Yang Z. Li M.T. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. LaMarca M. McKinney C.E. Ginns E.I. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Briefly, the shaved dermis was fixed in half-strength Karnovsky's fixative in cacodylate buffer and postfixed in osmium tetroxide. After dehydration, the sample was stained en bloc with uranyl acetate and infiltrated with epoxy. Sections (90–110 nm) were stained with lead citrate and saturated uranyl acetate and examined with a JEOL 1200 EXII transmission electron microscope. Total body skin was harvested from mice with an average weight of 12 g. Mice were divided into four experimental groups (male/WT, female/WT, male/exon 2Δ, and female/exon 2Δ), with 5–11 animals per group. Skin was completely shaved, removed from the animal, and weighed. A fraction was set aside for determination of total hydroxyproline. The remainder was minced finely and incubated in 30 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C with stirring. Tissue was harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and suspended in 30 volumes of 0.5 m acetic acid. Extraction was performed overnight at 4 °C with stirring. An aliquot of acetic acid-extracted collagen was then subjected to acid hydrolysis by incubation at 110 °C for 16 h in 6 n HCl. The hydrolysate was neutralized with NaOH, and hydroxyproline was quantified by the addition of chloramine T to a final concentration of 0.017 m and incubation at 25 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of perchloric acid to 0.8 m, color developed with 4% p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, and absorbance measured in a spectrophotometer at 557 nm. The amount of collagen in experimental samples was calculated by comparison with a hydroxyproline standard curve. Skin fibroblasts were isolated from age- and sex-matched WT and exon 2Δ mice as described previously (28Yang Z. Kyriakides T.R. Bornstein P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 80 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile, 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid, and 30 μCi/ml [3H]proline. In some experiments the medium was also supplemented with 0.5% serum. The conditioned medium was harvested, 1.2 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide was added, and the medium was then divided into two equal parts. One aliquot was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 9.6 units of highly purified collagenase (Worthington, CLSPA). The remaining aliquot was incubated in the absence of collagenase. Proteins were harvested by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, washed in 2% trichloroacetic acid followed by 95% ethanol, and dissolved in SDS loading buffer containing dithiothreitol. Incorporation of [3H]proline into proteins secreted into the conditioned medium was measured by scintillation counting, and the proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Three-month-old sex-matched mice were subjected to excisional wounds as described previously (29Kyriakides T.R. Tam J.W.Y. Bornstein P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 782-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, wounds were made with 6-mm punches on four WT and four exon 2Δ mice under Avertin anesthesia. Two mice of each genotype were killed at 7 and 14 days, and the wounds were harvested with a rim of ∼2 mm of unwounded tissue. Wound tissues were placed in porous holders to prevent curling, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Five-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with Sirius Red. The strategy for the generation of a Col1a1 allele that lacks exon 2 is described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Fig. 2. Because our experience with the targeting of other genes indicated that the introduction of a phosphoglycerate-thymidine kinase cassette into the targeting vector and negative selection with gangcyclovir gave us at best a 2–3-fold enrichment in correctly targeted ES cell clones, we dispensed with this additional step. G418-resistant, homologously recombined clones containing the exon 2ΔNeo allele were identified by Southern blot analysis of BamHI-XhoI-digested DNA. As illustrated in Fig. 3, mutant clones produced a band of 6.3 kb and WT clones a band of 7.8 kb when hybridized with Probe 1. Hybridization of EcoRI-XhoI digests of DNA from correctly targeted ES cell clones with Probe 2 provided assurance that the structure of the disrupted Col1a1 gene was as expected; targeted clones produced a band of 8.8 kb and WT clones a band of 13.4 kb (data not shown). Chromosome spreads were performed on several correctly targeted clones to confirm a normal karyotype, and two independently derived ES cell clones with a favorable morphology in culture (clones 145 and 252) were injected into blastocysts. These blastocysts were then transplanted into the uterine horns of pseudopregnant mice. Several high percentage chimeras were obtained from each clone, and these were bred with both C57BL/6 and 129 SvJ mice. Coat color and genetic screening were used to determine germline transmission of the mutation. However, repeated mating of these heterozygous animals failed to produce homozygous exon 2ΔNeo mice. This failure most likely reflected silencing of theCol1a1 promoter by the PGK-Neo transcription unit (30Pham C.T. MacIvor D.M. Hug B.A. Heusel J.W. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13090-13095Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), which would result in embryonic lethality of homozygous mutant mice. Accordingly, heterozygous mutant mice were bred with cytomegalovirus-Cre-expressing mice and offspring tested for the presence or absence of Cre and Neo by PCR. In almost all cases Cre-positive mice were Neo-negative, reflecting removal of the floxed PGK-Neo cassette by Cre recombinase (data not shown). Subsequent mating of these mice produced homozygous exon 2Δ mice, as judged by both PCR (Fig. 4B) and Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Breeding of mixed background (129 OlaHsdSv × C57BL/6) heterozygous mice produced WT, heterozygous, and homozygous exon 2Δ animals in the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1. However, breeding of pure 129 OlaHsd/Sv background heterozygous mice consistently produced fewer than predicted homozygous mutant animals. This finding was equally true for mutant mice generated from ES cell clones 145 and 252. Of 176 offspring that were genotyped at 4 weeks of age, we identified 56 WT, 92 heterozygous, and 28 homozygous exon 2Δ mice. Thus, homozygous mutant mice were generated at only 64% of the expected frequency. There was no indication that potentially exon 2Δ mice died after birth. To determine whether the absence of exon 2 in the Col1a1 gene affected the biosynthesis or function of type I collagen, it was first important to establish that the resulting chimeric intron 1-2 was efficiently spliced. Otherwise, retention of the intronic sequence could lead to nonsense-mediated degradation of heteronuclear RNA (31Sun X. Maquat L.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore transfected COS cells with a construct containing the normal sequence of exons in theCol1a1 gene or with a construct lacking exon 2. Amplification of a reverse transcribed WT transcript with primers P3 and P3′ (Fig. 5) should generate a 428-bp fragment, whereas amplification of a transcript with a deletion of the exon 2 sequence should generate a 233-bp fragment, provided that splicing of the chimeric intron 1-2 occurred normally. As shown in Fig. 5, a fragment of the size predicted by splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 (233 bp) was detected with RNA encoding the mutant collagen sequence, whereas RNA encoding the intact proα1(I) sequence produced the expected band of 428 bp. Genomic DNA sequence analysis of a PCR-amplified fragment, produced with a forward primer in intron 1 upstream from the BamHI site used to generate the deletion of exon 2 and a reverse primer in intron 5, confirmed the formation of a chimeric intron 1-2 (Fig.6A). Homologous recombination reconstitutes a BamHI site in place of the KpnI site in intron 2. The 34-bp loxP sequence, boxedin Fig. 6A, which is inserted between the intron 1 and 2 sequences, is flanked by a 29-bp 5′-sequence derived from bacteriophage and a 25-bp 3′-sequence of undetermined origin. Identical results were obtained from the sequences of DNA derived from exon 2Δ mice generated from either ES cell clone 145 or 252. The evidence obtained for correct splicing of the chimeric intron 1-2 (Fig. 5) was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified product of reverse transcribed RNA extracted from lungs of mutant and control mice. Thus, in contrast to the WT sequence, the exon 2Δ allele does in fact encode a protein chain in which the amino acid sequence in exon 1 is linked directly to that in exon 3 (Fig.6B). The bridging codon composed of 1 base from exon 1 and 2 bases from exon 3 happens to encode the same amino acid, isoleucine, as the codon formed from the normal fusion of exon 1 to exon 2. Mice lacking the 65 amino acids encoded by exon 2 appear normal on inspection and are fertile. The skin is not abnormally stretchable, and there is no indication of unusual fragility of tissues. Examination of the dermis by light microscopy revealed a normal appearance and organization of collagen fibers as determined by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Sirius Red (data not shown). There were no significant differences in the collagen content of skin or in the quantity of collagen that was extractable with 0.5 m acetic acid from the skin of young mutant and WT mice (TableI). These findings provide a strong indication that covalent cross-links are formed normally in the absence of the protein sequence encoded by exon 2. Finally, the time course of healing of 6-mm excisional skin wounds was normal in exon 2Δ mice, and histological examination of the wound beds at day 7 and day 14 revealed no abnormalities (data not shown). These experiments and those described below were performed with mixed background mice.Table IExtractability of collagen from mouse skinExtracted Hyp1-aHyp, hydroxyproline.Total HypExtracted Hyp/total Hypμg/mg skinμg/mg skinWT ♂1-bn = 6.1.77 ± 0.2713.0 ± 0.740.14 ± 0.02Exon 2Δ ♂1-cn = 11.2.08 ± 0.4914.6 ± 0.260.14 ± 0.04WT ♀1-dn = 5.1.76 ± 0.1511.2 ± 0.440.16 ± 0.02Exon 2Δ ♀1-en = 9.1.67 ± 0.5413.6 ± 1.40.12 ± 0.04Collagen was extracted with 0.5 m acetic acid at 4 °C (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”).

Thus we have previously shown that the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 7 (mGlu7 receptor) blocks P/Q-type Ca2+ channels via activation of a Go protein and PKC, in cerebellar granule cells. We show here that the transient depolarizations used to evoke the studied Ca2+ current were indeed permissive to activate this pathway by a mGlu7 receptor agonist. Indeed, sustained depolarization to 0 mV was sufficient to inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. This effect involved a conformational change in voltage-gated sodium channel independently of Na+ flux, activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein, inositol trisphosphate formation, intracellular Ca2+ release, and PKC activity. Subliminal sustained membrane depolarization became efficient in inducing inositol trisphosphate formation, release of intracellular Ca2+ and in blocking Ca2+ channels, when applied concomitantly with the mGlu7a receptor agonist,d,l-aminophosphonobutyrate. This synergistic effect of membrane depolarization and mGlu7 receptor activation provides a mechanism by which neuronal excitation could control action of the mGlu7 receptor in neurons.

Eight genes encoding mGlu receptors have been identified and classified into three groups. The group I (mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors) activates PLC through a Gq protein, whereas group II (mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors) and group III (mGlu4, mGlu6, mGlu7, and mGlu8 receptors) are coupled to Gi/Go proteins (1Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Google Scholar). These receptors are widely distributed throughout the mammalian brain (2Kinzie J.M. Saugstad J.A. Westbrook G.L. Segerson T.P. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 167-176Google Scholar, 3Ohishi H. Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 360: 555-570Google Scholar, 4Bradley S.R. Levey A.I.

Group II and III mGlu receptors, and particularly the mGlu7 receptor subtype, inhibit synaptic transmission (1Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Google Scholar, 9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Google Scholar). Thus in vitrostudies have shown that stimulation of mGlu7 receptors decreases release of glutamate in cerebellar cultures (10Lafon-Cazal M. Fagni L. Guiraud M.J. Mary S. Lerner-Natoli M. Pin J.P. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 663-672Google Scholar) and GABA in striatal cultures (11Lafon-Cazal M. Viennois G. Kuhn R. Malitschek B. Pin J.P. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1631-1640Google Scholar), promoting neuroprotection and excitotoxicity, respectively. Moreover, we have recently shown that mGlu7 receptors selectively block P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in neurons (12Perroy J. De Prézeau L. Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar), and these channels control transmitter release (13Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest that mGlu7 receptors play an important role in the modulation of synaptic transmission. Recent studies have pointed out that in the rat locus coeruleus, group III mGlu receptor agonists down-regulate high but not low frequency synaptic activity (14Dube G.R. Marshall K.C. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1141-1149Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor action depends on the state of neuronal depolarization. Moreover, a voltage-dependent activation of a Go protein has recently been shown in rat brain synaptoneurosomes (15Anis Y. Nurnberg B. Visochek L. Reiss N. Naor Z. Cohen-Armon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7431-7440Google Scholar). In light of these results, and because the mGlu7 receptor is coupled to a Go protein, this receptor is a potential candidate for mobilization of both voltage- and Goprotein-dependent events in neurons. We therefore investigated, in cultured cerebellar granule cells, the effect of membrane depolarization on this receptor signaling. We have previously shown that the mGlu7 receptor-induced blockade of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels is independent of a direct action of Go protein βγ subunits on the Ca2+channels, but results from IP31 formation and PKC activation (12Perroy J. De Prézeau L. Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar). Here we show a synergistic effect of the receptor activation and membrane depolarization. Primary cultures of mouse cerebellar granule cells were prepared as previously described (16Van Vliet B.J. Sebben M. Dumuis A. Gabrion J. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1229-1239Google Scholar). Since these cultured neurons do not express functional native group III mGlu receptors in the soma (12Perroy J. De Prézeau L. Waard M. Shigemoto R.

As only 10–20% neurons were transfected using this method, the mGlu7a receptor was co-transfected with the transfection marker, green fluorescent protein (GFP), for single cell electrophysiological recording and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measurement. Barium currents were recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, at room temperature, from mGu7a/GFP-expressing cerebellar granule cells, after 9 ± 1 days in vitro.

Drug solutions were prepared in this medium and pH of the solutions was readjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The NMDA receptor-channel blocker, MK-801 (1 μm), was added to all the solutions in order to avoid activation of this receptor by the d-isoform ofd,l-AP4. 2L. Fagni and M.

We also added TTX (0.3 μm), 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (100 μm), and 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt 250 μm), in order to block Na+ flux through VGSCs and release of glutamate, as well as activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and endogenous mGlu1 receptors. Indeed, cultured cerebellar granule neurons do not express functional native mGlu5 receptors (17Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.M. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Fagni L.

In some experiments, intracellular EGTA was replaced by BAPTA. Recordings started at least 5 min after breaking the membrane patch and stabilization of evoked Ba2+ current (IBa). Barium currents were evoked using voltage-clamp pulses of 500 ms duration, from a holding potential of −80 mV to a test potential of 0 mV, at a rate of 0.1 Hz, except when specified in the text. Membrane resistance was measured by applying hyperpolarizing pulses of 20 mV amplitude and 55 ms duration, from a holding potential of −80 mV. Current signals were recorded using an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 1 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter and sampled at 3 kHz on a Pentium II PC computer. Analyses were performed using the pClamp6 program of Axon Instruments. Barium currents were measured at their peak amplitude and expressed as mean ± S.E. of the indicated number (n) of experiments. The procedure to measure IP accumulation in neurons was adapted from a one previously described (20Blahos J. Mary S. Perroy J. de Colle C. Brabet I. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25765-25769Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-week-old cerebellar cultures were incubated for 14 h in culture medium containing 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (23.4 Ci/mol; Invitrogen, Paris, France). Cells were then washed 3 times and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of HEPES saline buffer (146 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 0.3 μm TTX, 10 μm MK801, 100 μm6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 250 μmCPCCOEt, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 unit/ml glutamate pyruvate transaminase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) and 2 mm pyruvate (Sigma, St. Quentin-Fallavier, France). In experiments where KCl was elevated to 30 or 100 mm, the same respective amounts of NaCl were removed from the saline buffer solution. This induced theoretical membrane steady-state depolarizations to −40 and −10 mV, respectively, at 20 °C, assuming an intracellular K+ concentration of 140 mm. Cells were then washed again with the same saline buffer, and LiCl was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The agonist was applied 15 min later and left for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by replacing the incubation medium with 0.5 ml of perchloric acid (5%) on ice. Supernatants were recovered and IP purified on Dowex columns. Total radioactivity remaining in the membrane fraction was counted after treatment with 10% Triton X-100, 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min and used as a standard. Results were expressed as the ratio of [3H]IP production over radioactivity present in the membranes. Experiments were performed in triplicates for statistical analyses. Similar results were obtained in mGlu7 receptor-transfected and nontransfected cultures. Note that only data obtained from transfected cultures are presented here. Given that only 10–20% neurons were transfected with our method, this indicated that majority ofd,l-AP4-induced IP accumulation measured in mGlu7 receptor-transfected cultures resulted from activation of the native mGlu7 receptors (12Perroy J. De Prézeau L. Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ level was measured in single cells, as previously described (21Boccara G. Choby C. Frapier J.M. Nargeaot J. Dayanithi G. Richard S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 606-613Google Scholar). Briefly, the dual excitation ratiometric Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fura-2, was used for [Ca2+]i imaging measurements by means of an Olympus-LSR system (MERLIN; Life Science Resources Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Cerebellar cultures were loaded by incubation with 2.5 μm Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester and 0.02% pluronic acid (F-127; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 35 min at 37 °C in a buffer medium containing (mm): NaCl (150), KCl (3Ohishi H.

This medium was used to thoroughly rinse the cells before mounting them on the stage of the inverted microscope of the Olympus-LSR system and to prepare drug solutions. In experiments where 30 mm KCl was added to the medium, NaCl concentration was lowered to 120 mm. The osmolarity of all the solutions was adjusted to 330 mOsm with NaCl. Epifluorescent illumination was via a SpectraMASTER monochromator (Life Science Resources Ltd.) coupled to the microscope fitted with a UV transparent oil objective (Uapo/340 40X/1.35). The image was detected with an Astrocam 12/14 bit frame transfer digital camera (Life Science Resources Ltd.). The Olympus-LSR system controlled the illuminator and camera, and performed image ratioing and analysis. The intensity of fluorescent light emission at λ = 510 nm, using excitation at 340 and 380 nm, was monitored for each single cell analyzed. The ratio of fluorescence emission when excited at 340 nm (the absorbance peak of Fura-2 bound to Ca2+) to 380 nm (the absorbance peak of free Fura-2) was used as an index of [Ca2+]i, with an increase in the fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) signifying an increase in [Ca2+]i. Although [Ca2+]i measurements were performed in cultured cerebellar granule cells expressing the GFP reporter gene, one can estimate that less than 1% of the signal at 340 nm excitation and less than 5% of the signal at 380 nm excitation were contributed by GFP. d,l-AP4, 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and MK-801 were purchased from Tocris Cockson (Bristol, UK), PTX, nimodipine, GF109203X, and veratridine from RBI (Sigma), ω−agatoxin-IVA from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel), heparin from Calbiochem (Meudon, France), TTX from Latoxan (Valence, France), Fura-2 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and the GFP (pEGFP-N1) expression plasmid fromCLONTECH (Ozyme, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). The R- and S-enantiomers of DPI 201–106 were generous gifts from G. Romey (CNRS UPR 411, Nice, France). Stimulation of mGlu7 receptors byd,l-AP4 (500 μm) had no effect on somatic whole cell IBa, in nontransfected cerebellar granule cells, which was consistent with the presynaptic location of the receptor in neurons (12Perroy J. De Prézeau L. Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar). Therefore experiments were performed in cultured cerebellar granule cells transfected with a mGlu7 receptor expression plasmid. The receptor was expressed in both cell body and neurites which allowed us to study its effect on somatic IBa. In mGlu7 receptor-transfected cerebellar granule cells application of the receptor agonist, d,l-AP4 (500 μm), at a steady state potential of −80 mV, did not affect IBa evoked at the end of the application (mean ± S.E. = 1 ± 1% inhibition; n = 6; Fig.1, period 1). In contrast, application of d,l-AP4, combined with transient and repetitive depolarizations (which evoked IBa), induced a progressive and potent inhibition (39 ± 2%; n = 6) of the current that last upon wash out of the agonist (Fig. 1,period 2) (12Perroy J. De Prézeau L. Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar). These results indicated that mGlu7 receptors inhibited Ca2+ channels under conditions where cerebellar granule cells were transiently and repetitively depolarized, but not in resting neurons. Because inhibition of Ca2+ channels by mGlu7 receptors was dependent on transient and repetitive depolarization, we examined the effect of membrane depolarization per se (in the absence of receptor agonist) on the channel activity. To mimic physiological activity, we stimulated neurons using 20-ms depolarization pulses, from −80 to 0 mV. When applied at a frequency of 0.1 Hz, these stimulations evoked IBa of stable amplitude over a period of at least 45 min (Fig.2A, open circles). Increasing the frequency of the depolarization pulses up to 25 Hz decreased IBa amplitude (Fig. 2A, points). This frequency-dependent decrease in amplitude of the current was reversible immediately after cessation of the tetanic stimulation if the train of depolarization pulses last for less than 30 s (Fig. 2A, 1). On the other hand, a 1-min train of transient depolarizations induced a long lasting inhibition of the current (Fig. 2A, 2). To quantify this blockade we replaced the high frequency train of stimulation by a single square pulse depolarization of equivalent duration. Thus maintaining the cell for 1 min at a steady state potential of −80 mV did not alter IBa evoked after this resting period (0 ± 1% inhibition,n = 6, Fig. 2B, 1). On the other hand, holding the cell for 1 min at 0 mV inhibited IBa evoked after cessation of this steady state depolarization period (40 ± 2% inhibition;n = 6; Fig. 2B, 2). This effect was voltage- (Fig. 2C) and time-dependent (Fig.2D). After the sustained depolarization period, neither membrane resistance (not shown), nor IBa inactivation kinetics (Fig.2E) were significantly altered, indicating that inhibition of IBa did not result from change in passive properties of the membrane or biophysical properties of the Ca2+ channels. We interpreted the reversible decrease in IBa amplitude observed after a short train of stimulations or sustained depolarization shorter than 10 s, as a classical Ca2+ channel inactivation. On the other hand, we tentatively interpreted the long lasting decrease induced by longer depolarization trains, or sustained steady state depolarization, as a pure Ca2+ channel inhibition. The following data supported this hypothesis. First, IBa evoked after a sustained depolarization to 0 mV (Fig. 2B, 2), although of smaller amplitude, still displayed similar inactivation kinetics (Fig. 2E). Second, IBa inhibition was mediated through intracellular messengers. Thus, inhibition of IBa induced by sustained depolarization was abolished by PTX, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, intracellular dialysis of the IP3 receptor antagonist heparin, or intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (Fig. 3A). Moreover, KCl-induced depolarization increased basal IP accumulation, in a PTX-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Taken together these results suggested that inhibition of Ca2+ channels induced by sustained depolarization was distinct from their classical voltage-dependent inactivation, since it involved a Gi/Go protein, intracellular Ca2+, and PKC. We then searched for the voltage sensor of this inhibitory pathway. Since voltage-induced inhibition of IBa was blocked by PTX (Fig.3A), the voltage-sensitive step of this phenomenon should be either upstream Gi/Go protein activation, or the Gi/Go protein itself. Previous studies have shown the existence of a Go protein activation through a conformational change of VGSCs, regardless of the Na+current (15Anis Y. Nurnberg B. Visochek L. Reiss N. Naor Z. Cohen-Armon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7431-7440Google Scholar). Since cerebellar granule cells express functional somatic VGSCs (−145 pA/pF Na+ current) (17Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.M. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 793-803Google Scholar), we examined whether these channels were involved in the depolarization-induced inhibition of Ca2+ channels. Since experiments were performed in the presence of TTX, the effects observed here were obviously independent of Na+ flux through VGSCs. TheR-4-[3-(4-diphenylmethyl1-piperazinyl)-2-hydroxypropoxyl]-1H-indole-2-carbonitrile (R-DPI 201–106; 50 μm, 10 min), a drug that blocks VGSC conformational changes (22Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Google Scholar), also blocked the voltage-induced inhibition of IBa (2 ± 5% inhibition, n = 8, Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this drug has been shown to block depolarization induced activation of Go protein in synaptoneurosomes (15Anis Y. Nurnberg B. Visochek L. Reiss N. Naor Z. Cohen-Armon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7431-7440Google Scholar). The potent and selective VGSC activator, veratridine, shifted the voltage-induced inhibition of IBa toward more negative potentials (Fig. 6B,filled triangles). The S-DPI 201–106 (50 μm, 10 min treatment), which mimics the action of veratridine on VGSC (22Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Google Scholar), also mimicked the effect of veratridine on IBa inhibition (data not shown). In the absence of sustained depolarization, neither veratridine nor S- or R-DPI 201–106 significantly altered IBa (1 ± 2, 2 ± 4, and 2 ± 1% inhibition, respectively; n = 10 for both conditions). These results suggested that VGSCs were the voltage sensors that triggered the depolarization-induced inhibition of Ca2+ channels.Figure 6Synergistic action of membrane depolarization or veratridine and d,l-AP4.A, IBa amplitude was expressed as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

After application of ω-agatoxin-IVA (250 nm), the toxin-resistant IBa was not significantly affected by subsequent sustained depolarization (38 ± 2% inhibition with ω-agatoxin-IVA; 2 ± 0.4% inhibition with depolarization, n = 7, Fig. 4B) and vice versa (40 ± 1.8% inhibition with depolarization; 2. 5 ± 1.2% inhibition with subsequent ω-agatoxin-IVA application,n = 8, Fig. 4C). The Ca2+channels inhibited by sustained depolarization were therefore of the P/Q-type. Since the mGlu7 receptor and membrane depolarization shared common mechanisms, inhibition of IBa by these factors should be mutually occluded. This hypothesis was confirmed by the following experiments. We have seen here above (Fig. 1) that in mGlu7 receptor-transfected cerebellar granule cells, application of the receptor agonist,d,l-AP4 (500 μm), during repetitive and transient depolarizations, progressively inhibited IBa (39 ± 2% inhibition; n = 6). Interestingly, the amount of IBa remaining after this action ofd,l-AP4 was not significantly affected by subsequent sustained depolarization (36 ± 3% inhibition withd,l-AP4; 3 ± 2% inhibition with depolarization; n = 5; Fig.5A). Conversely, after sustained depolarization, d,l-AP4 application (associated with repetitive transient depolarizations) did not further inhibit the remaining IBa (39 ± 3% inhibition with depolarization; 1 ± 1% inhibition withd,l-AP4; n = 6; Fig.5B). These results indicated a mutual occlusion of the effects of sustained depolarization and mGlu7 receptor activation. We then assessed whether or not voltage and mGlu7 receptor could act synergistically to inhibit Ca2+ channels. Transient and successive depolarization pulses applied at 0.1 Hz frequency (Fig. 1), or a 1-min steady-state depolarization to −40 mV (Fig.6, A, 1, andB, filled circles), did not per seaffect IBa. Similarly to these subliminal stimulations,d,l-AP4 applied at a steady state potential of −80 mV did not alter IBa (Figs. 1 and 6, B, open circles). However, a 1-min steady-state depolarization to −40 mV, combined with a d,l-AP4 application inhibited IBa by 20% (Fig. 6, A, 2, andB, open circles). These results indicated a synergistic inhibitory effect of mGlu7 receptors and membrane depolarization on IBa. We verified that this synergistic effect involved VGSCs. Application of the VGSC blocker, R-DPI 201–106, antagonized the action of d,l-AP4 applied concomitantly with transient depolarization pulses (7 ± 3% inhibition; n = 5). Moreover, co-application, but not separate applications, of veratridine andd,l-AP4, at a membrane potential of −60 mV, significantly inhibited IBa (Fig. 6B, filled andopen triangles). These results indicated that the mGlu7 receptor action depended on activation of VGSCs. This synergistic effect of mGlu7 receptor and membrane depolarization was also observed on the receptor intracellular signaling cascade. Thus, basal IP level was not affected by 30 mm KCl (equivalent to −40 mV depolarization), nor byd,l-AP4 alone, but increased when KCl andd,l-AP4 were co-applied (Fig. 6C). The synergistic action of KCl and d,l-AP4 was also evident on evoked intracellular Ca2+ release. Thusd,l-AP4 or 30 mm KCl alone did not induce any significant Ca2+ response, but together evoked marked and reversible intracellular Ca2+ release (Fig.6D). These results indicated that coincident subliminal membrane depolarization and mGlu7 receptor activation were required for the synthesis of IP3 and intracellular Ca2+release. It is worth noting that a high concentration (100 mm) of KCl (equivalent to a steady-state depolarization to −10 mV) induced a similar IP response as a co-application of 100 mm KCl andd,l-AP4 (Fig. 6C). This result was consistent with the nonadditive inhibitory effects of a sustained depolarization to 0 mV and d,l-AP4 application on IBa (Figs. 5 and 6, B, open and filled circles). The present study shows that a long duration train of high frequency depolarization pulses, or a prolonged single steady state depolarization, can inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ channels through a VGSC-Go protein-PLC-dependent pathway. These results provides the first electrophysiological evidence for a voltage-dependent activation of a G-protein via VGSCs, independently of Na+ flux. We also show that subliminal depolarizations were permissive for activation of this signaling cascade by the mGlu7 receptor (Fig.7). Inhibition of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel induced by sustained membrane depolarization was different from the classical voltage-mediated inactivation of these channels, since P/Q-type Ca2+ channel inactivation has been previously described to be reversible, virtually abolished when Ba2+ was used as charge carrier, and should not depend on G protein or PKC activation (23Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Google Scholar, 24Lee A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6830-6838Google Scholar). Our results were consistent with previous biochemical studies showing a voltage-dependent interaction of VGSC with Goprotein in rat brain synaptoneurosomes (15Anis Y. Nurnberg B. Visochek L. Reiss N. Naor Z. Cohen-Armon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7431-7440Google Scholar). Indeed, R-DPI 201–106, a drug that blocks depolarization-induced activation of Goprotein in this preparation (15Anis Y. Nurnberg B. Visochek L. Reiss N. Naor Z. Cohen-Armon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7431-7440Google Scholar), also blocked the depolarization-induced inhibition of Ca2+ channels in cerebellar granule cells. Although it is difficult to determine from the present study whether or not Go protein activation occurred during activation or inactivation of VGSCs, studies in synaptoneurosomes suggested that this may happen as long as depolarization lasts (15Anis Y. Nurnberg B. Visochek L. Reiss N. Naor Z. Cohen-Armon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7431-7440Google Scholar). We show here that voltage-dependent activation of Go protein through VGSCs resulted in IP3 formation and intracellular Ca2+ release. Evidence for depolarization-induced IP3 formation has been previously reported in skeletal muscle (25Vergara J. Tsien R.Y. Delay M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6352-6356Google Scholar), and hyperpolarization has been suggested to reduce agonist-induced generation of IP3 in rabbit mesenteric artery (26Itoh T. Seki N. Suzuki S. Ito S. Kajikuri J. Kuriyama H. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 307-328Google Scholar). Thus, the voltage-dependent activation of Go protein and IP3 synthesis observed here may not be specific for cerebellar granule cells. We found a synergistic action of VGSCs and mGlu7 receptors on IP3 formation and intracellular Ca2+ release. Voltage-dependent IP3-mediated Ca2+release has also been reported in coronary artery during stimulation of metabotropic cholinergic receptors (27Ganitkevich V. Isenberg G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 470: 35-44Google Scholar). Moreover, during stimulation of metabotropic purinergic receptors, membrane depolarization can stimulate the release of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores, in rat megakaryocytes. Consistent with our findings, the voltage sensor of this effect has been proposed to be upstream the purinergic receptors (28Mahaut-Smith M.P. Hussain J.F. Mason M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 385-390Google Scholar). Two alternative hypotheses can be proposed to explain the synergistic action of voltage and mGlu7 receptor in neurons. The mGlu7 receptors and VGSCs may share the same Go protein, or independently activate distinct Go proteins. Whatever the type of coupling to Go protein, a synergistic action of the receptor and VGSC was required to inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+channels. This provided a mechanism by which neuronal activity could promote glutamate-mediated metabotropic effects. It is likely that this mechanism occur at the axon terminal, since mGluR7 (6Kinzie J.M.

Thus high but not low frequency axonal discharges promotes coincident activation of presynaptic mGlu7 receptors by the neurotransmitter glutamate and action potential-induced activation of VGSCs, in the axon terminal. This coincident events would allow their synergistic inhibitory action on presynaptic P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and synaptic transmission. This hypothesis is consistent with the inhibitory effect of group III mGlu receptors on high but not low frequency synaptic transmission, observed in the rat locus coeuleus (14Dube G.R. Marshall K.C.

FGF-BP overexpression as well as ribozyme-mediated reduction of endogenous FGF-BP revealed that FGF-BP can be rate-limiting for tumor growth and angiogenesis. Recent studies showed that FGF-BP expression is up-regulated during early phases of tumorigenesis, indicating that the role of FGF-BP in angiogenesis is a critical early step in the development and progression of tumors. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is highly associated with the development of anogenital cancers. Here we demonstrate that the stable expression of the E6 oncogene of HPV 16 leads to an activation of the FGF-BP promoter in primary human foreskin keratinocytes (one of the natural host cells of these viruses). This is associated with an increase in the steady state levels of FGF-BP mRNA and FGF-BP protein in cells stably expressing E6. Transient E6 expression revealed that the observed activation of the FGF-BP promoter by the viral oncogene is an early process which is independent from immortalization/transformation events in the cells."

The existence of a second A·T-rich element (25 As out of 33 nucleotides) present six base pairs upstream of the Reb1p-binding site, suggested that nucleosome exclusion from the hypersensitive site in the ILV1 promoter region might be dictated by synergistic action of the two poly(dA·dT) elements. Replacing one or both of them had, however, no effect on the chromatin structure of the ILV1 promoter, although drastically reduced basal transcription. Similarly, deletion of the Reb1p-binding site, albeit affecting ILV1 expression, had no detectable effect on chromatin at the ILV1 promoter. The absence of a good correlation between effects of these elements on gene activity and on chromatin structure at the ILV1 promoter indicates that the chromatin organization present at the ILV1 promoter is independent of the known regulatory elements and most likely dictated directly by the DNA sequence.

ILV1basal level expression (defined as the level of expression observed in a Δgcn4 strain grown in minimal medium) is controlled by two cis-acting elements: a binding site for the REB1 protein (Reb1p) and a poly(dA·dT) element (1Remacle J.E.

Reb1p (Grf2, Qbp, factor Y or Q) is an essential, abundant DNA-binding protein with numerous binding sites present throughout the genome, many of which are located within regulatory regions for RNA polymerase II transcribed genes. Other Reb1p-binding sites are found in RNA polymerase I regulatory regions and in diverse genetic elements, such as centromeres and telomeres (3Chasman D.I. Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. LaPointe J.W.

Reb1p-binding sites are also found in the recently identified STAR1 (subtelomeric anti-silencing regions) elements (8Fourel G. Revardel E. Koering C.E. Gilson E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2522-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These regions function as insulators and can protect neighboring genes from surrounding silencing elements. Interestingly, tandemly repeated binding sites for Reb1p can duplicate this anti-silencing effect and limit telomeric silenced chromatin. Furthermore, Reb1p-binding sites can stimulate or diminish transcription in a context-dependent manner (9Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4256-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Wang H. Nicholson P.R. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell.

The presence of a Reb1p-binding site in the GAL1-GAL10 promoter correlated with a nucleosome-free region of about 230 bp in vivo (12Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggesting that Reb1p functions to generate a nucleosome-free region allowing auxiliary factors access to adjacentcis-acting elements. Other reports, however, contest this result (13Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Reagan M.S. Majors J.E. Mol. Gen.

Homopolymeric poly(dA·dT) sequences are present in the promoter region of many yeast genes and have been shown to influence transcription of several genes (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Chen W. Tabor S. Struhl K.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Due to their nucleosome destabilizing properties poly(dA·dT) elements have been proposed to function by virtue of their intrinsic effect on chromatin (15Chen W. Tabor S. Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the yeast poly(dA·dT)-binding protein Dat1p (19Winter E. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) functions as a transcriptional activator of ILV1 expression and this action depends on the presence of the poly(dA·dT) element (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which the Reb1p-binding site and the downstream poly(dA·dT) element control ILV1basal expression, we investigated the chromatin structure of theILV1 locus. We show that the ILV1 promoter and coding regions are assembled into a highly ordered nucleosome array, with a single hypersensitive region encompassing all regulatorycis-acting elements. We also show that deletion of the Reb1p site and/or the adjacent downstream poly(dA·dT) element greatly diminishes ILV1 expression, yet does not cause reconfiguration of the ILV1 chromatin structure. Furthermore, a second A·T-rich element present upstream of the Reb1p-binding site can be deleted, again with no effect onILV1 chromatin structure. This suggests that neither Reb1p nor the adjacent poly(dA·dT) elements stimulate ILV1transcription by increasing the accessibility of DNA in chromatin at the promoter, but by another yet unknown mechanism. Sequence insertions and deletions at the hypersensitive region of the ILV1promoter, albeit affecting expression of the ILV1 gene, do not affect the positioning of the adjacent nucleosomes pointing to a dominant effect of the DNA sequence in organizing the nucleosomal array present at the ILV1 promoter. Escherichia colistrain DH5α was used for plasmid propagation and manipulation. The following S. cerevisiae strains have been used in this study: TD28 (MATaura3–52 ino1 can1), 9994–6C (MATα Δgcn4 ura3–52), EWY1002c-1 (MATalys2–801 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1–1(am)), BRY1004–3 (MATa lys2–801 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1–1(am) dat1-Δ2), TG561 (MATailv1::lacZ ino1 can1), TG570 (EWY1002c-1 ilv1::lacZ). Strains were grown in minimal medium (0.67% Bacto Yeast Nitrogen Base without Amino Acids, 2% glucose, buffered with 10 g of succinic acid and 6 g of NaOH per liter) supplemented with the required amino acids at appropriate concentrations. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Zymolyase 100T was from Seikagaku America, Inc. Taq polymerase was from Amersham Biosciences. Radiolabeled nucleotides were from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Agarose was from FMC Bioproducts (Rockland, ME). All nucleic acid manipulation was performed according to established protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used under standard conditions (0.2 mm of each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, dGTP; 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.4); 50 mm KCl; 5 mmMgCl2; 0.5 μm of each primer; 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase per reaction). DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy primer extension method (Sequenase Sequencing Kit v2.0, United States Biochemical Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio). Yeast cells were transformed following the method of Ito et al. (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis was performed as described (22Moreira J.M.A. Holmberg S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2836-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nuclei isolation and nuclease digestions were performed as previously described (23Svaren J. Venter U. Hörz W. Microbial Gene Techniques. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). After secondary digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme, DNA samples were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred onto PositiveTM nylon membranes (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) and hybridized following standard protocols. A plasmid containing a 6.1-kbHindIII-SalI ILV1 fragment (pC519) was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and electrophoretically purified DNA fragments labeled with the Prime-It® II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as probes in all experiments. The specific fragments used as probes are described in further detail in figure legends. For the spacing experiments, we used plasmid constructs containing insertions of E. coliplasmid DNA into the XhoI site of the 15X ILV1internal deletion fused to the lacZ gene (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The constructs were integrated at the ILV1 locus in strain 9994–6C (Δgcn4). All integration events were confirmed by Southern analysis and PCR. Deletion of the ILV1 A·T-rich tracts was made by PCR using a previously described procedure (24Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides covering the sequences we wished to modify were synthesized (T·A·G Copenhagen ApS, Denmark) allowing the target sequences to be substituted by random sequences with no known cis-acting elements. Oligonucleotide SUBUP (5′-AATTGACGCGAACTAGATCGCTTAAGCTCGGCATCAAGCTCGAGCGCAGCGGGTAGCAAATTTGGAATCG-3′) was used to replace the 5′-most ILV1 A·T-rich tract (positions −235 to −166) while simultaneously creating a uniqueXhoI site. Similarly, oligonucleotide SUBDOWN (5′-ATCTGCAGACATATGTTTGAGATGACTCTAGATCTCCGATGTTCAAGCTTCATGATTATGCGATTCCAAATTTGC-3′) was used to replace the 3′-most ILV1 A·T-rich tract (positions −106 to −180) and simultaneously introduce aHindIII site. PCR fragments were obtained covering theILV1 promoter and entire coding region (from position −840 to position +2530) that contained a substitution of the 5′-most, the 3′ most, or both A·T-rich tracts in the promoter region. The amplificates were cloned into plasmid pGEM-TTM (Promega) and the substitutions confirmed by sequencing and subsequently integrated at the ILV1 locus in strain TG561 generatingILV1(ΔA1), ILV1(ΔA2), andILV1(ΔA1ΔA2), respectively. We have shown that two cis-acting sequences, a Reb1p-binding site and a downstream poly(dA·dT) element control ILV1basal-level (GCN4-independent) expression (1Remacle J.E. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The two elements act synergistically, an indication that they might exert their effect trough a common activation pathway (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sequence inspection revealed an additional A·T-rich tract (25 As out of 33 nucleotides) located six bp upstream of the Reb1p-binding site. To determine whether the upstream A·T-rich tract also plays a role in ILV1basal expression we replaced either one or bothILV1 A·T-rich tracts by 40% GC content random sequences resulting in strains ILV1(ΔA1),ILV1(ΔA2), and ILV1(ΔA1ΔA2), respectively. Northern analysis showed that both A·T-rich tracts potentiateILV1 basal expression (Fig.1). We analyzed the nucleosomal organization of theILV1 promoter using digestion of yeast nuclei with DNase I, micrococcal nuclease (MNase), or restriction enzymes to map nuclease cuts by indirect end-labeling (25Wu C. Wong Y.C. Elgin S.C. Cell. 1979; 16: 807-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclei from strain TD28 (GCN4) were treated with DNase I (see “Materials and Methods”), and the isolated DNA was resolved in an agarose gel after digestion with EcoRI, blotted, and hybridized with a radioactively labeled EcoRI-DraI probe. The obtained DNase I pattern (Fig.2) shows a characteristic ladder of bands typical of an ordered nucleosomal array, and a strong band corresponding to a hypersensitive site (HS). Mapping of this HS revealed that all previously identified cis-acting elements, namely a Reb1p-binding site, a Gcn4p-binding site, and the two poly(dA·dT) elements were located within the hypersensitive region. To complement the DNase I analysis and confirm our interpretation of the observed banding pattern, we digested nuclei from TD28 cells with various restriction enzymes (Fig. 3,A and B). Hypersensitive sites and linker regions are expected to be susceptible to digestion with endonucleolytic enzymes, whereas sequences assembled into nucleosomes should be protected. Very strong, nucleosomal sites are resistant to cleavage over a large range in enzyme concentration while non-nucleosomal sites are cut at much lower concentrations. Consequently accessibility reaches plateau levels both for nucleosomal and non-nucleosomal sites. To be certain in our experiments that we have truly reached these plateau values for a given site, we always verify that 3- to 4-fold higher nuclease concentrations still give the same accessibility thus ruling out that the enzyme activity had been limiting. Nuclei from yeast strain TD28 (GCN4) were digested withPvuII, BstUI, DraI, HinfI, or PstI at 500 and 1500 units/ml for 1 h. The results shown in Fig. 3, A and B confirm our conclusions derived from the DNase I assay. Bands were quantified using a phosphorimager equipped with ImageQuant analysis software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and percent accessibility for the various enzymes was calculated from the ratio between the bands corresponding to digested sites and that of undigested DNA. Thus, the twoPstI sites present in the promoter region showed 50% (position −108) and <5% (position −546) accessibility, consistent with being at the border of the HS and within a nucleosome, respectively. BstUI (position −227) displayed 75% accessibility, correlating well with a position within the hypersensitive region. Conversely, the two DraI sites (positions −364 and −28) were less than 5% accessible, consistent with a location within the nucleosomes flanking the HS.PvuII (position −432) with 30% accessibility locates to an internucleosomal region in the deduced ILV1 chromatin structure. Five HinfI sites were examined (positions −595, −486, −296, −170, and −132). The sites within the hypersensitive region showed 80% accessibility (positions −170 and −132), whereas the remaining sites displayed less than 5% accessibility, consistent with nucleosomal locations. These results confirm the DNase I analysis and the mapping of nucleosomal positions we derived from that analysis. We conclude that the ILV1 promoter is organized in an ordered nucleosomal array with one strong hypersensitive site encompassing the region where the UAS elements are located. A schematic drawing of the ILV1 locus with restriction sites,cis-acting elements, and inferred chromatin structure is shown in Fig. 3C. The S. cerevisiae ILV1 gene is under regulation of the general control of amino acid biosynthesis. A Gcn4p-binding site present at position −127 was found to bind Gcn4p in vitro (26Arndt K.T. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Indeed, upon amino acid starvation ILV1 expression is increased 2-fold by the Gcn4p activator protein (27Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We tried to determine whether derepression by Gcn4p had any effect on ILV1 chromatin structure. For derepression by the general control of amino acid biosynthesis, the tryptophan analog 5-methyl-dl-tryptophan (MeTrp) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mm to the growth medium (27Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Miozzari G. Niederberger P. Hütter R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 48-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from TD28 (GCN4) cells grown to a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml and subjected to nuclease digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and DNase I, enabling us to complement our structural analysis. RNA was isolated from non-digested nuclei, and Northern analysis performed to confirm that ILV1 expression increased 2-fold upon derepression by the general control of amino acid biosynthesis (data not shown). The pattern obtained with either MNase (Fig.4) or DNase I (data not shown) was identical to the one previously observed for the basal transcriptional state of the ILV1 gene with a strong hypersensitive site comprising the UAS elements and an ordered nucleosomal array covering the promoter and coding region. Hence, derepression of theILV1 gene does not modify its chromatin structure in a way detectable in our analyses. We investigated the role of twotrans-acting factors, Dat1p and Gcn4p, both of which have been shown to bind their cognate sites at the ILV1 promoterin vitro (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Arndt K.T. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Nuclei isolated from strains TD28 (GCN4), 9994–6C (Δgcn4), EWY1002c-1 (DAT1), and BRY1004–3 (Δdat1) grown in minimal medium were digested with DNase I, DNA was isolated, and end-labeling analysis performed as described above. The patterns obtained for all four strains were identical (data not shown), demonstrating that neither Gcn4p nor Dat1p are involved in generating the observedILV1 chromatin structure. A Reb1p-binding site present at position −180 is required forGCN4-independent ILV1 basal level transcription. Deletion of the Reb1p site reduces ILV1 basal level expression 10- to 15-fold (1Remacle J.E. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, the poly(dA·dT) element located between positions −164 and −133, which is also necessary for wild-type ILV1 basal level expression (see above), is situated 15 bp downstream of the Reb1p site, and the two elements cooperatively stimulate ILV1 transcription (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This synergistic activation could be the result of a common mechanism of action. A Reb1p-binding site in the GAL1-GAL10 promoter was correlated with the presence of a nucleosome-free region of about 230 bp (12Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, poly(dA·dT) sequences stimulate Gcn4p-activated transcription and were suggested to function by changing chromatin structure and increasing accessibility of adjacent Gcn4p sites (18Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, the cooperative activation by the ILV1 Reb1p site and the downstream poly(dA·dT) element could be due to interactions between these two elements leading to increased accessibility of the adjacent Gcn4p-binding site. To test this possibility, we analyzed previously characterized promoter constructs showing decreasedILV1 basal expression (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these constructs theILV1 coding region has been replaced by the E. coli lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase (1Remacle J.E. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether the replacement of the ILV1 coding region with lacZ affected the structure of theILV1 promoter, we compared MNase digests of strain TD28 with those of strain TG561, an isogenic TD28 derivative containing aILV1 wild-type promoter, but with the ILV1 coding sequence replaced by lacZ. The digestion pattern for strain TD28 (Fig. 5, ILV1) is the expected one, a strong HS located in the promoter region, and an ordered nucleosomal array covers the coding region and promoter. Strain TG561 where the ILV1 coding sequence was substituted withlacZ shows a different pattern (Fig. 5, lacZ). The ILV1 promoter conserved its structure with one exception: the hypersensitive site was slightly decreased in size. This appears to be due to a shifted position of the nucleosome positioned at the downstream boundary of the hypersensitive region. Moreover, thelacZ sequence appears strongly nuclease-sensitive suggesting this gene to be less prone to undergo an ordered nucleosome organization. To confirm these conclusions and to determine that no accessibility changes had occurred in the hybrid promoter as compared with the wild-type promoter, we performed restriction enzyme analysis on the two strains. The results (Fig. 6) show that BstUI accessibility is almost identical (75% inILV1 and 70% in lacZ) but that thePstI site at position −108 changed from 50% accessibility in the wild-type situation (Fig. 6, ILV1) to <5% accessibility in the hybrid construct (Fig. 6, lacZ), consistent with going from a location at the border of the hypersensitive site to being covered by the adjacent nucleosome. The original position of this nucleosome had incorporated about 20 bp of coding sequence. Apparently, in the lacZ derivative, this positioned nucleosome is shifted upstream by about 20 bp thus excluding the new coding sequence altogether. At any rate, we conclude that the structure of the hybrid promoter construct reflects the wild-type situation in a sufficiently adequate manner for our study.Figure 6Accessibility analysis of the ILV1promoter in strains TD28 (wild-type) and TG561 (chimericILV1-lacZ fusion). Restriction enzyme analysis was performed as described (Fig. 3 legend). Position −108 corresponding to a PstI recognition site with altered accessibility is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We carried out a DNase I analysis on four constructs, which had previously been used to identify the Reb1p site and the downstream poly(dA·dT) element as important basal regulatory elements in theILV1 promoter (1Remacle J.E. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The promoter derivatives are either deleted for the Reb1p-binding site and/or the poly(dA·dT) element. Again, the pattern observed is identical in all three derivatives and indistinguishable from the wild-type pattern (Fig.7, A and B and data not shown) suggesting that neither the Reb1p-binding site nor the poly(dA·dT) are responsible for generating of the HS present at theILV1 promoter. To rule out the possibility that deletion of the Reb1p-binding site or/and the neighboring poly(dA·dT) element has more subtle effects on chromatin not detected by DNase I digestion, we performed a restriction enzyme analysis of three of the constructs as well (Fig. 7C). BstUI (position −227) accessibility is similar in the tested constructs (75–70%), and thePstI site at position −108, as shown before, displayed <5% accessibility (Fig. 7C, ΔREB1Δ(dA·dT)) in the lacZ constructs. These results show that neither the ILV1 Reb1p-binding site nor the downstream poly(dA·dT) element are responsible for generating the hypersensitive region we observe in the ILV1 promoter. We have shown that ILV1 basal level expression depends on the distance separating the Reb1p-binding site and the downstream poly(dA·dT) element, since insertion of spacing DNA into aXhoI site created between the Reb1p-binding site and the poly(dA·dT) element in the 15X construct reduces promoter activity (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the hypersensitive site in the ILV1promoter were caused by any cis-acting element present within the nuclease accessible region, insertion of 41 bp or 74 bp of DNA corresponding to a size increase of 22% and 41%, respectively, might cause some rearrangement of the borders of the hypersensitive region thus affecting promoter activity. DNase I analysis of the constructs containing insertions of DNA between the Reb1p-binding site and the downstream poly(dA·dT) element is shown in Fig. 8. The basic structure and relative positioning of nucleosomes is preserved in the constructs containing insertions relative to the wild-type situation. The main difference is the progressive increase in the size of the nuclease-sensitive region. The resulting pattern clearly shows that the entire promoter region structure is similar between all the constructs and that insertion of increasingly larger spacing DNA is compensated for by correspondingly larger hypersensitive regions. We considered the possibility that the presence of two A·T-rich tracts placed symmetrically within the HS and located at roughly the same distance from the borders of the HS triggers nucleosome exclusion from this region. Such a mechanism would also explain the lengthening of the hypersensitive site observed as a consequence of introducing random sequences in between the two A-T rich tracts. We therefore replaced either one or both ILV1 A·T-rich tracts by 40% GC content random sequences resulting in strainsILV1(ΔA1), ILV1(ΔA2), andILV1(ΔA1ΔA2), respectively. MNase analysis of these strains is shown in Fig. 9. The obtained pattern is identical to the one previously detected in theILV1 promoter. Neither the typical nucleosomal ladder nor the hypersensitive region shows any significant difference to the wild-type situation. We conclude that the strong nucleosome positioning which we observe at the ILV1 locus is not dependent on the presence of the two A·T-rich tracts present in the promoter region. We have reported that ILV1 basal level expression is controlled in a synergistic manner by a Reb1p-binding site and a downstream poly(dA·dT) element (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reb1p has been proposed to antagonize nucleosomal repression by creating an accessible chromatin structure, thereby allowing other factors to gain access to their cognate sites (12Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Other reports, however, dispute this conclusion and interpret the data differently (13Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Reagan M.S. Majors J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reb1p has also been implicated as a regulatory factor both in Pol II and Pol I transcribed genes (1Remacle J.E. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Lang W.H. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,9Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4256-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Synergistic interactions between Reb1p-binding sites and poly(dA·dT) elements have been described by several authors (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 3Chasman D.I. Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Graham I.R. Chambers A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Buchman A.R. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the two elements cooperate to increase accessibility of adjacent elements since also homopolymeric poly(dA·dT) elements have been proposed to stimulate transcription through an effect on chromatin structure (15Chen W. Tabor S. Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Given the presence of a Reb1p-binding site and two poly(dA·dT) elements in theILV1 promoter and the fact that at least one poly(dA·dT) element synergizes with Reb1p to sustain a relatively high basal level expression of the ILV1 gene, it is possible that the two elements act to increase chromatin accessibility, perhaps by keeping the promoter free from nucleosomes. To ascertain if Reb1p or the poly(dA·dT) elements have an effect on chromatin at ILV1, we examined the structure of theILV1 locus and mapped the nucleosomal of this gene (Fig.3C). The promoter and coding region are covered by an ordered nucleosomal array that is interrupted by a single strong nuclease-sensitive site comprising the region where thecis-acting elements required for normal expression of theILV1 gene are located. The structure of the locus is unaltered by Gcn4p-mediated derepression (Fig. 4). This is not an unexpected result since ILV1 basal level expression is relatively high and ILV1 is up-regulated only 2-fold by amino acid starvation (26Arndt K.T. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Holmberg S. Petersen J.G.L. Curr. Genet. 1988; 13: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additionally, neither eliminations of Dat1p nor of Gcn4p, two trans-acting factors required for normal levels of expression, affected the chromatin structure of theILV1 locus (data not shown). It seemed reasonable to expect that Reb1p functions in theILV1 context through an effect on chromatin structure, establishing the nucleosome-free area of about 180 bp observed in the promoter region. However, constructs containing deletions in the Reb1p-binding site and/or the downstream poly(dA·dT) element, which decrease expression of the ILV1 gene or even abolish it (β-galactosidase measurements expressed in Miller Units; wild-type: 4.3 ± 0.8; ΔReb1: 0.51 ± 0.02; Δpoly(dA·dT); 0.36 ± 0.05; ΔReb1Δpoly(dA·dT): 0.09 ± 0.02) (1Remacle J.E. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed the same chromatin structure as a wild-type promoter construct (Fig. 7, A–C), thus disproving the hypothesis that Reb1p is responsible for the hypersensitive site in the ILV1promoter. These data were obtained with ILV1-lacZ fusions replacing ILV1, and are therefore open to the criticism that they are not relevant for the native locus. In fact, the structure of the fusion constructs does not match perfectly the situation in the wild-type ILV1 locus, since the hypersensitive region is decreased by ∼20 bp (Fig. 5). Two lines of evidence argue against this criticism. First, quantitative analysis of accessibility in the region immediately upstream of the Reb1p-binding site did not show a significant difference between an ILV1 wild-type situation and the ILV1-lacZ fusion construct (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the observed decrease in the size of the hypersensitive site is a localized effect at the boundary to the lacZ coding region. Second, deletion of the Reb1p-binding site in theILV1-lacZ hybrid construct decreased transcription to about 10% of the wild-type levels as determined by β-galactosidase activity (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A decrease in promoter accessibility having such a dramatic effect on gene expression would be expected to be easily revealed by the restriction enzyme analysis presented in Fig.7C, if it existed. However, no difference was detected. We conclude that Reb1p is not responsible for the formation of the hypersensitive site present in the ILV1 promoter region and that Reb1p potentiates expression in the ILV1 context by a mechanism other than causing a nucleosome-free region. Poly(dA·dT) elements stimulate transcription of several yeast genes (15Chen W. Tabor S. Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Lue N.F.

Circular dichroism studies, x-ray fiber diffraction and an analysis of the helical repeat of homopolymeric poly(dA·dT) tracts clearly showed that the homopolymer is structurally different from canonical B-DNA (31Wells R.D. Larson J.E. Grant R.C. Shortle B.E. Cantor C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 54: 465-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 32Arnott S. Selsing E. J. Mol.

Failed attempts to assemble homopolymers into nucleosomes in vitro(34Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Simpson R.T. Kunzler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1387-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the observation that cloned oligoadenosine regions were excluded from nucleosome formation (36Prunell A. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) provided the basis for the view that poly(dA·dT) tracts are refractory to nucleosome assembly. More recent reports, however, present a different view on homopolymeric sequences function and structure. Herrera and Chaires (37Herrera J.E. Chaires J.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1993-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) showed that poly(dA·dT) tracts can assume a normal B-conformation, and other laboratories demonstrated that poly(dA·dT) sequences can be assembled into nucleosomes, in some cases even more favorably than heterogeneous-sequence DNA (38Losa R. Omari S. Thoma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3495-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P.

We have shown that a poly(dA·dT) element present in the ILV1 promoter is required for efficient basal level expression and that the activity of the element is partially dependent on Dat1p, a poly(dA·dT) DNA-binding protein (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Analysis of ILV1 chromatin in the absence of Dat1p and in an ILV1-lacZ fusion containing a deletion of the downstream poly(dA·dT) element, showed no difference to a wild-type situation (data not shown), suggesting that theILV1 downstream poly(dA·dT) element was not responsible for the nucleosome exclusion observed in the promoter region. If the nuclease accessible site is caused by a strong setting preference of the nucleosomes positioned at the HS borders, we would expect that insertion of 74 bp of DNA into a previously 180-bp long stretch might allow the assembly of an additional nucleosome, thereby eliminating or splitting the nucleosome-free region. On the other hand, if a single cis-acting element present within the promoter region were responsible for the nucleosome-free region, then insertions would cause an asymmetric shift in the position of the HS. Insertion of spacing DNA in the center of the hypersensitive region (Fig. 8), clearly shows that the entire promoter structure remains unaltered, accommodating the inserted sequences within the hypersensitive site with a concomitant enlargement of the nucleosome-free region. The observed size increase suggested to us that two elements might be required to generate the hypersensitive region, such as the two A·T-rich tracts flanking the ILV1 Reb1p-binding site. However, simultaneous deletion of both A·T-rich tracts present in theILV1 promoter had no effect on the chromatin structure of the locus (Fig. 9), excluding the possibility that these elements are responsible for the nucleosomal exclusion. In summary, we have established the chromatin structure of theILV1 locus, with a positioned array of nucleosomes covering the entire gene and promoter, and a hypersensitive region comprising all known cis-acting sequences. We have shown that Reb1p does not visibly affect chromatin structure of the ILV1promoter even though the Reb1p-binding site is required for normal expression. This shows that Reb1p functions at ILV1 not through exclusion of nucleosomes but by some other mechanism of activation. We have also shown that the two poly(dA·dT) elements do not play an in vivo role in antagonizing nucleosome assembly in the ILV1 promoter, supporting our previous findings (2Moreira J.M.A. Remacle J.E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and suggesting that binding of Dat1p, a poly(dA·dT)-binding factor, rather than chromatin modulation might be the function of these elements in the ILV1 promoter context. What is then responsible for the strong nuclease sensitive site observed in the ILV1 gene? Our results strongly suggest that the DNA sequence itself plays a dominant role in orchestrating the chromatin structure at the ILV1 promoter. The DNA contained within the hypersensitive region would be intrinsically refractory to nucleosome formation, thus creating a nucleosome-free zone. By the same token, the DNA adjacent to the hypersensitive site would dictate the positioning of the nucleosomes that is so characteristic of this promoter. This scenario would explain the resiliency of the chromatin organization of the ILV1 promoter to the loss of individual factor binding sites and to localized DNA insertions and deletions. Shen and Clark (42Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35209-35216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) recently reported that also at the yeastCUP1 gene DNA sequence is likely to play a very important role in positioning nucleosomes, which together with our data suggests a major role for DNA sequence in dictating nucleosome positioning and exclusion in vivo.

Using tumor cell lines generated previously by asbestos treatment of immortalized human bronchial epithelial (BEP2D) cells, we examined alterations in p16 and p21(Cip1) genes together with their protein levels. Results were compared with untreated BEP2D cells, normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), as well as non-tumorigenic fusion cell lines generated by fusing tumor cells with BEP2D cells. No deletion in the p16 gene was found in any of the tumor cell lines examined. Although p16 protein was expressed at a similar level in tumor and BEP2D cells, there was a fourfold decrease in its expression among NHBE cells. In contrast, both the protein and mRNA expression levels of p21(Cip1) were decreased by about threefold in tumor cell lines when compared with either BEP2D or NHBE cells, which had a similar expression level. Expression of p21(Cip1) mRNA was restored to the control level in all the fusion cell lines examined. The results suggested that down regulation of p21(Cip1) expression is linked to the tumorigenic conversion of BEP2D cells by asbestos."
https://openalex.org/W2047796739,"Cotransfection of primary rat embryo fibroblasts (REF) with c-Jun and activated Ras leads to oncogenic transformation and this process requires the phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of c-Jun. Ras augments this phosphorylation and, consequently activates the c-Jun transactivation property of TRE (TPA Responsive Element)-dependent promoters. To analyse the role of the c-Jun C-terminal phosphorylation site in oncogenic cooperation we tested the activities of N-terminal c-Jun Ala(63/73) (named Nt), C-terminal c-Jun Ala(234/242/246/252) (named Ct) and (Nt+Ct)-with both mutations-non-phosphorylatable c-Jun mutants. In cooperation with Ras, the Ct mutant and wt c-Jun display similar oncogenic properties whereas the Nt form was defective in transforming REF cells. Unexpectedly, the Nt+Ct mutant exhibited identical oncogenic properties to wt c-Jun, demonstrating that the Ct mutation rescues in cis the Nt mutation. The transcriptional activity and the capacity to bind the c-Jun coactivator CREB Binding Protein (CBP) were enhanced by Ras for the wt and Ct proteins but not for the Nt mutant. Interestingly, the Nt+Ct mutant presents identical transactivation and CBP binding activities to wt c-Jun. Therefore the rescue in cis of the defective Nt mutation by the Ct mutation seems to be due to the recovery of CBP binding. Our results revealed that the process of oncogenic cooperation can occur between Ras and the Nt+Ct non-phosphorylatable c-Jun protein."
https://openalex.org/W2322101969,"Oncogenic activation of c-myb by retroviral insertion has been implicated in tumor formation in chicken and mice. These genetic alterations result in deregulated expression of the c-myb gene and frequently in N-terminal truncation of the c-Myb protein. We demonstrate that truncation of the c-Myb N-terminus affects DNA binding and reporter activation. However, all three mutants, Myb Delta N20, Myb Delta N47 and Myb Delta N71 cooperated with C/EBP beta in reporter assays. In contrast to Myb Delta N20 and Myb Delta N47, however, the Myb Delta N71 mutant failed to activate the chromatin embedded endogenous mim-1 gene together with C/EBP beta. This suggests that an N-terminal region (amino acids 47-71) within repeat 1 (R1) of the murine c-Myb DNA binding domain affects activation of chromosomal target genes in collaboration with C/EBP beta."
