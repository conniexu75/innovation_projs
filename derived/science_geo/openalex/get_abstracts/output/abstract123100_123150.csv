https://openalex.org/W2151089147,"Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and other food products, was purified and shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity in assays representing three major stages of carcinogenesis. Resveratrol was found to act as an antioxidant and antimutagen and to induce phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (anti-initiation activity); it mediated anti-inflammatory effects and inhibited cyclooxygenase and hydroperoxidase functions (antipromotion activity); and it induced human promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation (antiprogression activity). In addition, it inhibited the development of preneoplastic lesions in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands in culture and inhibited tumorigenesis in a mouse skin cancer model. These data suggest that resveratrol, a common constituent of the human diet, merits investigation as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1994190235,"Hemoglobin is released from lysed RBCs in numerous clinical settings. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear and cytosolic DNA-binding protein released from injured cells that has been shown to play an important role in inducing inflammation. Because both of these endogenous molecules are frequently present in sites of necrosis and inflammation, we studied their interaction on the activation of macrophages. We report in this article that hemoglobin and HMGB1 synergize to activate mouse macrophages to release significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines. Addition of microbial ligands that activate through TLR2 or TLR4 resulted in further significant increases, in a ""three-way"" synergy between endogenous and microbial ligands. The synergy was strongly suppressed by hemopexin (Hx), an endogenous heme-binding plasma protein. The findings suggest that hemoglobin may play an important role in sterile and infectious inflammation, and that endogenous Hx can modulate this response. Administration of Hx may be beneficial in clinical settings characterized by elevated extracellular hemoglobin and HMGB1."
https://openalex.org/W2115659029,"Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) that are found as close-packed arrays in crystalline ropes have been studied by using Raman scattering techniques with laser excitation wavelengths in the range from 514.5 to 1320 nanometers. Numerous Raman peaks were observed and identified with vibrational modes of armchair symmetry ( n , n ) SWNTs. The Raman spectra are in good agreement with lattice dynamics calculations based on C-C force constants used to fit the two-dimensional, experimental phonon dispersion of a single graphene sheet. Calculated intensities from a nonresonant, bond polarizability model optimized for sp 2 carbon are also in qualitative agreement with the Raman data, although a resonant Raman scattering process is also taking place. This resonance results from the one-dimensional quantum confinement of the electrons in the nanotube."
https://openalex.org/W2010778459,"Summary We have produced a mouse strain in which the deletion of the NMDAR1 gene is restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus by using a new and general method that allows CA1-restricted gene knockout. The mutant mice grow into adulthood without obvious abnormalities. Adult mice lack NMDA receptor–mediated synaptic currents and long-term potentiation in the CA1 synapses and exhibit impaired spatial memory but unimpaired nonspatial learning. Our results strongly suggest that activity-dependent modifications of CA1 synapses, mediated by NMDA receptors, play an essential role in the acquisition of spatial memories."
https://openalex.org/W2022995207,"Cortical neurons receive synaptic inputs from thousands of afferents that fire action potentials at rates ranging from less than 1 hertz to more than 200 hertz. Both the number of afferents and their large dynamic range can mask changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of synaptic activity, limiting the ability of a cortical neuron to respond to its inputs. Modeling work based on experimental measurements indicates that short-term depression of intracortical synapses provides a dynamic gain-control mechanism that allows equal percentage rate changes on rapidly and slowly firing afferents to produce equal postsynaptic responses. Unlike inhibitory and adaptive mechanisms that reduce responsiveness to all inputs, synaptic depression is input-specific, leading to a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of a neuron to subtle changes in the firing patterns of its afferents."
https://openalex.org/W2072233684,"The role of back-propagating dendritic action potentials in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) was investigated in CA1 neurons by means of dendritic patch recordings and simultaneous calcium imaging. Pairing of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with back-propagating action potentials resulted in an amplification of dendritic action potentials and evoked calcium influx near the site of synaptic input. This pairing also induced a robust LTP, which was reduced when EPSPs were paired with non-back-propagating action potentials or when stimuli were unpaired. Action potentials thus provide a synaptically controlled, associative signal to the dendrites for Hebbian modifications of synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2133659563,"Using the phage P1–derived Cre/loxP recombination system, we have developed a method to create mice in which the deletion (knockout) of virtually any gene of interest is restricted to a subregion or a specific cell type in the brain such as the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region. The Cre/loxP recombination–based gene deletion appears to require a certain level of Cre protein expression. The brain subregional restricted gene knockout should allow a more precise analysis of the impact of a gene mutation on animal behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2052221476,"Integration host factor (IHF) is a small heterodimeric protein that specifically binds to DNA and functions as an architectural factor in many cellular processes in prokaryotes. Here, we report the crystal structure of IHF complexed with 35 bp of DNA. The DNA is wrapped around the protein and bent by >160 degrees, thus reversing the direction of the helix axis within a very short distance. Much of the bending occurs at two large kinks where the base stacking is interrupted by intercalation of a proline residue. IHF contacts the DNA exclusively via the phosphodiester backbone and the minor groove and relies heavily on indirect readout to recognize its binding sequence. One such readout involves a six-base A tract, providing evidence for the importance of a narrow minor groove."
https://openalex.org/W2086778920,"The transcription initiation factor TFIID is a multimeric protein complex composed of TATA box–binding protein (TBP) and many TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs). TAFIIs are important cofactors that mediate activated transcription by providing interaction sites for distinct activators. Here, we present evidence that human TAFII250 and its homologs in Drosophila and yeast have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity in vitro. HAT activity maps to the central, most conserved portion of dTAFII230 and yTAFII130. The HAT activity of dTAFII230 resembles that of yeast and human GCN5 in that it is specific for histones H3 and H4 in vitro. Our findings suggest that targeted histone acetylation at specific promoters by TAFII250 may be involved in mechanisms by which TFIID gains access to transcriptionally repressed chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2121753315,"The HIV-1 capsid protein forms the conical core structure at the center of the mature virion. Capsid also binds the human peptidyl prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A, thereby packaging the enzyme into the virion. Cyclophilin A subsequently performs an essential function in HIV-1 replication, possibly helping to disassemble the capsid core upon infection. We report the 2.36 Å crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid (residues 1–151) in complex with human cyclophilin A. A single exposed capsid loop (residues 85–93) binds in the enzyme's active site, and Pro-90 adopts an unprecedented transconformation. The structure suggests how cyclophilin A can act as a sequence-specific binding protein and a nonspecific prolyl isomerase. In the crystal lattice, capsid molecules assemble into continuous planar strips. Side by side association of these strips may allow capsid to form the surface of the viral core. Cyclophilin A could then function by weakening the association between capsid strips, thereby promoting disassembly of the viral core."
https://openalex.org/W2147808841,"A novel 15-subunit complex with the capacity to remodel the structure of chromatin, termed RSC, has been isolated from S. cerevisiae on the basis of homology to the SWI/SNF complex. At least three RSC subunits are related to SWI/SNF polypeptides: Sth1p, Rsc6p, and Rsc8p are significantly similar to Swi2/Snf2p, Swp73p, and Swi3p, respectively, and were identified by mass spectrometric and sequence analysis of peptide fragments. Like SWI/SNF, RSC exhibits a DNA-dependent ATPase activity stimulated by both free and nucleosomal DNA and a capacity to perturb nucleosome structure. RSC is, however, at least 10-fold more abundant than SWI/SNF complex and is essential for mitotic growth. Contrary to a report for SWII/SNF complex, no association of RSC (nor of SWI/SNF complex) with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme was detected."
https://openalex.org/W1988633143,"To investigate the role of synaptic plasticity in the place-specific firing of the hippocampus, we have applied multiple electrode recording techniques to freely behaving mice with a CA1 pyramidal cell–specific knockout of the NMDAR1 gene. We have discovered that although the CA1 pyramidal cells of these mice retain place-related activity, there is a significant decrease in the spatial specificity of individual place fields. We have also found a striking deficit in the coordinated firing of pairs of neurons tuned to similar spatial locations. Pairs have uncorrelated firing even if their fields overlap. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptor–mediated synaptic plasticity is necessary for the proper representation of space in the CA1 region of the hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W2113122815,"Neurotrophins have been proposed to mediate several forms of activity-dependent competition in the central nervous system. A key element of such hypotheses is that neurotrophins act preferentially on active neurons; however, little direct evidence supports this postulate. We therefore examined, in ferret cortical brain slices, the interactions between activity and neurotrophins in regulating dendritic growth of layer 4 pyramidal neurons. Inhibition of spontaneous electrical activity, synaptic transmission, or L-type calcium channels each prevented the otherwise dramatic increase in dendritic arborizations elicited by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. In developing cortex, this requirement for conjoint neurotrophin signaling and activity provides a mechanism for selectively enhancing the growth and connectivity of active neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2049378629,"Interaction of the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1)-associated signal transducer TRADD with FADD signals apoptosis, whereas the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 protein (TRAF2) is required for activation of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B. TNF-induced activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) was shown to occur through a noncytotoxic TRAF2-dependent pathway. TRAF2 was both sufficient and necessary for activation of SAPK by TNF-R1; conversely, expression of a dominant-negative FADD mutant, which blocks apoptosis, did not interfere with SAPK activation. Therefore, SAPK activation occurs through a pathway that is not required for TNF-R1-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1987427290,"In the embryonic nervous system, developing axons can be guided to their targets by diffusible factors secreted by their intermediate and final cellular targets. To date only one family of chemoattractants for developing axons has been identified. Grafting and ablation experiments in fish, amphibians, and birds have suggested that spinal motor axons are guided to their targets in the limb in part by a succession of chemoattractants made by the sclerotome and by the limb mesenchyme, two intermediate targets that these axons encounter en route to their target muscles. Here we identify the limb mesenchyme-derived chemoattractant as hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), a diffusible ligand for the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, and we also implicate HGF/SF at later stages as a muscle-derived survival factor for motoneurons. These results indicate that, in addition to functioning as a mitogen, a motogen, and a morphogen in nonneural systems, HGF/SF can function as a guidance and survival factor in the developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1990913409,"The isk gene is expressed in many tissues. Pharmacological evidence from the inner ear suggests that Isk mediates potassium secretion into the endolymph. To examine the consequences of IsK null mutation on inner ear function, and to produce a system useful for examining the role(s) IsK plays elsewhere, we have produced a mouse strain that carries a disrupted isk locus. Knockout mice exhibit classic shaker/waltzer behavior. Hair cells degenerate, but those of different inner ear organs degenerate at different times. Functionally, we show that in mice lacking isk, the strial marginal cells and the vestibular dark cells of the inner ear are unable to generate an equivalent short circuit current in vitro, indicating a lack of transepithelial potassium secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2055433327,"Recently, we reported that a pool of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is associated with microtubules. Here, we demonstrate that specific isoforms of PP2A bind and dephosphorylate the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau. Coexpression of tau and SV40 small t, a specific inhibitor of PP2A, in CV-1, NIH 3T3, or NT2 cells induced the phosphorylation of tau at multiple sites, including Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-396, and Ser-404. Immunofluorescent and biochemical analyses revealed that hyperphosphorylation correlated with dissociation of tau from microtubules and a loss of tau-induced microtubule stabilization. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that PP2A controls the phosphorylation state of tau in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2091595468,"The molecular mechanism by which bacterial avirulence genes mediate recognition by resistant host plants has been enigmatic for more than a decade. In this paper we provide evidence that the Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria avirulence protein AvrBs3 is recognized inside the plant cell. Transient expression of avrBs3 in pepper leaves, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens for gene delivery, results in hypersensitive cell death, specifically on plants carrying the resistance gene Bs3. In addition, for its intracellular recognition, AvrBs3 requires nuclear localization signals that are present in the C-terminal region of the protein. We propose that AvrBs3 is translocated into plant cells via the Xanthomonas Hrp type III secretion system and that nuclear factors are involved in AvrBs3 perception."
https://openalex.org/W2040461990,"Most cell types in multicellular eukaryotes exit from the mitotic cell cycle before terminal differentiation. We show that the dacapo gene is required to arrest the epidermal cell proliferation at the correct developmental stage during Drosophila embryogenesis. dacapo encodes an inhibitor of cyclin E/cdk2 complexes with similarity to the vertebrate Cip/Kip inhibitors. dacapo is transiently expressed beginning late in the G2 phase preceding the terminal division (mitosis 16). Mutants unable to express the inhibitor fail to arrest cell proliferation after mitosis 16 and progress through an extra division cycle. Conversely, premature dacapo expression in transgenic embryos results in a precocious G1 arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2009277631,"In a screen for genes that interact with the Rap1 GTPase, we have identified a Drosophila gene, dacapo (dap), which is a member of the p21/p27 family of cdk inhibitors. Unlike mammalian cdk inhibitors studied to date, dap is essential for normal embryonic development. Dacapo inhibits cyclin-cdk activity in vitro. Overexpressing dap during eye development interferes with cell cycle progression and interacts genetically with the retinoblastoma homolog (Rbf) and cyclin E. dap expression in embryos parallels the exit of cells from the cell cycle. dap mutant embryos delay the normal cell cycle exit during development; many cells complete an additional cycle and subsequently become quiescent. Thus, dap functions during embryogenesis to achieve a precisely timed exit from the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1981782196,"Although vertebrate hindbrains are segmented structures, the functional significance of the segmentation is unknown. In zebrafish, the hindbrain segments contain serially repeated classes of individually identifiable neurons. We took advantage of the transparency of larval zebrafish and used confocal calcium imaging in the intact fish to study the activity of one set of individually identified, serially homologous reticulospinal cells (the Mauthner cell, MiD2cm, and MiD3cm) during behavior. Behavioral studies predicted that differential activity in this set of serially homologous neurons might serve to control the directionality of the escape behavior that fish use to avoid predators. We found that the serially homologous cells are indeed activated during escapes and that the combination of cells activated depends upon the location of the sensory stimulus used to elicit the escape. The patterns of activation we observed were exactly those predicted by behavioral studies. The data suggest that duplication of ancestral hindbrain segments, and subsequent functional diversification, resulted in sets of related neurons whose activity patterns create behavioral variability."

https://openalex.org/W2026998769,"The molecular mechanisms that regulate growth cone guidance of dendrite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that mRNA localization in dendritic growth cones and their local protein synthesis may be important for growth cone functioning. The appearance of 23 of 31 growth cone mRNAs was developmentally regulated. Also, alteration of growth cone morphology affected the relative levels of three mRNAs. Finally, using single dendrite transfection, it was shown that local protein synthesis occurs in dendrites and growth cones. A heterogeneous population of mRNAs exists in dendritic growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons whose relative abundances are developmentally regulated and can vary with changes in growth cone physiology. The demonstration of protein synthesis in growth cones suggests that translation of the localized mRNAs may contribute to regulation of growth cone motility and dendrite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W1965522502,"rsec6 and rsec8 are two components of a 17S complex in mammalian brain that is homologous to the yeast 834 kDa Sec6/8/15 complex which is essential for exocytosis. Purification and partial amino acid sequencing of the mammalian rsec6/8 complex reveals that it is composed of eight novel proteins with a combined molecular weight of 743 kDa. The complex is broadly expressed in brain and displays a plasma membrane localization in nerve terminals. Membrane associated rsec6/8 complex coimmunoprecipitates with syntaxin, a plasma membrane protein critical for neurotransmission. These data suggest a role for the mammalian rsec6/8 complex in neurotransmitter release via interactions with the core vesicle docking and fusion apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2024710493,"Using high resolution capacitance measurements, we have characterized an ultrafast component of transmitter release in ribbon-type synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons. During depolarization, capacitance increases to a plateau of ∼30 fF with a time constant of ∼1.5 ms. When not limited by activation kinetics of calcium current, the small pool is depleted even faster, with a time constant of 0.5 ms. After the ultrafast pool is depleted, capacitance rises with a slower time constant of ∼300 ms. EGTA (5 mM) depresses the slower capacitance rise but leaves the ultrafast phase intact. BAPTA (5 mM) depresses both components of exocytosis. With paired-pulse stimulation, the ultrafast pool recovers from depletion with a time constant of ∼4 s. The ultrafast component may represent fusion of docked vesicles at the base of the synaptic ribbon, while the slower component represents more distal vesicles on the ribbon."
https://openalex.org/W2028648973,"Astrocytes invade the developing retina from the optic nerve head, over the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs express the platelet-derived growth factor A-chain (PDGF-A) and retinal astrocytes the PDGF alpha-receptor (PDGFRα), suggesting that PDGF mediates a paracrine interaction between these cells. To test this, we inhibited PDGF signaling in the eye with a neutralizing anti-PDGFRα antibody or a soluble extracellular fragment of PDGFRα. These treatments inhibited development of the astrocyte network. We also generated transgenic mice that overexpress PDGF-A in RGCs. This resulted in hyperproliferation of astrocytes, which in turn induced excessive vasculogenesis. Thus, PDGF appears to be a link in the chain of cell–cell interactions responsible for matching numbers of neurons, astrocytes, and blood vessels during retinal development."
https://openalex.org/W2055434206,"To understand mechanisms resulting in the absence of two-thirds of spinal sensory neurons in mice lacking NT-3, we have compared dorsal root ganglia development in normal and mutant embryos. The reduction in neurons, achieved by E13, results from several deficits: first, elevated neuronal apoptosis significantly reduces neuronal numbers; second, elevated neurogenesis between E11 and E12, without changes in rates of precursor proliferation or apoptosis, depletes the precursor pool; consequently, the reduced precursor pool prevents increases in neuronal numbers between E12 and E13, when most neurons are born in normal animals. Although deficits occur before final target innervation, we show that NT-3 is expressed at all stages in regions accessible to these neurons or their axons and is only restricted to final targets after innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2011909683,"To relate different forms of synaptic plasticity to the formation and maintenance of place cells in the hippocampus, we have recorded place cells in freely behaving, transgenic mice that express a mutated Ca2+-independent form of CaM Kinase II. These mice have normal long-term potentiation (LTP) at 100 Hz, but they lack LTP in response to stimulation at 5–10 Hz and are impaired on spatial memory tasks. In these transgenic mice, the place cells in the CA1 region have three important differences from those of wild types: they are less common, less precise, and less stable. These findings suggest that LTP in the 5–10 Hz range may be important for the maintenance of place-field stability and that this stability may be essential for the storage of spatial memory."
https://openalex.org/W1968011224,"Maleic anhydride, a precursor to polyester resins, is made by oxidation of n-butane over vanadium phosphate catalysts. This system is of general interest because it is the only heterogeneously catalyzed, alkane-selective oxidation reaction in commercial use. Time-resolved in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that when either alphaI-VOPO4/SiO2 or (VO)2P2O7/SiO2 catalysts are exposed to n-butane, the rate of maleic anhydride formation is proportional to the rate of decay of V5+ species in the catalyst. Thus V5+ species are kinetically significant for the production of maleic anhydride and not just for the production of by-products. The results also suggest that V5+ species may play a role in the initial hydrogen abstraction from n-butane, the rate-determining step in the reaction sequence. V4+ sites appear to be responsible for by-product formation."

With the use of a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model, it is shown that the North Atlantic may have climatic predictability on the order of a decade or longer. These results suggest that variations of the dominant multidecadal sea surface temperature patterns in the North Atlantic, which have been associated with changes in climate over Eurasia, can be predicted if an adequate and sustainable system for monitoring the Atlantic Ocean exists."

https://openalex.org/W1976057396,"The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a plasticity-associated transcription factor that can potentially integrate cAMP and calcium signals at the gene activation level. We tested for convergent Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB via dopamine D1/D5 receptors and L-type calcium channels in organotypic cultures of neonatal striatum. We found such convergence only transiently. Sustained CREB phosphorylation by D1/D5 receptor and L-type channel agonists was targeted to opposite (striosome and matrix) cellular phenotypes. Subsequent expression of the CRE-containing gene, c-fos, matched the divergent patterns of sustained CREB phosphorylation, and both divergent patterns could be switched by inhibition of phosphatases, including calcineurin. Control of the duration of CREB phosphorylation may be a critical regulator of CRE-mediated gene expression by dopamine and calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2028055687,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are widely distributed throughout the nervous system, but their functions remain largely unknown. One of the most abundant is a class of receptors that contains the alpha 7 gene product, has a high relative permeability to calcium, and binds alpha-bungarotoxin. Here, we report that receptors sensitive to alpha-bungarotoxin, though concentrated in perisynaptic clusters on neurons, can generate a large amount of the synaptic current. Residual currents through other nicotinic receptors are sufficient to elicit action potentials, but with slower rise times. This demonstrates a postsynaptic response for alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive receptors on neurons and suggests that the functional domain of the postsynaptic membrane is broader than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2044773122,"The function of the compound eye is dependent upon a developmental program that specifies different cell fates and directs the expression of spectrally distinct opsins in different photoreceptor cells. Rh5 is a novel Drosophila opsin gene that encodes a biologically active visual pigment that is expressed in a subset of R8 photoreceptor cells. Rh5 expression in the R8 cell of an individual ommatidium is strictly coordinated with the expression of Rh3, in the overlying R7 cell. In sevenless mutant flies, which lack R7 photoreceptor cells, the expression of the Rh5 protein in R8 cells is disrupted, providing evidence for a specific developmental signal between the R7 and R8 cells that is responsible for the paired expression of opsin genes."
https://openalex.org/W2045756787,"MAP2 and tau are the two most prominent neuron-specific microtubule-associated proteins. They have been implicated in the stabilization of microtubules and consequently of neurite morphology. To investigate their influence on microtubule dynamics, we have tagged both proteins with green fluorescent protein and expressed them in non-neuronal cells. Time-lapse recordings of living cells showed that MAP2 and tau did not significantly affect the rates of microtubule growth and shrinkage. Longer recordings revealed the growth and disappearance of MAP-induced microtubule bundles coinciding with changes in cell shape. This supports the idea that microtubule dynamics are influenced by the cortical cytoskeleton. The dynamics-preserving stabilization of microtubules by MAP2 and tau thus provides a molecular basis for the morphological plasticity reported to exist in established neurites."
https://openalex.org/W1979126290,"In vivo, cytoplasmic microtubules are nucleated and anchored by their minus ends at the centrosome and are believed to turn over by a mechanism termed dynamic instability: depolymerization and repolymerization at their plus ends. In cytoplasmic fragments of fish melanophores, microtubules were shown to detach from their nucleation site and depolymerize from their minus ends. Free microtubules moved toward the periphery by treadmilling—growth at one end and shortening from the opposite end. Frequent release from nucleation sites may be a general property of centrosomes and permit a minus-end mechanism of microtubule turnover and treadmilling."

During exponential growth in which the generation time was 10 hours, the profile of bioluminescence from a reporter strain of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus (species PCC 7942) matched a model based on the assumption that cells proliferate exponentially and the bioluminescence of each cell oscillates in a cosine fashion. Some messenger RNAs showed a circadian rhythm in abundance during continuous exponential growth with a doubling time of 5 to 6 hours. Thus, the cyanobacterial circadian clock functions in cells that divide three or more times during one circadian cycle."

Additionally, materials associated with some impact craters have been excavated from a layer interpreted to be deficient in opaque minerals within the crust, possibly analogous to the lunar anorthosite crust. These observations suggest that Mercury has undergone complex differentiation like the other terrestrial planets and the Earth's moon."
https://openalex.org/W2003036054,"When embryonic thalamic neurons are plated onto living slices of mouse forebrain, cell attachment and neurite outgrowth on different layers of the developing cerebral cortex vary dramatically, in ways that correlate with the timing and pattern of thalamocortical innervation. These layer-specific differences can be eliminated from embryonic day 16 slices by enzymatic removal of chondroitin sulfate (CS). The cortical plate (a zone avoided by thalamic axons in vivo) possesses inhibitory activity (anti-adhesive, neurite repelling) and the intermediate zone and subplate (in which thalamic axons normally grow) possess stimulatory activity (adhesive, neurite promoting), both of which are chondroitinase sensitive. These opposing activities appear not to reflect the presence of different CS proteoglycans (CSPGs) in different zones, but rather the presence of differentially localized CS-binding molecules, which can be competed away by soluble CS. This model reconciles conflicting reports on the actions of CSPGs in neural development, and suggests a role for CSPGs in the organization of matrix-bound cues in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2090869432,"Netrin-1, a diffusible signal secreted by floor plate cells at the ventral midline of the vertebrate CNS, can attract ventrally migrating axons and repel a subset of dorsally migrating axons in the spinal cord and rostral hindbrain in vitro. Whether netrin-1 can act as a global cue to guide all circumferentially migrating axons is, however, unknown. Here, we show that netrin-1 can attract alar plate axons that cross the floor plate along its entire rostrocaudal axis. Dorsally directed axons forming the posterior commissure are, however, repelled by the floor plate by a netrin-independent mechanism. These results suggest that netrin-1 functions as a global guidance cue for attraction to the midline. Moreover, floor plate-mediated chemorepulsion may also operate generally to direct dorsal migrations, but its molecular basis may involve both netrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms."

On the basis of preliminary insights into this theory, Einstein had already derived the basic features of the lensing effect. When he finally published the very same results 24 years later, it was only in response to prodding by an amateur scientist."

Interferograms spanning up to 3.12 years also include signatures of plate spreading and indicate that the plate boundary is locked at a depth of about 5 kilometers. Below that depth, the plate movements are accommodated by continuous ductile deformation, which is not fully balanced by inflow of magma from depth, causing subsidence of the plate boundary of about 6.5 millimeters per year."
https://openalex.org/W1992799801,"A nonsense suppression method was employed to incorporate a total of four natural and six unnatural residues at the 9' position of the M2 region in the beta, gamma, and delta subunits of muscle nicotinic receptors. In 33 pairwise comparisons of functional properties as influenced by structural features including side chain length, branching, and substitution of oxygen for methylene carbons, it is concluded that increased polarity in the side chains at the 9' position consistently increases the sensitivity to acetylcholine. In addition, the stereochemistry of the side chain can have marked influences on the EC50, primarily because of changes in the single-channel open time. For the case of isoleucine versus allo-isoleucine in the delta subunit, these changes are themselves modified by mutations at the 9' position in other subunits. The data suggest an especially strong interaction between the beta and delta subunits in the pore region, leading in turn to a suggested arrangement of subunits within the pentamer."
