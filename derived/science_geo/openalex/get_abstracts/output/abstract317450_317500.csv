Shear strain parallel to the fault has accumulated monotonically since November 1980, but at a variable rate. Improvements in measurement precision and temporal resolution over those of previous geodetic studies near Palmdale have resulted in the definition of a time history of crustal deformation that is much more complex than formerly realized."

The anterior end of the cell is elongated to form a barrel; the wall at the mouth is invaginated deep into the cell to form a bore. A walled chamber at the base of the bore houses a complex, missile-like attack apparatus. The projectile is fired from the gun cell at high speed to accomplish initial penetration of the host."

After a brief account of Born's earlier involvements with quantum physics, including his bringing the new mechanics to the United States, the motivation for and contents of Born's two papers are discussed. The reaction of his colleagues is described."

If these projects are successful, which appears likely, advanced economic and military research in the United States may become dependent on access to supercomputers of foreign manufacture."

In addition, the development of sensitive emission and absorption detection methods and the advent of picosecond Raman and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy make possible the direct observaton of picosecond transient spectra and lifetimes. The information obtained allows the complete determination of mechanisms through the identification of transient states, radicals, and ions that evolve during the course of a chemical or biological reaction."

The action of amino acids appears to be synergistic rather than additive. Methionine is essential for the enhancement. Threonine and methionine sulfoxide facilitate the effect of methionine following a reciprocal quantitative relationship."

A summary is made of the role played by Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG) in space efforts, and then RTG's advantages and disadvantages are compared to those of nuclear reactors. The history of the US government's support for the research necessary for space applications is also summarized, emphasizing the delicate, controversial political environment that influences legislation and funding."

The preliminary data at hand, although not of a definite nature, would seem to indicate that some factor or factors of the corn used were responsible or at least contributory to this disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2088068376,"The writer is embarrassed by his discovery that in revising a manuscript entitled ""Chronic Intermittent Anoxia and Impairment of Peripheral Vision,"" an important paragraph was inadvertently omitted from the version which appeared in Science for June 15, 1945. In checking back it becomes evident that the omission arose in the author's final copy, and that the editors of Science are in no way responsible. The paragraph which should have been inserted between the two paragraphs of column 2, page 615, is as follows: Serial determinations of alveolar gas tensions for each visual test day were carried out on sixteen of the twenty subjects by Dr. Wright Adams, but no relationship could be established with the impairment of peripheral vision. Similarly, in a smaller number of subjects no clear relationship could be established between the visual effect and renal vascular changes (Dr. Alf S. Alving), cardio-vascular changes (Dr. Emmet B. Bay), blood chemistry (Dr. Guzmán E. S. Barrón), psychiatric changes (Dr. Hugh T. Carmichael), electroencephalograms (Dr. Theodore Case), peripheral blood flow (Dr. Milton Landowne), certain metabolic effects (Drs. Henry T. Ricketts and A. Hughes Bryan), and certain additional neuropsychological indicators. Through omission of the above paragraph, inadequate representation was given to the scope of the total war research project in which the psychological studies carried out by the writer constituted one aspect. In addition to their particular lines of investigation, each of the above men contributed generously of specialized knowledge and of time and energy to insure adequate clinical supervision of the experimental subjects and a valid interpretation of the impairment of peripheral vision as reported."
