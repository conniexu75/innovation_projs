https://openalex.org/W2168190474,"As video-game playing has become a ubiquitous activity in today's society, it is worth considering its potential consequences on perceptual and motor skills. It is well known that exposing an organism to an altered visual environment often results in modification of the visual system of the organism. The field of perceptual learning provides many examples of training-induced increases in performance. But perceptual learning, when it occurs, tends to be specific to the trained task; that is, generalization to new tasks is rarely found1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we show, by contrast, that action-video-game playing is capable of altering a range of visual skills. Four experiments establish changes in different aspects of visual attention in habitual video-game players as compared with non-video-game players. In a fifth experiment, non-players trained on an action video game show marked improvement from their pre-training abilities, thereby establishing the role of playing in this effect."

But it has been difficult to separate these two influences because both tend to increase the daily mean surface temperature. The impact of urbanization has been estimated by comparing observations in cities with those in surrounding rural areas, but the results differ significantly depending on whether population data or satellite measurements of night light are used to classify urban and rural areas. Here we use the difference between trends in observed surface temperatures in the continental United States and the corresponding trends in a reconstruction of surface temperatures determined from a reanalysis of global weather over the past 50 years, which is insensitive to surface observations, to estimate the impact of land-use changes on surface warming. Our results suggest that half of the observed decrease in diurnal temperature range is due to urban and other land-use changes. Moreover, our estimate of 0.27 degrees C mean surface warming per century due to land-use changes is at least twice as high as previous estimates based on urbanization alone."

Here we show that Tat fusion proteins are internalized by the cells through a temperature-dependent endocytic pathway that originates from cell membrane lipid rafts and follows caveolar endocytosis. These conclusions are supported by the study of the slow kinetics of the internalization of Tat endosomes, by their resistance to nonionic detergents, the colocalization of internalized Tat with markers of caveolar endocytosis, and the impairment of the internalization process by drugs that disrupt lipid rafts or disturb caveolar trafficking. These results are of interest for all those who exploit Tat as a vehicle for transcellular protein delivery.

The Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LTR, long terminal repeat; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine-isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin. is a powerful transcriptional activator of viral gene expression. At the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, the protein binds a cis-acting RNA element (trans-activation-responsive region) present at the 5′-end of each viral transcript (1Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Through this interaction Tat activates HIV-1 transcription by promoting the assembly of transcriptionally active complexes at the LTR by multiple protein-protein interactions (for review, see Refs. 2Marcello A. Zoppe M. Giacca M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 3Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Besides its fundamental role in the control of HIV-1 gene expression, more than 10 years ago it was first demonstrated that Tat also possesses the unusual property of entering the cells and translocating to the nucleus when present in the extracellular environment (4Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 5Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O.

This unusual characteristic depends upon the integrity of the basic region of the protein, a nine-amino acid, arginine-rich sequence that also corresponds to the nuclear localization signal and the trans-activation-responsive region binding domain of the protein (2Marcello A. Zoppe M. Giacca M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The property of Tat to cross cell membranes is common to a small group of proteins that also includes the herpesvirus structural protein VP22 (7Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), the homeotic protein of Drosophila melanogaster Antennapedia (8Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), and the fibroblast growth factor (9Jans D.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as well as several toxins of bacterial and plant origin. In most cases, the cellular mechanisms that these proteins use for cellular penetration are still poorly understood and are most probably different. The mounting interest in the cell-penetrating capacity of these proteins is due to their ability to drive the internalization of large protein cargoes that are chemically coupled or fused to them. In particular, the addition of an 11-amino acid stretch from the basic domain of Tat (10Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) or the cross-link of Tat (11Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) to heterologous molecules, even of a large size, mediates their cellular uptake; this property is currently widely exploited as a biotechnological tool for transcellular protein transduction. In the case of Tat, it has been demonstrated that the intraperitoneal injection of a 120-kDa β-galactosidase/Tat fusion protein results in the transcellular transduction into virtually all tissues in mice, including the passage of the blood-brain barrier (12Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the translocating activity of the Tat basic domain is now being extensively utilized for several therapeutic applications, including protection from apoptosis in the brain (13Asoh S. Ohsawa I. Mori T. Katsura K. Hiraide T. Katayama Y. Kimura M. Ozaki D. Yamagata K. Ohta S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17107-17112Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Cao G.

Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), to name but a few of the current applications. In addition, the Tat transduction domain has also been shown to mediate cell internalization of large molecules or particles, including magnetic nanoparticles (22Lewin M. Carlesso N. Tung C.H. Tang X.W. Cory D. Scadden D.T. Weissleder R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), phage vectors (23Eguchi A. Akuta T. Okuyama H. Senda T. Yokoi H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Despite this variety of successful biotechnological applications of Tat as a delivery vector across cell membranes, the cellular mechanisms involved in the uptake of wild type HIV-1 Tat and of Tat fusion proteins are still obscure. We have previously observed that extracellular Tat specifically interacts with the heparan sulfate chains of cell membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (26Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Spillmann D. Tanghetti E. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28198-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and that this interaction is absolutely required for the uptake process to occur (27Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). These results together with the observation that the internalization of large molecules fused to Tat is impaired at 4 °C suggest that the interaction of Tat with HSPGs is followed by an active endocytic process. Endocytosis is a complex mechanism that involves different pathways and a large network of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. The first and best-characterized pathway is clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which starts on the plasma membrane with the formation of clathrin-coated invaginations that pinch off to make up clathrin-coated vesicles (28Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Less defined are the non-classical, clathrin-independent pathways, among which is caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Caveolae are flask-shaped, small (50–70 nm) invaginations in the plasma membrane that constitute a subclass of detergent-resistant membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that are called lipid rafts (29Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Caveolae are involved in signal transduction and the intracellular transportation of lipid raft-associated molecules, whereas proteins internalized by the clathrin pathway, such as transferrin, are excluded from these membrane domains (30Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 31Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). Several bacterial toxins, including cholera toxin (32Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and some viruses, including SV40 (33Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), make use of caveolar endocytosis to enter the cells. Here we show that extracellular proteins containing full-length Tat or the Tat transduction domain are internalized through an active endocytic pathway originating from cell membrane lipid rafts and involving caveolar endocytosis. These results are of relevance for all those applications that exploit Tat as a vehicle for transcellular protein transduction. Antibodies and Fluorescent Markers—Antibodies against early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and caveolin-1 were from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Secondary Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse antibody, TRITC-labeled transferrin, Alexa Fluor 594-labeled cholera toxin subunit B, TRITC-labeled M r 10,000 dextran, and Lysotracker Red were all from Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cell Cultures—HL3T1 cells (a HeLa cell derivative stably transfected with a silent LTR-CAT cassette), a kind gift of B. Felber (34Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Science. 1988; 239: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and HeLa and Cos-1 cells (both obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Jurkat T-cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Recombinant Tat Proteins—The plasmid expressing the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Tat11-EGFP fusion protein was obtained by replacing the Tat86-coding region in the GST-Tat86-EGFP plasmid (27Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) with the sequence encoding for amino acids 48–58 in the basic domain of Tat. The recombinant GST-Tat86-EGFP and GST-Tat11-EGFP fusion proteins were produced and purified as described (27Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—For treatment with the different fluorescent proteins, HeLa and Cos-1 cells were grown on chamber slides (Labtech International, Woodside, UK) to about 60% confluence; Jurkat cells were treated in suspension cultures. After a 30-min incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fresh, serum-free medium supplemented with Hepes 25 mm (pH 7.2) and containing the different fluorescent molecules was added. Final concentrations were 2 μg/ml recombinant Tat86-EGFP and Tat11-EGFP, 10 μg/ml transferrin-TRITC, 10 μg/ml cholera toxin B-subunit, 50 nm Lysotracker Red, and 0.1 mg/ml dextran-TRITC. At the different time points indicated in each figure, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed and incubated with glycine 100 mm in PBS for 5 min and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Lysotracker Red was added 30 min before fixation. For immuno-staining, fixed cells were washed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with antibodies in PBS supplemented with 0.15% glycine and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Images were obtained by confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV300 microscope. For live cell recording, cells plated on 6-cm glass bottom dishes were placed in a humidified Plexiglas chamber and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 throughout the experiment. For the fast dynamics recording and co-localization experiments cells were imaged using a TCS-SP laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Treatment with Triton X-100 —Cells were incubated with either Tat86-EGFP or Tat11-EGFP together with labeled transferrin for 1 h, washed, and left in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Drug Treatments—Cells were pretreated with the different drugs (5 μm cytochalasin D, 20 μm nocodazole, 20 μm taxol, 10 μm brefeldin A, 10 μg/ml heparin, 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin) for 30 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then recombinant proteins in fresh serum-free medium containing the same inhibitors were added. Cells were then processed at different time points (1 h for fluorescence microscopy and 8 h for flow cytometry and competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis). Flow Cytometry—Quantification of internalized Tat-EGFP recombinant proteins was performed as already described (27Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well plates to about 60% confluence and incubated with Tat86-EGFP, Tat11-EGFP, or labeled transferrin for the time points indicated in the figures. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, again washed with PBS, washed with 2 m NaCl to completely take off surface-bound proteins, again washed twice with PBS, and finally, analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Competitive PCR—The day before treatment, 2.5 × 105 HL3T1 cells were plated on 6-cm-diameter dishes. Cells were incubated with recombinant Tat86-EGFP protein (or Tat11-EGFP control; 2 μg/ml) as described (27Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). After incubation, cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). After treatment with DNase I amplification grade (Invitrogen), 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript™ II RNase H reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Competitive PCR was performed by mixing the cDNA obtained in previous step with a fixed amount of a competitor DNA molecule containing the primers for amplification of the β-actin RNA (BA1 and BA4) and of the CAT RNA (CATupper and CATlower) (35Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with 1/25 and 1/250 of the cDNA for the CAT and β-actin amplifications, respectively. For both primers, the PCR profiles were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles of amplification. Amplification products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified. To study the molecular pathway involved in the internalization of extracellular Tat, we obtained two recombinant proteins, each one containing the GST protein at the N terminus, the enhanced variant of the green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the C terminus, and in between, either the 86-amino acid form of Tat or only its 11-amino acid transduction domain (GST-Tat86-EGFP and GST-Tat11-EGFP, respectively, hereafter named Tat86-EGFP and Tat11-EGFP; Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that the former protein retains full transcriptional activity on the viral LTR and is efficiently internalized by different cell types when added to the extracellular medium of these cells (27Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Tat Internalization—The kinetics of cellular internalization of the two Tat fusions is shown comparatively in Fig. 1 together with the kinetics of internalization of recombinant TRITC-labeled transferrin. The three proteins were added to the cell culture medium of human HeLa epithelial cells at a concentration of 2 μg/ml, and cellular fluorescence was quantitatively assessed at different time points by flow cytometry after cell treatment with trypsin to remove any protein adsorbed to the cell surface. Analysis of the flow cytometry profiles and of the mean cellular fluorescence values (shown in Fig. 1) clearly indicates that the kinetics of internalization of transferrin and of Tat fusion proteins is remarkably different. Transferrin is internalized rapidly, with >80% of maximum fluorescence already obtained after 15 min of incubation. In contrast, internalization of both the Tat86 and Tat11 proteins is slower and progresses in the first 10 h, after which it reaches a plateau, which persists for at least up to 20 h. There was no difference noticed between Tat86-EGFP and Tat11-EGFP. A microscopic analysis of cells treated with the three proteins (inset in the graphs of Fig. 1) indicated that fluorescence was localized to discrete compartments in the cytoplasm, suggestive of internalization by an endocytic process. This observation is consistent with a number of reports from our laboratory as well as from other laboratories which showed that the internalization of large protein cargoes fused or conjugated to Tat is an energy-dependent process, that it does not occur at 4 °C, and that is sensitive to drugs blocking endocytosis (36Silhol M. Tyagi M. Giacca M. Lebleu B. Vives E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar); see also Figs. 5 and 6. The cellular internalization of Tat by endocytosis was further corroborated by the observations that both extracellular Tat11-EGFP and Tat86-EGFPs were found to be internalized in discrete vesicles when mixed together with labeled M r 10,000 dextran, a fluid phase marker, before the addition to the cell medium (shown in Fig. 2A for Tat11-EGFP).Fig. 6Drugs affecting caveolar endocytosis impair Tat transactivation. A, Tat86-EGFP was added to the cell culture medium of HL3T1 cells (bearing silently integrated LTR-CAT construct), and at the indicated time points, the transcripts of the LTR-CAT reporter gene were quantified by quantitative competitive PCR. Cellular RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, mixed to a competitor DNA bearing primer recognition sequences for the CAT gene and for the cellular β-actin reference gene, and PCR-amplified. The two figures show representative competitive PCR amplifications for the two cDNA species (comp, competitor). On the bottom of each lane, the ratio between the amounts of the two amplification products is reported. The table on the bottom of panel A reports the levels of Tat-induced LTR transactivation at the different time points. B, the histogram shows the effects of drug treatments on the Tat86-EGFP transactivation activity. The effects were calculated as percent of changes in fold transactivation for each experiment; shown are the means and S.D. of three independent experiments. n.d., not done.

Note that the two recombinant proteins are internalized in distinct structures inside the cells. The same localization pattern was also found in the cells incubated with Tat86-EGFP (E). C and G, Tat11-EGFP and Tat86-EGFP did not colocalize with the early endosome marker EEA1 (detected by indirect immunofluorescence) in HeLa cells.

Transferrin is known to be internalized from clathrin-coated invaginations on the plasma membrane that eventually detaches to form clathrin-coated vesicles (28Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Maturation and trafficking of a vast proportion of these endosomes eventually leads to their fusion with cell lysosomes. To assess whether this might also be the case of Tat endosomes, we mixed Tat11-EGFP to TRITC-labeled transferrin and added the two proteins to the culture medium of HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, both proteins appeared in discrete intracellular endosomes at different time points after treatment; however, these compartments were clearly distinguishable. Additionally, at earlier time points (10 and 30 min), although transferrin-containing endosomes were dispersed all through the cytoplasm and enriched in the perinuclear recycling compartment, Tat endosomes were still localized to the cell periphery, consistent with the different kinetics of endocytosis shown in Fig. 1. The involvement of clathrin-coated endosomes in Tat internalization was further ruled out by the observation that internalized Tat does not co-localize with the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), a protein associated with early endosomes (Fig. 2C). Finally, endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles is known to involve progressive endosome maturation and eventual fusion with the cell lysosome. Therefore, we tested the possible co-localization of internalized fluorescent Tat with Lysotracker, a marker for cell lysosomes. As shown in Fig. 2D, at all the analyzed time points, Tat and lysosome fluorescence appeared in vesicles that were clearly distinct. These results are shown in Fig. 2, A–D, for the Tat11-EGFP molecule; those obtained with the Tat86-EGFP protein were superimposable, as shown in Fig. 2, E–G, for selected time points. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that Tat is not internalized by endocytosis in clathrincoated endosomes. Tat Endocytosis Occurs from Cell Membrane Lipid Rafts— Similar to other microbial toxins (37Falnes P.O. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the active fraction of cholera toxin is the one internalized by clathrin-independent endocytosis from lipid rafts (38Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), cell membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipid. To assess whether this might be the case also for our Tat fusions, we tested their co-localization with the labeled B-subunit of cholera toxin. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively, more than 80% of both Tat11-EGFP- and Tat86-EGFP endosomes also contained the cholera toxin. One group of cell membranes that have lipid raft properties are caveolae, typical flask-shaped membrane invaginations defined by a distinctive membrane coat composed of the cholesterol-binding protein caveolin-1 (39Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Tat endosomes were also positive for the presence of caveolin-1. As shown in Fig. 3C, in Cos-1 cells, which are known to express caveolin-1, a large proportion of endosomes proved positive for both caveolin-1 and Tat11-EGFP. Lipid rafts are operationally defined by their insolubility in nonionic detergents. Thus, we tested the effect of Triton X-100 on cells that had previously (1 h earlier) internalized both Tat and transferrin. The detergent completely solubilized the transferrin endosomes, whereas those containing either Tat11-EGFP or Tat86-EGFP remained unaffected (shown in Fig. 3, D and E, respectively). Finally, to further corroborate the conclusion that the internalization of extracellular Tat occurs from cell membrane lipid rafts, we treated cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a drug that extracts cholesterol from cell membranes, thus disrupting lipid rafts. As show in Fig. 3, F and G, for Tat86-EGFP and Tat11-EGFP, respectively, in cells treated with MβCD, endocytosis of Tat was clearly impaired, and a peculiar fluorescence pattern was visualized marking the cell membrane. No internalized fluorescent endosomes were evident. In contrast, internalization of transferrin was not affected by the drug. As an additional indication that Tat uptake involves caveolar endocytosis, we comparatively analyzed internalization of Tat, transferrin, and cholera toxin B in living cells by time lapse confocal microscopy. Tat86-EGFP was mixed to either transferrin-TRITC or to CtxB-Alexa 594 and added to the culture medium of HeLa cells. After 30 min, fluorescence of endosomes was visualized at 10-s intervals. Fig. 4 shows one confocal plane for each experiment, with images taken for a total of 40 s. In cells exposed to Tat and transferrin (panel A), the localization of the endosomes containing Tat appeared unchanged during this time frame, in sharp contrast to the relative mobility of transferrin-containing endosomes. In cells treated with Tat and cholera toxin B (panel B), endosomes containing both proteins again were relatively immobile, whereas the localization of a subset of endosomes containing only cholera toxin B changed over time; internalization of cholera toxin B is known to occur, in part, also in clathrin-coated endosomes (38Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with the notion that the velocity at which caveolar endocytosis proceeds is remarkably slower than that of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (40Wacker I. Kaether C. Kromer A. Migala A. Almers W. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internalization of fluorescent Tat in the presence of different cell treatments was also quantitatively addressed by flow cytometry and compared with the internalization of labeled transferrin. As shown in Fig. 5A, Tat uptake in HeLa cells was blocked at 4 °C (as expected for an active endocytosis process) and by treatment with heparin (a soluble competitor of cell membrane-"
https://openalex.org/W2029502542,"Rhomboid proteins are intramembrane serine proteases that activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling in Drosophila. Rhomboids are conserved throughout evolution, and even in eukaryotes their existence in species with no EGFRs implies that they must have additional roles. Here we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two rhomboids, which we have named Rbd1p and Rbd2p. RBD1 deletion results in a respiratory defect; consistent with this, Rbd1p is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and mutant cells have disrupted mitochondria. We have identified two substrates of Rbd1p: cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1p); and a dynamin-like GTPase (Mgm1p), which is involved in mitochondrial membrane fusion. Rbd1p mutants are indistinguishable from Mgm1p mutants, indicating that Mgm1p is a key substrate of Rbd1p and explaining the rbd1Delta mitochondrial phenotype. Our data indicate that mitochondrial membrane remodelling is regulated by cleavage of Mgm1p and show that intramembrane proteolysis by rhomboids controls cellular processes other than signalling. In addition, mitochondrial rhomboids are conserved throughout eukaryotes and the mammalian homologue, PARL, rescues the yeast mutant, suggesting that these proteins represent a functionally conserved subclass of rhomboid proteases."

https://openalex.org/W2067988300,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from early mammalian embryos. Their immortality and rapid growth make them attractive sources for stem cell therapies; however, they produce tumours (teratomas) when transplanted, which could preclude their therapeutic usage. Why ES cells, which lack chromosomal abnormalities, possess tumour-like properties is largely unknown. Here we show that mouse ES cells specifically express a Ras-like gene, which we have named ERas. We show that human HRasp, which is a recognized pseudogene, does not contain reported base substitutions and instead encodes the human orthologue of ERas. This protein contains amino-acid residues identical to those present in active mutants of Ras and causes oncogenic transformation in NIH 3T3 cells. ERas interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase but not with Raf. ERas-null ES cells maintain pluripotency but show significantly reduced growth and tumorigenicity, which are rescued by expression of ERas complementary DNA or by activated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase. We conclude that the transforming oncogene ERas is important in the tumour-like growth properties of ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138760938,"The packaging of the male haploid genome within the differentiating spermatid nucleus is facilitated by small basic nuclear proteins called protamines. Although the majority of the DNA in human sperm chromatin is bound by these proteins, a small percentage retains a nucleosomal-like component. These histone-enriched regions may possess enhanced nuclease sensitivity and have been postulated to designate certain genes involved in early embryogenesis. We have shown previously that the chromatin domain containing the two human protamines PRM1 and PRM2 and the transition protein TNP2 forms a DNase I-sensitive conformation in pachytene spermatocytes, a requisite event prior to the haploid expression of its members in round spermatids (Kramer, J. A, McCarrey, J., Djakiew, D., and Krawetz, S. A. (1998) Development 125, 4749–4755). Interestingly, this configuration persists in mature spermatozoa subsequent to the transcriptional silencing of the locus. It was therefore postulated that the retained, enhanced DNase I-sensitive conformation of the PRM1→PRM2→TNP2 domain in human sperm may be preferentially histone-enriched. To address this tenet, we examined the chromatin structure of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain using a PCR-based assay. The results show that this retained, enhanced DNase I sensitive domain reflects an enrichment of histones at discrete regions across the locus. In addition, a similar examination of other genes and repetitive sequences suggests the non-random distribution of histones and protamines within the sperm nucleus.

In addition, a similar examination of other genes and repetitive sequences suggests the non-random distribution of histones and protamines within the sperm nucleus. A discussion of these results and their functional significance is presented. In mammals, the haploid phase of spermatogenesis, termed spermiogenesis, marks the initial expression of the nuclear packaging proteins, the transition proteins, and the protamines (1Steger K. Anat. Embryol. 1999; 199: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These proteins facilitate the molecular remodeling and species-specific compaction of the male genome within the differentiating spermatid nucleus (2Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). There are two types of protamines, i.e. protamine-1, which is found in nearly all mammals (3Queralt R. Adroer R. Oliva R. Winkfein R. Retief J. Dixon G. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and protamine-2, which is confined to relatively few species that include human (4McKay D. Renzaux B. Dixon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), mouse (5Bellvé A. McKay D. Renzuax B. Dixon G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2890-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and stallion (6Pirhonen A. Valtonene P Linnala-Kankuunen A. Heiskanen M. Mäenpää P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to the protamines, several mammalian species retain a nucleohistone component within their sperm chromatin, including human (7Gatewood J. Cook G. Balhorn R. Bradbury E. Schmid C. Science. 1987; 236: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), mouse (8Pittoggii C. Renzi L. Zaccagnini G Cimini D. Degrassi F. Giordano R. Magnano A. Lorenzini R. Lavia P. Spadfora C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3537-3548PubMed Google Scholar), and boar (9Banerjee S. Smallwood A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Proton-induced x-ray emission spectroscopy has been used to examine the relative amounts of protamine in mammalian sperm. The results showed that, although the total amount of protamine remained constant, the relative proportion of each protamine was variable. For example, the relative amount of protamine-2 in human, mouse, and hamster constitutes 67, 34, and 43% of the total protamine, respectively (10Bench G. Friz A. Corzett M. Morse D. Balhorn R. Cytometry. 1996; 23: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This interspecies variability has raised the issue of whether the evolution of a second protamine in mammals is functionally redundant. To address this, the expression of the Prm1 or Prm2 genes was disrupted in mouse embryonic stem cells. The resulting haplo-insufficient chimeras were infertile, displaying nuclear condensation abnormalities. This showed that both protamines were essential for normal sperm development (11Cho C. Willis A. Goulding E. Jung-Ha H. Choi Y. Hecht N. Eddy E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 1: 82-86Google Scholar).The relationship between function and nuclear organization has been well established in somatic cells (12Cremer T. Kreth G. Koester R. Fink H. Heintzmann R. Cremer M. Solove D. Cremer C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2000; 12: 179-212Google Scholar); however, the functional significance of sperm nuclear architecture remains to be clearly defined. Chromosomes within the sperm nucleus are arranged in a hairpin-like structure with the centromeres confined to the interior of the nucleus and the telomeres at the periphery (13Zalensky A. Allen M. Kobayashi A. Zalenskaya I. Balhorn R. Bradbury E. Chromosoma. 1995; 103: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the close proximity of telomeres to the egg's environment renders it one of the first structures to participate in the initial events of male pronuclear formation, immediately subsequent to fertilization (14Zalenskaya I. Bradbury E. Zalensky A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 279: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Similar to the somatic nucleus, the DNA in sperm chromatin is organized into looped domains attached at their bases to the nuclear matrix (15Ward W.S. Partin A. Coffey D. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Studies examining the global configuration of the sperm nucleus have shown that spermatozoa function abnormally with a disrupted nuclear matrix and do not produce viable offspring (16Ward W.S. Kimura Y. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the spatial organization of the male-haploid genome provides important epigenetic information critical for both sperm function and early development (17Sotolongo B. Ward W.S. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2000; 35: 23-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The DNA in human sperm chromatin is partitioned into both a nucleohistone and a nucleoprotamine fraction with 15% of the DNA bound by histones and 85% of the DNA bound by protamines (18Gatewood J. Cook G. Balhorn R. Schmid C. Bradbury E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 20662-20666Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 19Tanphaichitr N. Sobhon P. Taluppeth N. Chalermisarachai P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 117: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In both mouse and human sperm, histones have been localized to the nuclear periphery in association with LINE/L1 elements (8Pittoggii C. Renzi L. Zaccagnini G Cimini D. Degrassi F. Giordano R. Magnano A. Lorenzini R. Lavia P. Spadfora C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3537-3548PubMed Google Scholar) and telomeric sequences, respectively (14Zalenskaya I. Bradbury E. Zalensky A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 279: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the sequence-specific packaging of human sperm chromatin by histones and protamines may also serve to designate a specific subset of early embryonic expressed genes (7Gatewood J. Cook G. Balhorn R. Bradbury E. Schmid C. Science. 1987; 236: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Studies examining the chromatin structure of the β-globin gene cluster in sperm have shown that the embryonic-specific ϵ– and γ-globin genes were histone enriched, whereas the post-natal expressed β-globin gene was protamine enriched (20Gardiner-Garden M. Ballesteros M. Gordon M. Tam P. Mol. Cell, Biol. 1998; 18: 3350-3356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Smallwood A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The two human protamines PRM1 and PRM2 and the transition protein TNP2 are clustered together on chromosome 16p13.13 (21Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2932-2936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that this cluster exists as a single 28.5-kb chromatin domain flanked by two male, germ cell-specific matrix attachment regions (22Choudhary S. Wykes S. Kramer J. Mohammed A. Koppitch F. Nelson J. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11619-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain forms a DNase I-sensitive, potentiated conformation at the pachytene spermatocyte stage, a requisite event prior to the expression of these three genes in round spermatids (24Kramer J.A McCarrey J. Djakiew D. Krawetz S.A. Development. 1998; 125: 4749-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this enhanced DNase I-sensitive configuration is retained in mature spermatozoa (22Choudhary S. Wykes S. Kramer J. Mohammed A. Koppitch F. Nelson J. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In both human (9Banerjee S. Smallwood A. Mol. Reprod.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3537-3548PubMed Google Scholar), increased nuclease sensitivity has been observed to parallel nucleosomal sperm chromatin structure. It was therefore postulated that the retained, enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain in sperm may reflect the preferential association of histones across the locus. To address this tenet, the sperm chromatin from a series of normal, healthy male donors was partitioned into histone or protamine DNA fractions using various restriction enzymes. The distributionofhistonesandprotaminesacrossthehumanPRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain was then assessed using a PCR-based assay. The results showed that discrete restriction fragments are histone-enriched throughout the enhanced DNase I-sensitive locus. Furthermore, the distribution of histones and protamines was consistent within the same sample and between different individuals. This supports the view that the configuration of the genetic material within the sperm nucleus is not random. A discussion of these results and their functional significance is presented.MATERIALS AND METHODSSemen Samples—Human semen samples from normal male donors were provided by the in vitro fertilization clinic, Hutzel Hospital (Detroit, MI). Collection and utilization of these samples were performed in accordance with the Human Investigation Committee at Wayne State University (Institutional Review Board number 095701MP2F). The samples were supplied frozen in test yolk buffer freezing medium supplemented with glycerol (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) and stored at –80 °C until use.Fractionation of Sperm Chromatin—This protocol was adapted from that described by Gardiner-Garden et al. in 1998 (20Gardiner-Garden M. Ballesteros M. Gordon M. Tam P. Mol. Cell, Biol. 1998; 18: 3350-3356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of five fractionations were performed. Semen samples from three individual donors were fractionated by BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease digestion. To assess variation, this procedure was repeated on one individual. An additional sample from a fourth donor was fractionated using PvuII.Approximately 108 sperm were thawed then combined with Trisbuffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl) to a final volume of 25 ml. The sperm were then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The sperm were washed as above two additional times. After washing, the sperm were resuspended in 4 ml of a freshly prepared solution of a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (Amresco, Solon, OH) and then incubated on ice for 15 min. Subsequent to dithiothreitol treatment, 10% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. The sample was then incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. Following incubation, an aliquot was removed and examined using bright field microscopy to verify the complete removal of the tails. The sperm were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% digitonin (Sigma). The sperm nuclei were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. This washing procedure was repeated four additional times. Subsequent to washing, the sperm nuclei were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.65 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% digitonin and then incubated on ice for 15 min. Following histone extraction, the nuclei were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Extraction of the histone component under these conditions was independently confirmed by immunofluorescence using both histone and protamine antibodies. The extracted pellet of nuclei was then washed in 1 ml of the appropriate 1× restriction enzyme buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.05% digitonin and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and then the final pellet resuspended in 1 ml of the digitonin-supplemented restriction buffer. The exposed histone-free DNA was then cleaved by digestion with 100 units each of BamH1 plus EcoR1 or 100 units of PvuII (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at 37 °C with gentle rocking. Subsequent to digestion, the cleaved histone-enriched DNA was separated from the protamine-bound DNA by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the histone-enriched DNA was then transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove any contaminating protamine-bound DNA. The pellets containing the protamine-bound DNA were then combined and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. The protamine-bound DNA and histone-enriched DNA fractions were then incubated overnight at 50 °C following the addition of 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen). Subsequent to proteinase K treatment, the fractionated DNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNAs were then resuspended in sterile distilled H2O supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA. The protamineenriched DNA was again digested as above and then purified by organic extraction and ethanol precipitation. The relative concentration of both the purified histone-enriched and protamine-enriched DNA was then spectrophotometrically determined.PCR Amplification—The distribution of histones and protamines across the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain was evaluated using various primer pairs to specific regions contained within unique restriction fragments across the locus. In addition to the protamine domain, several other loci including acrosin, β-globin, and IGF-2 as well as Alu, telomeric, and centromeric sequences were evaluated. Primer sequences are shown in Table I. Equal amounts of template were used for PCR, and each reaction was performed in triplicate to ensure that the differences observed were attributed to the biology and not the variation in PCR efficiency. PCR was performed within the linear range of amplification.Table IPrimers specific to the PRM1→PRM2→TNP2 domain and other primersSequence (5′ to 3′)PositionAmplicon (bp)TemperatureC°Domain-specific primersiFwd GGGAGGCTGACGTAGG8955-912416955Rev CTCTGGGCTGTGACATTCiiFwd CCCAGCAGGGCACATATCC10,621-10,88126050Rev TTGGCACTGGCGATTAGAAAiiiFwd CCTTTGCCCTCACAATGAC14,873-15,08020855Rev GGTAATATCTGCTCCGGCTCTivFwd AGGCAAGGCAAGGGGGTCTCT19,802-20,04144160Rev TGGCCATGGGTCCTCTCGTAGvFwd CAGTGGCTGAGGTGTGAGTTA22,514-23,10759360Rev CGTGGGGCCAGAAGGGATAGGviFwd GGAAACCCAAAGACTAGAAG25,943-26,12418260Rev TTGGAAACCCGTCTCTviiFwd AAACGTGGCCTCCTATGGACA26,975-27,21423960Rev GTGTTGGGACTCTGGCTCTGGTviiiFwd CTTGTTCCTGCGTGTTTC28,291-28,65336350Rev CGTGTTCTTGGGCTACATACixFwd GTGTGGCTTATGGACCTACC31,956-32,25229655Rev ATTGTGAGTGCTTGCCTACAxFwd ATGGCCTCGCACGACAATC38,926-39,23330750Rev ATCTGGCCTTCCCGGTCTTCOther primersActinFwd AACACCCCAGCCATGTACG25460Rev ATGTCACGCACGATTTCCCGlobinFwd CAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC26860Rev GAAGAGCCAAGGACAGGTACAcrosinFwd CCCCCACCTACACCCTCATC20260Rev TGAAGGGCTCACTGGGTCTGIGF2Fwd GACGCTGCTTGGGGCTAAAGT43360Rev ACCGCTCATGCTTGAAAACGCAluFwd CCCCCACCTACACCCTCATC20260Rev CGGGTTCACGCCATTCTCCCentromereFwd TGCAAGTGGAGATTTCAAG15655Rev GGGTTTCCAGAATGCTGTATelomereFwd AAAGCTCTCAGAACCTCCCC22155Rev AGAGGTTCCCATGTAGTTCC Open table in a new tab Southern Hybridization Analysis—PCR products were resolved on agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and then analyzed by Southern hybridization analysis using the respective [α-32P]dCTP-labeled (Amersham Biosciences) PCR products as probes. The membranes were hybridized at 45 °C overnight in 5× SSPE buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 106 dpm/ml of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed at room temperature in 2× SSPE containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min. The membranes were then transferred to a circulating bath at 50 °C containing 0.1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS and washed for 15 min. Subsequent to washing, the hybridized signal was visualized by autoradiography.Computational Analysis—Autoradiographic images were quantitated using the Millipore 60 S version 3.0 whole band image analysis system. The intensity of the hybridized signal was determined, and the mean integrated values were standardized to the GC content of each PCR amplicon. This was defined as the relative optical density (ROD). The mean intensity for each cycle for all similarly fractionated samples was then determined and plotted as a function of cycle number. Statistical data analysis was performed using a paired t test. Repetitive elements within the PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain were identified using the CENSOR server at charon.girinst.org.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo examine the sperm chromatin structure of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain, four different semen samples were individually partitioned into BamH1 and EcoR1 histone and protamine-enriched DNA fractions. DNA was subsequently isolated and purified from each fraction, and equal amounts of template were used for PCR. The distribution of histones and protamines across the PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain was then assessed by PCR using primers (designated i–x) to specific regions within unique BamH1/EcoR1 fragments for each of the four histone/protamine-purified samples from three individuals. For each sample, PCR was performed in triplicate and remained within the linear range. The PCR products were subsequently analyzed by Southern analysis using the respective [α-32P]dCTP-labeled PCR products as probes. Autoradiographic images were quantitated by densitometric analysis, and the mean integrated intensity values were plotted for the four samples from the three individuals as a function of each cycle. The statistical significance of the mean intensity difference between the two fractions for all four fractionated samples was assessed using a paired t test. A statistically significant difference was considered indicative of a histone or protamineenriched segment. These results are summarized in Fig. 1. As shown, the BamHI/EcoRI restriction fragments interrogated with primer sets i, iv, vii, and x were histone-enriched when the distribution of histones, as indicated by the open circles (p ≤ 0.05) in Fig. 1, was compared with that of the protamines (Fig. 1, filled squares). In contrast, BamHI/EcoRI restriction fragments interrogated with primer sets ii and iii were protamine-enriched, as indicated by the filled protamine squares (p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 1) in comparison to the open histone circles (Fig. 1). The remaining fragments interrogated by primer sets v, vi, viii, and ix were evenly distributed among the histone and protamine DNA fractions, as the data clearly overlapped. This likely reflects a mixture of histones and protamines throughout these regions. The distribution of histones and protamines that spanned the locus was similar between three different individuals and between different same sample preparations from the same individual for all ten regions examined. This supports the view that histones and protamines are uniquely distributed across the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain in sperm.A similar study examining the chromatin structure of the human PRM2 gene (Figs. 1 and 2, amplicon iv) in sperm from two individuals reported histone enrichment for one subject and protamine enrichment for the other subject (20Gardiner-Garden M. Ballesteros M. Gordon M. Tam P. Mol. Cell, Biol. 1998; 18: 3350-3356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy was attributed to a restriction site polymorphism. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, the distribution of histones and protamines across regions i–viii of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain were evaluated using PvuII-fractionated sperm DNA. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. Regions ix and x were not evaluated, because PvuII bisects these amplicons. As shown, similar to the results of the respective BamH1/EcoR1 fractionation, regions v, vi, and viii displayed no enrichment. In contrast to their corresponding BamH1/EcoR1 results, regions i, ii, iv, vii, and ix also showed no enrichment indicating a mixture of histones and protamines within these PvuII fragments. Interestingly, region iii was protamine-enriched as a 5-kb BamH1/EcoR1 fragment but was histone-enriched (p ≤ 0.025) within the 387-bp PvuII sub-fragment. These results further support the view that the deposition of histones and protamines is ordered over discrete and specific regions.Fig. 2Histone and protamine fractionation using PvuII. Human sperm were partitioned into histone- or protamine-enriched DNA fractions using PvuII restriction endonuclease. The distribution of histones (open circles) and protamines (closed boxes) across the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain was then assessed by PCR using primers to the specific regions, i–x, contained within these restriction fragments as a function of relative optical density. This was calculated as the mean hybridization signal, expressed as a function of the GC content of the probe. The PvuII fragment containing region iii was histone-enriched (open circles, p ≤ 0.05). The distribution of histones (open circles) and protamines (closed boxes) in the remaining regions overlapped, indicating a mixture of histones and protamines. Regions ix and x were not evaluated in the PvuII-fractionated samples because of the coincidence of a PvuII cleavage site within these amplicons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A comparative summary showing the distribution of histones and protamines across the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain and the locus is presented in Fig. 3A. The DNase I-sensitive region encompassing the three PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 genes is flanked by two DNase I-insensitive regions proximal to the two male germ cell-specific matrix attachment regions that designate the physical boundaries of this domain (23Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11619-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The summarized fractionation data of Fig. 3B show that the bulk of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain appears to contain a mixture of histones and protamines. Interestingly there is specific histone-enrichment in association with the relative DNase I-insensitive 5′ PRM spMAR region and the DNase I-sensitive promoter regions of the PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 genes. In addition, histone-enrichment was also observed in association with the CpG island and the DNase I-insensitive SOCS-1 MAR located immediately downstream of the PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain. This suggests that, in human sperm, relative DNase I sensitivity does not reflect its histone/protamine status.Fig. 3The DNase I-sensitive PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain in human sperm and the preferential deposition of histones across the locus. The enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 domain (A) and the distribution of histones and protamines across this region of human chromosome 16p13.13 (B) are shown. There is a marked histone enrichment (open box) in association with the 5′ PRM spMAR and the promoter regions for each of the three PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 genes.

This included the acrosin, β-globin, and IGF-2 genes as well as the Alu, centromeric, and telomeric regions, respectively. All were similarly evaluated using the identical four BamH1/EcoR1 fractionated samples. These results are summarized in Fig. 4.

Long term culture of MCF-7 cells in estrogen (E2)-depleted medium (long term estrogen deprivation; LTED) results in hypersensitivity to E2 coinciding with elevated levels of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha phosphorylated on Ser118 and MAPK, together with several of its downstream targets associated previously with ERalpha phosphorylation. Our data suggest elevated MAPK activity results from enhanced ERBB2 expression in the LTED cells versus the wild-type (wt), and treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 revealed increased sensitivity in both transcription and proliferation assays. Similarly the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased transcription and proliferation in the LTED cells and reduced their sensitivity to the proliferative effects of E2, while having no effect on the wt. However, the complete suppression of MAPK activity in the LTED cells did not inhibit ERalpha Ser118 phosphorylation suggesting that ER activity remained ligand-dependant. The LTED cells also expressed elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor-1R, and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity with LY294002 reduced basal ERalpha transactivation by 70% in the LTED cells compared with the wt. However, LY294002 had no effect on ERalpha Ser118 phosphorylation. These data suggest that although elevated levels of MAPK occur during LTED and influence the phenotype, this is unlikely to be the sole pathway operating to achieve adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2166210136,"Dwarf galaxies have attracted increased attention in recent years, because of their susceptibility to galaxy transformation processes within rich galaxy clusters. Direct evidence for these processes, however, has been difficult to obtain, with a small number of diffuse light trails and intra-cluster stars being the only signs of galaxy disruption. Furthermore, our current knowledge of dwarf galaxy populations may be very incomplete, because traditional galaxy surveys are insensitive to extremely diffuse or compact galaxies. Aware of these concerns, we recently undertook an all-object survey of the Fornax galaxy cluster. This revealed a new population of compact members, overlooked in previous conventional surveys. Here we demonstrate that these 'ultra-compact' dwarf galaxies are structurally and dynamically distinct from both globular star clusters and known types of dwarf galaxy, and thus represent a new class of dwarf galaxy. Our data are consistent with the interpretation that these are the remnant nuclei of disrupted dwarf galaxies, making them an easily observed tracer of galaxy disruption."

Plastocyanin transfers electrons from cytochrome b 6/f to PSI (1Redinbo M.R. Yeates T.O. Merchant S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and in cyanobacteria and some algae, plastocyanin can be replaced by the heme protein cytochrome c 6 (2Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B.

The familiar idea that in higher plants only plastocyanin operates as a mobile electron donor to PSI has recently been challenged. Arabidopsis thaliana lines in which both of the plastocyanin-coding genes, PetE1 and PetE2, had been silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) were viable, whereas plastocyanin-RNAi lines that in addition lacked a cytochrome c 6-like protein did not survive (4Gupta R. He Z. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). From these data, it was concluded that in higher plants neither plastocyanin nor cytochrome c 6 is essential for plant growth and development but that both proteins can transport electrons from cytochrome b 6/f to PSI. Plastocyanin-null mutants have been identified and characterized in several cyanobacterial and algal species (2Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol.

Accordingly, Chlamydomonas cells mutated for plastocyanin only perform photosynthesis when cytochrome c 6 expression is induced by making the cells deficient for copper (3Merchant S. Bogorad L.

Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53693) Google Scholar) containing 2% sucrose. Transposon insertions within PetE1 and PetE2 were identified by screening the En-tagged population using gene-specific primers in combination with En-specific primers followed by hybridization with a gene-specific probe as described previously (12Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Meurer J. Oelmuller R. Steiner-Lange S. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive lines were confirmed by sequencing PCR-amplified insertion sites. The stable frameshift mutants pete1-1.1 and pete2-1.1 were identified according to Varotto et al. (13Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Jahns P. Leβnick A. Tizzano M. Schiavon F. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 2002; 129: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the double mutant pete1-1.1 pete2-1.1 was generated by crossing the single mutants. Complementation of the pete1 pete2 Double Mutant—The PetE2 and Atc6 cDNAs were introduced by recombination cloning (Gateway, Invitrogen) into the plant expression vector pJAN33, placing them under the transcriptional control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter. In addition, a genomic fragment containing PetE2 and 1000 and 500 bp of DNA 5′ and 3′ to the gene, respectively, were introduced by recombination cloning into the vector pP001VS-GW. Flowers of pete1-1.1/pete1-1.1 PetE2/pete2-1.1 plants were transformed according to Clough and Bent (14Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plants were transferred to the greenhouse, and seeds were collected after 3 weeks. At least 200 independent transgenic plants were selected on the basis of their resistance to kanamycin (pJAN33) or to the herbicide Basta (pP001VS-GW). The presence of the respective transgenes in double homozygous mutant plants was confirmed by PCR using primers that specifically allowed the amplification of the transgenes and of the endogenous PetE2 and pete2-1.1 alleles. Successful complementation of the double mutation was confirmed by measurements of growth and of chlorophyll fluorescence. Immunoblot and Chlorophyll Fluorescence Analyses—Total proteins were isolated from 6-week-old plants as described previously (15Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For denaturing PAGE analysis, 40 μg of total proteins determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the Bradford dye-binding procedure (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) were loaded for each genotype. Decreasing amounts of wild-type proteins (28 and 16 μg) were loaded in parallel lanes (0.7× WT and 0.4× WT). For immunoblot analyses, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) and incubated with antibodies specific for the large subunit of Rubisco (polyclonal chicken anti-RbcL raised against a peptide target conserved in all of the known Type I RbcL proteins (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden)), plastocyanin (polyclonal antibody raised against the mature form of the spinach plastocyanin expressed in E. coli, obtained from Ralph Bernd Klösgen (Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Germany)), and cytochrome c 6 (polyclonal antibody raised against the mature form of the Arabidopsis cytochrome C 6 expressed in E. coli (see also Ref. 4Gupta R. He Z. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), obtained from Sheng Luan (University of California, Berkeley, CA)). Signals were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using the Lumi Analyst 3.0 (Roche Applied Science). In vivo, Chl a fluorescence of single leaves was measured using the PAM 101/103 device (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) as described previously (12Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Meurer J. Oelmuller R. Steiner-Lange S. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulses (800 ms) of white light (6000 μmol photons·m–2·s–1) were used to determine the maximum fluorescence (F M) and the ratio (F M – F o)/F M = F V /F M. A 20-min illumination with actinic light (FL101/E; Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) at a rate of 80 μmol photons·m–2·s–1 was used to drive electron transport between the two photosystems before measuring the effective quantum yield of PSII (ΦII) and photochemical quenching (qP = (F M′ – F S)/(F M′ – F o′)). Fluorescence induction kinetics were measured with a home-made fluorometer (17Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10209-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Actinic light was provided by an array of green light emitting diodes (HLMP CM15, 520 nm, Hewlett-Packard). Light was concentrated on a leaf spot of ∼20 mm2, and fluorescence was detected on the opposite side of the sample. Emission was recorded at discrete times with a maximum resolution time of 30 μs. In A. thaliana, we have isolated transposon insertion mutants for both plastocyanin-coding genes PetE1 (MIPS accession number At1g76100) and PetE2 (MIPS accession number At1g20340). Starting from the unstable insertion mutants, stable null alleles of both genes, pete1-1.1 and pete2-1.1, were generated by selecting germinal revertants with frameshift mutations (Fig. 1A). The double mutant pete1-1.1 pete2-1.1 was obtained by crossing single mutants and genotyping F2 progenies. In pete1-1.1 pete2-1.1 plants, no plastocyanin was detectable by immunoblot analysis, whereas wild-type amounts of the cytochrome c 6 polypeptide were found (Fig. 1B). In both pete1-1.1 and pete2-1.1 plants, growth was affected (Fig. 1C). The plastocyanin double mutants did not survive when grown on soil but could be propagated in axenic culture on medium supplemented with sucrose. However, heterotrophically grown double mutants had a substantially reduced growth rate and displayed a high chlorophyll fluorescence phenotype upon illumination with UV light (Fig. 1D). This last observation indicated that photosynthetic electron flow was blocked. Parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence induction were determined to characterize the electron flow in the plastocyanin double null mutant. Although the maximum (F V/F M) quantum yield was decreased by ∼35% in pete1-1.1 pete2-1.1 plants compared with the wild type (F V/F M: 0.54 ± 0.04 versus 0.81 ± 0.01), the effective quantum yield (ΦII) was close to zero in the double mutant with respect to the wild type (ΦII: 0.04 ± 0.01 versus 0.74 ± 0.02), again pointing to a severe perturbation in electron flow. In addition, the fraction of QA (the primary electron acceptor of PSII) present in the reduced state was drastically increased (1 – qP: 0.94 ± 0.01 versus 0.06 ± 0.02), implying that electron flow through PSII is still occurring while the block exists at a later electron transfer step. Consistent with these data is the comparison of the fluorescence induction curves measured in the pete1-1.1 pete2-1.1 mutant and wild-type plants (Fig. 2). Whereas the PSII photochemical rate measured in the pete1-1.1 pete2-1.1 line was close to that of the WT (data not shown), the area above the fluorescence induction curve (a parameter proportional to the size of the PSII acceptors; Refs. 18Malkin S. Kok B. Biochim. Biophis. Acta. 1966; 126: 413-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar and 19Murata N. Nishimura M. Takamiya A. Biochim. Biophis. Acta. 1966; 126: 26-33Google Scholar) was largely reduced in this mutant. This finding suggests that the size of PSII electron acceptor pool was largely decreased by the mutation. The area was nevertheless larger than the one measured in the WT in the presence of DCMU (to block the reoxidation of QA), confirming that the effect of the mutation was localized downstream of PSII. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutant was blocked in a high fluorescence state, whereas in the WT, the fluorescence yield started to decrease after approximately 10 s of continuous illumination. This decrease is at least partly attributable to the activation of the Benson Calvin cycle (20Kautsky H. Appel W. Amann H. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1960; 322: 277-292Google Scholar). Its absence in the mutant gives a further indication that electron transfer is blocked. Moreover, the mutant did not display the plateau observed in the WT in the 20–100-ms time range during continuous illumination. This plateau has been recently ascribed to the reduction of PSI acceptors (see Ref. 17Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10209-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar for discussion). Its absence is consistent with a block of electron flow located downstream of the cytochrome b 6/f. Taken together, these results strongly strengthen the interpretation of the non-photoautotrophic mutant phenotype as the consequence of a complete block in light-driven electron transport, which seems to occur as expected at the level of the PSI donor side. To test whether increased doses of cytochrome c 6 can replace plastocyanin in the pete1 pete2 double mutant, the Arabidopsis cDNA for cytochrome c 6 was fused to the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and introduced into the pete1 pete2 line. In all of the 35S::Atc6 pete1 pete2 individuals analyzed, Atc6 mRNA was detected at high levels (Fig. 1E). However, unlike the case of the plastocyanin-overexpressing 35S::AtPetE2 construct that served as a positive control, 35S::Atc6 could neither reverse nor reduce the effects of the double mutation, indicating that cytochrome c 6 cannot replace plastocyanin in vivo. Also, cytochrome c 6 expressed from T-DNA constructs containing the Atc6 gene under the transcriptional control of its natural promoter had no effect on the phenotype of the pete1 pete2 double mutant. The data concerning the photosynthetic behavior of the pete1 pete2 double mutant are in conflict with the findings of Gupta et al. (4Gupta R. He Z. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Their oxygen evolution reconstruction assays indicate that Arabidopsis cytochrome c 6 can function along with plastocyanin in photosynthetic electron transport (4Gupta R. He Z. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). But does Arabidopsis cytochrome c 6 actually donate electrons to PSI in vivo? Unlike the case in Chlamydomonas, cytochrome c 6 expression in A. thaliana is constitutive and is not up-regulated by plastocyanin depletion due to copper deficiency (4Gupta R. He Z. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytochrome c 6 of higher plants compared with that of prokaryotes or algae may have acquired novel functions as suggested from phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3). The plastocyanin sequences from Arabidopsis and several other plant species branch from algal sequences, indicating a continuous evolution from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont to the plastocyanin of modern chloroplasts. On the contrary, the cytochrome c 6-like sequences of higher plants form a distinct clade, which is relatively distantly related to both algal and cyanobacterial proteins. This indicates that higher plant cytochrome c 6 has diversified in sequence perhaps in association with the acquisition of function(s) different from transferring electrons to PSI. The RNAi-based silencing of the genes for plastocyanin as well as the combination of plastocyanin-RNAi and Atc6 knockout was performed in the Wassilewskija ecotype of A. thaliana (4Gupta R. He Z. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas the pete1 pete2 double mutant (this study) was generated in the Columbia 0 background. However, it seems improbable that intraspecific variation in photosynthetic functions could account for the difference in response. A second possibility can explain the contrasting results. Residual plastocyanin expression can take place during RNAi because of leakiness in gene silencing (21Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11739) Google Scholar). Thus, the plastocyanin-RNAi lines may have retained enough plastocyanin to allow a residual level of photosynthesis. If cytochrome c 6 cannot replace plastocyanin, at least in Columbia 0, what might its function be under normal physiological conditions? The protein might play a regulatory role rather than quantitatively transferring electrons to PSI, or in light of the results of recent proteomics analyses of the thylakoid lumen (22Peltier J.B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J. Friso G. Rudella A. Liberles D.A. Soderberg L. Roepstorff P. von Heijne G. van Wijk K.J.

https://openalex.org/W2000166086,"Cytochrome P450-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the forkhead box, class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors and their downstream target p27Kip1 in EET-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with 11,12-EET induced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in p27Kip1 protein expression, whereas p21Cip1 was not significantly affected. This effect on p27Kip1 protein was associated with decreased mRNA levels as well as p27Kip1 promoter activity. 11,12-EET also stimulated the time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and of the forkhead factors FOXO1 and FOXO3a, effects prevented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Transfection of endothelial cells with either a dominant-negative or an “Akt-resistant”/constitutively active FOXO3a mutant reversed the 11,12-EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1, whereas transfection of a constitutive active Akt decreased p27Kip1 expression independently of the presence or absence of 11,12-EET. To determine whether these effects are involved in EET-induced proliferation, endothelial cells were transfected with the 11,12-EET-generating epoxygenase CYP2C9. Transfection of CYP2C9 elicited endothelial cell proliferation and this effect was inhibited in cells co-transfected with CYP2C9 and either a dominant-negative Akt or constitutively active FOXO3a. Reducing FOXO expression using RNA interference, on the other hand, attenuated p27Kip1 expression and stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. These results indicate that EET-induced endothelial cell proliferation is associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO factors and the subsequent decrease in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. Cytochrome P450-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the forkhead box, class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors and their downstream target p27Kip1 in EET-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with 11,12-EET induced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in p27Kip1 protein expression, whereas p21Cip1 was not significantly affected. This effect on p27Kip1 protein was associated with decreased mRNA levels as well as p27Kip1 promoter activity. 11,12-EET also stimulated the time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and of the forkhead factors FOXO1 and FOXO3a, effects prevented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Transfection of endothelial cells with either a dominant-negative or an “Akt-resistant”/constitutively active FOXO3a mutant reversed the 11,12-EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1, whereas transfection of a constitutive active Akt decreased p27Kip1 expression independently of the presence or absence of 11,12-EET. To determine whether these effects are involved in EET-induced proliferation, endothelial cells were transfected with the 11,12-EET-generating epoxygenase CYP2C9. Transfection of CYP2C9 elicited endothelial cell proliferation and this effect was inhibited in cells co-transfected with CYP2C9 and either a dominant-negative Akt or constitutively active FOXO3a. Reducing FOXO expression using RNA interference, on the other hand, attenuated p27Kip1 expression and stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. These results indicate that EET-induced endothelial cell proliferation is associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO factors and the subsequent decrease in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1.

Epoxygenases of the CYP2B, -2C, and -2J subfamilies are expressed in vascular endothelial cells and metabolize arachidonic acid into a series of regio- and stereo-selective EETs (5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET) that are potent vasodilators and have been identified as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (3Campbell W.B.

Recent reports have shown that EETs exert multiple effects on the vascular wall that are not directly related to changes in membrane potential or vascular tone. Indeed, EETs seem to act as second messengers in numerous signaling pathways (6Fleming I. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Roman R.J. Physiol.

Progression through the mammalian cell cycle requires the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) through association with regulatory subunits (cyclins) that phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product and the related pocket proteins from mid-G1 to mitosis (17Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 18Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Cip/Kip cell cycle regulatory proteins are endogenous inhibitors of the cyclin/CDK complexes and play a crucial role in proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine whether the Cip/Kip family of cell cycle regulatory proteins is involved in EET-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Materials—11,12-EET was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Massy, France). The cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, protein ASepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, and protein G-Sepharose was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin, Germany). α-dCTP was from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). LY 294002 and all other chemicals were from Sigma (Heidelberg, Germany). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Cell Systems/Clonetics (Solingen, Germany) and cultured in endothelial basal medium (Cell Systems/Clonetics) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (3 μg/ml), penicillin (50 μg/ml), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 μg/ml), and 8% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Second passage endothelial cells were used throughout the present study. Plasmids and Transfection—HUVEC were grown to 60–70% confluence and then transfected with 2–2.5 μg of plasmids. Overexpression plasmids contained the cDNAs encoding wild-type Akt, dominant negative Akt (K179M or T308A, S473A), constitutive active Akt (T308D, S473D), wild-type FOXO3a, “Akt-insensitive”-FOXO3a A3, wild-type FOXO1, “Akt-insensitive” FOXO1 A3, p27Kip1, and CYP2C9. Transfection was performed using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells were incubated with the DNA-Superfect complexes at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by recovery in the presence of 4% fetal calf serum. Transfection efficiency was ∼40% as determined using green fluorescent protein, and maximal levels of protein expression were observed between 24 and 48 h. The Akt constructs were kindly provided by Stefanie Dimmeler (Frankfurt am Main, Germany), the p27Kip1 construct was from Ludger Hengst (Martinsried, Germany). The FOXO plasmids as well as the pGL2-p27Kip1 luciferase promoter construct were from Boudewijn M. T. Burgering (Utrecht, Netherlands). Small Interfering RNA—To silence FOXO gene expression, transfection of a siRNA duplex was performed using TransGene II transfection reagent (Mo Bi Tec, Göttingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The FOXO siRNA was synthesized by Eurogentec and corresponded to nucleotides 961 to 979 of the human FOXO1a coding region (GAGCGTGCCCTACTTCAAG). The siRNA also targeted the sequence for FOXO 3a. A non-related control siRNA that targeted the green fluorescent protein DNA sequence CCACTACCTGAGCACCCAG was used as a control. Incorporation of the siRNA duplex was monitored by confocal microscopy using fluorescin-conjugated siRNA. Cell Proliferation Assays—To assay proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, quiescent HUVEC were transfected with the plasmids indicated; after 24 h, the proliferative status of the endothelial cells was determined. Briefly, cells were incubated with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 2 h, and incorporated BrdUrd was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoblotting—For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β–glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm Na2H2P2O7, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0,10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin)), left on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for a further 10 min. Proteins in the resulting supernatant or in the Triton-insoluble pellet were heated with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (19Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: e68-e75Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected with antibodies recognizing Akt, phospho-Ser473 Akt, FKHR, phospho-FKHR/FKHR-L1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p27Kip1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), p21Cip1 (BD Pharmingen), c-Myc, hemagglutinin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) and β-actin (Sigma). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blotting—HUVEC were starved of serum for 24 h before stimulation with 11,12-EET (3 μm) for the times indicated. Total RNA was isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate and phenol extraction, and 20 μg of total RNA was used for Northern blotting. RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel, visualized with ethidium bromide, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with the full-length p27Kip1 cDNA. Membranes underwent filmless autoradiographic analysis (BAS-1500 Bioimaging Analyzer; Fujifilm, Kyoto, Japan) before mRNA quantification. The autoradiographs were analyzed by scanning densitometry, and p27Kip1 mRNA levels were normalized to the respective 18S ribosomal RNA levels and expressed as the -fold increase in signal obtained compared with that in untreated cells. Luciferase Assays—HUVEC were transiently co-transfected with a p27Kip1 promoter construct together with a LacZ construct; after 24 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed according to the manufacturers protocol (Promega, Mannheim, Germany; Tropix, Bedford, MA). Values were corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical evaluation was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data, one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni t test, or one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, where appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Effect of 11,12-EET on the Expression of p27Kip1—To determine whether or not EETs affect the expression of Cip/Kip, HUVEC were incubated with 11,12-EET and p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Stimulation of endothelial cells with 11,12-EET induced a time-dependent decrease in p27Kip1 protein expression. p27Kip1 protein levels were reduced by 60% after 24 h of treatment with 3 μm 11,12-EET (Fig. 1A). The expression of the p27Kip1-related protein p21Cip1, however, was not significantly affected by EET stimulation (Fig. 1B). The EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1 was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 1C) and was comparable with the reduction of p27Kip1 seen after treatment with either vascular endothelial cell growth factor or fetal calf serum, endothelial mitogens known to decrease p27Kip1 expression (20Watanabe Y. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Ajioka I. Dvorak H.F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither 14,15-EET nor sphingosine-1-phosphate significantly effected p27Kip1 expression. Because the expression of p27Kip1 is determined by transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms, we assessed whether the 11,12-EET-mediated down-regulation of p27Kip1 is caused by an effect on transcription. p27Kip1 mRNA levels were time-dependently decreased after the application of 11,12-EET (Fig. 2A). The decrease in mRNA levels was accompanied by a ∼60% decrease in the activity of the p27Kip1 promoter (Fig. 2B). Role for Akt in EET-induced Down-regulation of p27Kip1— Protein kinase B/Akt plays an important role in regulating the transcription and subcellular distribution of p27Kip1. We therefore determined whether or not Akt is implicated in the EET-induced signaling cascade. Treatment of endothelial cells with 11,12-EET led to a concentration- (data not shown) and time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 (Fig. 3A) that was prevented by pre-incubation with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) inhibitor LY 294002 (Fig. 3B). LY 294002 also attenuated the 11,12-EET-induced decrease in p27Kip1 levels (Fig. 4A). Moreover, transfection of HUVEC with a dominant-negative Akt almost completely prevented the EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1 (Fig. 4B). Transfection of HUVEC with a constitutively active Akt, on the other hand, decreased p27Kip1 expression independently of the presence or absence of 11,12-EET, highlighting the importance of Akt in regulating p27Kip1 expression in endothelial cells. Effect of 11,12-EET on the Activity Forkhead Transcription Factors—As a possible molecular mechanism by which the EET-induced activation of Akt could regulate p27Kip1 expression, we focused on the forkhead transcription factors, specifically the FOXO subfamily, which is involved in the Akt-dependent regulation of cell proliferation and survival (21Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). HUVEC express FOXO1 and FOXO3a (Fig. 5), whereas FOXO4 could not be detected (data not shown). 11,12-EET elicited the time-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 and FOXO3a (Fig. 5A), an effect that was abolished by pretreatment of HUVEC with LY 294002 (Fig. 5B). Because 11,12-EET reduced p27Kip1 promoter activity and p27Kip1 is a direct target of the forkhead transcription factors, we determined the involvement of FOXO3a in the EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1. Co-transfection of HUVEC with the p27Kip1 promoter construct and either a wild-type FOXO3a (FOXO3a WT) or an “Akt-insensitive” and thus constitutively active FOXO3a mutant (FOXO3a A3) prevented the EET-induced decrease in promoter activity (Fig. 6A). In cells transfected with FOXO3a A3, p27Kip1 promoter activity was, as expected, higher than that measured in cells transfected with wild-type FOXO3a. This increase in activity could not be inhibited by 11,12-EET, supporting the notion that the EET-induced inhibition of FOXO activity depends on Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO proteins. Moreover, the EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1 protein expression was prevented by cotransfection with either the wild-type or constitutively active FOXO3a (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained when FOXO1 was overexpressed in endothelial cells (data not shown). The Mitogenic Effect of Cytochrome P450-derived EETs Depends on Akt and Forkhead Activity—To determine whether the effects observed are functionally involved in CYP2C9-induced proliferation, BrdUrd incorporation was assessed in CYP2C9-overexpressing HUVEC. Similar to the effect of the CYP2C9 product 11,12-EET, CYP2C9 overexpression resulted in a decrease in p27Kip1 expression (data not shown) and a 2-fold increase in BrdUrd incorporation compared with endothelial cells, which were transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 7). Overexpression of wild-type Akt in CYP2C9-expressing endothelial cells did not influence BrdUrd incorporation, but CYP2C9 overexpression failed to elicit proliferation in endothelial cells that were co-transfected with a dominant-negative Akt (Fig. 7A). Moreover, the co-transfection of HUVEC with CYP2C9 and either the wild-type or constitutively active FOXO3a completely prevented the cytochrome P450-induced proliferation of endothelial cells (Fig. 7B). Effect of FOXO siRNA on Endothelial Cell Proliferation—To investigate whether endogenous FOXO factors are required for CYP2C9-induced endothelial proliferation, we attenuated FOXO gene expression using RNA interference. Transfection of endothelial cells with FOXO-specific siRNA significantly decreased the expression of FOXO protein compared with endothelial cells transfected with a control siRNA (expression was reduced by 66 ± 1.5%, p < 0.001, n = 4; Fig. 8A). To evaluate the consequences of decreased FOXO expression on CYP2C9-induced endothelial cell proliferation, we co-transfected endothelial cells with pcDNA3.1 or CYP2C9 and either a FOXO siRNA or a control siRNA. The siRNA-induced reduction in FOXO expression was associated with a decrease in p27Kip1 protein levels (Fig. 8B), a finding that highlights the crucial role played by FOXO factors in the regulation of p27Kip1. In cells treated with the FOXO siRNA, the expression of p27Kip1 was not influenced by the presence of 11,12-EET. In accordance with its effect on p27Kip1, decreasing FOXO expression in cells transfected with pcDNA was in itself a significant stimulus of endothelial cell proliferation, compared with cells transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 8C). The FOXO siRNA-induced proliferation of endothelial cells was such that we were unable to detect an additive effect of FOXO siRNA and CYP2C9 overexpression. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that CYP2C9-derived 11,12-EET promotes endothelial proliferation by down-regulating the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. The signal transduction cascade activated by 11,12-EET, which results in the down-regulation of p27Kip1, involves activation of the PI 3-K/Akt signaling pathway and the subsequent phosphorylation and inhibition of the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. EETs are potent vasodilators (22Campbell W.B. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that, by acting as second messenger molecules, also play an important role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis (6Fleming I.

The molecular mechanisms and signal transduction cascades that mediate the effects of EETs are not well defined, although the spectrum of kinases and phosphatases that can be stimulated by 11,12- and 14,15-EET is continuously expanding (6Fleming I. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). EETs are reported to modulate endothelial cell gene expression (8Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K.

However, although the cytochrome P450 epoxygenases that generate EETs are expressed in native endothelial cells (5Fisslthaler B. Popp R. Kiss L. Potente M. Harder D.R. Fleming I. Busse R. Nature. 1999; 401: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 8Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), the expression of the enzyme is rapidly down-regulated (within 24 h) once the cells are isolated, making it difficult to assess the biological effects of EETs in cultured cells. However, we were recently able to show that overexpression of CYP2C9 in endothelial cells up-regulates the expression of cyclin D1 and thus stimulates endothelial cell proliferation (16Potente M. Michaelis U.R. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Fleming I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15671-15676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because cell proliferation is governed by a complex interaction of CDKs and CDK inhibitors, we investigated whether additional regulators of cell cycle progression are targeted by cytochrome P450-derived EETs. Moreover, because a second non-catalytic function of cyclin d-CDK4 complexes is the sequestration of CDK inhibitors, including p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 (23Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 24Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar), we concentrated on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins. Our results show that 11,12-EET does not affect the expression of p21Cip1 but down-regulates the expression of p27Kip1. Because the level of unbound Cip/Kip proteins may set an inhibitory threshold for the activation of cyclin E and A-CDK2, the down-regulation of these proteins is a requirement for mitogen-induced cell proliferation. Nuclear levels of CDK inhibitor proteins are decreased by sequestration into the cytosol; once the level has decreased sufficiently, cyclin E-CDK2 can facilitate its own activation by phosphorylating p27Kip1, thus initiating its degradation (25Sheaff R.J.

Indeed, the expression of p27Kip1 is cell cycle-dependent and highest in quiescent cells and decreases upon re-entry into the cell cycle (31Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation was initially thought to determine cellular p27Kip1 levels, the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors is now known to directly regulate the transcription of the p27Kip1 gene (32Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 33Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), which means that a proliferative stimulus that results in a decrease in p27Kip1 levels may also be associated with the inhibition of FOXO-induced transcription. Our data indicate that the proliferation of endothelial cells elicited by 11,12-EET is associated with a decrease in the activity of the p27Kip1 promoter and subsequently with a decrease in p27Kip1 mRNA levels. These effects can be attributed to the phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO factors inasmuch as cell stimulation with 11,12-EET time-dependently increased the phosphorylation of FOXO1 (formerly known as FKHR) and FOXO3a (formerly known as FKHR-L1). Moreover, overexpression of a constitutively active FOXO3a mutant largely prevented the 11,12-EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1 expression and inhibited the CYP2C9-induced increase in endothelial cell proliferation. Relatively little is known about the expression and biological functions of forkhead factors in endothelial cells. However, from work in numerous other cell types, it is evident that the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors is regulated by the PI 3-K/Akt pathway (34Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

The results of the present investigation indicate that the upstream signaling pathways leading to the 11,12-EET-induced phosphorylation of FOXO factors and down-regulation of p27Kip1 in endothelial cells also involves activation of the PI 3-K/Akt pathway. Indeed, 11,12-EET induced the PI 3-K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, and a selective PI 3-K inhibitor abolished the 11,12-EET-induced phosphorylation of FOXO proteins. Moreover, introducing a dominant-negative Akt into endothelial cells prevented both the 11,12-EET-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1- and CYP2C9-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The important role of FOXO factors in endothelial cell proliferation was highlighted by the results of experiments in which FOXO expression was down-regulated using an siRNA approach. Indeed, the reduction in FOXO expression proved to be a strong stimulus for endothelial cell proliferation, and the effects observed were equivalent to those of CYP2C9 overexpression. The FOXO siRNA-stimulated increase in cell proliferation was associated with an attenuated expression of the forkhead target gene p27Kip1, indicating that the FOXO-dependent regulation of p27Kip1 expression plays a significant role in the regulation of endothelial cell growth. We have previously shown that the induction of mitogenactivated protein kinase phosphatase 1 and the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity also play a crucial role in the regulation of CYP2C9-induced endothelial cell proliferation (16Potente M. Michaelis U.R. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Fleming I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15671-15676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and it remains to be demonstrated how the pathway outlined previously can be linked to the activation of the PI 3-K/Akt/FOXO cascade described here. There is, however, a precedent for the negative regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase after the activation of Akt, because Akt has been reported to phosphorylate and inactivate the kinase SEK1 and thus inactivate its substrate, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, in insulin-stimulated human embryonic kidney cells (40Park H.S.

Exactly how 11,12-EET can elicit the activation of Akt remains unclear; although an extracellular EET receptor has been proposed on guinea pig monocytes (41Wong P.Y. Lai P.S. Falck J.R. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000; 62: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (42Snyder G.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1936-H1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), there has been no report of such a receptor in endothelial cells. Certainly, part of the biological response to the exogenously applied EETs, as well as the overexpression of CYP2C9 in endothelial cells, can be accounted for by the transactivation of the EGF receptor, either by the release of epidermal growth factor/heparin-binding epidermal growth factor from the cell surface or the intracellular activation of the receptor by Src kinases (43Chen J.K. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6029-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 44Chen J.K. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel signaling pathway by which cytochrome P450-derived 11,12-EET promotes endothelial cell proliferation and identify p27Kip1 as a downstream target of EET signaling. The EET-induced proliferation involves the down-regulation of p27Kip1 through PI3-K/Akt-regulated inactivation of the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. Therefore, regulation of p27Kip1 expression might be an important downstream target in EET-signaling, given that p27Kip1 is a likely candidate to couple cell cycle progression with migration and angiogenesis (47Goukassian D.

High expression levels of this family member were reported in osteoarthritic cartilage 2 (26Steck E. Breit S. Breusch S.J. Axt M. Richter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs) are a family of four Chi-lectins from Drosophila melanogaster with mitogenic activity (13Kawamura K. Shibata T. Saget O. Peel D. Peter J. Development. 1999; 126: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oviductin is a glycoprotein secreted by the oviduct (29Malette B. Paquette Y. Merlen Y. Bleau G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These Chi-lectins share several properties: they show homology to family 18 chitinases but lack key residues from the DXXDXDXE motif and are therefore inactive; they are secretory proteins and thought to be involved in tissue remodeling and/or immune responses. However, the physiological ligands for these proteins have not been defined. Ym1 has been shown to interact with GlcN oligomers, yet the physiological relevance of this finding is not clear (27Chang N.C.A. Hung S.I. Hwa K.Y. Kato I. Chen J.E. Liu C.H. Chang A.C. J. Biol.

The identity of the cellular receptors mediating the biological effects reported for YM-1 and HCGP39 are currently not known. Detailed structural information on the protein-ligand interactions would allow us to characterize the physiological processes affected by the Chi-lectins more clearly. Here, we describe the high resolution crystal structure of HCGP39 and show that it, unlike the Ym1 and IDGF2 structures, possesses a binding cleft conserved in structure and sequence with HCHT. We demonstrate that HCGP39 interacts with chitooligosaccharides with high affinity. A crystal structure of a complex with GlcNAc8 shows how this lectin is able to bind chitooligosaccharides and suggests that the binding cleft is compatible with the binding of longer chitin fragments or other polymeric carbohydrates. Structure Solution—HCGP39 was purified from human chondrocytes as described previously (1Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography was used as a final step, following ion-exchange on DEAE-Sepharose and gel filtration. The protein was frozen in the buffer of the final purification step (20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.2) at a concentration of 1.8 mg/ml. For crystallization, the protein solution was thawed and concentrated to 7 mg/ml. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using equal volumes of protein and mother liquor (0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.6, 25% PEG 4000, 100 mm dithiothreitol). The crystals grew as bars with maximum dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm after approximately 1 week. A complex with GlcNAc8 was obtained by co-crystallization in the same conditions, in the presence of 3 mg/ml of the ligand. All of the crystals were cryoprotected in 30% glycerol, 70% mother liquor prior to freezing in a cryostream. The data were collected on beamlines ID14-4 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) and X11 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) and processed using the HKL package (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar) (Table I). The native structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab For the complex with GlcNAc8, refinement was started from the native HCGP39 structure using CNS rigid body refinement. The protein model was built using iterative cycles of O and CNS. The ligand was only included until well defined by unbiased (i.e. before inclusion of any ligand) Fo – Fc,φcalc maps (shown in Fig. 3A). Structural comparisons described here were performed with the first monomers in the coordinate files, some of the loops of the further monomers being less well defined and the overall backbone B factors being higher. This is true in particular for the complex with GlcNAc8, where the first monomer has a <B> of 49.7 Å2, and for the second monomer <B> = 66.7 Å2. This is also reflected in relatively high Wilson B factors for the complex, compared with those of the native structure (Table I). Analysis of Ligand Binding—Binding of chitooligosaccharides to HCGP39 was analyzed using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein and ligand-induced changes of the solvent environment of tryptophan residues (39Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with Flu-Sys software (version 1.02) (40Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 118-119PubMed Google Scholar) and a thermostatted cuvette holder at 25 °C. Emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 460 nm upon excitation at 295 nm. Both the excitation and emission slits were opened to 5 nm, and the spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 25 nm/min. Initial binding experiments were performed with GlcNAc4. HCGP39 (5.9 μl of a 42.5 μm solution) was added to a 0.5-ml quartz cuvette containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl to an initial volume of 0.485 ml. After preincubating the solution for 10 min at 25 °C within the cuvette holder, 2.5-μl aliquots of various GlcNAc4 stock solutions were added to the mixture (to a final volume of 0.5 ml after six additions), and the emission spectrum was recorded after each addition following mixing and a 5-min incubation. All of the spectra were corrected for the background emission signal from both the buffer and the unbound ligand. The concentrations of the ligand were corrected for dilution effects, making the final concentration range 0–1.55 μm. Both the fluorescence of the macromolecule and the background fluorescence of the ligand were linear over the concentration range used in this study. The fluorescence intensity from a solution containing 0.1 μm GlcNAc4 and 0.5 μm HCGP39 remained constant up to 3 h after the initial mixing, indicating a stable and rapidly formed equilibrium complex. The equilibrium dissociation constant could be obtained from fitting the fluorescence intensity data to the following single site binding equation using nonlinear regression analysis (41Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar): F – F o = (F b – F o) * (L o/(K d + L o)), where F and F o refer to the fluorescence intensity in the presence and absence of GlcNAc4 respectively; F b refers to maximum fluorescence signal of the HCGP39-GlcNAc4 complex at saturation; L o is the initial [GlcNAc4]; and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The above protocol was also performed using 0.75 μm of HCGP39 and gave a similar K d value (data not shown). Binding of GlcNAc6 was analyzed in an identical fashion, except that the final concentration range of the ligand was 0–71.4 μm. Overall Structure—The structure of the 39-kDa human cartilage glycoprotein (HCGP39) was solved by molecular replacement and refined against 1.85 Å synchrotron data (Table I), to a final R factor (R free) of 0.183 (0.206) with good geometry (Fig. 1A and Table I). The structure reveals the standard (β/α)8 barrel, as expected from the high sequence identity (53%) with the human macrophage chitinase (Fig. 1B, HCHT, and Ref. 18Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D.

Similar to many other chitinase structures solved to date, an extra α/β domain is inserted between strands β7 and α7, which gives the active site a groove-like character (15Perrakis A. Tews I.

Like most family 18 chitinases, three conserved cis-peptides are present (positions 57 and 58, positions 140 and 141, and positions 352 and 353). An ordered GlcNAc2 N-linked glycan is attached to Asn63, the single predicted glycosylation site. Sequence data bases suggest polymorphism on residue 311; the electron density maps identify this residue as Ile rather than Thr. Family 18 chitinases contain a sequence motif DXXDXDXE, which lies on strand β4 (Fig. 1B). Structural analysis has shown that the glutamate is the catalytic acid, which protonates the glycosidic bond (14Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Kalk K.H. Beintema J.J. Dijkstra B.W.

HCGP39 possesses no chitinase activity; in addition it has been shown that mutation of Glu140 (the catalytic acid) to Leu in HCHT renders the enzyme catalytically inactive (24Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Au F.L. Donker-Koopman W.E. Strijland A. Muijsers A.O. Hrebicek M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, both HCGP39 and this HCHT mutant are able to bind chitin particles with high affinity (24Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Au F.L. Donker-Koopman W.E. Strijland A. Muijsers A.O. Hrebicek M.

The reason for this is apparent from sequence comparison (Fig. 1B) and the nature of the residues lining the HCGP39 putative binding cleft (Fig. 1A). Similar to HCHT (18Fusetti F. von Moeller H.

Structural studies on chitinases have shown that these residues are important for interacting with the hydrophobic faces of the pyranose rings in the chitooligosaccharides GlcNAc5 and GlcNAc8 (16van Aalten D.M.F.

Thus, the HCGP39 structure supports the observation that this protein is able to interact with chitin. Comparison with Other Chi-lectins—Several proteins with high sequence homology to family 18 chitinases, but lacking catalytic activity, have been reported. These Chi-lectins have a range of roles and are thought to interact with a variety of carbohydrate ligands (4Shackelton L.M. Mann D.M. Millis A.J.T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2042790425,"Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates a variety of cellular responses. To provide information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of Akt/PKB activity, we have developed genetically encoded fluorescent indicators for Akt/PKB. The indicators contain two green fluorescent protein mutants, an Akt/PKB substrate domain, flexible linker sequence, and phosphorylation recognition domain. A phosphorylation of the substrate domain in the indicators caused change in the emission ratio based on fluorescent resonance energy transfer between the two green fluorescent protein mutants. To let the fluorescent indicators behave as endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and Bad, which are endogenous Akt/PKB substrates, they were fused with the Golgi target domain and mitochondria target domain, respectively. The indicators thus colocalized with the endogenous substrates conferred their susceptibilities to phosphorylation by Akt/PKB. We showed that the Golgi-localized indicator responded to the stimulation with 17β-estradiol (E2) and insulin in endothelial cells. In addition, E2 elicited the phosphorylation of the mitochondria-localized indicator in the endothelial cells, but no phosphorylation was observed by E2 or by insulin of the diffusible indicator that has no targeting domain. The difference in the results with the three indicators suggests that the activated Akt/PKB is localized to subcellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus and/or mitochondria, rather than diffusing in the cytosol, thereby efficiently phosphorylating its substrate proteins. E2 triggered the phosphorylation of the mitochondria-localized indicator, whereas insulin did not induce this phosphorylation, which suggests that the localization of the activated Akt/PKB to the mitochondria is directed differently between insulin and E2 via distinct mechanisms.

The Akt/protein kinase B was identified as a serine/threonine protein kinase with high homology with the protein kinases A and C. At the same time, this kinase was identified as the cellular homologue of the viral oncoprotein v-Akt. Mammals have three closely related Akt isoforms, encoding Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. All the three isoforms contain an N-terminal Pleckstrin homology domain, followed by a kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory tail. Akt is an important regulator of various cellular processes including glucose metabolism, cell survival, and angiogenesis (1Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Akt becomes activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, steroid hormones, and cellular stresses. Recent studies on the mechanism of Akt activation indicate that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and its product phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate promote translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and the phosphorylation at the two sites, Thr-308 and Ser-473, in Akt protein. The phosphorylation of the both sites is blocked by pretreatment of the cells with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. The activated Akt then phosphorylates substrates including glycogen synthase kinase-3, Bad, eNOS, 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; E2, 17β-estradiol; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IR, insulin receptor; CPAE, calf pulmonary artery endothelial; ER, estrogen receptor. caspase-9, and forkhead transcription factors (4Hafezi-Moghadam A.

To achieve signaling specificity when the Akt signaling pathway is activated by stimuli that elicit different cellular responses, the exact location of the substrates in living cells may dictate which pathways are activated, but the precise mechanism remains poorly understood because of the lack of sufficient methods to study it. Recently, we and other groups have reported genetically encoded fluorescent indicators for detecting protein phosphorylation in a single living cell (9Sato M. Ozawa T. Inukai K. Asano T. Umezawa Y. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 10Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The approaches for detecting protein phosphorylation based on the fluorescent indicators have provided new information on the spatial and temporal regulation of activities of protein kinases and phosphatases. Herein, we describe genetically encoded fluorescent indicators for Akt/PKB kinase activity, named Aktus (a fluorescent indicator for Akt phosphorylation that can be custom-made), eNOS-Aktus, and Bad-Aktus. eNOS-Aktus and Bad-Aktus are indicators for phosphorylation of eNOS and Bad, respectively. In addition, Aktus is a diffusible cytosolic indicator for phosphorylation by Akt. The common unit of the indicators is Aktus and is based on our general approach for visualizing protein phosphorylation in living cells (9Sato M. Ozawa T. Inukai K. Asano T. Umezawa Y. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which contains two GFP mutants, an Akt substrate domain, a flexible linker sequence, and a phosphorylation recognition domain. We demonstrate that a FRET change between the two GFP mutants in the Aktus is induced by the phosphorylation of its Akt substrate domain. Almost all Akt substrates are known to localize to subcellular regions. eNOS is localized to the Golgi apparatus and cholesterol-rich microdomain of plasma membrane, caveolae in cells (13Fulton D.

By fusing the Aktus with the respectively subcellular localization domains for eNOS and Bad, the eNOS-Aktus and Bad-Aktus were prepared, respectively, and were compared with the diffusible indicator, Aktus. The colocalized indicators were found to exhibit the extent of phosphorylation of eNOS and Bad, respectively, which was identical to those of the endogenous substrates, whereas Aktus induced no phosphorylation. These results suggest that the activated Akt is localized. The indicators thereby allowed detecting protein phosphorylation by Akt with high spatial and temporal resolution in single living cells.

Plasmid Construction—To construct the genes of the three indicators, fragment cDNAs of two GFP mutants (enhanced CFP and enhanced YFP), a linker and a substrate domain, a phosphoserine recognition domain, an eNOS targeting domain, or a mitochondrial targeting domain fused to the N-terminal of the CFP were generated by PCR and cloned into pBlueScript. All PCR fragments were sequenced with an ABI310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The amino acid sequence containing the flexible linker and substrate domain is GGSSGGSSRGRSRSAP, which is a serine phosphorylation domain recognized by Akt derived from Bad (17Datta S.R. Dudek H.

Imaging of Cells—CHO-IR-Akt cells were starved in 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 4–6 h and washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. After transfection, CPAE cells were maintained in the culture medium for 12–24 h, infected with adenoviruses containing Akt1, estrogen receptor (ER), or both for 1 h, and incubated for 12 h in the culture medium. After starvation in a steroid-free medium (phenol red-free Eagle's minimal essential minimum with 2% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum) for 12 h, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were imaged at room temperature on a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope with a cooled charge-coupled device camera MicroMaX (Roper Scientific Inc., Tucson, AZ), controlled by MetaFluor (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). The exposure time at 440 ± 10 nm excitation was 100 ms. The fluorescent images were obtained through filters at 480 ± 15 nm and 535 ± 12.5 nm with a 40× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin and 1 μm E2. Western Blotting Analysis—CHO-IR-Akt cells and CPAE cells were starved in 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 4–6 h and were then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min at 25 °C. After starvation in the steroid-free medium for 12 h, the CPAE cells infected with adenoviruses containing Akt and ER stimulated with 1 μm E2 for 20 min at 25 °C. The cells were lysed with an ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After immunoprecipitation with the antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, the immunocomplex was precipitated using Protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads (Amersham Life Sciences). The sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The obtained signal was quantified using an image analyzer (LAS-1000plus; Fujifilm). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—CPAE cells expressing eNOS-Aktus were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After 1 h of incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-eNOS (C-20) antibody, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% fish skin gelatin and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with Cy5 for 30 min. The coverslips were mounted onto a slide and observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss). Design of Aktus, eNOS-Aktus, and Bad-Aktus—The common unit, Aktus, of the present indicators is a five-part tandem fusion protein containing enhanced CFP, a substrate domain, flexible linker sequence, phosphorylation recognition domain, and enhanced YFP. The substrates of Akt including Bad and eNOS contain a common Akt substrate sequence RxRxxS/Ty, where x is any amino acid and y is a bulky hydrophobic residue (20Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B.

The phosphorylated serine contained in this sequence binds to 14-3-3 protein (22Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C.

We chose the RGRSRSAP sequence derived from Bad as the common substrate domain and the 14-3-3 protein as the common phosphorylation recognition domain for Aktus, eNOS-Aktus, and Bad-Aktus. The constructs of the indicators prepared are shown in Fig. 1. The 14-3-3 protein exists naturally as a dimer (25Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain is deleted to avoid intermolecular FRET between the indicators. Protein kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates are often discretely localized in cells, which is essential for efficiency, specificity, and duration of phosphorylation. For example, acylation reactions via myristoylation or palmitoylation of proteins such as Src and eNOS are required for correct cellular trafficking and for coupling intracellular signaling to extracellular stimuli. eNOS is unique among NOS family members, which is localized to specific intracellular domains, including the Golgi and caveolae in cells (13Fulton D. Fontana J. Sowa G. Gratton J.-P. Lin M. Li K.-X. Michell B. Kemp B.E. Rodman D. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Liu et al. demonstrated that the first 35 amino acids of eNOS fused with GFP were sufficient to target the GFP to the Golgi apparatus and caveolae (18Liu J. Huges T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 by Akt is a critical control step for NO production in endothelial cells (28Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar), and the localization of eNOS is necessary for its activation by Akt (13Fulton D. Fontana J. Sowa G. Gratton J.-P. Lin M.

By fusing the Aktus with eNOS targeting domain, eNOS-Aktus is formed (Fig. 1), which is capable of detecting the phosphorylation of eNOS. Bad protein is localized to mitochondrial outer membrane (15Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. Mckeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 16Ottilie S. Diaz J.-L. Horne W. Chang J. Wang Y. Wilson G. Chang S. Weeks S. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30866-30872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To localize the Aktus to the mitochondrial outer membrane, Aktus was fused with the mitochondrial targeting domain (amino acids 1–33) derived from Tom20, which binds to the mitochondria outer membrane through the N-terminal α-helical hydrophobic transmembrane domain (19Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Bad-Aktus is thereby formed (Fig. 1). Characterization of Aktus—Akt is known to be activated by insulin through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathway (30Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic B.C. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). To examine whether Aktus was phosphorylated by Akt, we performed immunoblotting analysis using the anti-phospho-Bad (Ser-136) antibody. When CHO-IR-Akt cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min, the phosphorylation of Aktus was induced (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of the cells with 10 μm wortmannin completely blocked the insulin-induced increase in the phosphorylation of Aktus (Fig. 2A). In the CHO-IR-Akt cells, Akt was phosphorylated at Ser-473 and Thr-308 upon stimulation with insulin, and this phosphorylation of Akt was completely blocked by pretreatment with 10 μm wortmannin (Fig. 2B). CHO-IR-Akt cells expressing AktusS136A were prepared in which serine was replaced with alanine at the phosphorylation site within the substrate domain. When this cell was stimulated with insulin, no phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 2A). In CHO-IR cells, in which Akt was not overexpressed, the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of Aktus was not detected (data not shown). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of Aktus is mediated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway. We next examined whether FRET in the Aktus was changed as a result of the phosphorylation of Aktus. Fig. 2C shows images of Aktus expressed in CHO-IR-Akt cells, before and at different times after stimulation with insulin, in which the 480 nm/535 nm emission ratio is represented by pseudocolor images that represent the efficiency of FRET between the GFP mutants within Aktus. When Aktus was transfected into CHO-IR-Akt cells, it was uniformly distributed in the cytosolic compartment but excluded from the nucleus despite the absence of a nuclear-export signal (Fig. 2C), as was expected for its high molecular weight protein. Fig. 2D shows a time course of the change in the cytosolic emission ratio. Upon stimulation with 100 nm insulin, a blue shift of the pseudocolor was observed because of a decrease in the emission ratio (Fig. 2C). The decrease in emission ratio was detectable within several seconds and reached a plateau within 10 min. The insulin-induced change in the cytosolic emission ratio was blocked when the cells were pretreated with 10 μm wortmannin (Fig. 2, D and E). No significant change was observed in the cytosolic emission ratio in CHO-IR-Akt cells expressing AktusS136A (Fig. 2, D and E). These results demonstrate that FRET from CFP to YFP within Aktus is increased upon phosphorylation of Aktus in the cytosolic compartment, thereby allowing visualization of protein phosphorylation by Akt in single living cells. Fluorescent Indicator for eNOS Phosphorylation—One of the major physiological roles of endothelial cells is to mediate the vasodilatory response to various agonists by NO production (31Govers R. Rebelink T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F193-F206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells treated with insulin or estrogen have shown increased eNOS activity by Akt (4Hafezi-Moghadam A.

Both co-translational N-terminal myristoylation and post-translational palmitoylation (cysteines 15 and 26) of eNOS are required for the proper subcellular localization of eNOS (18Liu J. Huges T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that G2A eNOS is not myristoylated and does not localize to the Golgi apparatus or caveolae but is distributed throughout the cytosol (18Liu J. Huges T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, upon stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor, G2A eNOS was not phosphorylated at Ser-1179 by Akt (13Fulton D. Fontana J. Sowa G. Gratton J.-P. Lin M. Li K.-X. Michell B. Kemp B.E. Rodman D. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4277-4284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and did not produce nitric oxide (29Fulton D. Gratton J.-P.

These results indicate that the localization of eNOS is critical for its phosphorylation and activation. To obtain spatial and temporal information on the dynamics of the phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt, we prepared eNOS-Aktus by fusing Aktus with the eNOS targeting domain. This eNOS-Aktus was in fact colocalized with endogenous eNOS in CPAE cells; the cells were transfected with eNOS-Aktus and immunolabeled with anti-eNOS antibody. Confocal fluorescence images illustrated that eNOS-Aktus was found to be colocalized with endogenous eNOS in CPAE cells (Fig. 3A). eNOS-Aktus and endogenous eNOS were found to localize in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3A, arrowhead), but eNOS-Aktus and endogenous eNOS in the caveolae were not found, which indicates that the majority of eNOS-Aktus and endogenous eNOS is localized in the Golgi apparatus in the CPAE cells. To examine the response of eNOS-Aktus to insulin, CPAE cells expressed with eNOS-Aktus were observed under a conventional fluorescence microscope, and the CFP/YFP emission ratio of the eNOS-Aktus in the Golgi apparatus was measured. Insulin stimulation triggered a rapid change in the emission ratio in CPAE cells infected with adenovirus-expressing Akt (Fig. 3B). Omission of the infection of Akt (Fig. 3B) abolished this FRET response to insulin, indicating that the response of eNOS-Aktus to insulin is caused by the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-Aktus. To examine the response of the diffusible indicator Aktus to insulin, the cytosolic region of the CPAE cells transfected with Aktus was observed. Aktus exhibited no response to insulin in the CPAE cells infected with adenovirus containing Akt (Fig. 4). The different results between eNOS-Aktus and Aktus indicate that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation by Akt occurs in the Golgi apparatus but not in the cytosol. The increase in the efficiency of phosphorylation by Akt in the Golgi apparatus indicates that the activated Akt is also localized to the Golgi apparatus. Recently, it was reported that E2 induces the phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt (35Hisamoto K. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. Hayakawa J. Kanda Y. Nishio Y. Adachi K. Tasaka K. Miyoshi E. Fujiwara N. Taniguchi N. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3459-3467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To examine the response of eNOS-Aktus to stimulation with E2, CPAE cells infected with adenoviruses expressing ER and Akt were transfected with eNOS-Aktus. E2 stimulation caused a significant decrease in the emission ratio of eNOS-Aktus in 3–8 min in the Golgi apparatus of the CPAE cells (Fig. 3B). When CPAE cells were expressed with either ER or Akt alone and stimulated with E2, respectively, no significant response of eNOS-Aktus was obtained (Fig. 3B), indicating that the response of eNOS-Aktus to E2 was caused by both ER- and Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-Aktus. On the other hand, Aktus under otherwise identical conditions exhibited no response to E2 (Fig. 4A). The different responses between eNOS-Aktus and Aktus suggest that Akt activated by E2 stimulation is localized to the Golgi apparatus. To confirm that the responses of eNOS-Aktus to stimulation of insulin and of E2, respectively, reflect that eNOS in the Golgi apparatus is phosphorylated, immunoblotting analyses with anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser-1179) antibody were performed using the CPAE cells transfected with eNOS. The CPAE cells infected with Akt exhibited insulin-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS (Fig. 3C, top). However, treatment with insulin of CPAE cells that were not infected with Akt did not induce the phosphorylation of eNOS (Fig. 3C, top). Moreover, the CPAE cells infected with both ER and Akt induced E2-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS, but the phosphorylation of eNOS upon stimulation with E2 was not detected in the CPAE cells infected with either ER or Akt alone (Fig. 3D, top). The results are consistent with the responses of eNOS-Aktus, indicating that the response of eNOS-Aktus represent the phosphorylation of eNOS. In addition, to confirm that the response of the cytosolic indicator Aktus reflects the phosphorylation of GSK3β, which is a substrate for Akt in the cytosol, immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-GSK3β antibody was performed using the CPAE cells transfected with GSK3β. Consistent with the response of Aktus, no phosphorylation of GSK3β was detected in the CPAE cells infected with Akt. The phosphorylation of GSK3β was detected in CHO-IR-Akt cells (Fig. 4B, top), where the response of Aktus was observed (Fig. 2D). The results indicate that the response of Aktus reflects the phosphorylation of the cytosolic protein GSK3β. We have shown that the Akt activated by both E2 stimulation and insulin stimulation is localized to the Golgi apparatus, whereas E2 or insulin stimulation activates Akt in a different time-dependent manner. The different time dependence between stimulation with E2 and insulin is explained by the difference in the time dependence of phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate production, which precedes the Akt activation, as reported previously (6Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). It has been discovered that E2-induced activation of Akt occurs through a mechanism independent of insulin-induced activation of Akt (6Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Indicator for Bad Phosphorylation—Apoptosis is fundamental in the regulation of development and control of tissue homoeostasis under conditions of cellular stress. Akt is known to exert antiapoptotic effects through several downstream targets. Among molecules central to the regulation of apoptosis in eukaryotes are members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, including Bad, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL. Bad is known to exert its apoptosis-promoting effects by hetrodimerizing with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (36Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Bad is capable of forming heterodimers with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane (15Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. Mckeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 16Ottilie S. Diaz J.-L. Horne W. Chang J. Wang Y. Wilson G. Chang S. Weeks S.

Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation on Ser-136 of Bad by stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor occurs via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated Bad is complexed with 14-3-3 protein and no longer interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, allowing the inhibition of apoptosis (24Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). To observe the phosphorylation of Bad in endothelial cells, Bad-Aktus, which is colocalized with endogenous Bad at the mitochondria outer membrane, is prepared by fusing Aktus with the mitochondrial targeting domain. To confirm that the Bad-Aktus in CPAE cells was localized in the mitochondria, CPAE cells transfected with Bad-Aktus were stained with TMRE, a mitochondrial marker. Confocal fluorescence images illustrated that the localization of Bad-Aktus found was the same as that of the mitochondria stained with TMRE (Fig. 5A). This merged image indicates that Bad-Aktus was localized in the mitochondria. Estrogen is known to inhibit apoptosis of endothelial cells (37Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Spyridopoulos I. Sullivan A.B. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Losordo D.W.

Although it was reported recently that E2 activates Akt in endothelial cells (6Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 32Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3459-3467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), it is not known whether stimulation with E2 induces Bad phosphorylation by Akt in endothelial cells. To examine whether Bad is phosphorylated by Akt upon stimulation with E2, CPAE cells infected with adenoviruses containing Akt and ER were transfected with Bad-Aktus. E2 was found to trigger a significant decrease in the CFP/YFP emission ratio of Bad-Aktus in 3–10 min in the mitochondria in CPAE cells (Fig. 5B). When CPAE cells were expressed with either ER or Akt alone, and stimulated with E2, respectively, no significant response with Bad-Aktus was observed (data not shown). This result clearly indicates that E2 stimulation induces the phosphorylation of endogenous Bad via an Akt- and ER-dependent pathway in the endothelial cells. The present result with Bad-Aktus suggests that E2-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may require the phosphorylation of Bad by Akt. Aktus exhibited no response to E2 in the cytosolic region of the CPAE infected adenovirus expressing ER and Akt (Fig. 4). The different results between Bad-Aktus and Aktus described above indicate that the E2-induced phosphorylation of Bad by Akt occurs in the mitochondria, which further suggests that the E2-activated Akt is also localized to the mitochondria. In contrast to E2 stimulation, Bad-Aktus was not responsive to insulin stimulation in CPAE cells infected with adenoviruses expressing Akt (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that insulin stimulation induces no phosphorylation of endogenous Bad by Akt in endothelial cells. The results with Bad-Aktus suggest that the activated Akt that is induced by E2 is localized to the mitochondria, but the activated Akt that is induced by insulin is not localized to the mitochondria; consequently, no phosphorylation of Bad takes place. To confirm that the responses of Bad-Aktus reflect the phosphorylation of Bad in the mitochondria, immunoblotting analyses with anti-Bad antibody were performed using the CPAE cells transfected with Bad. E2 stimulation of CPAE cells infected with both adenoviruses expressing ER and Akt caused a modification of Bad such that it migrated slower in SDS-polyacrylamide gels than Bad from unstimulated cells, indicative of E2-mediated phosphorylation of Bad (Fig. 5C). The phosphorylation of Bad upon stimulation with E2 was not detected in the CPAE cells infected with either ER or Akt alone (Fig. 5C). Insulin stimulation of CPAE cells infected with adenovirus expressing Akt was not able to induce the phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift of Bad (Fig. 5D). These results are in agreement with those of Bad-Aktus, indicating that the response of Bad-Aktus in fact represents the phosphorylation of Bad. The phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift of Bad can be regarded as the extent of the phosphorylation of Bad-Aktus. Thus, by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay of Bad, we examined what level of decrease in the CFP/YFP emission ratio is gained as a result of phosphorylation of the substrate domain in Bad-Aktus. E2 stimulation of CPAE cells infected with both adenoviruses expressing ER and Akt induced an increase in phosphorylated Bad from 19% to 26% of the total Bad proteins (Fig. 5C). These values correspond to the emission ratio of Bad-Aktus before and after E2 stimulation, respectively (Fig. 5B). The level of decrease in the CFP/YFP emission ratio of Bad-Aktus was estimated to be ∼6.5 × 10–3 upon extrapolating the amount of the phosphorylated Bad with the mobility shift assay to 100% of the Bad proteins. In conclusion, we have developed fluorescent indicators for the serine/threonine kinase Akt. We showed that eNOS-Aktus responded to the stimulation with E2 and insulin at the Golgi apparatus in the CPAE cells. In addition, E2 elicited the phosphorylation of Bad-Aktus at the mitochondria in the CPAE cells. But no phosphorylation of Aktus was observed by E2 or by insulin. The difference in the results with the three indicators suggests that the activated Akt is localized to subcellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus and/or mitochondria rather than diffusing in the cytosol, thereby efficiently phosphorylating its substrate proteins. E2 triggered the phosphorylation of Bad-Aktus, whereas insulin did not induce the phosphorylation of Bad-Aktus. The results suggest that the localization of the activated Akt is directed differently between stimuli, including insulin and E2, via distinct mechanisms. Akt can phosphorylate substrate proteins, including not only eNOS and Bad but also forkhead transcription factors and IκB kinases (4Hafezi-Moghadam A. Simoncini T. Yang Z. Limbourg F.P. Plumier J.-C.

By replacing the targeting domains of the present indicators with those of forkhead transcription factors and IκB kinases, the genetically encoded indicators for forkhead transcription factors and for IκB kinases can also be prepared. Endogenous Akt isoforms are expressed at low levels in CPAE cells. Consequently, the endogenous Akt phosphorylated only a small portion of the expressed indicators. Overexpression of Akt was required to phosphorylate much of the remaining indicators, so that the activation of the Akt as a whole became detectable. Throughout this study, the overexpression was made with Akt1, which was the major isoform. Therefore, the conclusion was drawn basically with Akt1 that the activated Akt was localized in each particular subcellular compartment. Upon replacing Akt1 with Akt2 or Akt3 in the CPAE cells, possible distinctions if any between Akt1, -2, and -3 could be assessed. The present indicators and their applications are thus expected to contribute to the studies of a whole range of dynamics of the activated Akt in living cells. We thank Drs. T. Ichimura, T.

https://openalex.org/W2148050098,"Nickel is a common cause of pneumoconiosis. Here, we show that nickel inactivates aquaporin (AQP)-3, the water channel expressed apically in epithelial cells of human terminal airways. Human AQP3 was transiently transfected into human lung cells, and water permeability was measured in transfected and neighboring untransfected cells. Incubation with NiCl<sub>2</sub> rapidly, dose-dependently, and reversibly decreased water permeability in AQP3-expressing cells. Acidification of the extracellular medium also caused rapid, dose-dependent, and reversible inhibition of AQP3. Sensitivity of AQP3 to nickel was lower at alkaline pH than at neutral and acidic pH. Cells transfected with human AQP4 and AQP5, which are also expressed in airway epithelia, were insensitive to nickel and extracellular acidification. Zinc and cadmium, other common causes of pneumoconiosis, had no effect on the water permeability of AQP3. Three extracellular residues, Trp<sup>128</sup>, Ser<sup>152</sup>, and His<sup>241</sup>, were responsible for the blocking effect of nickel on human AQP3. Ser<sup>152</sup> was identified as a common site for nickel and pH sensitivity. His<sup>53</sup>, Tyr<sup>124</sup>, and His<sup>154</sup> were also involved in regulation of AQP3 by extracellular pH. In addition, the aromatic side chain of His<sup>154</sup> was shown to be important for the water permeability of AQP3. Our results imply that nickel and extracellular pH may modulate lung water clearance and that defective water clearance may be an early component of nickel-induced lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2017636767,"Superconductivity in the high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxides competes with other possible ground states. The physical explanation for superconductivity can be constrained by determining the nature of the closest competing ground state, and establishing if that state is universal among the high-T(c) materials. Antiferromagnetism has been theoretically predicted to be the competing ground state. A competing ground state is revealed when superconductivity is destroyed by the application of a magnetic field, and antiferromagnetism has been observed in hole-doped materials under the influence of modest fields. None of the previous experiments have revealed the quantum phase transition from the superconducting state to the antiferromagnetic state, because they failed to reach the upper critical field B(c2). Here we report the results of transport and neutron-scattering experiments on electron-doped Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 (refs 13, 14), where B(c2) can be reached. The applied field reveals a static, commensurate, anomalously conducting long-range ordered antiferromagnetic state, in which the induced moment scales approximately linearly with the field strength until it saturates at B(c2). This and previous experiments on the hole-doped materials therefore establishes antiferromagnetic order as a competing ground state in the high-T(c) copper oxide materials, irrespective of electron or hole doping."
https://openalex.org/W2107748470,"A 20-Myr record of creation of oceanic lithosphere is exposed along a segment of the central Mid-Atlantic Ridge on an uplifted sliver of lithosphere. The degree of melting of the mantle that is upwelling below the ridge, estimated from the chemistry of the exposed mantle rocks, as well as crustal thickness inferred from gravity measurements, show oscillations of ∼3–4 Myr superimposed on a longer-term steady increase with time. The time lag between oscillations of mantle melting and crustal thickness indicates that the mantle is upwelling at an average rate of ∼25 mm yr-1, but this appears to vary through time. Slow-spreading lithosphere seems to form through dynamic pulses of mantle upwelling and melting, leading not only to along-axis segmentation but also to across-axis structural variability. Also, the central Mid-Atlantic Ridge appears to have become steadily hotter over the past 20 Myr, possibly owing to north–south mantle flow."
https://openalex.org/W2162310945,"The effects of insulin on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in cultured vascular cells and in angiogenesis were characterized. Insulin increased VEGF mRNA levels in mouse aortic smooth muscle cells from 10–9 to 10–7m with an initial peak of 3.7-fold increases at 1 h and a second peak of 2.8-fold after 12 h. The first peak of VEGF expression was inhibited by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, and by the overexpression of dominant negative forms of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase or Akt. Inhibitors of MEK kinase, PD98059, or overexpression of dominant negative forms of Ras was ineffective. In contrast, the chronic effect of insulin on VEGF expression was partially inhibited by both LY294002 or PD98059 as well as by the overexpression of dominant negatives of PI 3-kinase or Ras. The importance of PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway on VEGF expression was confirmed in mouse aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from insulin receptor substrate –1 knockout (IRS-1–/–) mice that showed parallel reductions of 46–49% in insulin-stimulated VEGF expression and PI 3-kinase-Akt activation. Insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt on hypoxia-induced VEGF expression and neovascularization was reduced by 40% in the retina of neonatal hypoxia model using IRS-1–/– mice. Thus, unlike other cells, insulin can regulate VEGF expression by both IRS-1/PI 3-kinase-Akt cascade and Ras-MAPK pathways in aortic smooth muscle cells.

The dysfunction of the vasculature is likely associated with the loss of the direct action of insulin on vascular cells that have been shown to be insulin-responsive (4Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G.

In addition, insulin also has vascular-specific actions that are particular to vascular tissues; for example, the activation and the induction of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) in EC (5Kuboki K.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 981-990PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that insulin can stimulate several signaling cascades in EC and vascular smooth muscle cells similar to other insulin-sensitive cells after the activation of insulin receptor via its tyrosine kinase β subunit (IRβ) by phosphorylating both insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2) (13Jiang Z.Y.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and -2 interact with several downstream cellular proteins containing the Src homology 2 domain including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and activate its p110 catalytic subunit resulting in the formation of several phosphorylated complexes and the activation of Akt kinase (13Jiang Z.Y.

In contrast, the mitogenic actions of insulin in EC and ASMC growth are mostly stimulated by the activation of Ras-MAPK cascade (10Feener E.P. King G.L. Lancet. 1997; 350: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have also reported that in both micro- and macrovessels from insulin-resistant rodents there is a selective inhibition of insulin-induced activation of the IRS-PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway, whereas the Ras-MAPK pathway can be fully activated (13Jiang Z.Y. Lin Y.W. Clemont A. Feener E.P. Hein K.D. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. White M.F. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The vascular-specific action of insulin may be attributable to the direct action of insulin or mediated through the growth factors and cytokines of which the expression is regulated by insulin (4Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G.

VEGF is an angiogenic factor that plays key roles both in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis (18Ferrara N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1358-C1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in pathological angiogenesis such as cancer metastasis (19Ferrara N. Nat. Rev.

Rev. 1997; 13: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This regulation could be clinically relevant because intensive insulin treatment is associated with worsening of diabetic retinopathy and is related to VEGF expression (15Poulaki V. Qin W.

Insulin-induced VEGF expression has been reported to be mediated through the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt that is downstream to the insulin receptor. It has been reported by multiple groups that the activation of PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway can up-regulate the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α/aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator) (15Poulaki V.

However, this action may be cell type-dependent because Takahashi and colleagues (23Takahashi A. Kureishi Y. Yang J. Luo Z. Guo K. Mukhopadhyay D. Ivashchenko Y. Branellec D. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4803-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) clearly showed that activation of Akt by insulin and IGF-1 can enhance VEGF expression independent of HIF in C2C12 myoblasts. The involvement of MEK/MAPK pathway in insulin-induced VEGF expression has not been reported. Fukuda et al. (24Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38205-38211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) reported that increases of p44/42 MAPK induced the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in colon cancer cells; however, this effect appears to be related to the overexpression of IGF receptor in transformed cells because it is not seen in other cell types such as cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells or in insulin-infused retinal tissue in vivo (15Poulaki V.

In this study, we have made a novel finding showing that insulin stimulation resulted in a bi-phasic up-regulation of VEGF expression in ASMC and further characterized the potential signaling pathways utilized by insulin to induce this expression. Our data suggested that the activation of both PI 3-kinase/Akt and p44/42 MAPK pathways is required in this regulation with PI 3-kinase/Akt activation are responsible for short term stimulation, whereas both pathways are essential for the long term up-regulation of VEGF. The physiological significance of these effects is also determined in an in vivo hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis model in IRS-1–/– null mice.

Cells were starved for 24 h in 0.2% bovine serum albumin serum-free DMEM before treatment with insulin (100 nm) for 16 h. The cells were then harvested in lysis buffer and frozen-thawed once, and insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). Luciferase activity in the lysate was measured with Dual-luciferaseR reporter assay system (Promega Co., Madison, WI).

The protein extracts were used for electrophoresis and immunoblotting studies as described below (25Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Chatterjee A. Feener E.P. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. King G.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitated fractions (as described above) were separated with SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filter which was incubated with blocking buffer (phosphate buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) and 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. To detect protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the blot was first incubated with monoclonal antibody αPY, then with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and finally with 125I-labeled protein A at room temperature. To detect protein levels of IR, IRS-1, IRS-2 protein, or p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, blots were first incubated with polyclonal αIRβ, αIRS-1, αIRS-2, or αp85 antibodies, respectively, and then with 125I-labeled protein A. Blots were washed with PBST after each incubation, and 125I-labeled protein A-bound proteins were quantified using the PhosphorImager as described above. To detect ERK-1/2 protein level, tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, or serine phosphorylation of Akt, total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with antibodies against ERK-1/2, tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK-1/2, or phospho-(Ser-473)-Akt respectively, overnight at 4 °C. Then horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed with buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature after each incubation. Finally, the level of serine-phosphorylated Akt was detected with the ECL™ kit and quantified with a densitometer with readings performed in the linear range. Mouse Model of Retinal Neovascularization—The in vivo studies were performed in a model of hyperoxia-induced retinal neovascularization as described previously (31Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Litters of 7-day-old (P7, postnatal day 7) IRS-1–/– or 129/C57 IRS-1+/+ mice and their nursing mothers were exposed to 75 ± 2% oxygen for 5 days. At P12, the mice were returned to ambient air. The use of these animals were approved by Joslin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Retinal Flat Mount—After induction of retinal neovascularization, eyes were enucleated at P17 after intracardiac perfusion of the mice with fluorescein-dextran in 4% paraformaldehyde as described previously (31Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Retinas were isolated, flat-mounted with VECTA SHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus AX70TRE, Japan). Quantification of Neovascularization—As described previously (31Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), mice at P17 (n = 5) were deeply anesthetized with (100 mg/kg) pentobarbital sodium (Abbott) and sacrificed by cardiac perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C before paraffin embedding. Over 50 serial 6-μm paraffin-embedded axial sections starting at the optic nerve head were obtained. After staining with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and hematoxylin, 10 intact sections of equal length, each 30 μm apart, were evaluated for a span of 300 μm. All retinal vascular cell nuclei anterior to the internal limiting membrane were counted in each section by a fully masked protocol. The mean of all 10 counted sections yielded average neovascular cell nuclei per 6-μm section per eye. No vascular cell nuclei anterior to the internal limiting membrane were observed in normal unmanipulated animals (31Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Multiplex RT-PCR—Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to quantify the expression of VEGF mRNA as described previously (32Suzuma K. Naruse K. Suzuma I. Takahara N. Ueki K. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40725-40731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was isolated from individual retinas, and 500 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C in the presence of 100 pmol of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 25-μl reaction mixture. A mixture containing the oligonucleotide primers (200 nm each), [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dNTP (80 μm; Invitrogen), MgCl2 (1.5 mm; Promega, Madison, WI), and TaqDNA polymerase (2.5 units; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each reaction to a total volume of 50 μl. Amplification was carried out using a 10-min denaturation at 94 °C and 60 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C in a Cycle LR 228 DNA sequencing Thermal Cycler (Genomyx Co.). The samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel. After autoradiography, the gel was dried and analyzed by PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of signals was normalized using rat ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (RRRPP0) as internal standard. Band identity was confirmed by monoplex and multiplex reactions, Southern blot analysis, and DNA sequencing. Linearity of all reactions over the range studied in these experiments was experimentally confirmed as described previously (32Suzuma K. Naruse K. Suzuma I. Takahara N. Ueki K. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40725-40731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Statistics—Unless indicated otherwise, comparisons of data presented as mean ± S.D. or ± S.E. were performed using the Kruskall-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significantly different. Concentration- and Time-dependent Stimulation of VEGF mRNA Expression—Insulin (100 nm) increased expression of VEGF mRNA levels by 3.7-fold after 1 h (Fig. 1A). A decline from the maximum occurred after 3 h of incubation, reaching a nadir after 6 h at 160% of basal levels. Interestingly, VEGF mRNA levels rebounded to 2.8-fold of basal after 12–24 h of incubation with insulin. Insulin also stimulated VEGF mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner with significant increases at 1 nm (Fig. 1B), and the maximal level (∼3.7-fold increase) was achieved at 100 nm of insulin. Insulin Increases VEGF mRNA Transcription but Not Its Stability—To determine whether insulin had an effect on VEGF mRNA stability, ASMC was treated with or without insulin for 1 h followed by the addition of actinomycin D to inhibit transcription. Fig. 2A showed that VEGF mRNA levels decreased rapidly with a half-life of 1 h in both control and insulin-treated mouse ASMC, suggesting insulin did not alter VEGF mRNA stability. Incubation with insulin (100 nm for 1 h) was not able to increase VEGF mRNA level when RNA polymerase activity was inhibited by actinomycin D in the cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting the effect of insulin on VEGF gene expression was due to an increase in the rate of transcription. To confirm that the increases of VEGF mRNA levels were due to an effect on gene transcription, mouse VEGF promoter luciferase construct was introduced into mouse ASMC, and luciferase activity was assessed in cell lysates after insulin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2C, insulin increased VEGF promoter activity significantly by 2.7-fold. Effect of PI 3-Kinase and MAP Kinase Pathway Inhibitors— Insulin stimulated the activation of p44/42 MAPK in a time-dependent manner with a peak at 10 min and declined to basal levels between 30 and 60 min (data not shown). Two signal transduction pathways involved in insulin-induced VEGF mRNA expression in mouse ASMC were examined using inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways. Preincubation of mouse ASMC with LY292004 (30 μm), a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (5Kuboki K. Jiang Z.Y. Takahara N. Ha S.W. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. Feener E.P. Herbert T.P. Rhodes C.J. King G.L. Circulation. 2000; 101: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), decreased VEGF mRNA level in ASMC stimulated with insulin for 1 h by 70% (Fig. 3A). However, pretreatment of the cells with MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) (32Suzuma K. Naruse K. Suzuma I. Takahara N. Ueki K. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40725-40731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) did not alter the short term"
https://openalex.org/W2041623706,"We describe the construction of a FasL fusion protein devoid of systemic toxicity, inducing apoptosis only on cell-surface antigen-positive cells. The fusion protein consists carboxyl-terminally of the extracellular domain of FasL and amino-terminally of a fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-specific single chain antibody fragment (sc40-FasL). The latter allows immobilization-dependent conversion of the inactive soluble FasL fusion protein into an entity with membrane FasL-like activity. Thus, sc40-FasL efficiently induced apoptosis only in FAP-expressing cells. In accordance with a strict target-selective activity of sc40-FasL, the intravenous application of this reagent in mice revealed no signs of systemic toxicity and prevented growth of xenotransplanted FAP-positive (but not FAP-negative) tumor cells. The principle described here for the first time, in which cell-surface antigen-mediated activation of Fas permits local activation of Fas in vivo, opens novel avenues for the use of Fas signaling in cancer therapy.

Fas is the prototype death receptor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sFasL, soluble FasL; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sFasL, soluble FasL; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. receptor superfamily, which, upon activation by its cognate ligand (FasL) or by agonistic antibodies, induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types via a direct (type 1) or a mitochondria-dependent (type 2) caspase cascade (for review see Ref. 1Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). As most other members of the TNF ligand family, Fas ligand is a trimeric type 2 membrane protein (2Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar), from which a soluble molecule can be derived by proteolytic processing or in mice by alternative splicing (3Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 4Kayagaki N. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S. Yoshino K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Soluble homotrimeric FasL (sFasL) is biologically inactive in vitro and in vivo and may even antagonize the function of membrane-bound FasL (5Suda T. Hashimoto H. Tanaka M. Ochi T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 6Tanaka M. Itai T. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat.

Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). However, complexes of secondarily aggregated sFasL trimers obtained experimentally by cross-linking antibodies (or at least hexameric fusion proteins of FasL) are potent Fas activators (7Schneider P Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 8Holler N. Tardivel A. Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Hertig S. Gaide O.

Ex vivo, isolated tumor cells and cell lines derived from many different tumors express Fas; in vitro, several of them are sensitive to treatment with agonistic antibodies or recombinant multimeric FasL constructs (for review see Ref. 9Timmer T. de Vries E.G. De Jong S. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) whereby some cell types require pre- or cosensitization by various chemotherapeutics. Sensitization to Fas-induced apoptosis may be effective at distinct levels acting at a receptor-proximal, mitochondrial, and/or effector-caspase level(s) along the apoptotic signal pathway and typically involves down-regulation of the function or amount of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins. Moreover, the anti-tumoral effects of chemotherapeutic drugs have been attributed partly to p53-mediated up-regulation of Fas and FasL (10Owen-Schaub L.B. Zhang W. Cusack J.C. Angelo L.S. Santee S.M.

Thus, direct induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis in principle is a powerful strategy for anti-cancer therapy particularly in combination with chemotherapy. However, attempts to exploit Fas agonists for cancer therapy have revealed severe systemic toxicity of such reagents with liver failure being the major determinant for acute lethality (13Ogasawara J Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar, 14Galle P.R Hofmann W.J. Walczak H. Schaller H. Otto G. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Runkel L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Systemic toxicity was observed, although to various degrees, with all reagents capable of activating Fas, such as agonistic antibodies, multimeric recombinant FasL preparations, and cells expressing membrane FasL or membrane vesicles derived therefrom (9Timmer T. de Vries E.G. De Jong S. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, upon prevention of systemic action of FasL either by the use of mice lacking a functional Fas/FasL system (gld/lpr) or by the use of human Fas-specific antibodies and xenotransplants, the principle feasibility of Fas activation as an anti-tumoral strategy has been shown (15Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 16Shimizu M. Yoshimoto T. Nagata S. Matsuzawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, anti-cancer strategies based on Fas activation have to meet, first and foremost, the criterion of strictly localized action, i.e. at the tumor site. We have shown previously that soluble fusion proteins comprised of the extracellular domain of TNF or TRAIL and comprised of a single chain antibody variable-region fragment exert superior functional capabilities compared with the corresponding soluble ligands (17Wajant H. Moosmayer D. Wuest T. Bartke T. Gerlach E. Schonherr U. Peters N. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 18Wuest T. Gerlach E. Banerjee D. Gerspach J. Moosmayer D. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). From these studies, it is clear that signaling of the TNF and TRAIL single chain fusion proteins via their cognate type 2 (but not type 1) receptors was dependent on specific binding of the single chain moiety to a cell membrane-expressed target antigen (17Wajant H. Moosmayer D. Wuest T. Bartke T. Gerlach E. Schonherr U. Peters N. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 18Wuest T. Gerlach E. Banerjee D. Gerspach J. Moosmayer D. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these fusion proteins exert their superior signal capacity remain to be elucidated. Thus, it seems that artificial cell-surface immobilization of soluble TNF ligands is sufficient to convert these molecules into fully active ligands. Here we have exploited this principle to construct FasL chimeric molecules that reconstitute bioactivity only upon binding to defined cell-surface molecules, thereby creating reagents with high local apoptotic potential that could be safely applied in vivo without systemic action. Animals, Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Reagents—Female C57Bl/6xCBA/J, CD1, and NMRI nu/nu mice were purchased from Elevage Janvier (Le Genest St. Isle, France). The human HeLa and HEK293 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The HT1080 and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-expressing clones derived therefrom as well as the anti-FAP mAb F19 were a kind gift from W. Rettig (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, Vienna, Austria). HeLa, HEK293, and HT1080 cells, as well as stable transfectants derived therefrom, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The medium of stable transfectants was occasionally (4–7 days/month) supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. Fas-Comp, Fas-Fc, TRAIL-R2-Fc, FLAG-tagged FasL, and the pPS089 vector were generously supplied by P. Schneider and J. Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Switzerland). The caspase-8-specific mAb was a kind gift of Klaus Schulze-Osthoff (University of Düsseldorf, Germany). Anti-FLAG mAb M2, FLAG peptide, and secondary antibodies were from Sigma. To generate the sc40-FasL expression plasmid, the human FAP-specific single chain antibody fragment “40” including the leader sequence (19Muller D. Herstellung und Anwendung rekombinanter Antikoerperderivate gegen das Fibroblast Activation Protein. Ph.D. thesis, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany2001Google Scholar) was amplified by proofreading PCR with a primer pair containing a KpnI (forward primer) and a NotI site (reverse primer) in their 5′-overhang to allow insertion in the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The reverse primer, in addition, contained a FLAG-tag encoding sequence upstream of the NotI overhang. Subsequently, an amplicon corresponding to amino acids 139–281 of human FasL was generated with a primer pair containing a NotI (forward primer) and a NheI site (reverse primer) in their 5′-overhang and inserted into the NotI and XbaI (NheI-compatible) site of the pcDNA3.1 intermediate containing sc40 to deliver the sc40-FasL construct. Note that there is a FLAG epitope between the amino-terminal sc40 and the carboxyl-terminal FasL part. Production of sc40-FasL—The expression plasmid encoding sc40-FasL was stably introduced into HEK293 cells. After G418 selection, clones (>250) were pooled and expanded. Finally, a clone (293-40-FasL-A) producing 5–15 μg/ml sc40-FasL was obtained by limiting dilution. For large scale production of sc40-FasL, clone 293-40-FasL-A was expanded in RPMI 1640 medium and 0.5% fetal calf serum, and supernatants of confluent-grown cells were collected. sc40-FasL-containing supernatants (or control supernatants) were either concentrated by dialysis on polyethylene glycol, or sc40-FasL was purified by affinity chromatography via its internal FLAG tag on an anti-FLAG M2-Sepharose column. After elution with M2 peptide (Sigma), sc40-FasL-containing fractions were dialyzed to remove the M2 peptide and stored at –20 °C. Viability Assay—Cells (20 × 103/well) were grown overnight in 100 μl of culture medium in 96-well plates. The following day, cells were treated in triplicates with the indicated concentrations of sc40-FasL or FasL cross-linked with 1 μg/ml of the FLAG-specific mAb M2. To show construct specificity and caspase involvement in the induction of cell death, cells or the FasL fusion proteins (100 ng/ml) were preincubated for 1 h with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm), Fas-Comp (2 μg/ml), Fas-Fc (10 μg/ml), TRAIL-R2-Fc (10 μg/ml), or anti-FAP (5 μg/ml). All cell death assays were performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide to sensitize cells for death receptor-mediated apoptosis; cell viability was determined after 16 h using crystal violet staining as described elsewhere (17Wajant H. Moosmayer D. Wuest T. Bartke T. Gerlach E. Schonherr U. Peters N. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells (3 × 106) were grown overnight in 100-mm tissue-culture dishes and were challenged the next day for 2 h with 100 ng/ml sc40-FasL in the presence of cycloheximide (HT1080 1 μg/ml; HeLa 2.5 μg/ml). Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 0.1 volume of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. 50 μg of each lysate were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) dry milk, procaspase-8 (p55/53) and the p18 and p41/43 fragments (derived therefrom by proteolytical processing) were detected with a caspase-8-specific mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. FACS Analysis and Cell Sorting—Cells were stained for FAP expression in 200 μl of FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal calf serum) with 5 μg/ml anti-FAP mAb F19. An appropriate control IgG served as the control for specificity (data not shown). Bound antibodies were detected with fluorescence isothiocyanate (anti-FAP) anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml). FACS analysis was performed with a FACStar Plus (BD Biosciences). For generation of stable transfectants, cells (107 cells/ml) were electroporated (4-mm cuvette; 250 V, 1800 microfarads, maximal resistance) with appropriate expression constructs encoding FAP and the neomycin resistance gene in medium with 5% fetal calf serum. Stable clones (>40) obtained after 2 weeks of selection with G418 (500 μg/ml) were pooled, expanded, and enriched for expression of FAP by three cycles of cell sorting (see above). Determination of Alanine Aminotransferase and Caspase-3 Activities—As an indicator of liver damage, the plasma activity of alanine aminotransferase was assessed by measuring enzyme activities according to Bergmeyer (20Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. 3. Wiley Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 416-456Google Scholar) using an automated procedure. Plasma samples were prepared as follows: mice were killed by inhalation of Ethrane, and blood (500–800 μl) was taken by heart puncture with syringes containing 80 μl of heparin. After centrifugation (5 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C), plasma supernatants were taken and stored at –80 °C until analysis. To determine the activation of caspase-3 in the liver tissue of mice, homogenates (50% w/w) were prepared in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CHAPS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed using the colorimetric caspase-3 assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Animal Studies—Animal care and all experiments performed were in accordance with federal guidelines and have been approved by university and state authorities. Subcutaneous tumor growth of parental HT1080 and FAP transfectants was assessed by subcutaneous injection of 1.5 × 106 cells suspended in 100 μl of 0.9% NaCl solution into the back of narcotized (with Ethrane) nu/nu mice. Treatment of groups of 2–9 animals with the reagents and doses as indicated in the legend of Fig. 3 started the following day with four daily subcutaneous injections of concentrated or purified sc40-FasL (50 μg) into the area of tumor cell application. In one experiment, control mice and sc40-FasL-treated mice were also treated with 20 μg of cycloheximide. Tumor growth was monitored as described (21Asher A. Mule J.J. Reichert C.M. Shiloni E. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 963-974PubMed Google Scholar) and documented photographically. Tumor-bearing animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks or when the tumor size exceeded 250 mm2. To investigate systemic toxicity of sc40-FasL and secondarily cross-linked sc40-FasL, groups of 2–6 animals were treated with the indicated doses of these reagents (Table I and Fig. 3) by two subsequent intravenous injections within 30 min. Survival and phenotypical signs of sickness were monitored for 48 h. For additional biochemical and histological analyses, groups of five animals were sacrificed 45 min and 6 h, respectively, after injection of reagents.

Open table in a new tab A FAP-specific Single Chain Antibody (sc40)-FasL Fusion Protein Selectively Induces Apoptosis in FAP-expressing Cells— The observation that sFasL trimers possess virtually no apoptosis-inducing capacity, whereas secondarily aggregated sFasL trimers are potent apoptosis inducers (7Schneider P Holler N.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1428-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), suggests (i) that interaction between Fas and sFasL is too weak to allow the formation of signaling competent receptor complexes and (ii) that multivalent binding of sFasL is sufficient to fully activate Fas. In this context, binding of one sFasL trimer to three Fas receptor molecules is considered a monovalent interaction. We therefore reasoned that recruitment of an a priori inactive sFasL fusion protein to a cell surface by a Fas/FasL-independent protein-protein interaction domain could induce multivalent binding and/or aggregation of the FasL fusion protein subsequently mimicking a fully signaling competent membrane FasL acting on the same or adjacent cells. Of course, if this hypothesis is correct, the appropriate choice of the protein-protein interaction domain should allow the generation of sFasL fusion proteins that selectively act on cells expressing cell-surface structures recognized by the chosen protein-protein interaction domain or on Fas-sensitive cells adjacent to the target cell. We generated a fusion protein (sc40-FasL) consisting carboxyl-terminally of the extracellular domain of FasL and amino-terminally of a single chain antibody recognizing FAP (Fig. 1A), a membrane-expressed tumor stroma marker (22Scanlan M.J. Raj B.K. Calvo B. Garin-Chesa P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Healey J.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5657-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The sc40-FasL fusion protein was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified by affinity chromatography using a FLAG tag placed between the FasL and the sc40 domain. Gel-filtration analyses indicated a homotrimeric organization of sc40-FasL (data not shown), which was expected from the trimeric structure of FasL. Bioactivity of sc40-FasL was analyzed on HT1080 and HeLa cells (which express no FAP) and on transfectants of both cell lines stably expressing FAP (Fig. 1B). In both cases, the parental cell lines (and the FAP transfectants derived therefrom) displayed identical sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis as revealed from dose-response plots of anti-FLAG mAb cross-linked FLAG-tagged sFasL (Fig. 1C). Similarly, each pair of cells could be killed by sc40-FasL cross-linked via its internal FLAG-tag (data not shown). However, sc40-FasL treatment of these cells showed a strikingly different apoptotic response with complete apoptosis induction in the FAP-positive cells and no (HT1080) or strongly reduced (HeLa) cytotoxicity on antigen-negative control cells (Fig. 1D). The calculated EC50 value of sc40-FasL on FAP-positive cells was similar or even lower than the EC50 value of cross-linked FLAG-tagged FasL (Fig. 1, C and D). Caspase-8 activation (Fig. 1E), complete inhibition by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and by Fas-Comp, as well as significant inhibition by Fas-Fc (but not TRAIL-R2-Fc) formally proved that sc40-FasL-induced cell death was because of Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the absolute requirement of Fas/FasL-independent cell-surface binding via the single chain domain for sc40-FasL-induced cell death was evident from target antigen competition blocking apoptosis with a FAP-specific antibody (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, these results show that it is possible to fully reconstitute a membrane FasL-like signaling capacity of soluble FasL upon antibody-mediated binding to a distinct cell-surface antigen (Fig. 2B). At very high concentrations of sc40-FasL (>2 μg/ml), a minor antigen-independent cytotoxic activity was observed (Fig. 1D; HeLa, HT1080), which was related to the existence of traces of higher molecular weight aggregates of the homotrimeric molecule thus resembling cross-linked sFasL constructs. Independent support for this interpretation was obtained from functional analyses of various other anti-FAP single chain FasL fusion proteins differing in the FAP-specific single chain domain. Some of these constructs displayed a strong FAP-independent apoptotic capacity, which in gel-filtration analyses eluted in fractions corresponding to high molecular weight aggregates (data not shown).Fig. 2sc40-FasL-induced apoptosis is dependent upon binding to FAP and is mediated by Fas. A, FAP-expressing HT1080 cells were left untreated, or apoptosis was induced by treatment with sc40-FasL in the absence or presence of Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm), Fas-Comp (2 μg/ml), Fas-Fc (10 μg/ml), TRAIL-R2-Fc (10 μg/ml), or anti-FAP (5 μg/ml). Cells (Z-VAD-fmk, anti-FAP) or sc40-FasL (Fas-Comp, Fas-Fc, TRAIL-R2-Fc) were preincubated for 1 h before starting the experiment.

To prove the feasibility of such FasL fusion proteins for potential clinical use, we first tested the in vivo toxicity of sc40-FasL. Mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of up to 90 μg of sc40-FasL/animal, and overall performance and survival were monitored for several days. All animals survived and showed no apparent signs of sickness (Table I). In contrast, upon cross-linking of sc40-FasL via its internal FLAG-tag with the FLAG-specific mAb M2, dose-dependent toxicity was noted, with all animals dying from a single injection of 5–8 μg of sc40-FasL within 45–90 min (Table I). Similar to other Fas agonists (9Timmer T. de Vries E.G. De Jong S. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the M2-cross-linked sc40-FasL complex induced liver cell apoptosis and acute liver failure leading to death, which was preceded by a sharp rise in biochemical hallmarks of liver damage. Thus, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (Fig. 3A) and intrahepatic caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3B) were strongly increased and the livers of mice challenged this way were highly hemorrhagic (Fig. 3C). All of these parameters remained normal upon sc40-FasL application (Fig. 3, A–C). These data clearly show that sc40-FasL is per se inactive and is well tolerated by the organism but, nevertheless, has latently retained the pronounced proapoptotic features of conventional Fas agonists. The complete lack of in vivo toxicity observed with sc40-FasL prompted pilot experiments assessing a potential anti-tumoral activity of sc40-FasL. Nu/nu mice were injected subcutaneously with FAP-expressing HT1080 cells, and the development of local fibrosarcomas was monitored for several weeks (Fig. 3, D and E). Because these tumors tend to rapidly lose the target antigen in vivo, 2J. Park and P. Garin-Chesa, personal communication. an early and local treatment strategy was pursued with four daily subcutaneous injections (50 μg/animal) in an area close to the tumor inoculation site starting 1 day after tumor-cell inoculation. Tumor growth was monitored for 3–4 weeks, at which time the tumors of the control animals reached a size of ∼150–250 mm2. Four independent series of experiments were performed, with a tumor burden of 100% (3/3, 6/6, 5/5, 8/8) in all control (saline or cycloheximide 20 μg) groups. Under this regimen, sc40-FasL prevented tumor growth in 78% (4/6, 4/6, 2/2, 8/9) of treated animals (Fig. 3, D and E). Interestingly, cotreatment with cycloheximide (20 μg/animal), a sensitizer of death receptor-induced apoptosis in HT1080 cells in vitro, did not improve response rate (75%) nor did application of this drug influence tumor burden. Of note, for animals showing no macroscopically detectable tumor after 24 days, monitoring was continued and revealed in only one case late tumor development detectable after a further 3 weeks, whereas all other animals remained tumor-free during an observation period of at least 9 weeks. Because of the instability of FAP antigen in vivo, the few animals developing tumors under sc40-FasL treatment might have lost the target required for immobilization-dependent activation of Fas, thus becoming resistant to the action of sc40-FasL. However, alternative explanations for treatment failure (e.g. insufficient dosing) cannot be ruled out. In support of this reasoning, we have preliminary evidence that reduction in the number of sc40-FasL applications was associated with an increased number of tumor-bearing animals (data not shown). Concerning the in vivo function of the FasL-fusion protein, several mechanisms have to be considered. First, our in vitro data imply the possibility of a direct apoptosis-inducing action of sc40-FasL on the tumor cells themselves. Second, and not excluding a direct action on the tumor cells, FasL-mediated tumor rejection could be caused by recruitment of cellular effector functions of the innate immune system reported to prevent growth of FasL-positive tumors in both wild-type and T-cell-deficient mice (23Seino K. Kayagaki N. Okumura K. Yagita H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24Arai H. Gordon D. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, in the latter case, the application of an sc40-FasL-like fusion protein would also be an amenable treatment strategy for tumors a priori resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Future studies will be required to reveal to which extent direct Fas-mediated killing of tumor cells and immune cell-mediated effector mechanisms contribute to the selective anti-tumoral action of sc40-FasL. Nevertheless, the pilot animal studies presented here already point out a feature of immense importance to this novel anti-tumoral FasL reagent, namely the complete lack of systemic toxicity even under repeated high dose application, yet effective action at the targeted tissue, the tumor cells. This feature discriminates sc40-FasL from all other presently available Fas-specific reagents. These include novel Fas-specific antibodies with apparently reduced hepato-toxic activity (for a review see Ref. 27Yonehara S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and other cytokines with potential anti-tumoral activities, all of which typically possess unwanted treatment limiting side effects upon systemic administration. In conclusion, our data show that homotrimeric FasL-based fusion proteins can be generated that are devoid of bioactivity but upon cell-surface binding, via their antibody module, regain full activity. Such fusion proteins thus fulfill essential prerequisites for a safely applicable anti-cancer reagent, namely target-restricted highly specific activity (e.g. tumor cell apoptosis induction) and lack of systemic toxicity. Of note, cell-surface immobilization-dependent activation of Fas by trimeric FasL-fusion proteins is not restricted to antibody derivatives but can also be achieved with other selective protein-protein interactions, for example, with a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of CD40 and the extracellular domain of FasL, which selectively binds to and acts on CD40L-expressing cells (data not shown). The promising results presented here warrant further studies in animal tumor models to elucidate both the in vivo mechanisms involved in this process and the full potential of this new class of anti-cancer protein therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1987799034,"Many natural habitats exist on privately owned land outside protected areas1, but few governments can afford to enforce or subsidize conservation of this biodiversity. Even in some developed countries, conservation subsidy schemes have only achieved limited success2,3,4. Fortunately, some landowners may be willing to accept management costs in return for other benefits5, although this remains controversial when it involves the killing of charismatic species. For example, participants in British field sports, such as fox hunting and game-bird shooting, may voluntarily conserve important habitats that are required by quarry species6,7,8. Here we report results from a multidisciplinary study that addressed this issue by focusing on three sites across central England. We found that landowners participating in field sports maintained the most established woodland and planted more new woodland and hedgerows than those who did not, despite the equal availability of subsidies. Therefore, voluntary habitat management appears to be important for biodiversity conservation in Britain. Current debates on the future of field sports in Britain, and similar activities globally, may benefit from considering their utility as incentives to conserve additional habitat on private land."

The amino acid sequence of agrin encodes a protein with a molecular size of 220 kDa, whereas SDS-PAGE shows a diffuse band around 400 kDa. Further studies showed that agrin is highly glycosylated and belongs to the family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. By expressing different protein fragments, we localized the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites to two locations within the agrin molecule. One site that is located between the seventh and eight follistatin-like domain includes 3 closely spaced serine-glycine (SG) consensus sequences and carries exclusively heparan sulfate side chains. The second site is located further downstream in the centrally located serine-threonine-rich domain and contains a cluster of 4 closely packed SG consensus sequences. This site predominantly carries chondroitin sulfate side chains. Investigating the contribution of individual serines in GAG priming by site-directed mutagenesis showed that each serine of the two SG clusters has the potential to carry GAGs. In accordance with the mixed GAG glycosylation of agrin peptide fragments, it was found that recombinant and <i>in vivo</i>-derived full-length agrin are not exclusively heparan sulfate proteoglycans but also carry chondroitin sulfate side chains."
https://openalex.org/W2064239254,"Falcipain-2 (FP-2) is a dual-function protease that cleaves hemoglobin at the early trophozoite stage and erythrocyte membrane ankyrin and protein 4.1 at the late stages of parasite development.

Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of human malaria and is responsible for nearly all malaria-induced mortality. Clinical manifestations of malaria are caused by the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum. The parasite undergoes distinct morphologic changes during its 48-h life cycle inside human red blood cells (RBCs) 1The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood cell; FP-2, falcipain-2; PVM, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane; Ant, antennapedia protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry; IOVs, inside-out vesicles; rFP-2, recombinant FP-2; SERP, serine-rich protein: AnkP, ankyrin peptide.1The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood cell; FP-2, falcipain-2; PVM, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane; Ant, antennapedia protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry; IOVs, inside-out vesicles; rFP-2, recombinant FP-2; SERP, serine-rich protein: AnkP, ankyrin peptide. (1Sherman I. Parasitology. 1985; 91: 609-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After invasion into RBCs, the parasites mature from ring stage to trophozoites and then to schizonts. Mature segmented schizonts finally rupture the host erythrocytes releasing merozoites, which rapidly invade other erythrocytes to reinitiate the cycle. The mechanism of merozoite release from host RBCs is largely unknown. The cluster of merozoites inside a red blood cell is enclosed within two membranes: an inner parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and an outer RBC membrane. The rupture of these two membranes precedes the release of merozoites for subsequent round of RBC invasion. Several studies have shown that the merozoite release is susceptible to protease inhibitors. In the presence of such inhibitors, merozoites mature normally but are unable to escape from RBCs (2Banyal H.S. Misra G.C. Gupta C.M. Dutta G.P. J. Parasitol. 1981; 67: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Hadley T. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Lyon J.A. Haynes J.D. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2245-2251PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of plasmodial proteases have been isolated and are shown to have activities against known RBC membrane skeletal proteins (5Deguercy A. Hommel M. Schrevel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although a functional role of these proteases in the rupture of the RBC membrane during merozoite escape has not been established. The issue of malaria parasite release from RBCs was recently examined by two separate research groups. By using a combination of E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, and a specific antibody labeling approach, Salmon et al. (6Salmon B.L. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) proposed a two-step process for parasite release that includes an initial exit of merozoites enclosed within the PVM followed by a rapid parasite escape by a proteolysis-dependent mechanism. Secondly, Winograd et al. (7Winograd E. Clavijo C.A. Bustamante L.Y. Jarammillo M. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) used video microscopy to study the release of merozoites and concluded that an aperture is made through the PVM as well as the red cell membrane to allow merozoite exit in an orderly fashion. Another report from the same group (8Clavijo C.A. Mora C.A. Winograd E. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro. 1998; 93: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) detected fragments of erythrocyte membrane and PVM in culture medium at the time of merozoite release from infected RBCs. This study implied that although there might be two distinct components underlying the release mechanism, they operate together to ensure a simultaneous breakdown of the two barriers encapsulating the intracellular parasite. The present evidence as outlined above suggests that proteases are probably involved in the parasite release, but the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process remains largely uncharacterized. In this context, parasite-derived proteases that are involved in the breakdown of certain host cytoskeletal proteins at different stages of parasite development are of interest as potential therapeutic targets. Previously, we showed that P. falciparum derived cysteine protease falcipain-2 (FP-2) cleaves host erythrocyte membrane skeletal proteins at neutral pH. Specifically, FP-2 cleaves ankyrin and protein 4.1, the cytoskeletal elements vital to the stability of RBC membrane (9Dua M. Raphael P. Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This proteolytic event is accompanied by membrane instability as evident by an increased rate of membrane fragmentation of infected RBCs. We also documented that FP-2 cleaves protein 4.1 within a region of the spectrin-actin binding domain critical for erythrocyte membrane stability and identified a 16-mer peptide that inhibits FP-2 in vitro with a K i of 100 μm (10Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our continuing pursuit to develop potent inhibitors of falcipain-2, in the present study, we have identified the precise peptide sequence at the hydrolysis site of ankyrin. We also demonstrate that a 10-mer ankyrin peptide containing the cleavage site inhibits FP-2 in vitro with a K i of 2 μm and effectively blocks late-stage malaria parasite development in RBCs. These studies support our previous hypothesis and provide an important framework for the development of peptide-based antimalarial drugs. Parasite Culture and Preparation of Parasite Extract—P. falciparum (strain 3D7) culture was maintained in vitro in the presence of 15% human serum in a culture medium containing fresh A+ human erythrocytes, RPMI 1640 medium, glucose, gentamycin sulfate, HEPES, NaHCO3, l-glutamine, and pyruvic acid as described previously (11Trager W. Jensen J B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6122) Google Scholar). Parasites were grown up to 6% parasitemia at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 1% O2, and 94% N2. Ring-stage parasites were synchronized in 5% sorbitol (12Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Marsh K. Eidelman O. Howard R.J. Parasitology. 1986; 92: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Trophozoite and schizont-infected RBCs were enriched to greater than 95% parasitemia by centrifugation through sorbitol-Percoll (Sigma) gradients (13Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For the preparation of parasite extracts, RBCs infected with trophozoites were incubated with 0.01% (w/v) saponin in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min to lyse erythrocyte membrane followed by three washings with ice-cold PBS. Released parasites were then lysed with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (14Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.-C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem.

The resulting supernatant is referred to as “soluble parasite extract.” Expression of Recombinant FP-2 and FP-3—FP-2 encoding the complete mature domain plus 35 amino acids (from the COOH-terminal end) of the prodomain was expressed in M15(pREP4)-strain Escherichia coli and refolded to obtain mature active enzyme as described previously (15Shenai B.R.

An identical protocol was used to obtain recombinant FP-3, which encoded the complete mature domain plus 33 amino acids (from the COOH-terminal end) of the prodomain (16Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.R. Gut J. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study, recombinant FP-3 was used only for testing the specificity of FP-2 antibodies. Construction and Expression of His-tagged Recombinant Ankyrin—To identify the precise cleavage site, we designed a cDNA construct containing nucleotides 3001–4560 encoding amino acids 972–1,491 (17Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P. Speicher D. Cheung M.C. Kan Y.W. Palek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The insert was PCR-amplified from a human reticulocyte cDNA library and ligated into the pQE-30 vector, which encodes an NH2-terminal His6 tag (Qiagen) to generate an expression construct. After confirming the sequence, the cDNA construct was transformed into M15(pREP4)-strain E. coli and the transformants were induced in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the expression of the fusion protein termed (His)6-ank972. Recombinant His-tagged ankyrin segment was bound to Ni-NTA resin and digested with 0.2 μm FP-2 at pH 7.5 for 30 min at 37 °C. Bound protein was then eluted with 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, and subjected to MALDI-MS at Harvard Microchemistry Laboratory (Cambridge, MA) to determine the precise molecular mass of the cleaved product. To further examine whether additional cleavage sites were located in the COOH-terminal half of the recombinant protein, the 972–1,491 amino acid segment of ankyrin was cloned into pET32a vector (Novagen), which encodes His6 tag at both ends. The NH2-terminal tag was removed by thrombin cleavage (according to the manufacturer's instructions). Resin was washed thoroughly and digested with FP-2 as described above. The sample was centrifuged, and both the supernatant and pelleted beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Measurement of Protease Activity—To detect enzyme activity against erythrocyte membrane skeletal proteins, spectrin-actin depleted inside-out vesicles (IOVs) were used as substrate (14Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.-C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem.

Vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To detect the enzyme activity against hemoglobin, 100 nm rFP-2 was added into 25-μl reaction mixture containing 3 μg of human hemoglobin (Sigma) in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 60 min, and digestion products were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Generation of Peptide-specific Antibodies—A peptide corresponding to residues 185–197 (EIVNPLTKKGEKH) of FP-2 with an additional cysteine residue at the COOH terminus was synthesized and linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies to the conjugate were raised in rabbits. Peptide synthesis and antibody production was performed by Cell Essentials (Boston, MA). The antiserum was tested for immunospecificity for FP-2 by Western blots of P. falciparum parasite extract. Peptide-specific antibodies were obtained by affinity purification of antiserum on cyanogen bromide-immobilized peptide. Antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, immediately neutralized with Tris and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence—Parasite culture enriched in trophozoites was washed three times in PBS, and cells were smeared on glass slides, fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 min, air-dried, and blocked in 1% nonfat milk in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:60 for the affinity-purified FP 2 antibody and 1:30 for serine-rich protein (SERP), plasmepsin IV, or LWL1 antibodies). SERP antibodies were generously provided by Dr. Stefan Baumeister (Marburg, Germany); plasmepsin IV was provided by Dr. Daniel Goldberg (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO); and LWL1 antibodies were obtained from the MR4 program (MRA-73, a gift from Dr. Kasturi Haldar, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Slides were then washed in PBS and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies purchased from Molecular Probes (Alexa-488-conjugated (green) goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa 594-conjugated (red) goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. Slides were washed in PBS, air dried, and mounted with Antifade (Molecular Probes), and coverslips were sealed. Slides were viewed using Leica TCS SP2 confocal fluorescence microscope, and images were analyzed and prepared for publication using Adobe PhotoShop. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed essentially by the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed essentially as described by Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44846) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Falcipain-2 Cleaves Erythrocyte Ankyrin within the Spectrin-binding Domain—In our initial attempt to identify the cleavage site of ankyrin, we used two previously defined monoclonal antibodies, 8C3 and 2H1, recognizing epitopes in different regions of the molecule. The epitope for 8C3 lies somewhere between residues 1 and 1,012, and that for 2H1 lies within residues 1,462 and 1,798 in the regulatory domain of human erythrocyte ankyrin (14Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.-C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We showed that the 155-kDa truncated ankyrin cross-reacted with 8C3 antibody but not with the 2H1 monoclonal, suggesting that it lacks most of the COOH-terminal regulatory domain (14Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.-C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This result, together with the size of the cleaved product, suggests that FP-2 cleaves erythrocyte ankyrin at a site between the COOH-terminal half of spectrin-binding domain and the beginning of the regulatory domain. To identify the precise cleavage site, we designed a construct to express a fragment of ankyrin from amino acids 972 to 1,491 that covers most of the spectrin-binding domain and a small portion of the regulatory domain. This fragment was expressed in E. coli as a (His)6-ank972 fusion protein, which migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Recombinant protein was bound to Ni-NTA resin and digested with 0.2 μm FP-2 at pH 7.5 for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged and both the supernatant and the pelleted beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Although no protein was detected in the supernatant (data not shown), a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼27 kDa was detected in the pellet (Fig. 1B, asterisk). In addition, a band corresponding to undigested recombinant protein was detected. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the ∼27-kDa band was a fragment of ankyrin and it contained the NH2-terminal His tag, suggesting that the cleavage took place from the COOH-terminal end of the recombinant protein. Bound protein was then eluted with 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, and subjected to MALDI-MS to determine the precise molecular mass of the cleaved product. A major species with a molecular mass of 27,600 Da was detected. Another peak of 59,500 Da corresponding to undigested recombinant protein was also detected. Based on the amino acid sequence of recombinant His-tagged protein, cleavage after arginine 1,210 appeared to be most consistent with the MALDI-MS data. Cleavage at this location corresponds to the expected generation of an NH2-terminal fragment of 27,600 Da. Furthermore, amino acids in the vicinity of this cleavage site are consistent with the known substrate specificity of other papain family enzymes. Most importantly, arginine or lysine at the P1 position, a hydrophobic residue at the P2 position, and phenylalanine at the P1′ position are the preferred amino acids for cysteine proteases (15Shenai B.R.

Sanderson S.J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether additional cleavage sites exist within the COOH-terminal half of the recombinant protein, the 972–1,491 amino acid segment of ankyrin was cloned into pET32a vector, which encodes His6 tag at both ends (Fig. 2A). Recombinant protein expressed in E. coli was bound to Ni-NTA resin and digested with thrombin to remove the NH2-terminal His6 tag followed by digestion with falcipain-2. As shown in Fig. 2B, lane 2, thrombin digestion produced two major protein bands of ∼61 and ∼11 kDa. Immunoblot analysis showed that while both bands cross-reacted with anti-His antibodies, only the 61-kDa band cross-reacted with anti-ankyrin antibodies (data not shown). Based on the predicted molecular masses, it is likely that the ∼11-kDa fragment contains the NH2-terminal His tag and the ∼61-kDa band represents ankyrin fragment with a COOH-terminal His tag. Subsequent digestion with falcipain-2 produced a single band of ∼33 kDa in the pellet (lane 3) and a band of ∼28 kDa in the supernatant (lane 4). To determine the precise molecular mass, the supernatant was subjected to MALDI-MS analysis revealing a major peak at 28,475 Da, consistent with a single cleavage site at arginine 1,210, which lies within the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin. Ankyrin Peptide Containing the Cleavage Site Inhibits All of the Known Functions of Falcipain-2—To confirm the specificity of cleavage, we designed two 10-mer peptides. Ankrin peptide (AnkP) (NVSARFWLSD) contains the proposed cleavage site, and peptide AnkPR→E (NVSAEFWLSD) where the arginine was replaced by glutamic acid. To determine the effect of these peptides on FP-2-mediated cleavage of ankyrin, rFP-2 was incubated with recombinant ankyrin fragment bound to Ni-NTA resin in the presence of increasing amounts of peptides (dissolved in Me2SO). Control samples contained the same concentration of Me2SO. As shown in Fig. 3A, peptide AnkP inhibited FP-2-mediated cleavage of ankyrin in a dose-dependent manner. Quantification of the intensity of 27,600-Da band (indicated by an asterisk) by densitometry showed that the peptide AnkP did not inhibit FP-2 activity between 0.1 and 1.0 μm (lanes 3 and 4) but caused nearly 100% inhibition at concentrations of 5.0 μm and above (lanes 5–7) with an inhibition constant K i of ∼2 μm. In contrast, the AnkPR→E peptide had no significant effect on FP-2 activity as compared with the control sample. The effect of synthetic peptides was also tested on FP-2-mediated cleavage of intact ankyrin and protein 4.1 associated with erythrocyte membrane IOVs. rFP-2 was incubated with IOVs at pH 7.5 in the presence of various amounts of each peptide, and the digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As reported earlier (9Dua M. Raphael P. Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), FP-2-mediated cleavage of ankyrin and protein 4.1 produces a 155- and a 56-kDa protein fragment, respectively. Monitoring the intensities of these protein bands showed that peptide AnkP inhibited FP-2-mediated cleavage of both ankyrin and protein 4.1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the AnkPR→E peptide had no such effect. We also examined the effect of these peptides on FP-2-mediated hemoglobin degradation as described earlier (10Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At concentrations of 5.0 μm and above, the AnkP peptide caused nearly 100% inhibition of hemoglobin degradation, whereas the AnkPR→E peptide had no effect at similar concentrations (data not shown). We next investigated the effect of ankyrin peptides on parasite growth in vitro. Peptides were synthesized by fusing with the 16 amino acid internalization sequence of Antennapedia (Ant) homeoprotein, which permits the uptake of peptides into cells via facilitated diffusion (21Holinger E.P. Chittenden T. Lutz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Walsh M. Lutz R.J. Cotter T.G. O'Connor R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3439-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes infected with stage-specific P. falciparum were cultured in the presence of Ant-AnkP peptide, the Ant peptide alone, AnkP peptide alone, or a mutant form of the Ant-AnkP peptide where the AnkP portion was scrambled to eliminate the signature sequence of the cleavage site (Table I). As shown in Fig. 4, when highly synchronized ring-stage parasites were incubated with either peptide for 24 h, parasites matured to trophozoites in all of the cases (top panel). However, when trophozoite-stage parasites were incubated under identical conditions, virtually no rings were detected in cultures containing the Ant-AnkP peptide. The parasites appeared as condensed round structures, which failed to develop into segmented schizonts or rings (middle panel). In contrast, in control cultures (i.e. those containing Ant peptide, Ank peptide, or the mutant peptide), nearly all of the parasites developed into rings. Quantification of these data is shown in Table II. In the presence of Me2SO, AnkP, or Ant, the trophozoites matured normally giving rise to nearly 100% ring-stage parasites, whereas in the presence of increasing amounts of Ant-AnkP, there was a significant decline in the number of rings and, as expected, the scrambled peptide had no effect on ring formation. Similarly, when the schizont-stage parasites were incubated overnight, virtually no new rings were detected in cultures containing the Ant-AnkP peptide, indicating almost complete block of cell rupture and merozoite release (Fig. 4, bottom panel). The internalization of the Ant-AnkP peptide but not that of Ant, AnkP, or the mutant peptide was confirmed by incubating parasite-infected erythrocytes with the biotin-tagged versions of the peptides for 30 min at 37 °C followed by visualization of the peptides using streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (data not shown).Table IList of peptidesAntRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKAnt-AnkPRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-NVSARFWLSDAnkPNVSARFWLSDScrambled Ant-AnkPRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-NSRSDVFWLA Open table in a new tab Table IIEffect of ankyrin peptide on the growth and development of P. falciparum trophozoites in cultureTreatmentConcentrationRing parasitesμ m%Me2SO100AnkP250100Ant25095Ant-AnkP507310040250<10Scrambled Ant-AnkP250100 Open table in a new tab Localization of Falcipain-2 in Parasite-infected Red Blood Cells—Using biochemical and immunofluorescence assays, a previous study (15Shenai B.R. Sijwali P. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) has suggested that the active mature falcipain-2 is present largely in the food vacuole of trophozoites. This finding appears to be inconsistent with the proposed role of FP-2 in the cleavage of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. To address this issue, we investigated the cellular localization of the FP-2 enzyme using an antibody generated against a unique COOH-terminal peptide sequence found in the mature FP-2 enzyme. Immunoblot analysis showed that the affinity-purified antibody recognized both the inactive proenzyme and the active mature form of recombinant FP-2 (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). This antibody also detected native FP-2 in the trophozoite extract (Fig. 5, lane 3), which apparently contains largely the mature active FP-2. The specificity of this antibody was further confirmed using recombinant FP-3, which shares a high degree of sequence similarity with FP-2 (16Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.R. Gut J. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, lane 4, the FP-2 antibody did not cross-react with recombinant FP-3. The FP-2 antibody was used to visualize the location of falcipain-2 in synchronized parasite cultures by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Smears of trophozoite-infected erythrocytes were fixed in methanol and examined using the affinity-purified falcipain-2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, the antibody stained the entire trophozoite. In addition, fluorescently labeled vesicles or vesicle-like structures of unknown identity were seen extending into the erythrocyte cytoplasm. No staining was detected in uninfected erythrocytes. Co-staining of infected erythrocytes with antibodies to plasmepsin IV, which is present exclusively in the food vacuole (23Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), confirmed that FP-2 is present in the food vacuole as well as in the area that lies outside of the food vacuole (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, we used antibodies against SERP and LWL1 as markers of PVM and its extension, the tubovesicular network, respectively (24Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Li W.-L. Das A. Song J.-Y. Crary J.L. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SERP staining was observed in a ring form surrounding the parasite (Fig. 6B), and the LWL1 antibody showed a punctate staining pattern consistent with the localization of LWL1 antigen in the intraerythrocytic space of the infected erythrocyte (Fig. 6D). Co-labeling experiments with FP-2 and SERP antibodies could not be done because both antibodies were of rabbit origin. A comparison of FP-2 and SERP staining shows that the FP-2 is localized in the PVM as well as in a compartment that is distinct from the PVM. This conclusion is further strengthened when images of FP-2 and LWL1-staining patterns were merged. FP-2 appears to go beyond the area of LWL1 staining. Together, these results suggest that the FP-2 enzyme is in apposition with the inner surface of the erythrocyte membrane. The precise mechanism of merozoite release from host red blood cells is largely unknown; however, considerable evidence now suggests that proteases play an important role in this process. In the erythrocytic stage of malaria parasite, several proteases including cysteine, aspartic, and metalloproteases have been characterized. A number of such proteases are active in hydrolyzing the RBC hemoglobin and are thus probably not relevant to the merozoite release. However, other proteases are expressed at the late stages of parasite development and might play a role during merozoite release from RBCs. Previous studies have shown that the cysteine protease FP-2 is a dual function protease that cleaves hemoglobin at the early trophozoite stage and targets specific components of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton at the late stages of parasite development. We have hypothesized that this latter action of FP-2 may be relevant to the release of malaria parasite from RBCs. Previously, we showed that falcipain-2 cleaves erythrocyte membrane ankyrin near the carboxyl terminus. The removal of the COOH terminus of ankyrin weakened its interaction with the erythrocyte membrane and destabilized the skeletal network. Based on these findings, we postulated that protease-induced ankyrin degradation destabilizes the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which in turn facilitates parasite release (14Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.-C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we initiated studies to determine the precise peptide sequence at the hydrolysis site of ankyrin with the intent to develop specific inhibitor(s) that might block or inhibit parasite release in vivo. To identify the precise cleavage site, a segment of human erythrocyte ankyrin predicted to contain the cleavage site was expressed as a His-tagged protein and incubated with FP-2 and the resulting digestion products were analyzed by MALDI-MS. This analysis revealed that the cleavage site lies immediately after arginine 1,210 of ankyrin. This proposed cleavage site is consistent with the previous observation that both native and recombinant FP-2 show a strong preference for a hydrophobic residue at the P2 position (15Shenai B.R. Sijwali P. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Moreover, amino acids in the vicinity of this cleavage site are also consistent with the known substrate specificity of other papain family enzymes. Most importantly, arginine or lysine at the P1 position, a hydrophobic residue at the P2 position, and phenylalanine at the P1′ position are the preferred amino acids (20Alves L.C. Judice W.A.S. Hilaire P.M. Meldal M. Sanderson S.J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on the mapping of the cleavage site, we designed a 10-mer peptide (AnkP) containing the cleavage site that completely inhibited the enzyme activity in vitro and abolished all of the known functions of FP-2, namely the cleavage of ankyrin, protein 4.1, and hemoglobin. It is noteworthy here that the AnkP peptide is at least 50-fold more potent in inhibiting FP-2 than the protein 4.1 peptide (K i for AnkP is ∼2 μm compared with ∼100 μm for the protein 4.1 peptide) identified earlier (10Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that ankyrin might be a preferred substrate of FP-2 in vivo. To determine the effect of AnkP peptide on the growth and development of P. falciparum, we utilized a recent technique where peptides were delivered into intact RBCs by fusion with the Antennapedia homeoprotein internalization domain (22Walsh M. Lutz R.J. Cotter T.G. O'Connor R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3439-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes infected with stage-specific parasites were incubated with 100–250 μm of the fused peptide (Ant-AnkP). Giemsa staining of thin smears after 6 and 24 h of incubation showed that although the ring-stage parasites matured normally, the development of trophozoites and schizonts was markedly inhibited. <10% of new ring-stage parasites were detected compared with control cultures containing the same final concentrations of Antennapedia peptide, AnkP peptide, or Me2SO. It is noteworthy here that although the Ant-AnkP peptide is likely to inhibit the hemoglobinase activity of FP-2, incubation with trophozoite-infected RBCs did not result in the formation of enlarged food vacuole, a feature indicative of the accumulation of undegraded hemoglobin generally observed with leupeptin (26Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 27Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Rasnick D. Leech J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This inconsistency could be attributed to the fact that leupeptin is a relatively membrane-impermeable cysteine protease inhibitor and enters the infected RBC via the parasite-induced permeation pathways (28Ginsburg H. Krugliak M. Eidelman O. Cabantchik Z.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and therefore preferentially targets the intracellular parasite. In contrast, the Ant-AnkP peptide presumably enters by fusing with the erythrocyte membrane. Consistent with this view, our recent unpublished studies have shown that in the presence of a membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor MDL 28170, an enlarged food vacuole is not formed yet the parasite release is completely blocked (data not shown). Together, our studies suggest that the route of entry of synthetic inhibitors influence their targeting efficiency to different compartments within the parasitized RBCs, thus giving rise to distinct modes of inhibitory functions. Our results, as presented in this paper, identify the falcipain-2 cleavage site within ankyrin and demonstrate that a specific peptide derived from the COOH-terminal end of the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin could effectively block the late-stage malaria parasite development in RBCs. Previous studies have shown that the erythrocyte ankyrin is also a substrate of μ-calpain, an intracellular cysteine protease (29Hall T.G. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10537-10545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although μ-calpain has been recently shown to be dispensable for malaria parasite development (30Hanspal M. Goel V.K. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we reasoned that if AnkP inhibited the μ-calpain activity then the observed inhibitory effect of the peptide on intracellular parasite development may not reflect the sole contribution of FP-2. To test this possibility, we compared the cleavage patterns of ankyrin obtained after digestion with either FP-2 or μ-calpain. Spectrin-actin-depleted erythrocyte IOVs were incubated with either rFP-2 (10Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or with μ-calpain (31Glaser T. Schwarz-Benmeir N. Barnoy S. Barak S. Eshhar Z. Kosower N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. We found that the FP-2 and μ-calpain cleave ankyrin at different sites, producing distinct cleavage products (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the ankyrin peptide inhibits parasite growth by inhibiting the host μ-calpain activity and is consistent with the normal parasite life cycle in μ-calpain null mice (30Hanspal M. Goel V.K. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Finally, to address the issue of whether the erythrocyte membrane skeleton serves as a physiologically relevant target of FP-2, we investigated the cellular localization of the parasite enzyme within infected erythrocytes. Confocal fluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified FP-2 antibodies provided clear evidence of the possible proximity between the FP-2 enzyme and the membrane skeleton during late stages of parasite maturation. Affinity-purified FP-2 antibodies, which specifically recognize both the mature and the proenzyme, showed that the FP-2 is present in the food vacuole, cytosol, and in the vesicle-like structures within the host cytosol. These vesicle-like structures were seen originating from the PVM and reaching to the periphery of the host plasma membrane. Because the native FP-2 in the trophozoite extract is predominantly the ∼27-kDa mature form (Fig. 5, lane 3), it is likely that these vesicles contain the mature active enzyme. Furthermore, the co-labeling experiments with the LWL1 antibody suggest that while the LWL1 staining completely overlaps with the FP-2 staining, there are additional areas of FP-2 staining that are distinct from the tubovesicular network yet localized to the vesicles in the erythrocyte cytoplasm. This unique staining pattern of FP-2 suggests that it may be transported to the host membrane via these vesicles. Furthermore, as predicted for type II membrane proteins, it is possible that the active domain of FP-2 is extruded from these vesicles, thus permitting proteolysis of erythrocyte skeletal proteins without the necessity of the enzyme being released from the vesicles. Considering the cleavage site specificity of FP-2 and the intense staining as well as the location of the parasite enzyme, our results strongly suggest that the FP-2 function is not necessarily restricted to hemoglobin degradation during its intraerythrocytic life cycle. The presence of large amount of FP-2 outside of the food vacuole and near the erythrocyte membrane skeleton is consistent with the proposed involvement of ankyrin and protein 4.1 cleavage in the merozoite release. Future exploration of the trafficking mechanism of FP-2 may lead to the development of specific inhibitors of parasite release from red blood cells.

However, no dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-specific receptors have been evidenced so far in the brain. In this paper, we showed by isothermal titration calorimetry that the DHEA specifically binds to the dendritic brain microtubule-associated protein MAP2C with an association constant of 2.7 × 107m–1 and at a molar ratio of 1:1. By partial tryptic digestions and mass spectrometry analysis, we found that the binding involved the N-terminal region of MAP2C. Interestingly, MAP2C displays homologies with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, an enzyme required for estrogen synthesis. Based on these sequence homologies and on the x-ray structure of the DHEA-binding pocket of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, we modeled the complex of DHEA with MAP2C. The binding of DHEA to MAP2C involved specific hydrogen bonds that orient the steroid into the pocket. This work suggests that DHEA can directly influence brain plasticity via MAP2C binding.

O'Guin K. Rubino H. Garner C. Shafit-Zagardo B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10894-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MAP2 isoforms have been divided into two groups depending on their molecular weight. High molecular weight MAP2s include MAP2A and MAP2B, whereas low molecular weight MAP2s include MAP2C and MAP2D. Expression of MAP2 isoforms is regulated during development. MAP2A is mostly expressed in adult brain, whereas MAP2B is present all along the development of the nervous system (2Riederer B. Matus A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6006-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Conversely, MAP2C is expressed at early developmental stages but is also found in adult retina and olfactory bulb, tissues in which neurogenesis persists in the adult stage (3Charriere-Bertrand C. Garner C. Tardy M. Nunez J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MAP2 belongs to a family of cytoskeletal proteins and is predominantly expressed in dendrites of neurons (4Matus A. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 19-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It regulates neurite extension (5Boucher M. Belanger D. Beaulieu C. Leclerc N. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is associated with the development of neuronal polarity (6Gonzalez-Billault C. Engelke M. Jimenez-Mateos E.M. Wandosell F. Caceres A. Avila J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All in all, these observations suggest that MAP2 plays a significant role in neuronal plasticity. Regulation of MAP2 involves steroids such as estradiol or progesterone (7Reyna-Neyra A. Camacho-Arroyo I. Ferrera P. Arias C. Brain Res. Bull. 2002; 58: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these steroids are also synthesized in the brain for its own use and are therefore called neurosteroids. In pioneering work, Baulieu and co-workers (8Corpechot C. Robel P. Axelson M. Sjovall J. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4704-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) showed in situ synthesis of DHEA and its sulfate form (DHEA-S) in the rat brain, independently of the peripheral endocrine glands. Moreover, they showed that major steroids, such as pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, DHEA, and DHEA-S, are synthesized de novo from cholesterol in different brain cells such as glial cells or Purkinje cells (for reviews, see Refs. 9Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 9: 383-394PubMed Google Scholar, 10Baulieu E.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsutsui K. Ukena K. Usui M. Sakamoto H. Takase M. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 36: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As a consequence, these works opened an emerging field in the study of neurosteroid effects. Among these studies, many focused on the role of DHEA in the brain. Some concluded that DHEA displays a neuroprotective effect against anoxia (12Marx C.E. Jarskog L.F. Lauder J.M. Gilmore J.H. Lieberman J.A. Morrow A.L. Brain Res. 2000; 871: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced injury (13Kimonides V.G. Khatibi N.H. Svendsen C.N. Sofroniew M.V. Herbert J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and amyloid-β toxicity (14Cardounel A. Regelson W. Kalimi M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or even that DHEA stimulates neurogenesis in rat hippocampus (15Karishma K.K. Herbert J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Steroid hormones act mostly via binding to specific nuclear receptors, but they also modulate neurotransmitter receptor function at the membrane level. However, the mechanism of action of neurosteroids in the brain is not fully understood. Another recent breakthrough came from equilibrium binding studies, which evidenced that pregnenolone was able to bind MAP2 and to stimulate microtubule assembly (16Murakami K. Fellous A. Baulieu E.E. Robel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3579-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Plassart-Schiess E. Baulieu E.E. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 37: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These observations clearly suggested that neurosteroids could directly bind on neuronal cytoskeleton and influence its dynamics with potential implication for brain plasticity. We report here that DHEA tightly binds to MAP2C. This binding involved polar and hydrophobic interactions and was essentially localized in the N-terminal extremity. Note that this N-terminal extremity is specific of MAP2 isoforms. It is absent in other MAPs, notably Tau, involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The direct interaction of DHEA with MAP2C raises the possibility that, in addition to the well known steroid hormone-receptor interactions, direct regulation by neurosteroids at the cytoskeleton level may participate in the plasticity of the brain. DNA Construct—A full-length cDNA of rat MAP2C was constructed as previously described (18Gamblin T.C. Nachmanoff K. Halpain S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12576-12586Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, the 5′ NdeI-PstI fragment of pCG2b33 (19Kindler S. Schulz B. Goedert M. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19679-19684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into the 3′ PstI-BamHI-digested fragment of pJBMap2c (20Berling B. Wille H. Roll B. Mandelkow E.M. Garner C. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 120-130PubMed Google Scholar). This new construct was then digested by NdeI and BamHI and subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI-digested pET3a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequence was checked by direct sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA (Biofidal, Vaux-en-Velin, France). We called the new plasmid construct pMap2C. Expression and Purification of MAP2C—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with pMap2C and grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to A 600 = 0.6–0.8. Then protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and bacteria were broken with a French press. The lysate was then centrifuged for 45 min at 20,000 × g to remove bacterial debris. Overnight ammonium sulfate fractionation (35% final) clarified the supernatant. The pellet was finally recovered by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 h, dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against the same buffer. Proteins were first separated on a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–100% in 100 min with a flow rate of 1 ml·min–1). The presence of MAP2C in each fraction was quickly checked by SDS-PAGE and MALDI mass spectrometry (Voyager Elite; Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). Further purification was then done by reverse phase chromatography on a Resource 15 RPC column (Amersham Biosciences). In brief, the reverse phase column was equilibrated in H2O with 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid, and proteins were separated with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (0–100% in 100 min with a flow rate of 1 ml·min–1). One-milliliter fractions were collected, loaded on an SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot with antibodies to MAP2C. Purity of the sample was then checked by ESI mass spectrometry (ESI QTOF; Micromass, Manchester, UK). The fractions of interest were frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, and kept at –80 °C until use. For spectroscopic and calorimetric studies, the protein was resuspended in the appropriate buffer, and concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Peptide Synthesis—The N-terminal fragment of MAP2C (residues 84–120), also present in MAP2A and MAP2B, was assembled in solid phase synthesis according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (21Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptide: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New, York1980: 1-284Google Scholar) with an automated synthesizer (ABI 433A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purification was carried out on a Beckman high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus with a C8 reverse phase column (Merck). All steps of purification were carried out at pH 4.5. Success of the synthesis was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry on a single quad PESCIEX API 150ex (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amino acid analyses were performed on a Beckman model 6300 analyzer. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Experiments— SDS-PAGE was performed on 15% polyacrylamide slab gels by standard procedures. For quick control of purification steps, the gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and analyzed for the presence of MAP2C. Alternatively, to check the purity of MAP2C, the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and submitted to Western blot experiments with homemade polyclonal antibodies to MAP2C. Mass Spectrometry—Molecular mass of the protein was determined by ESI mass spectrometry (ESI QTOF; Micromass), and tryptic digestions were analyzed by MALDI (Voyager Elite; Perseptive Biosystems Inc.). In brief, for ESI mass spectrometry, samples were mixed with acetonitrile, 1% formic acid (1:1, v/v). For MALDI experiments, 0.5 μlof sample was crystallized with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Spectra were recorded in linear mode with a Voyager MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA). Tubulin Polymerization—Tubulin was purified from porcine brain as previously described (22Barbier P. Peyrot V. Leynadier D. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tubulin was equilibrated in polymerization buffer (3.4 m glycerol, 20 mm NaPi, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm GTP, pH 6.5) by two successive runs on a Sephadex-G25 column (Amersham Biosciences). We used 15 μm tubulin for assembly with and without 3 μm MAP2C. The reaction components were mixed at 4 °C and transferred into a precooled cuvette at 4 °C. Assembly was induced by increasing the temperature to 37 °C. Polymerization was then monitored by recording the increase in absorbance at 350 nm through turbidimetry with a spectrophotometer (DU 7400; Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Depolymerization was induced by decreasing the temperature to 4 °C. Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD spectra were recorded in the 178–260-nm range on a Jobin-Yvon UV CD spectrophotometer (MARK VI; Long-Jumeau, France). The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. A ratio of 2:1 was found between the positive CD band at 290.5 nm and the negative band at 192.5 nm. The measurements were carried out at 20 °C using 0.005-cm path length cells. Spectra were recorded in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, and the base-line signal was removed from the final spectrum. Data were collected at 0.5-nm intervals with a scan rate of 3 nm/min. The circular dichroism spectrum was reported as Δϵ per amide. Protein concentration was determined by the Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc.). Data were analyzed with the method of Manavalan and Johnson (23Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This method uses 32 reference proteins with known secondary structures determined from high resolution x-ray crystallography data to deduce the secondary structure. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—For ITC experiments, MAP2C was resuspended in 50 mm MES buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8, or in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against the same buffer for 2 h to remove any remaining trifluoroacetic acid counterions. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. DHEA was dissolved in 100% isopropyl alcohol or in 100% methanol and then diluted with the buffer to ensure a final concentration of 10% isopropyl alcohol or 20% methanol. For the corresponding ITC experiments, 10% isopropyl alcohol or 20% methanol was added to the protein solution. Binding of MAP2C to DHEA was carried out at 25 °C using a MicroCal MCS titration calorimeter (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA). The enthalpy of binding (ΔH), the affinity constant (K a), and the molar binding stoichiometry (N) were obtained with the following procedure. Ten-microliter aliquots of DHEA (2 × 10–4m) were injected with a 250-μl microsyringe into the 1.34-ml calorimeter cell containing the protein solution (at about 2 × 10–5m) to achieve a complete binding isotherm. The heat of dilution was measured by injecting the ligand into the buffer solution. The value obtained was subtracted from the heat of reaction to obtain the effective heat of binding. Titration curves were fitted using the MicroCal Origin software, assuming one set of sites. Changes in free energy ΔG and entropy ΔS were calculated from the following relationship. ΔG=-RTlnKa=ΔH-TΔS(Eq. 1) Tryptic Digests of MAP2C—MAP2C (50 μg) with and without DHEA was mixed with 0.5 ng of trypsin and incubated at 37 °C. Digestions were stopped after 15 to 45 min by the addition of 5% formic acid. Samples were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectrometry. Secondary Structure Predictions—The profile network prediction Heidelberg (PHD) method was used to predict MAP2C secondary structure. This software developed by Rost and Sander (24Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar, 25Hobohm U. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) predicts the secondary structure of proteins from multiple sequence alignments (available on the World Wide Web at cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predict-protein/). Secondary structure is predicted through neural networks, based on 126 known three-dimensional protein structures, rating at an expected average accuracy >72% for the three states: helix, strand, and loop. In our alignments, however, we used only predictions with an average accuracy of >82% to be more confident with our results. Sequence Alignment and Molecular Modeling—The DHEA-binding pocket of the 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (17β-HSD1) crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3DHE) is made of six regions. These six regions were well aligned with the MAP2C sequence by the ClustalX program (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35505) Google Scholar). Five of them aligned with the N-terminal sequence of MAP2C (residues 1–14, 47–53, 58–61, 67–71, and 108–119), whereas only one region aligned with the C-terminal sequence (residues 295–310). We then used these six aligned regions to build the DHEA-binding pocket of MAP2C by structural homology with the 17β-HSD1 structure, according to the main principles outlined by Greer (27Greer J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For this, we first built the MAP2C backbone of each of these six regions with the software TITO (Tool for Incremental Threading Optimization (28Labesse G. Mornon J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); available on the World Wide Web at bioserv.cbs.cnrs.fr/). This software allows one to generate the backbone of a protein of unknown structure that displays sequence homologies with a protein of known structure. However, at this step, only the backbone and not the lateral chains was obtained. Therefore, in a second step, we used the MaxSprout software (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/maxsprout/) for generating the amino acid side chains. Third, to construct the final DHEA binding site of MAP2C, we superimposed the six regions of MAP2C with the homologous regions of the DHEA-binding pocket of 17β-HSD1. For that purpose, we used the Accelrys software InsightII and Builder modules (San Diego, CA), run on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station (SGI, Mountain View, CA). Then we positioned the DHEA molecule in the pocket of MAP2C, as it appears in 17β-HSD1. All of these steps allowed us to build a model of the DHEA-binding pocket of MAP2C. Purification Procedures Respected the Functional Integrity of MAP2C—Procedures described in the literature generally use heat to purify microtubule-associated proteins. To avoid such treatment for preventing protein denaturation, we employed milder conditions in our purification scheme. As shown by SDS-PAGE, ion exchange chromatography produced an enriched fraction of MAP2C with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). This observation was confirmed by Western blot experiments with polyclonal antibodies to MAP2C (Fig. 1A, lane 2). This fraction was further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to a high level of purity (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1B) showed a MAP2C molecular mass of 49,172 ± 5 Da. This molecular mass corresponds to the full-length protein without the N-terminal methionine, which is often cleaved by bacteria. Nonetheless, this result indicated a discrepancy with the apparent molecular size observed by SDS-PAGE. This behavior suggested a nonglobular three-dimensional pattern of microtubule-associated proteins, as previously reported (19Kindler S. Schulz B. Goedert M. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19679-19684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD spectrum was characterized by a negative band at 200 nm, which is usually associated with random coil structures (Fig. 2). However, that the intensity of this band was low relative to CD spectra of peptides in full random coil (30Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that other secondary structures exist in this protein. Analysis of this spectrum according to the method of Manavalan and Johnson (23Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) indicated 31% β-turns, 21% β-sheet or extended structures, and 4% α-helices (Table I). The circular dichroism spectrum of an α-helix is characterized by three bands, a positive and a negative contribution at 190 and 207 nm, respectively, due to π-π* transitions and a negative contribution at 222 nm due to n-π* transitions (30Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MAP2C spectrum did not show a positive contribution at 190 nm, indicating a very low content in α-helices. However, the high content of β-turns and the negative contribution at 185 nm observed with type II β-turn might explain the absence of an α-helix positive contribution at 190 nm. Finally, to check the functionality of our purified preparation of MAP2C, we performed tubulin polymerization assays. Indeed, MAPs are characterized by their ability to promote tubulin polymerization and to stabilize microtubules. Therefore, we performed tests with and without MAP2C. As expected, with MAP2C, we observed a left shift of the spectrum, indicating that MAP2C increased microtubule nucleation and polymerization (Fig. 3). The increase in plateau and the slower decrease induced by lowering the temperature to 4 °C showed that MAP2C increased the stabilization of microtubules. These results indicated that purified MAP2C was functional. We therefore investigated the possible binding of DHEA to this functional MAP2C.Fig. 2Secondary structure of MAP2C.

ITC is the method of choice for measuring interactions between proteins and small ligands. This method gives direct access to all thermodynamic parameters of the interaction: K a (affinity constant), ΔG (free energy), ΔH (enthalpy), ΔS (entropy), and n (number of sites). As a consequence, we can deduce the information about the type of interactions between the ligand and the protein. A negative ΔH value reflects polar interactions and Van der Waals contacts, and a positive ΔS reflects hydrophobic contacts. A typical set of data in 50 mm MES, pH 6.8, is shown in Fig. 4A. The upper plot represents the raw calorimetric data for the ligand-into-protein titration, and the lower plot represents the binding isotherm. DHEA bound to MAP2C with a strong affinity (K a = 2.7 × 107m–1), which revealed the specificity of interaction, and with a stoichiometric of 1:1. In addition, DHEA binding resulted in a strong exothermic effect (ΔH = –34 ± 5 kJ·m–1). This high enthalpy was due to a combination of the binding itself, mainly via polar or Van der Waals interactions, and the buffer ionization. Therefore, to determine the contribution of buffer ionization to the thermodynamic values and to calculate the entropy (ΔS), we performed the same experiment in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, a buffer with no heat of ionization (versus 3.3 kJ·m–1 for MES). With phosphate buffer, the difference between values measured in MES and phosphate buffers were attributable solely to proton exchange occurring during the binding of DHEA. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, the enthalpy changed sharply for the binding of DHEA to MAP2C (ΔH = –10 ± 8kJ·m–1), whereas the affinity remained constant (K a = 9.7 × 106m–1). We therefore concluded that several protons were exchanged during the binding of DHEA. However, their exact number was difficult to determine because the signal in phosphate buffer was extremely low and because it gave an inaccurate ΔH value. ΔH (ΔH = –10 ± 8 kJ·m–1) and ΔS (ΔS = 0.101 ± 0.01 kJ·m–1) values showed that the DHEA binding was both enthalpically and entropically driven, indicating that the number of polar and hydrophobic interactions increased due to DHEA binding. We therefore wanted to look at the region in which DHEA binds to MAP2C. We then looked for the DHEA binding domain of MAP2C by tryptic digestion experiments (see below). The N-terminal Extremity of MAP2 Binds DHEA—To look at the DHEA binding region of MAP2C, we performed limited proteolytic digestions with trypsin, with and without DHEA, and we analyzed the fragments by mass spectrometry (Table II). We found that, with DHEA, the entire N-terminus (residues 1–120) was more resistant to cleavage. With DHEA, Lys10 and Arg93 were transiently resistant to cleavage, whereas Lys112 and Lys117 remained uncleaved even after 45 min of digestion. Because three of these amino acids (Arg93, Lys112, and Lys117) were very close in the sequence, we looked more precisely around this region. Using PHD software that predicts protein secondary structure, we observed the presence of scarce α-helices and β-sheets localized at both extremities of MAP2C (Fig. 5). In addition, the region including the three amino acids Arg93, Lys112, and Lys117 and encompassing the 84–120 region was predicted to be structured with α-helices. Interestingly, this 84–120 sequence is absent from Tau, which is unable to bind pregnenolone, a precursor of DHEA (16Murakami K. Fellous A. Baulieu E.E. Robel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3579-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We then synthesized the 84–120 N-terminal peptide to confirm these results by monitoring DHEA binding to MAP2C in this N-terminal region.Table IIVariations of MAP2C tryptic digestion without and with DHEAAmino acidMAP2CMAP2C + DHEA15 min45 min15 min45 minLys10++-+Arg93++-+Lys112++--Lys117-+-- Open table in a new tab An Additional Region Is Required for the Binding of DHEA— Circular dichroism experiments showed that the 84–120 N-terminal peptide adopted a random coil structure in phosphate buffer. However, in the presence of moderate TFE concentrations (up to 23%), it adopted an α-helix structure (Fig. 6). This result indicated its propensity to fold in α-helix as predicted by the PHD method. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with the 84–120 N-terminal peptide did not reveal any signal of DHEA binding (not shown). We therefore concluded that additional regions of MAP2C were necessary for DHEA binding. Most probably, the binding is ensured by the whole N-terminal and also other regions of MAP2C that confer a three-dimensional structural motif. To identify these regions, we performed a sequence homology comparison between MAP2C and DHEA-binding proteins. MAP2C Shared Sequence Homologies with Steroid-binding Proteins—To localize the DHEA binding site of MAP2C, we looked at the structure of steroid-binding proteins available in the Protein Data Bank. Interestingly, we found that 17β-HSD1 was co-crystallized with DHEA (31Han Q. Campbell R.L. Gangloff A. Huang Y.W. Lin S.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1105-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 17β-HSD1 belongs to a family of enzymes required for the synthesis of active androgens and estrogens. Surprisingly, MAP2C showed sequence homologies with 17β-HSD1, especially with the DHEA binding site of 17β-HSD1 (Fig. 7). These homologies included five N-terminal regions of MAP2C (Met1–Trp14, Gly47–Glu53, Phe58–His61, Tyr67–Lys71, Gly108–Asp119), which are localized in the 1–120 N-terminal sequence (Fig. 7A), and one additional C-terminal region of MAP2C (Ala295–Leu310) (Fig. 7B). Indeed, Met1–Trp14 and Gly108–Asp119 regions contain amino acids previously identified by tryptic digestion (Lys10 and Arg112/Arg117, respectively)."
https://openalex.org/W2014813847,"In neutrophils, coupling of chemoattractants to their cell surface receptor at low temperature (≤15 °C) leads to receptor deactivation/desensitization without any triggering of the superoxide anion-generating NADPH-oxidase. We show that the deactivated formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) can be reactivated/resensitized by the cytoskeleton-disrupting drug cytochalasin B. Such cytoskeleton-dependent receptor reactivation occurs also with the closely related receptors FPR-like-1 and C5aR but not with the receptors for interleukin-8 and platelet-activating factor. The reactivation state was further characterized with FPR as a model. The signals generated by receptor reactivation induced superoxide production that was terminated in 5–8 min, after which the neutrophils entered a new state of homologous deactivation. FPR antagonists were potent inhibitors of the superoxide production induced by the reactivated receptors, suggesting that the occupied receptors turn into an actively signaling state when the cytoskeleton is disrupted. The signals generated by the reactivated receptor were pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating involvement of a G-protein. However, no transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ accompanies the NADPH-oxidase activation. This was not due to a general down-regulation of phospholipase C/Ca2+ signaling, and despite the fact that no intracellular Ca2+ transient was generated, protein kinase C still appeared to be involved in the response. Further, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and MEK all participated in the generation of second messengers from the reactivated receptors. In neutrophils, coupling of chemoattractants to their cell surface receptor at low temperature (≤15 °C) leads to receptor deactivation/desensitization without any triggering of the superoxide anion-generating NADPH-oxidase. We show that the deactivated formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) can be reactivated/resensitized by the cytoskeleton-disrupting drug cytochalasin B. Such cytoskeleton-dependent receptor reactivation occurs also with the closely related receptors FPR-like-1 and C5aR but not with the receptors for interleukin-8 and platelet-activating factor. The reactivation state was further characterized with FPR as a model. The signals generated by receptor reactivation induced superoxide production that was terminated in 5–8 min, after which the neutrophils entered a new state of homologous deactivation. FPR antagonists were potent inhibitors of the superoxide production induced by the reactivated receptors, suggesting that the occupied receptors turn into an actively signaling state when the cytoskeleton is disrupted. The signals generated by the reactivated receptor were pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating involvement of a G-protein. However, no transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ accompanies the NADPH-oxidase activation. This was not due to a general down-regulation of phospholipase C/Ca2+ signaling, and despite the fact that no intracellular Ca2+ transient was generated, protein kinase C still appeared to be involved in the response. Further, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and MEK all participated in the generation of second messengers from the reactivated receptors. Human neutrophil granulocytes constitute an important part of our innate immune defense against microbial infections, and the bactericidal activities performed by these cells rely on the ability to recognize and be guided by chemoattractants and other inflammatory mediators (1Matsukawa A. Hogaboam C.M. Lukacs N.W. Kunkel S.L. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 339-358PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for recognition and signaling in response to chemoattractants such as C5a, platelet-activating factor (PAF), 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; IL, interleukin; FPR, formyl peptide receptor; fMLF, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; Boc-FLFLFL, Boc-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu; MAPT, 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid; FPRL1, formyl peptide-like receptor 1; C5aR, C5a receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor. interleukin-8 (IL-8), and formylated peptides is the binding to and activation of specific receptors (2Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), resulting in directed migration, granule mobilization, and activation of the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase. The chemoattractant receptors can be recruited to the cell surface from intracellular storage organelles (3Almkvist J. Faldt J. Dahlgren C. Leffler H. Karlsson A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Borregaard N. Theilgaard-Monch K. Sorensen O.E. Cowland J.B. Curr. Opin.

Immun. 2002; 70: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the responses are not only influenced by the degree of receptor exposure on the cell surface but also by the survival time of its activated state and the time required for termination of the signals from the occupied receptor (6Szaszi K. Korda A. Wolfl J. Paclet M.H. Morel F. Ligeti E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The classical chemoattractant receptors in phagocytes include the formyl peptide receptor (FPR). The FPR belongs to the pertussis toxin-sensitive, G-protein-linked receptor family that is defined by a seven-transmembrane domain structure (2Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Verghese M.W. Barr A.J. Zhelev D.V. Snyderman R. Immunol. Res. 2000; 22: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to seven-transmembrane domain receptors creates a receptor-ligand complex that through a G-protein activates several down-stream signaling pathways, including the phospholipase C/inositol phosphate pathway responsible for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and a transient elevation of intracellular calcium (8Andersson T. Dahlgren C. Pozzan T. Stendahl O. Lew P.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 437-443PubMed Google Scholar, 9Katanaev V.L.

Following activation, deactivation mechanisms are put into action, and the resulting nonsignaling, deactivated, receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed and either degraded or recirculated back to the plasma membrane (11Gilbert T.L. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 12Gripentrog J.M. Jesaitis A.J. Miettinen H.M. Biochem.

McLeish K.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Termination of the chemoattractant-induced response is rapid and renders the cells refractory to further stimulation with the same agonist (7Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Verghese M.W. Barr A.J. Zhelev D.V. Snyderman R. Immunol. Res. 2000; 22: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Riccobene T.A. Omann G.M. Linderman J.J. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 200: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This loss of cellular responsiveness, commonly termed homologous desensitization, is present in many hormonal and neurotransmitter signaling systems (16Kardos J. Nyikos L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 642-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied receptor by specific receptor kinases has been suggested to be an important mechanism for both the termination of signaling and internalization of the occupied receptors (18Christophe T. Rabiet M.J. Tardif M. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, the neutrophil response to FPR agonists is both augmented and prolonged in the presence of cytochalasin B (a drug that inhibits reorganization of actin polymers) (19Stossel T.P. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1999: 661-679Google Scholar), suggesting that the cytoskeleton also takes part in terminating receptor signaling. The molecular basis for such cytoskeleton-dependent termination of FPR signaling is suggested to be a direct cessation of the transmembrane signals when the ligated receptor binds to the cytoskeleton, an event known to follow shortly after binding of the chemoattractant to its receptor (20Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13662-13669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Bokoch G.M. Allen R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fact, the association of the agonist-occupied receptor to cytoskeletal components induces a physical segregation of the G-protein and the receptor into different plasma membrane domains (20Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13662-13669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jesaitis A.J. Klotz K.N. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). If binding of the ligand takes place at a nonphysiological temperature (at or below 15 °C), the chronological order in which the signaling/activation/deactivation steps normally occur is broken. The signaling events leading to receptor internalization, secretion, and activation of the NADPH-oxidase are by-passed at 15 °C (20Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13662-13669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu L. Harbecke O. Elwing H. Follin P. Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2463-2468PubMed Google Scholar), and the receptor is directly associated with the cytoskeleton and deactivated/desensitized. This process occurs without triggering a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (24Lundqvist H. Gustafsson M. Johansson A. Sarndahl E. Dahlgren C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As outlined above, activation, deactivation/desensitization, and possibly reactivation/resensitization of chemoattractant receptors are complex and highly regulated processes. In the literature, desensitization (as well as resensitization) is commonly defined by the level of receptor phosphorylation, but clearly there are other mechanisms for switching the receptors on and off. From here on we therefore use the word “deactivation” to define the transfer of a receptor into a nonsignaling mode and the word “reactivation” to designate the shift of the deactivated receptor into an actively signaling state. These definitions are used without reference to the phosphorylation state of the receptors. We show here that deactivated FPR can be reactivated by cytochalasin B-induced uncoupling from the cytoskeleton, leading to NADPH-oxidase activation. The signaling by reactivated FPR is unique in that no transient elevation of intracellular calcium accompanies the NADPH-oxidase activation. Following the reactivation the cells are transferred into a novel deactivated state. The same type of cytoskeleton-dependent receptor reactivation occurs with some, but not all, of the other neutrophil seven-transmembrane domain chemoattractant receptors. Isolation of Human Neutrophils—Human peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from buffy coats obtained from apparently healthy blood donors using dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation (25Boyum A. Lovhaug D. Tresland L. Nordlie E.M. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 34: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The isolated neutrophils were washed and subsequently suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (containing 10 mm glucose, 1 mm Ca2+ and 1.5 mm Mg2+ at pH 7.3 (KRG)) to a final concentration of 107/ml. The cell suspensions were stored on melting ice until use. Chemoattractants and Receptor Antagonists—The hexapeptide Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-d-Met-NH2 (WKYMVm) was synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). The formylated peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), C5a, PAF, IL-8, and the FPR antagonist Boc-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu (Boc-FLFLFL) were from Sigma. Cyclosporin H was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland). C5a, IL-8, and PAF were dissolved in water, whereas the other peptide agonists and antagonists were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to 10–2m and stored at –70 °C until use. Further dilutions were made in KRG. Neutrophil NADPH-oxidase Activity—Neutrophil production and release of superoxide anions was measured by means of an isoluminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay (26Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The chemiluminescence activity was measured in a six-channel Biolumat LB 9505 apparatus (Berthold Co., Wildbad, Germany), using disposable 4-ml polypropylene tubes with a 900-μl reaction mixture containing 105–106 neutrophils, horseradish peroxidase (4 units), and isoluminol (20 μm). When deactivated cells were used the vials also contained fMLF (10–7m). The measuring tubes were equilibrated for at least 5 min (or sometimes incubated for extended periods) at 37 °C, the cells were activated either by addition of a peptide agonist or cytochalasin B, and the light emission was recorded continuously. By a direct comparison of the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence, 7.2 × 107 counts were found to correspond to production of 1 nmol of superoxide (a millimolar extinction coefficient for cytochrome c of 21.1 was used). Details about the chemiluminescence technique are given in Ref. 26Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar. Determination of Changes in Cytosolic Calcium—Neutrophils at a density of 2 × 107/ml in Ca2+-free KRG supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.1%), were incubated with acetoxymethylated fura-2 (2 μm) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in KRG, adjusted to 2 × 107/ml, and kept protected from light on ice until use. The same loading protocol was used for MAPT/acetoxy-methylated with a final concentration of 20 μm. The fura-2 fluorescence was measured with a luminescence spectrometer (LS50B; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C (27Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106/ml) with or without fMLF (10–7m) were equilibrated for 5 min at 37 °C, after which cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) was added. The fluorescence change was followed using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm, and the [Ca2+]i, was calculated as described earlier (28Dahlgren C. Christophe T. Boulay F. Madianos P.N. Rabiet M.J. Karlsson A. Blood. 2000; 95: 1810-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Receptor Exposure by FACS Analysis—The exposure of FPR was determined as described earlier (23Liu L. Harbecke O. Elwing H. Follin P. Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2463-2468PubMed Google Scholar). In short, control cells (incubated for 10 min at 15 °C followed by 10 min at 37 °C), desensitized cells (incubated with10–7m fMLF for 10 min at 15 °C followed by 10 min at 37 °C), and resensitized cells (incubated with 10–7m fMLF for 10 min at 15 °C and the at 37 °C for 5 min, after which and cytochalasin B was added and the incubation was continued for another 5 min) were washed, resuspended, and stored in ice-cold KRG. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated formylated peptide (fluorescein isothiocyanate-fLLFLYK, Molecular probes; 1 × 10–7m final concentration ± 2 × 10–6m unlabeled peptide) was added to neutrophils and allowed to incubate with the cells for 20 min at 4 °C. The amount of bound probe was determined by flow cytometry. Deactivation and Reactivation—To deactivate neutrophils, the cells were first equilibrated for 10 min at 15 °C. The chemoattractant fMLF (10–7m) was added, and the incubation was continued at 15 °C for an additional 5 min (24Lundqvist H. Gustafsson M. Johansson A. Sarndahl E. Dahlgren C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cells were equilibrated at 37 °C, and reactivation was achieved by addition of cytochalasin B. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test (two-sided) was employed to determine statistical significances. Reagents—Horseradish peroxidase was from Roche Applied Science. Isoluminol, cytochalasin B, superoxide dismutase, and pertussis toxin were purchased from Sigma. Dextran and Ficoll-Paque were from Amersham Biosciences, and all the signal transduction inhibitors (wortmannin, genistein, calyculin A, SB203580, PD98059, and RO318220) were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The Ca2+ probes (Fura2/MAPT) were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Deactivation of the Formyl Peptide Receptor—Resting neutrophils challenged with the chemotactic peptide fMLF at 37 °C were rapidly activated to generate superoxide anion (Fig. 1A). The maximal production was reached within the first minute, and the response was terminated within 3–4 min. Neutrophils that had first been incubated with fMLF at 15 °C and then transferred to 37 °C did not respond with an oxidative burst (data not shown and Ref. 13Klotz K.N. Jesaitis A.J. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Neither did these cells respond to further fMLF stimulation at 37 °C, i.e. they were deactivated (Fig. 1A). The hexapeptide WKYMVm can activate cells through the FPR but is a more potent agonist for the formyl peptide-like receptor 1 (FPRL1) (27Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and, as illustrated by the fact that the neutrophils deactivated to fMLF responded to WKYMVm (Fig. 1B), the deactivation was stimulus/receptor-specific. Uncoupling of the Deactivated FPR with Cytochalasin B (Reactivation)—The deactivation at 15 °C is achieved through binding of the receptor-ligand complex to the cytoskeleton, subsequently leading to a lateral segregation of the occupied receptor from the signaling heterotrimeric G-protein (13Klotz K.N. Jesaitis A.J. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Liu L. Harbecke O. Elwing H. Follin P. Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2463-2468PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have shown that neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species in response to chemoattractants such as fMLF or C5a is both prolonged and increased when induced in the presence of the cytoskeleton-disrupting drug cytochalasin B (19Stossel T.P. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1999: 661-679Google Scholar, 20Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13662-13669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bengtsson T. Dahlgren C. Stendahl O. Andersson T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Mukherjee G. Quinn M.T. Linner J.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1999: 607-626Google Scholar). We have investigated the effect of cytochalasin B as a receptor-uncoupler on cells deactivated using the protocol described above. In untreated, nondeactivated cells, no NADPH-oxidase activity was induced by cytochalasin B (Fig. 2A). However, when added to fMLF-deactivated neutrophils, cytochalasin B induced a robust burst of oxidase activity (Fig. 2A), i.e. the cells were reactivated. The duration and magnitude of the response was dependent on the concentration of cytochalasin B and on the time point for addition (Fig. 2, C and D). Typically, when using a final cytochalasin B concentration of 5 μg/ml and a desensitization time of 10 min (equilibration time at 37 °C), the response reached a peak of superoxide production after 3–4 min and returned to a resting value after 5–8 min. The fMLF-induced oxidative burst occurs extracellularly (26Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), and the same applies to the reactivation-induced burst, illustrated by the fact that the activity was reduced by more than 90% in the presence of superoxide dismutase (a cell-impermeable scavenger of superoxide anion). When fMLF-deactivated cells were reactivated by cytochalasin B, the oxidative burst was blocked by the competitive FPR antagonists Boc-FLFLFL (Fig. 3) and cyclosporin H (data not shown), showing that a signaling fMLF/FPR complex is needed for the radical production. The response was inhibited when the antagonists were added at the same time as cytochalasin B as well as when added at the peak of the cytochalasin B-induced cellular response (shown for Boc-FLFLFL in Fig. 3). The concentration of the antagonists was 100 times higher than that of the agonist (fMLF), and when added during the response a reduction of 50% was reached in around 20 s (20.9 ± 4.5 and 20.3 ± 1.6 s for Boc-FLFLFL and cyclosporin H, respectively; mean ± S.D., n = 4). Because removal of superoxide as soon as it is formed (by addition of superoxide dismutase) reduces the chemiluminescence activity immediately (less than 2 s; not shown by figure), the obtained curves reflect the instantaneous levels of superoxide at any given time. This indicates that the time needed for the antagonists to abolish the response really reflects the survival time for the signaling receptor-ligand complex. HL-60 Cells and Receptor Mobilization—In neutrophils, a fraction of the FPR is stored in mobilizable granules (32Sengelov H. Boulay F. Kjeldsen L. Borregaard N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A direct determination of the exposure of FPR during deactivation and reactivation revealed that the number of receptors exposed (determined as specific binding to the cell surface of a fluorescent labeled formylated peptide) decreased during the deactivation process. The level of receptor exposure was low also in reactivated cells, but the presence of cytochalasin B gave rise to a small increase in receptor exposure compared with the level for desensitized cells (Fig. 4). To determine whether up-regulation of new receptors is required for the reactivation by cytochalasin B, we used the cell line HL-60 that lacks the secretory granules and by that the reserve pool of mobilizable receptors (33Johnston J.J. Boxer L.A. Berliner N. Blood. 1992; 80: 2088-2091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated HL-60 cells are equipped with surface exposed FPR and an activable NADPH-oxidase. The same activation and deactivation patterns were obtained when normal neutrophils were replaced with differentiated HL-60 cells, i.e. also these cells were activated to generate reactive oxygen species when challenged with fMLF at 37 °C but deactivated when the peptide was added at 15 °C (data not shown). We found cytochalasin B to be a receptor-uncoupler also in deactivated HL-60 cells, i.e. when cytochalasin B was added to fMLF-deactivated HL-60 cells using the protocol described above, a robust oxidative burst was induced (Fig. 2B). Uncoupling of Other G-protein-coupled, Deactivated Chemoattractant Receptors with Cytochalasin B—The neutrophil receptors that bind the chemoattractants C5a (C5aR), PAF, IL-8 (CXCR1 and 2), and WKYMVm (FPRL1) all belong to the seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-linked receptor family (2Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Binding to these receptors of their respective ligand at 37 °C resulted in activation of the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase. In agreement with the results obtained with fMLF, neutrophils that were allowed to interact with either of the other agonists at 15 °C and then transferred to 37 °C became deactivated, i.e. there was no burst in oxidase activity, and the cells did not respond to further stimulation with the same chemoattractant. Furthermore, cytochalasin B induced a robust burst of oxidase activity in C5a, as well as in WKYMVm-deactivated cells, indicating that also C5aR and FPRL1 could be reactivated by cytoskeletal uncoupling. No such reactivation was, however, induced by cytochalasin B in IL-8- or PAF-deactivated cells. Induction of a New Deactivated/Desensitized State—The reactivation response was terminated within 5–8 min after the addition of cytochalasin B. After cessation of the response the cells could not be reactivated again, by adding either a new dose of fMLF or a new dose of cytochalasin B (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the cells enter a second deactivated state. This state of deactivation is receptor-specific, because the cells are fully responsive to the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (data not shown), as well as to the FPRL1 agonist WKYMVm (Fig. 5C). The Reactivated FPR Signals via a G-protein without Elevating Intracellular Ca2 + —The cytochalasin B-reactivated response was found to be pertussis toxin-sensitive (Fig. 6). This is in agreement with the well known fact that FPR is a G-protein-linked receptor (35Klinker J.F. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 33-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Downstream of the G-protein, activation of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) leads to an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, two second messengers that induce release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and translocate/activate PKC, respectively. Accordingly, when untreated, nondeactivated cells were activated by fMLF, intracellular Ca2+ levels were clearly elevated in a transient manner (Fig. 7A). Such a Ca2+ transient was observed also when cytochalasin B was added to the cells prior to the chemoattractant (not shown). Surprisingly, signaling from the cytochalasin B-reactivated FPR did not induce a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 7B). This inability to respond with a calcium rise was not due to a general down-regulation of the Ca2+ responsiveness because addition of the FPRL1 agonist WKYMVm to the reactivated cells induced a large Ca2+ transient (Fig. 7B).Fig. 7Induction of an intracellular calcium response. Nonde-activated (A) and fMLF-deactivated (B) neutrophils were loaded with Fura-2 (2 μm) and analyzed with respect to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ induced by direct fMLF stimulation (10–7m) (A) or cytochalasin B (CB) reactivation (5 μg/ml) (B) followed by stimulation with WKYMVm (10–7m). The curves are representative of at least four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the reactivation of FPR resulted in superoxide production without any Ca2+ transient, the process was clearly Ca2+-dependent, because no oxidase activity was triggered by cytochalasin B when extracellular Ca2+ was removed through an addition of EGTA (final concentration, 2 mm) or when intracellular Ca2+ was buffered through loading of the cells with MAPT/AM (data not shown). Signal Transduction Inhibitors and Activation of the NADPH-oxidase—To investigate whether the signaling by the reactivated FPR shows unique characteristics apart from the absence of a Ca2+ transient, different signal transduction inhibitors were employed. As previously shown, the products formed by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) were involved as second messengers in the fMLF-induced signaling leading to NADPH-oxidase activation because the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin dose-dependently inhibited both direct fMLF activation and cytochalasin B-induced reactivation of fMLF-deactivated cells (Fig. 8A). This wortmannin inhibition of the reactivation was achieved at much lower concentrations than the direct fMLF-induced activation of nondeactivated cells. Activation of MEK (the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase), the kinase upstream of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), has also been suggested to be involved in fMLF-induced activation of the NADPH-oxidase (36Avdi N.J.

The MEK inhibitor PD98059 was utilized to determine whether this pathway is involved also in cytochalasin B-induced reactivation. The response in reactivated cells was partly inhibited by PD98059, whereas no inhibitory effect was seen for the fMLF-induced response in nondeactivated cells (Fig. 8B).

https://openalex.org/W2010877050,"The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70), including the cognates (Hsc70), are molecular chaperones that prevent misfolding and aggregation of polypeptides in cells under both normal and stressed conditions. They are composed of two major structural domains: an N-terminal 44-kDa ATPase domain and a C-terminal 30-kDa substrate binding domain. The 30-kDa domain can be divided into an 18-kDa subdomain and a 10-kDa subdomain. Here we report the crystal structure of the 10-kDa subdomain of rat Hsc70 at 3.45 Å. Its helical region adopted a helix-loop-helix fold. This conformation is different from the equivalent subdomain of DnaK, the bacterial homologue of Hsc70. Moreover, in the crystalline state, the 10-kDa subdomain formed dimers. The results of gel filtration chromatography further supported the view that this subdomain was self-associated. Upon gel filtration, Hsc70 was found to exist as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and oligomers, but the 60-kDa fragment was predominantly found to exist as monomers. These findings suggest that the α-helical region of the 10-kDa subdomain dictates the chaperone self-association.

Members of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family (Hsp70), including the cognate (Hsc70), are ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that play an essential role in many cellular processes (1Harlt F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar, 2Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies clearly demonstrate that Hsc70 is composed of at least two structural domains. The N-terminal 44-kDa domain contains a nucleotide binding site and possesses a weak intrinsic ATP-hydrolytic activity (3Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schimid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Flaherty K.M. Deluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 5Wang C. Lee M.-R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 30-kDa domain has the capacity to bind unfolded polypeptides (6Hu S.M. Wang C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 322: 163-169Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding of peptides frequently leads to a stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 (5Wang C. Lee M.-R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Moreover, peptide affinity for hsc70 is relatively high in the ADP-bound state but reduced in the ATP-bound state (8Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 9Takeda S. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the activities of these two domains are coupled. It has also been shown that the 30-kDa domain can be further divided into N-terminal 18-kDa and C-terminal 10-kDa subdomains. Although the 18-kDa subdomain contains the binding site for peptides (10Wang T.F. Chang J.H. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsai M.Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5958-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 10-kDa subdomain is necessary for maintaining the peptide-bound state (6Hu S.M. Wang C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 322: 163-169Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several atomic resolution structures of the domains of Hsc70 and DnaK (an Hsc70 homologue in bacteria) have been reported. The N-terminal 44-kDa domain comprises two major lobes whose interface forms a deep cleft for binding of ATP or ADP (4Flaherty K.M. Deluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 18-kDa subdomain consists of a β-sandwich, whereas the 10-kDa subdomain is predominantly α-helical (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 13Wang H. Kurochkin A.V. Pang Y. Hu W.

Nevertheless, this C-terminal tail of most, if not all, eukaryotic Hsc70 is conserved, containing GGXP repeats and an EEVD motif (Fig. 1). Hsc70 must work with other proteins to carry out its diverse cellular functions. In several cases, the sites on hsc70 responsible for the protein-protein interactions have been identified. For instance, the N-terminal 44-kDa domain interacts with both Hsp70-interacting protein (Hip) (16Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and Bcl-2-binding athanogene (BAG-1) (17Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime S.C. Xie Z.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the PTIEEVD sequence at the C terminus is responsible for interacting with a group of tetratricopeptide repeat-containing proteins (20Scheufler C.

J. 2001; 359: 417-426Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, although the C-terminal tail of hsc70 is highly flexible, it plays important functional roles through interacting with specific target proteins. Moreover, the 30-kDa domain has been shown to be responsible for chaperone self-association (23Benaroudj N. Fouchaq B. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8744-8751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Wilbanks S.M. Chen L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. McKay D.B.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It nevertheless remains controversial as to whether the 18-kDa subdomain or the 10-kDa subdomain is critical for this phenomenon (24Wilbanks S.M. Chen L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12095-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Fouchaq B. Benaroudj N. Ebel C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the structure-function relationship of the 10-kDa subdomain, we have determined its crystal structure from rat Hsc70. The polypeptide adopted a conformation significantly different from that of the equivalent subdomain in DnaK. Our results also demonstrated that the 10-kDa subdomain played a dominant role in the self-association of Hsc70. Preparation of Selenomethionine-incorporated 10-kDa Subdomain— Construction of the plasmid pCt-10/R, suitable for expressing the 10-kDa subdomain (amino acids 542–646) of rat Rattus norvegicus Hsc70, was described previously (6Hu S.M. Wang C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 322: 163-169Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified using the Fast-flow nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). For the production of a selenomethionine-incorporated 10-kDa subdomain, the plasmid pCt-10/R was transformed into Escherichia coli BL834(DE3) (Novagen), and the transformants were grown in the LeMaster medium (26LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of wild-type and selenomethionine-labeled polypeptides were subsequently determined using a Bio-Q electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Micromass). The results indicated that four methionine residues were fully substituted by selenomethionine (data not shown). Crystallization and Data Collection—The purified selenomethionine-incorporated 10-kDa subdomain, including the N-terminal His tag portion, was crystallized as described (27Chou C.C. Wang C. Sun Y.J. Shr H.L. Hsiao CD. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method from solutions containing ammonium sulfate as precipitant. The crystals belong to space group P6122 with cell dimensions of a = b = 119.0 Å, c = 166.4 Å, and there are four molecules per asymmetric unit. MAD 1The abbreviations used are: MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion; r.m.s., root-mean-square. data for selenomethionine-labeled polypeptides were collected at the BL18B synchrotron beam line of Photon Factory (in High Energy Accelerator Organization), Tsukuba, Japan. A single crystal was frozen at 110 K using paratone-N (Hampton Research) as cryoprotectant. MAD data was collected at four wavelengths. Two wavelengths were chosen near the absorption peak and the edge of selenium, 0.9793 and 0.9795 Å, corresponding to the maximum f ″ and the minimum f ′, respectively. Two remote energies were selected as references with wavelengths of 0.9400 and 0.9801 Å, respectively. Four sets of data were collected using Quantum 4R CCD detector and the implemented software for monitoring the experimental conditions. All data sets were obtained from a single crystal and then were indexed and integrated using DPS/MOSFLM (28Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1631-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) followed by scaling with SCALA (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structure-factor amplitudes were calculated using TRUNCATE (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). The Patterson difference map was calculated using the anomalous and dispersive differences. Eight of sixteen selenium sites were found. The MAD phases were initially calculated using data between 15.0 and 4.0-Å resolution and were subsequently extended to 3.5 Å. The phases with the mean figure of merit of 0.78 were further improved by the density modification procedure of CNS using the histogram-matching and solvent-flipping techniques. The map showed continuous electron density with a well defined molecular boundary. The assignment of the chemical sequence to the density of the side chains was begun first with the positioning of the eight clear density regions of selenomethionines. The weak side chains were tentatively assigned by alanine residues at this stage. The initial model consisted of the four molecules, A537–A613, B537–B613, C537–C613, and D537–D613, of the asymmetric unit. The refinement was also performed using CNS. The four data sets were averaged with separate Bijvoet pairs and scaled by the ratio of anomalous signal. The first cycle of simulated annealing gave an R-factor of 30% for 15.0–3.5 Å data. This was followed by several iterative cycles of refinement, including bulk-solvent correction, torsion angle dynamics of stimulated annealing, B-factor refinement, and manual rebuilding of the structure using omitted maps. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not applied during refinement because of a large root-mean-square (r.m.s.) difference among the Cα of the four molecules. The final model contains residues A537–A620, B537–B618, C534–C621, D537–D614, and 23 water molecules. The remaining residues of the four molecules, A621–A646, B619–B646, C622–C646, and D615–D646, could not be traced due to their poor electron density maps. Residues preceding position 542 of each molecule are from the His tag. The current model has an R-factor of 24.9% for all reflections above 2 σ between 15.0- and 3.45-Å resolution and an R free of 30.7%, using 5% randomly distributed reflections. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot shows no violations of accepted backbone torsion angles, except for Asn-563 located at loop region of subunit B. HELIXANG and CONTACTS of the CCP4 suite were used to analyze properties of the helices and intermolecular interactions. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1UD0. Preparation of the 60-kDa Fragment—Previously, a plasmid (pHsc70-Ct) suitable for the expression of the 60-kDa fragment of Hsc70 was constructed (11Tsai M.Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5958-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To introduce a His tag at the C terminus of the polypeptide, we digested pHsc70-Ct with NdeI and XhoI. Then, the insert was isolated and ligated with pET-22b (Novagen) treated previously with these two restriction enzymes, resulting in p60K/22b. The plasmid was now used to express the 60-kDa fragment with six histidines at its C terminus. The expression and purification of the tagged protein was described previously (6Hu S.M. Wang C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 322: 163-169Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purified 60-kDa fragment and bovine hsc70 (5Wang C. Lee M.-R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were used for gel filtration analysis, as shown in Fig. 4B. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using an AKTA-FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Hsc70 and the 60-kDa fragment in buffer A (0.1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) were applied to a Superdex200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was operated at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The proteins were detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Identical procedures were utilized for analyzing the 10-kDa subdomain, except that a Superdex75 HR16/60 column was used. The columns were calibrated using a kit range with sizes ranging from 16.4 Å (13.7 kDa) to 85 Å (669 kDa). Structures of the Four 10-kDa Subdomains in the Asymmetric Unit—The topology of four 10-kDa fragments, 10-kDa-A, 10-kDa-B, 10-kDa-C, and 10kDa-D, in the asymmetric unit were essentially the same. They folded into a helix-loop-helix structure comprising an N-terminal short helix (αB′), a 10-residue loop (L), and a 70-Å-long kink helix (αC) (Fig. 2A). The long helix of the four molecules is slightly kinked at two positions. For instance, the long helix of molecule A is bent 10° at Glu-588 and 32° at Val-602. The stability of each molecule was maintained by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the Lys-550 of αB′ and the Asn-575 of αC, as well as van der Waals interactions. In 10-kDa-C, there is an additional intramolecular hydrogen bond between Glu-543 and Gln-585. The pairwise Cα r.m.s. distance measurements of the four molecules indicated that there were some local conformational differences among the four molecules. Although the r.m.s. distance between 10-kDa-A and 10-kDa-B is 1.26 Å, those of others range from 1.64 Å to 1.91 Å. Moreover, the conformation of the loop (from Glu-554 to Asn-563) of 10-kDa-A is similar to that of 10-kDa-D. In contrast, the loops of 10-kDa-B and 10-kDa-C adopt different conformations. For 10-kDa-B, the r.m.s. distance of Cα in the loop region was greater than 2 Å, as compared with other molecules in the asymetric unit, thereby having the most distinct structure (Fig. 2A). However, the GGXP repeats and the EEVD motif at the C terminus were poorly visible, despite the fact that they were present in the polypeptides in the crystalline state. Only the first four to seven residues of the GGXP repeats were visible in 10-kDa-A (residues 615–620), 10-kDa-B (residues 615–618), and 10-kDa-C (615–621). On the basis of the visible portion of the GGXP repeats, the flexible tail in 10-kDa-B pointed toward a direction different from those of 10-kDa-A and 10-kDa-C (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, comparison could not be made between the direction of the tails of Hsc70 and DnaK since the last 32 amino acids are not present in the structure of the 30-kDa domain of DnaK (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Dimer and Oligomer in Crystalline State—In the crystal of 10-kDa fragment, the four molecules form two pairs of dimers, A-B and C-D, respectively (Fig. 2B). The long helices of two interacting monomers wrapped around each other, forming an antiparallel coiled-coil-like structure (Fig. 2B). One salt bridge and six to seven hydrogen bonds are present in each dimer (Table II). They conceivably were responsible for the stabilization of the structures, although they vary from one molecule to another. For instance, in molecules A, B, and D, the Trp-580 was hydrogen-bonded with Gln-595 of the interacting molecule in the dimers, whereas the Trp-580 of 10-kDa-C located between two different dimers was hydrogen-bonded with Asp-572 of 10-kDa-A. Moreover, the Trp-580 of 10-kDa-D formed an additional hydrogen bond with the Glu-591 of 10-kDa-C. Clearly, the partially buried side chain of Trp-580 in the 10-kDa subdomain provides structural evidence for what has been reported of Trp-580 in Hsc70 (31Ha J.H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Table IIThe hydrogen bonding and salt bridge distance (Å) of the four 10-kDa moleculesIntermolecular interaction within the dimer10-kDa-A—10-kDa-BAsp-566 Oδ2Lys-609 Nζ3.49Asn-584 Oδ1Glu-588 Oϵ22.90Asn-584 Nδ2Glu-588 Oϵ12.72Glu-588 Oϵ1Asn-584 Nδ22.95Glu-588 Oϵ2Asn-584 Oδ13.11Trp-580 Nϵ1Gln-595 Oϵ13.28Gln-595 Oϵ1Trp-580 Nϵ13.4710-kDa-C—10-kDa-DAsp-566 Oδ2Lys-609 Nζ3.41Asn-584 Oδ1Glu-588 Oϵ13.37Asn-584 Oδ1Glu-588 Oϵ23.22Glu-588 Oϵ1Asn-584 Nδ22.61Glu-588 Oϵ2Asn-584NNδ23.02Glu-591 Oϵ1Trp-580 Nϵ13.37Gln-595 Nϵ2Trp-580 Nϵ13.47Intermolecular interaction between two dimers10-kDa-A—10-kDa-CLys-550 NζGlu-588 Oϵ23.48Asp-572 Oδ2Trp-580 Nϵ12.89Asp-582 Oδ1Glu-590 Oϵ12.60Asp-582 Oδ1Glu-590 Oϵ22.8010-kDa-A—10-kDa-DGlu-554 Oϵ2Lys-583 O3.45Glu-554 Oϵ2Asn-584 N3.21Lys-567 NζGlu-590 Oϵ23.47Asp-572 Oδ2Glu-591 Oϵ22.90 Open table in a new tab The two dimers in the asymmetric unit crossed each other such that they formed a cruciform structure (Fig. 2C). The tetrameric structure in the crystal was stabilized by the interactions of residues from molecule A with residues from the C-D dimer (Fig. 2C). There are four and five hydrogen bonds between 10-kDa-A and 10-kDa-C as well as between A and D, respectively (Table II). Also, residues at either end of the two interacting dimers were involved in interacting with other symmetric molecules in the unit cell. Consequently, the 48 molecules in the unit cell formed a loose channel with a diameter of 50 Å when viewed along the c axis (Fig. 3). However, the appearance of the channel in the crystal could be misleading since this empty space may be occupied by the unstructured tails of each 10-kDa subdomain. Oligomerization of the 10-kDa Subdomain in Solution— Since the structure implied that the 10-kDa subdomain could form dimers, it now needed biochemical verification to confirm that was the case. We carried out gel filtration chromatography on this 10-kDa subdomain, and the results revealed that several species did co-exist (Fig. 4A). We next undertook to determine whether the 10-kDa subdomain was necessary for self-association. Both Hsc70 and its 60-kDa fragment were subjected to gel filtration analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B, Hsc70 existed as multiple species in solution. Similar, if not identical, results have been obtained previously (32Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the 60-kDa fragment was predominantly monomeric. Therefore, these results indicated that the 10-kDa subdomain played an important role in the self-association of Hsc70. Structural Divergence between the Helical Regions of Hsc70 and DnaK—Comparison between the structures of the 10-kDa subdomain of Hsc70 and that of DnaK (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) was made; the results are shown in Fig. 5A. Evidently, the 10-kDa subdomain of Hsc70 adopted a conformation different from that of DnaK. Although the subdomain of Hsc70 was composed of two helices of αB′ and αC (Fig. 2), the equivalent region of DnaK was composed of four helices, αB–αE (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). This difference became more apparent when the Cα of both structures was superimposed on each other. As shown in Fig. 5A, the αB′ helix of Hsc70 superimposed relatively well on part of the αB helix of DnaK, but the αC helix of Hsc70 did not superimpose on αC–αE helices of DnaK at all. We also modeled the 30-kDa domain of Hsc70 in its peptide-bound state (Fig. 5B). Although the helical subdomain of DnaK was different from that of Hsc70, certain salt bridges could be conserved. For instance, in DnaK, there is a salt bridge between Asp-540 of αB and Arg-467 of the β-sandwich. In our model, Glu-543 (equivalent to Asp-540 in DnaK) at the 10-kDa subdomain formed a hydrogen bond with Arg-469 (equivalent to Arg-467 in DnaK) at the 18-kDa subdomain (Fig. 4B). Indeed, it has been shown that replacing Glu-543 with lysine in bovine Hsc70 results in a 4.5-fold increase in the rate of peptide release and that the mutant could not form stable complexes with the denatured staphylococcal nuclease (33Ha J.H. Hellman U Johmson E.R. Li L. McKay D.B. Sousa M.C. Takeda S Wernsted C. Wilbanks S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27796-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of Arg-469 in rat Hsc70 also brings about a faster release of bound peptides and causes the protein to lose its capacity to form tightly associated complexes with carboxymethyl-α-lactalbumin (34Hu S.-M. Liang P.-H. Hsiao C.-D. Wang C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the salt bridges between the 18-kDa and 10-kDa subdomains in Hsc70 are involved in the maintenance of the substrate-bound state of the protein. Herein, we have solved the crystal structure of the 10-kDa C-terminal subdomain of rat Hsc70. Two major conclusions can be drawn from our study. The first conclusion is that the 10-kDa subdomain is predominant for the self-association of Hsc70. Contrary to our verdict, Fouchaq et al. (25Fouchaq B. Benaroudj N. Ebel C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) concluded that the 18-kDa subdomain is responsible for dimerization of Hsc70 because both the 60-kDa fragment and the 18-kDa subdomain appeared to have the capacity to self-associate. It might be possible that these polypeptides at high concentrations could form oligomers since the 18-kDa subdomain contains the peptide binding site (10Wang T.F. Chang J.H. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Morshauser R.C. Hu W. Wang H. Pang Y. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our result, however, is in agreement with that of Wilbanks et al. (24Wilbanks S.M. Chen L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12095-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using small angle x-ray scattering, they also demonstrated that the 60-kDa fragment is monomeric. In any event, it remains to be determined how dimerization leads to higher order oligomerization and what this self-association means in real life. The second conclusion is that the structure of the 10-kDa subdomain of Hsc70 adopts a helix-loop-helix conformation and that this folding pattern differs from that of DnaK. There are several possible explanations for the observed difference in structures. In the first place, the sequence homology between these two 10-kDa subdomains is low. In particular, the region corresponding to the loop between αC and αD helices in DnaK is distinct. Therefore, different folding of the 10-kDa subdomains between Hsc70 and DnaK might be due to variations in the primary sequences. Secondly, in our structure, the 18-kDa subdomain was not included in crystallization. However, the DnaK fragment used for structure determination contains the 18-kDa subdomain, although it lacks the C-terminal flexible tail. Thus, one simple interpretation is that subdomains in isolation fold differently. Thirdly, the structure of DnaK represents the substrate-bound state of the chaperone. Since substrate binding causes Hsc70 to change from oligomer to monomer (32Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the dimeric structure shown in this study might conceivably correspond to a substrate-free state. Therefore, it raises the possibility that refolding of the C-terminal helices is accompanied by the chaperone switching from monomer to dimer. Obviously, further experiments are required for verifying this hypothesis. We thank Dr. N. Sakabe and staff for helping in synchrotron data collection."

The disulfide bonds are not required for overall structural integrity. The toroidal units have average external and internal diameters of 15 and 7 nm, respectively, and can form stacks in a lateral arrangement of two or three rings. C47S had a pronounced tendency to stack in long tubular structures containing up to 60 rings. Further unusual structural features are the presence of radial spikes projecting from the external surface and ordered electron-dense material within the central cavity of the toroid.

Oxidative stress arises as a consequence of an imbalance in the metabolism of redox-active species. The principal targets of oxidative damage are the key biomolecules of the cell, namely proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Accumulation of these damaged biomolecules is contributory to, or characteristic of, the aging process and several major pathologies, particularly neurodegenerative diseases (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7298) Google Scholar, 2Floyd R.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar).

ROS arise as intermediates in the reduction of molecular oxygen and include the superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical generated via the Fenton reaction. Despite the destructive properties of ROS, in several cases physiological concentrations are required for normal cellular function; indeed some such as hydrogen peroxide serve as second messenger molecules in cell signaling pathways (4Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 5Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). SP-22 is a small (22 kDa) bovine mitochondrial protein, so-called due to its initial identification as a substrate of a mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease (6Watabe S. Hara T. Kohno H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Watabe S. Kohno H. Kouyama H. Hiroi T. Yago N. Nakazawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is exclusively located in the matrix of the organelle, constituting ∼5% of total matrix protein in bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria. SP-22 is a member of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family of peroxidase enzymes, possessing the ability to protect several free radical-sensitive enzymes from inactivation by a metal-catalyzed, free radical-generating system (8Watabe S. Hasegawa H. Takimoto K. Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Watabe S. Hiroi T. Yamamoto Y. Fujioka Y. Hasegawa H. Yago N. Takahashi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Prxs exhibit diverse functions including roles in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, immunity, and infection; however, the recent major focus of research concerns their antioxidant properties (10Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 11Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Netto L.E. Seo M.S. Stadtman E.R. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Prxs can be divided into at least five distinct groups numbered according to their amino acid sequence, tissue distribution, and cellular localization. SP-22 is a 2-Cys Prx containing conserved cysteines at positions 47 and 168 and a third nonconserved cysteine (Cys-66). By amino acid sequence analysis of mature SP-22, Cys-47 was proposed to be the site of catalysis as it contained a sulfinic acid group (12Hiroi T. Watabe S. Takimoto K. Yago N. Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. DNA Seq. 1996; 6: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It was postulated that in the native state of SP-22, the Cys-47 side group forms a sulfenic acid intermediate, enabling it to function as a two-electron redox center. While both 1- and 2-Cys Prx subgroups contain a basic dimeric unit (13Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the 2-Cys group contains intermolecular disulfide bonds that form between the N-terminal residue of one monomer and the C-terminal cysteine of the adjacent subunit as part of the catalytic mechanism (14Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The initial stage of catalysis involves the oxidation of the N-terminal cysteines on both subunits to a cysteine-sulfenic acid by hydrogen peroxide or alkyl hydroperoxides. This moiety spontaneously reacts with the C-terminal cysteine of the adjacent subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide bond coupled to the elimination of water (15Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In order for the 2-Cys Prx to be converted back to its active state, the disulfide bonds are reduced by thioredoxin or DTT in an artificial assay system. The 2-Cys Prxs are thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidases as in vivo these enzymes utilize Trx exclusively as their electron donor (16Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Okada K. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12333-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The reduction of the resulting intramolecular disulfide bond formed within Trx is carried out by the cognate NADP-linked flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase. To date, the oligomeric structures of several Prxs of both the 1-Cys and 2-Cys sub-groups have been determined successfully. A second toroidal decameric form comprising five dimeric units (α2)5 is an increasingly recurring theme, particularly for the 2-Cys members (17Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Schroder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Structure. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Previous published work on SP-22 is extremely limited; therefore, the exact physiological function and biochemical mode of action of the protein remain to be fully elucidated. In this paper we report the overexpression and purification of recombinant SP-22 and analyze its quaternary structure. We highlight some unusual structural features, and we assess the role of the three cysteine residues in its catalytic function and oligomer stability. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant SP-22s—Precursor SP-22 previously amplified from bovine brain cDNA (Clontech) and cloned into the pCRScript plasmid vector was used as the template for the PCR and catalyzed by Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). Specific primers used in the amplification reaction are as follows: forward, 5′-TTC CTC GGA TCC TGCCCC TGC CGT CAC CC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCG CCC GGA TCC CTA CTG ATT TAC CTT CTC-3′. BamHI recognition sites (indicated in boldface) were incorporated to facilitate the subsequent ligation into the pET14b vector (Novagen). Amplification was carried out in a PTC-100™ programmable thermocycler (MJ Research Inc.). Successful amplification was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Site-directed mutagenesis of SP-22 to convert each of the three cysteines to serine residues was performed using the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific oligonucleotide primers were designed, complementary to the region of the gene containing the cysteine residue to be mutated. The annealing temperatures were 45 (C47S and C66S) and 55 °C (C168S). The fidelity of the amplification reactions was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Molecular Biology Sequencing Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, UK. Escherichia coli DE3 pLysS bacterial cells (Novagen) transformed with the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin until an A 600 of 0.5 was attained, prior to induction of protein expression by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were incubated for a further 5 h at 22 °C to promote optimal expression of soluble protein, prior to harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 15 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of starting buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm imidazole and 1.0 m NaCl) prior to passage (four times) through a French pressure cell press (Aminco) at a pressure of 950 pounds/square inch (6.68 MPa). The mixture was centrifuged (13,800 × g for 15 min) and the supernatant retained. His-tagged enzymes were purified on a metal affinity column (10 × 100 mm, bed volume 7.85 ml), containing SelfPack POROS 20 Metal Chelate Affinity Packing using a BioCAD® 700 Series Perfusion Chromatography® work station (PerSeptive Biosystems), according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Zinc(II) ions were loaded onto the matrix, and recombinant proteins were eluted using an increasing imidazole gradient (0.5 mm to 0.5 m) in the same buffer. Protein Concentration Determination of Wild Type and Mutant SP-22s—Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). For more accurate concentration determination of purified protein, the A 280 was measured. The extinction coefficient used for SP-22 and the cysteine mutants was 0.73 (1 mg/ml protein in a cuvette of path length 1 cm), calculated from the amino acid sequence (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—Electrophoresis of protein samples was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). For cross-linking experiments, samples were run on pre-cast 3–8% NuPAGE® NOVEX Tris acetate gradient gels (Invitrogen) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Cross-linking—Cross-linking was carried out according to the method used by White et al. (22White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and then incubated on ice for 5 min prior to centrifugation at 6,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of ice-cold acetone and centrifuged as before. The acetone precipitation step was repeated before final resuspension of the pellet in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (10% (w/v) sucrose, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and a small amount of pyronin Y dye). SDS-PAGE was used to confirm the success of the cross-linking procedure. Assay of SP-22 Protection—The activity of SP-22 was routinely determined by monitoring its ability to protect enolase from inactivation, in the presence of a thiol/Fe3+/O2 free radical-generating system (FRS). Assays were performed in 120 μl of incubation mixture containing 33 μg of enolase, 30 μm FeCl3, 30 mm DTT, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.2, and 3–66 μg of SP-22. Controls omitting each component of the FRS, in turn, were also carried out. The FRS and SP-22 were pre-incubated together for 5 min at 30 °C prior to addition of the enolase. At various time intervals, 20 μl of assay mixture was removed and added to 2 mm EDTA. Samples (30 μl) were then removed and added to 1 ml of assay solution containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm 2-phosphoglycerate. The A 240 was recorded using a UV-2101 Shimadzu PC scanning spectrophotometer over 45 s to monitor the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. Circular Dichroism—Far UV CD spectra over the range 190–260 nm were obtained using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Secondary structure estimations were calculated using the SELCON procedure (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded in a quartz cuvette (path length 0.02 cm) containing purified SP-22 (0.2 mg/ml) prepared in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaF. The CD spectrum was corrected by subtraction of the base-line spectrum (buffer only) from the sample spectrum. Far UV CD spectra were recorded for purified SP-22 (0.5 mg/ml) unfolded over a range of urea concentrations (0–9.5 M) prepared in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaF. Samples were equilibrated overnight at room temperature. To assess the importance of the disulfide bonds for structural stability, unfolding experiments were also carried out in the presence of 20 mm DTT. Transmission Electron Microscopy—As an additional purification step prior to TEM, gel exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature using a pre-packed HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a BioCAD® 700E Perfusion Chromatography® work station. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the volume of protein loaded was 1 ml (recommended < 2% of bed volume). The column was equilibrated with 2 column volumes of 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and calibrated with a MW-GF-1000 molecular weight marker kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SP-22 peak fractions were maintained at 4 °C until used. The single droplet method described by Harris (24Harris J.R. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 18: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was adopted for the negative staining procedure. Approximately 3 μl of SP-22 (50–100 μg/ml) was loaded onto a carbon-coated electron microscope grid (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) for 1 min. Grids were washed with distilled water, stained with a single drop of 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and left to air-dry. Low dose electron micrographs were recorded using a JEOL 1200 EXII transmission electron microscope recording at ×30,000 magnification, ∼600–1,000 nm underfocus, onto S0163 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Two-dimensional averages were calculated using a reference-free alignment algorithm (25Peshenko I.V. Shichi H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Projected radial density profiles were calculated from top views of SP-22 rings, and their radii were estimated by inspection of these plots and the raw images. All image processing was carried out using the SPIDER image-processing package (26Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant SP-22s—The heterologous production of wild type and mutant SP-22s was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells after cloning into the pET14b expression vector. The solubility of SP-22 was found to decrease at higher induction temperatures. Optimal expression of soluble wild type SP-22 and its C47S, C66S, and C168S mutants was routinely achieved at 22 °C after induction by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h. Overexpression of SP-22 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The band at 24–25 kDa corresponded to the predicted M r value of the mature His-tagged forms of the enzymes. Wild type and mutant SP-22s were routinely purified from large scale (500 ml) bacterial cultures by metal chelate affinity chromatography using a BioCAD® SPRINT™ work station. This system was extremely efficient in producing high yields of pure SP-22 (20–30 mg/500 ml culture). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that insignificant levels of contaminating E. coli proteins were present; therefore, no other purification steps were deemed necessary. SP-22 Forms a Basic Disulfide-linked Dimeric Unit—Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of wild type and mutant SP-22s established that SP-22 is isolated in its oxidized form since the protein migrates as a dimeric unit containing two disulfide bonds. Fig. 1 confirms that both Cys-47 and Cys-168 are involved in the formation of these disulfide bonds, since in the absence of DTT the C47S and C168S mutants are in their monomeric form (M1). However, the C66S mutant is dimeric; therefore, Cys-66 does not participate in disulfide interactions. It can be concluded that the disulfide bonds form between the N-terminal cysteine of one monomer and the C-terminal cysteine of the adjacent subunit. Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was used to assess the accessibility of Cys-66 to thiol modification under native and non-native conditions (27Riddles P.W. Robert L.B. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). No cysteine residues were accessible in the fully folded wild type SP-22; however, following denaturation in 6 m guanidinium chloride, approximately one (0.75) thiol group (Cys-66) was modified by DTNB. 2L. J. Gourlay and J. G. Lindsay, unpublished results. This implies that in the native enzyme Cys-66 is buried within the tertiary structure. To confirm that the accessible residue was Cys-66, the assay was repeated for the C66S mutant. As expected no cysteines were accessible in the C66S mutant in both native and denaturing conditions. SP-22 Forms a Larger Oligomeric Structure Corresponding to a Decamer—SP-22 was shown to adopt a larger oligomeric form using nonspecific cross-linking of purified SP-22 (50 μg) with glutaraldehyde and analysis by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. One major protein band was observed at ∼250 kDa, corresponding to a SP-22 decamer (Fig. 2). Four weaker bands were detected at higher mobilities than the decameric band illustrating the intermediate oligomeric states that were found as a result of incomplete cross-linking, corresponding to octamers (∼200 kDa), hexamers (∼150 kDa), tetramers (∼100 kDa), and dimers (∼50 kDa) of SP22 subunits. Minor bands corresponding to higher molecular weight species above 500 kDa were also detected. Following independent SDS-PAGE analysis on a 3% (w/v) sodium phosphate gel (Weber-Osborne) (results not shown), it was established that these higher molecular weight species have molecular masses of ∼500 and 750 kDa. It is proposed that these bands correspond to double or triple stacks of SP-22 rings, observed frequently in electron microscopy studies (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4SP-22 toroid formation and lateral stacking.

CD data were analyzed using the SELCON procedure (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) (Table I). It can be seen that the largest secondary structure contribution is attributed to the α-helical content, constituting nearly 50% of the overall secondary structure. β-Sheet content contributes 29.5% of the overall structure.Table ISecondary structure estimates of wild type SP-22Secondary structureProportion present in overall structure%α-Helix46.3Anti-parallel β-sheet9.1Parallel β-sheet6.6β-Turn13.8Other24.2 Open table in a new tab Assessment of SP-22 Stability—The stability of the SP-22 oligomer was assessed by chemical denaturation with urea. SP-22 was unfolded in increasing urea concentrations at room temperature, incubating overnight to allow equilibrium to be reached. Despite this lengthy incubation period and choice of denaturant, complete unfolding, even at 9.5 m urea, was not achieved as judged by far-UV CD, indicating that the native structure of SP-22 was extremely stable. Between 5 and 6 m urea there is a major unfolding event that is subsequently followed by further gradual unfolding until 9.5 m urea at which stage the oligomer still retains ∼25% of its native ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 3). These results therefore indicate that unfolding of SP-22 does not follow a simple two-state mechanism (native state → unfolded state) characterized by a monophasic denaturation curve. The reduced form of SP-22 was slightly less stable, beginning to unfold in 3.75 m urea (Fig. 3). The major loss of structure occurs in the region of 4–5.5 m urea. As for non-reduced wild type SP-22, unfolding is incomplete, and the protein retains ∼25% native ellipticity in 9.5 m urea. Unfolding experiments were repeated for the cysteine mutants.2 The C66S mutant unfolding profile was comparable with that of wild type SP-22, not unexpected given that the disulfide bonds are intact in this mutant. The C47S and C168S mutant SP-22s exhibited overall reduced stability confirming that the disulfide interactions are necessary for structure stability but not oligomer assembly. To prevent the formation of nonspecific disulfide bond formation during unfolding, the experiments with the mutant SP-22s were repeated in the presence of DTT. The effect of DTT on the stability of the mutant SP-22s was more pronounced for C66S and was minor for C47S and C168S, reinforcing the roles of the disulfide bonds in oligomer stability. Transmission Electron Microscopy—As an extra purification step, wild type SP-22 (purified) was passed down a Sephacryl-300 16/60 HR gel filtration column and, depending on the conditions, eluted as a major peak with an apparent molecular mass of ∼450 kDa (fraction B). Occasionally, a minor peak of aggregated material eluting at the void volume was also observed (fraction A). SP-22 was immobilized on a continuous carbon support and stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Fraction A showed that SP-22 is toroidal with the presence of long stacks comprising multiple rings aggregated in a lateral fashion, a predominant feature. Analysis of SP-22 from fraction B illustrated a prevalence of single rings although there were significant numbers of double and triple toroids (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, side views were predominantly found in comparison with top views implying some interaction of the protein with the grid. Image processing was carried out to investigate the ring structure of SP-22 from fraction B at higher resolution. Protein cross-linking experiments indicate that SP-22 is a decameric toroid. Attempts to demonstrate unambiguous 5-fold symmetry by established methods (28Kocsis E. Cerritelli M.E. Trus B.L. Cheng N. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 60: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. Two-dimensional averages of top views calculated by the reference-free alignment method, however, indicate a slightly angular appearance that is consistent with the three-dimensional reconstruction calculated for peroxiredoxin II (29Harris J.R. Schroder E. Isupov M.N. Scheffler D. Kristensen P. Little-child J.A. Vagin A.A. Meissner U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Radial density profiles were calculated from raw images, and these averages show that SP-22 rings have an internal diameter of ∼7 nm and an external diameter of ∼15 nm. Another feature of the rings, ubiquitously observed in both raw and two-dimensional averages, was the presence of spikes radiating from the outer edge of the ring. The pronounced modulation of staining repeatedly seen in these images is, we believe, too ordered to be an artifact of the staining procedure. Additionally, ordered electron dense material was observed within the central cavity of the majority of rings. This material appears to be regularly organized, displaying distinct structural features (Fig. 4B). It appears this central cavity material is probably part of the SP-22 oligomer, as no contaminating E. coli proteins were detected in a sample of purified SP-22 silver-stained following SDS-PAGE.2 This was also confirmed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects His-tagged proteins. Indeed, silver staining, which can detect 0.1–0.6 ng of protein, and immunoblotting only detected bands corresponding to SP-22, implying the material within the central cavity is part of the overall SP-22 structure and is not contaminating E. coli proteins. Negative Staining of Reduced Wild Type SP-22—To confirm that the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bonds is not essential for decamer formation, the negative staining procedure was repeated for SP-22 in the presence of 20 mm DTT. Reduced SP-22 remains toroidal confirming that the disulfides are not required for structural integrity. A greater proportion of single rings was observed, however, and stacking was less frequent than for oxidized SP-22. As wild type and mutant SP-22s were generated as His-tagged fusion proteins, it is possible that aggregation may be directed by these His tags being tethered together via interactions with contaminating zinc ions from the purification procedure. This would account for the high proportion of single rings observed in the presence of DTT since this reducing agent binds zinc ions with high affinity (30Linder P. Guth B. Wülfing C. Krebber C. Steipe B. Müller F. Plückthun A. Methods (Orlando). 1992; 4: 41-56Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gel filtration studies with thrombin-cleaved SP-22 indicate no significant loss in molecular mass and with the TEM results, suggesting that although the His tags may promote SP-22 to stack, they do not direct it. Interestingly, the apparent molecular mass of SP-22 on gel filtration analysis remained constant at ∼450–500 kDa, regardless of the proportion of single toroids observed by TEM. It is suggested that the high apparent molecular mass relates to the toroidal nature of SP-22, containing a large central cavity that increases its overall effective diameter. Lateral stacks of double and triple toroids of SP-22 have the same effective diameter as single toroids, displaying similar elution characteristics on gel filtration (Fig. 4B). Negative Staining of the C47S Mutant of SP-22—On gel filtration, the C47S mutant showed a single peak at the void volume, corresponding to a molecular mass of at least 2,000 kDa. The structure of this mutant was investigated"

The biological function of these proteins is unknown, although the proteins encoded by Leporipoxviruses have been shown to promote a slow decline in the level of superoxide dismutase activity in virus-infected cells. To gain more insights into their function, we have further characterized the enzymatic and biochemical properties of a SOD homolog encoded by Shope fibroma virus. Shope fibroma virus SOD has retained the zinc binding properties of its cellular homolog, but cannot bind copper. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that it requires at least four amino acid substitutions to partially restore copper binding activity, but even these changes still did not restore catalytic activity. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that recombinant Shope fibroma virus SOD forms very stable complexes with cellular copper chaperones for SOD and these observations were confirmed using glutathione-S-transferase tagged proteins. Similar viral SOD/chaperone complexes were formed in cells infected with a closely related myxoma virus, where we also noted that some of the SOD antigen co-localizes with mitochondrial markers using confocal fluorescence microscopy. About 2% of the viral SOD was subsequently detected in gradient-purified mitochondria extracted from virus-infected cells. These poxviral SOD homologs do not form stable complexes with cellular Cu,Zn-SOD or affect its concentration. We suggest that Leporipoxvirus SOD homologs are catalytically inert decoy proteins that are designed to interfere in the proper metallation and activation of cellular Cu,Zn-SOD.

Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity protects cells from oxidative stress and the importance of the enzyme is illustrated by the effects of Cu,Zn-SOD expression levels on aging (2Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and the association of SOD1 mutations with cases of human familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (3Rosen D.R. Siddique T.

Superoxide dismutases are also expected to serve some role in modulating innate immunity, because O2·¯ is one of several toxicants employed by the cellular arm of the immune system to kill bacteria and virus-infected cells (4Weiss S.J. King G.W. LoBuglio A.F. Am. J. Hematol. 1978; 4: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5Mills E.L. Debets-Ossenkopp Y. Verbrugh H.A. Verhoef J. Infect. Immun. 1981; 32: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cu,Zn-SODs are metalloproteins that depend upon a zinc atom for the maintenance of their structural integrity (6Marmocchi F. Caulini G. Venardi G. Cocco D. Calabrese L. Rotilio G. Physiol. Chem. Phys. 1975; 7: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and employ a copper atom as a catalytic cofactor (7Klug D. Rabani J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4839-4842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The zinc atom is probably acquired by passive diffusion in vivo, but the copper atom is delivered by a “copper chaperone for SOD” (CCS) using a switch-like translocation mechanism (8Hall L.T.

Virology. 2000; 274: 120-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and baculoviruses (18Tomalski M.D. Eldridge R. Miller L.K. Virology. 1991; 184: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most of the poxvirus-encoded Cu,Zn-SOD homologs belong to one of two well conserved structural classes comprising either the Orthopoxvirus genes, which seem to have undergone an extensive process of deletional mutagenesis during the course of viral evolution (19Smith G.L. Chan Y.S. Howard S.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1349-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), or proteins like those encoded by leporipoxviruses, which more closely resemble their cellular homologs (14Willer D.O. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 1999; 264: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The one or more biological functions of the poxvirus-encoded enzymes are still largely unknown. It is noteworthy that all of the poxviral Cu,Zn-SOD homologs characterized to date are catalytically inactive, and a number of mutations might be responsible for this phenotype (13Almazan F. Tscharke D.C. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7018-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutations in the protein sequence do not prevent homodimer formation under oxidizing conditions (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) but might be expected to delete some or all of the metal binding domains in these proteins. The proteins encoded by leporipoxviruses (Shope fibroma virus (SFV) and myxoma virus (MYX)) and by the Orthopoxvirus vaccinia are also abundant virion components. It was thus very surprising to discover that, despite the retention of these genes by many viruses, deleting either the vaccinia A45L or the MYX virus M131R genes seemed to have little effect on growth in culture or on virulence in animal disease models (13Almazan F. Tscharke D.C. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7018-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The only biological effect that has been noted is that Leporipoxvirus Cu,Zn-SOD homologs (“SFV SOD” and “MYX SOD”) inhibit the activity of endogenous cellular Cu,Zn-SOD activities in vivo (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This behavior is unique to Leporipoxvirus SOD homologs, but how and why the MYX or SFV proteins might modulate the activity of cellular Cu,Zn-SOD is unclear. These observations raise several questions concerning poxviral Cu,Zn-SOD homologs that might, if answered, provide insights into the function of these intriguing proteins. First, these genes have clearly undergone an extensive process of mutagenesis, and this has had a particular effect of producing a catalytically inactive protein. What are the multiple mutations responsible for this genetic feature? The answer to this question would establish whether encoding a functional superoxide dismutase has, at any time in the recent evolutionary past, been of some selective advantage for these viruses. Second, it is unclear from a comparison of the protein sequences of viral and cellular Cu,Zn-SOD homologs, what effect the many amino acid substitutions and small deletions have had on the metal binding properties of these proteins. Do the viral enzymes retain the capacity to bind metals and thus perhaps function as Zn and/or Cu chelators? Finally, poxviral Cu,Zn-SODs conserve many of the amino acids that form the interface between cellular Cu,Zn-SOD homodimers and between Cu,Zn-SOD and CCS heterodimers (Fig. 1). If these poxviral proteins have retained the capacity to associate with cellular Cu,Zn-SOD and/or CCS, this would provide a possible mechanism by which leporipoxviruses could perturb the level of cellular superoxide dismutase activity. In the studies that follow we show that Leporipoxvirus SOD homologs have lost the capacity to bind copper but retain the capacity to bind the copper chaperone and bind zinc. These biochemical properties suggest a novel way in which myxoma and Shope fibroma viruses might be using Cu,Zn-SOD homologs to manipulate intracellular concentrations of O2·¯ and thus promote the growth of virus-infected cells. Virus and Virus Culture—All cell lines (BSC40, BGMK, and SIRC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Myxoma virus (strain Lausanne) and vaccinia virus (strain WR) were obtained originally from the American type culture collection, and a vaccinia strain encoding T7 RNA polymerase (VTF7.5) was obtained from Dr. P. Traktman (University of Wisconsin). The construction of a recombinant myxoma virus encoding a deletion of MYX Cu,Zn-SOD (myxΔM131R) and a vaccinia virus encoding SFV Cu,Zn-SOD under the regulation of a T7 promoter (VMM5.2) is described elsewhere (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Viruses were routinely passaged on BGMK or SIRC cells. Expression of recombinant SFV Cu,Zn-SOD in mammalian cells was accomplished by co-infecting BSC40 or BGMK cells with vaccinia VMM5.2 plus VTF7.5 at a multiplicity of two of each virus (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid pDE422 (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H. Virology. 2002; 296: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) encodes the SFV Cu,Zn-SOD open-reading frame (S131R) fused in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). A standard PCR-based mutagenesis technique and mutagenic PCR primers were used to sequentially introduce amino acid substitutions into the SOD domain of the fusion protein. Table I illustrates the primers used and the resulting amino acid substitutions. Multiple amino acid substitutions were introduced in the order H148T → N59H → W157C → V157R creating mutant proteins designated S131R-T, S131R-TH, S131R-THC, and S131R-THCR, respectively. The W157C substitution mutation was also introduced separately into the cloned SFV S131R gene, creating a protein designated S131R-C. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the introduced substitution mutations and to ensure that no additional mutations were present. A plasmid encoding a protein comprising GST fused to full-length human copper chaperone for SOD (CCS) in pGEX4T was obtained from Dr. J. Gitlin (Washington University School of Medicine) (20Casareno R.L. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).

Bacterial cultures were grown to an optical density of one at 30 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. CuSO4 and ZnSO4 were added to final concentrations of 0.1 mm, 30 min later, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation 2 h post-induction. The cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), frozen, thawed, and disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 75 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1% Triton X-100. The debris was removed by centrifugation, and GST-tagged proteins were recovered by chromatography using a GSTrap column. Proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Where indicated, GST-tagged proteins were cleaved overnight at room temperature in Tris-HCl with one cleavage unit of thrombin (Sigma) per 100 μg of fusion protein. Metal Analysis—Affinity-purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed extensively against 2000 volumes of Chelex-100 treated 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) and a bovine serum albumin protein standard, and the copper and zinc contents were determined using a Varian 3000 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Dialyzed bovine Cu,Zn-SOD (Sigma) was used as a control and reference for metal content. The metal content of GST was also measured, and we detected <0.2 mol of zinc and no detectible copper per mole of GST protein. Cu,Zn-SOD Assays—Superoxide dismutase activity was measured by monitoring the inhibition of reduction of ferricytochrome c by hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase (21Quick K.L. Hardt J.I. Dugan L.L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 97: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A solution, containing the test sample and 12 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase in 0.25 ml of PBS, was added to 0.25 ml of PBS containing 120 units/ml catalase, 0.2 mm hypoxanthine, and 0.1 mm ferricytochrome c. The sample was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and ΔA 550 was monitored over an additional 2 min. One unit of activity is the amount of protein required to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c by 50%. Protein Binding Assays—GST “pull-down” assays used extracts prepared from bacteria expressing a GST-hCCS fusion protein. About 50 μl of 50% v/v glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) was added to 1.0 ml of clarified bacterial lysate containing ∼80 μg of fusion protein and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with ∼0.9 mg of mammalian cell protein in 0.2 ml of PBS at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed extensively with PBS, and the protein complexes were released by adding 0.1 ml of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 0.1 m DTT, plus 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Human Cu,Zn-SOD was used as a positive control (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation assays used extracts isolated from virus-infected BGMK cells. The cells were harvested 15–24 h post-infection by lysis with a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant (∼600 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:500 diluted preimmune rabbit serum and ∼50 μl (packed volume) of protein A beads (Sigma) and pre-cleared by centrifugation. The protein content of the supernatant was determined, and 1 mg of protein extract (∼600 μl) was mixed with 5 μg of rabbit αCCS or murine αSFV SOD antibody and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A beads were used to retrieve the complexes that were then washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Proteins were released from the beads by boiling them for 5 min in 0.2 ml of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 0.1 m DTT. These interaction assays were repeated three times with similar results. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were size-fractionated using 12% SDS-PAGE (22Zhang W. Evans D.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 204-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride support as directed by the manufacturer of the membrane (Millipore). The membrane was treated with 5% blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences) in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with either monoclonal αSFV SOD antibody (diluted 1:1000) or polyclonal αCCS antibodies (1:5000) in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed six times with PBST and incubated with 1:50,000-diluted secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed extensively, and horseradish peroxidase was detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and Kodak Omat-AR film. The monoclonal mouse αSFV SOD antibody detects both MYX and SFV SOD homologs but not cellular Cu,Zn-SOD (16Cao J.X. Teoh M.L. Moon M. McFadden G. Evans D.H.

A polyclonal sheep α-human Cu,Zn-SOD antibody was purchased from Biodesign and also did not cross-react with viral SOD homologs (data not shown). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—A Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope was used to investigate the distribution of MYX SOD antigen. BGMK cells were seeded on glass coverslips, infected (or mock infected) with myxoma virus at a multiplicity of infection of 20, and cultured overnight. Next day (24 h post-infection) “MitoTracker” Red CMXRos dye (Molecular Probes) was added to the media at 0.25 μm final concentration, and the incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed, fixed for 15 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in fresh pre-warmed media, washed with PBS, and permeabilized during a 5-min treatment at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Thereafter all incubations and washes were performed at room temperature solutions containing PBS. The cells were washed, “blocked” for 30 min with 5% non-immune goat serum (Molecular Probes), and then incubated for 1 h with a solution containing 1:40 diluted αSFV/MYX SOD monoclonal antibody plus 2% goat serum. The cells were washed and incubated for 30 min with a solution containing 1:400 diluted Alexafluor 488-labeled goat-α-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) plus 2% goat serum, then washed again and mounted in a PBS solution containing 50% glycerol. Isolation and Purification of Mitochondria—SIRC cells were infected with virus, at a multiplicity of infection of two, and cultured 24 h. Fifteen milliliters of ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 1× Roche Applied Science complete protease inhibitor mixture) was added to each 30- × 150-mm dish, and the cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Three different cell fractions were then isolated by a series of centrifugation steps, and each fraction was washed three times with homogenization buffer. These were a crude nuclear fraction (1,000 × g, 10 min), a crude heavy mitochondrial fraction (3,000 × g, 10 min), and a crude light mitochondrial fraction (20,000 × g, 20 min). The remaining material was designated the post-mitochondrial supernatant. Mitochondria were further gradient-purified using the method of Okado-Matsumoto and Fridovich (23Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) as suggested by Nycomed Pharma. A 50% (w/v) stock solution of Nycodenz (in 10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) was diluted with 0.25 m sucrose, in the same buffer, to produce solutions containing 20–34% Nycodenz. Discontinuous density gradients were then prepared by layering 1.5 ml of 34%, 2.5 ml of 30%, 2.5 ml of 23%, and finally 1 ml of 20% Nycodenz in 11-ml centrifuge tubes. The crude heavy mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 25% Nycodenz, layered over this gradient, and centrifuged at 19,900 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW28 Ti rotor. Four distinct bands formed at the gradient boundaries, and 0.6 ml of mitochondria was removed from the 25/30% interface by side puncturing (23Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The purity of these fractions was judged by Western blotting. Actin was used as a cytosolic marker (1/5000-diluted α-β-actin monoclonal antibody, Sigma), GRP78 as a microsomal marker (1/1000-diluted α-GRP78 rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), catalase as a peroxisome marker (1/5000-diluted α-catalase monoclonal antibody, Sigma), and cytochrome c oxidase as a mitochondrial marker (1/1000-diluted α-COX subunit IV monoclonal antibody, Molecular Probes). Manganese SOD (Mn-SOD) was detected using an α-Mn-SOD rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1/5000 and purchased from Stressgen. Structural Features of SFV and Other Poxvirus Cu,Zn-SOD Homologs— Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the SOD-like proteins encoded by poxviruses with the homologous sequences of bovine Cu,Zn-SOD and the SOD-like domain II of human CCS (hCCS). This multiple sequence alignment illustrates the multiple deletions in the gene that seem to have occurred during the evolution of orthopoxviruses like ectromelia, vaccinia, and variola. These deletions would be expected to delete all the residues shown from crystallographic analysis of bovine Cu,Zn-SOD (24Rypniewski W.R. Mangani S. Bruni B. Orioli P.L. Casati M. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to form the zinc binding domain (Fig. 1, filled circles) and results in this family of virus genes segregating to a different branch of a SOD-based “relatedness” tree (Fig. 1, lower panel). In contrast the SFV S131R gene product, and similar “non-orthopoxvirus” proteins, seem to have retained many of the structural features of Cu,Zn-SODs, including the amino acids that form the interface between SOD homodimers (Fig. 1, asterisks). SFV SOD has also retained homologs of the amino acids that in the yeast CCS·SOD heterodimeric structure (11Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) form key interactions between CCS and Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig. 1, small open circles). The residues responsible for binding zinc have also been conserved in SFV SOD, but an H → N substitution would delete at least one of the copper-coordinating residues (Fig. 1, large open circles). The capacity to form an intrastrand cross-link also seems to have been impaired by a C → W substitution and possibly by the displacement of the cysteine partner, and an R → V substitution is expected to delete an arginine involved in catalysis (24Rypniewski W.R. Mangani S. Bruni B. Orioli P.L. Casati M. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar sequence changes characterize the gene encoded by myxoma virus and to viruses belonging to the Capripoxvirus family, whereas the protein encoded by Amsacta morei entomopoxvirus is sufficiently similar to cellular Cu,Zn-SOD orthologs to account for it being catalytically active. 2R. Moyer and M. Becker, personal communication. Interestingly, Lamb et al. (11Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) noted that forming a SOD·CCS heterodimer leads to an exchange of disulfide bonds. An intrastrand bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146, seen in the yeast SOD homodimer, is replaced in the SOD·CCS complex by an interstrand disulfide bond between the SOD monomer and domain III of yeast CCS (SOD Cys-57 and CCS Cys-229). Molecular modeling suggests that amino acid Cys-67 in the Leporipoxvirus SOD homologs occupies a position very similar to that of Cys-57 in yeast SOD, within loop 4 and corresponding to the S-S subloop region of the cellular enzymes. Viral SOD homologs don't encode a second homologous cysteine that would be well positioned to form an intrastrand disulphide bond with viral residue Cys-67. Instead, this residue would be predicted to protrude outwards and facing the surface of the protein where it would be well positioned to form an intermolecular disulfide bond with CCS Cys-229. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of Recombinant SFV S131R Protein—To gain some insights into the impact of these different amino acid substitutions upon the enzymatic and metal-binding properties of SFV SOD, we introduced a series of amino acid substitution mutations into the SFV S131R gene, in an attempt to return the sequence to something more closely resembling a catalytically active superoxide dismutase. The sequence alterations are shown in Table I. The W157C mutation (numbering refers to the SFV S131R gene) was introduced to restore some potential for forming an intrastrand disulfide bond with the semi-conserved cysteine at S131R position 67. Based upon molecular modeling of the structure of the copper binding cleft in SFV SOD, the two H148T and N59H substitutions were expected to restore the original copper-coordinating domain, and the V154R mutation was introduced to restore a highly conserved arginine that comprises part of the bovine Cu,Zn-SOD catalytic site. These S131R mutant proteins, along with the wild-type protein, were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins, purified using affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) and digested with thrombin to release the 18-kDa S131R proteins (Fig. 2). These proteins were all readily expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and for the most part caused no obvious toxicity. The growth of bacterial strains encoding the quadruple mutant S131R-THCR was slowed significantly upon in"
https://openalex.org/W2030924653,"Induction and execution of apoptosis programs are generally believed to be mediated through a hierarchy of caspase activation. By using two cellular variants obtained from the L1210 cell line (L1210/S and L1210/0), we have shown previously that staurosporine induces apoptotic cell death through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Both pathways normally coexisted in L1210/S cells, whereas L1210/0 cells lacked the ability to activate caspases despite the confirmed presence of both procaspase-3 and -9. Here we show that this defect in caspase activation is not due to mechanisms such as an absence of cytochrome c release, the expression of non-functional caspases, or the presence of an endogenous inhibitor but results from the loss of apoptosis protease activator protein-1 (APAF-1) expression. This absence of APAF-1 protein results from multiple alterations at both genomic and transcriptional levels. However, although this lack of APAF-1 delays the apoptotic program, it does not hamper its execution. Importantly, in these cells, apoptosis develops not only in an APAF-1-independent way but also in the absence of caspase-3 and -9 activation. Altogether these findings provide evidence that apoptosis may occur through alternative signaling pathways independent of APAF-1 expression and totally dissociated from any caspase processing. Therefore, the L1210/0 variant sub-line provides a valuable tool for the elucidation of these pathways.

Apoptosis is a major form of cell death essential to maintain homeostasis in multicellular organisms. It can be activated by a variety of stimuli including death receptor ligation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and UV- or γ-irradiation. Resistance to apoptosis has been established as one important mechanism of antitumor treatment failure (1Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar).Apoptotic signals are generally believed to be mediated through a hierarchy of caspase activation. Caspases, members of the cysteine protease family, are synthesized as relatively catalytically inactive proenzymes and need to be activated by proteolytic cleavage at internal aspartate residues (2Cohen G.M.

Two pathways of caspase activation during apoptosis have been described. The first one is mediated by death receptors, such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptors, controlled by caspases-8/10, which in turn activate downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. In the second pathway, diverse apoptotic signals converge at the mitochondrial level, inducing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to its cytosolic partner APAF-1 1The abbreviations used are: APAF-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; DiOC6(3), 3,3′dihexyloxacarbocyanine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEVD-pNa, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide; IETD-pNA, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-pNa; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PT, permeability transition; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: APAF-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; DiOC6(3), 3,3′dihexyloxacarbocyanine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEVD-pNa, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide; IETD-pNA, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-pNa; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PT, permeability transition; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This multimeric complex, named “apoptosome,” is sufficient to recruit the initiator caspase, procaspase-9, to the complex and induces procaspase-9 autoactivation (13Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). The activated caspase-9 is released from the apoptosome and subsequently initiates a caspase cascade involving the effector caspases such as caspases-3, -6, and -7 (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Once active, these caspases cleave various cellular targets, ultimately leading to cell death. Many inducers of apoptosis, such as γ-irradiation, anticancer drugs, staurosporine, and growth factor withdrawal, were shown to activate cell death independent of death receptor pathways, thus presumably directly activating the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway (11Li P.

Both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathway can be interconnected via the activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, through caspase-8, possibly serving as an amplification loop (19Gross A.

Recently, it was reported that low levels or deficiency in APAF-1 protein can determine sensitivity to apoptosis downstream of mitochondrial events suggesting that regulation of APAF-1 may be important for apoptosis regulation (24Jia L.

However, there has been some controversy over the nature of these caspase-independent deaths. It is generally believed that these deaths are of a necrotic type. Furthermore, it has been difficult to elucidate the components and significance of these pathways because they are often intimately intermingled with and obscured by the ubiquitous caspase pathways.By using two cellular variants obtained from an L1210 cell line (L1210/S and L1210/0), we showed that staurosporineinduced apoptosis operates through both a rapid caspase-dependent and a delayed caspase-independent pathway depending on the enzymatic equipment of the cell (33Belmokhtar C.A. Hillion J. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The two pathways normally coexist in L1210/S cells, whereas only the caspase-independent pathway is active in L1210/0 cells due to a general defect in the caspase activation. We identify here that this defect is due to the loss of a functional APAF-1 protein, which results from alterations at both the genomic as well as the transcriptional level. However, despite this loss and the subsequent absence of caspase activation, apoptosis develops, although delayed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Staurosporine was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Stock solution (2.0 mm staurosporine in Me2SO) was stored at –20 °C. Proteinase K and DNase-free RNase were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, and the DNA molecular weight marker (123-bp ladder) was from Invitrogen. Electrophoresis grade agarose, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P), and the ECL detection system were from Amersham Biosciences. Bovine cytochrome c, dATP, 3,3′dihexyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC6(3)) were obtained from Sigma.Cell Culture and Media—The mouse leukemia L1210/0 cell line, originally isolated by Burchenal and co-workers (35Burchenal J.H.

The L1210 cell line (called here L1210/S) was obtained from S. Cros (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France). L1210/0 and L1210/S cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (streptomycin, 200 μg/ml; penicillin, 200 units/ml). The cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.Cell Viability, Morphologic and Biochemical Assessment of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was monitored by cell morphology changes after May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining; typical condensed and fragmented nuclear morphology was visible after staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Roche Diagnostics) and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. For measurement of DNA fragmentation, DNA was isolated from 2 × 106 cells and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (37Segal-Bendirdjian E. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Exp.

Cells (5 × 105 in 400 μl) were incubated with 20 nm DiOC6(3) for 30 min at 37 °C and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) with the excitation set at 488 nm.Western Blot Analysis—For the detection of cytosolic cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), L1210/S and L1210/0 cells were treated with 5 μm staurosporine for 3 and 12 h, respectively, and analyzed by Western blotting. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were collected, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Cells were then transferred to a 2-ml Dounce-type homogenizer and allowed to swell for 20 min on ice. Cells were then disrupted with 30 strokes of B-type pestle. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were removed and stored at –70 °C until required. For the detection of caspase processing, 2 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice. After 10,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatants were harvested. Protein concentration in cellular extracts was determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) protein assay reagent. For detection, samples (15 μg/lane) were fractionated on a 10, 12, or 15% SDS-PAGE in a Tris-glycine running buffer and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The loading homogeneity and transfer efficiency were checked by staining the membrane with red Ponceau and the gel with Coomassie Blue. The membranes were preblocked 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder and then immunoblotted overnight with the primary antibody. Mouse polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-cytochrome c (Pharmingen), rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-8 (Pharmingen), anti-caspase 9 (Cell Signaling, Ozyme), and anti-APAF-1 (either from Pharmingen or from Alexis, Coger, Paris, France), and anti-AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution for detection of caspases and APAF-1, at 1:250 dilution for detection of cytochrome c, and at 1:2000 for detection of AIF. After washing, the membranes were then incubated with the respective peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection was performed using the chemiluminescence procedure (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Measurement of Caspase Activity—Cells (2 × 106) were pelleted, washed with PBS, pH 7.2, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm DTT. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein determination was done using the Bradford assay. Assays were set up in flat bottom 96-well plates containing 0.2 mm of the caspase-3-like peptide substrate (DEVD-pNa, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide, Alexis, Coger, Paris, France) in a caspase reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT) and 0.01 ml of protein extract (20–50 μg) in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Assays were performed at 37 °C. Release of pNa was detected by periodic readings of absorbance at 405 nm taken against a blank containing buffer and peptide alone (i.e. no extract) from 0 to 5 h to mark the linearity of the enzymatic reaction in time. Enzyme activities were measured as initial velocities and expressed as relative intensity/min/mg total protein within the linear range of the response. In some experiments a specific peptide substrate for granzyme B was used (IETD-pNa, Alexis, Coger, Paris, France).Cell-free Reactions—Cells were collected, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in CEB hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were then transferred to a 2-ml Dounce-type homogenizer and allowed to swell for 20 min on ice. Cells were then disrupted with 30 strokes of B-type pestle. Lysates were then transferred to Eppendorf tubes and were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and frozen at –70 °C until required. Activation of cell extracts was induced by addition of 5 μm bovine cytochrome c and 1 mm dATP to extracts. Aliquots were then withdrawn for subsequent SDS-PAGE/Western blot and caspase assay. For activation of caspases by granzyme B, cell extracts were prepared in the caspase assay buffer and incubated with 2.8 ng/ml of granzyme B (Calbiochem and VWR International).In some experiments, before addition of cytochrome c and dATP, extracts from L1210/0 or L1210/S cells were mixed together or with extracts from melanoma cells (SKMel) known to be “APAF-1-negative” cells (generously provided by Dr. Soengas at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). We then assessed caspase activation by monitoring DEVD-pNa hydrolysis.Preparation and Activation of Naive and Immunodepleted Cell Lysates—For the immunodepletion experiments, lysates from L1210/S cells prepared in CEB buffer were incubated for 2 h with 50 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), precoated with 3% bovine serum albumin coated with antibodies against caspase-9. Immunodepleted supernatants were collected by centrifugation. In vitro activation of caspases in both normal and immunodepleted lysates was initiated by incubating lysates (6 mg/ml) with cytochrome c (5 μm) and dATP (1 mm) at 37 °C. In the reconstitution assay equivalent amounts of L1210/0 lysates and L1210/S-immunodepleted lysates were mixed before the addition of cytochrome c and dATP.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Nucleotide Sequencing—RNA was isolated from both L1210/0 and L1210/S cells using the guanidinium isothiocyanate-based Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). We then synthesized APAF-1 cDNAs by RT-PCR using oligo(dT)15 and random hexamer priming. The amplification of APAF-1 cDNA was performed with primer pairs presented in Table I. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned in PGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Charbonnières-les Bains, France), and sequenced.Table IPCR primer pairs used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′ to 3′)Localization on Apaf-1 cDNA sequence (exons)1SaS and AS correspond to sense and antisense orientation, respectively.atg gat gca aag gcc cgc a21ASacc cac cct ggt tct cca tt42ASatc tgt aac act ctt atc tct ggt cg63ASata atc ata aga tga aga ctt cc83Sgga aaa caa gac aaa tct54Sagc atg ttg tcc ctg tgg ag75Satg ctc aga gaa gac atc aaa g86Sccc cac aca gat gct gtt tac c137Stgg aac ata gac tcc cgc187ASccc tgt ctg cca att cca2211AScta cat taa cgc tta gcc a26a S and AS correspond to sense and antisense orientation, respectively.

Cell Res. 1995; 218: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA (10 μg) from both L1210/0 and L1210/S cells was digested overnight at 37 °C with the restriction enzymes EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII (New England Biolabs, Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). After electrophoretic separation and overnight transfer using standard protocols (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences), the membrane was probed with two cDNA APAF-1 probes (StuI-BglII and BglII-SpeI fragments of 498 and 474 bp, respectively) generated from the cloned fragment 7S/11AS of 1177 bp in PGEM-T. The probes were 32P-labeled using “prime-a-gene” random primer labeling kit from Promega (Charbonnières-les Bains, France).RESULTSDefective Caspase Activation in L1210/0 Cells—As shown previously (33Belmokhtar C.A. Hillion J. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), staurosporine treatment resulted in an early cell death (within 3 h) in L1210/S cells, whereas in L1210/0 cells, death occurred only after 12 h. In both instances, death was of the apoptotic type, as indicated by the presence of morphological features such as cell shrinkage and condensation of chromatin and biochemical markers such as DNA ladder (Fig. 1A) and annexin V staining (data not shown). Despite this similar ability to induce apoptosis in both cell lines, staurosporine triggered caspase activation in L1210/S but not in L1210/0 cells, as indicated by the measurement of caspase-3-like activity and the absence of efficient processing of both initiator (caspase-8, -2, and -9) and the effector caspase-3 (Fig. 1B). Note that in L1210/S, the level of the procaspase-8 remained unchanged, indicating that in this cell line, staurosporine treatment did not activate this caspase. Furthermore, as shown previously (33Belmokhtar C.A. Hillion J. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), procaspase-7 was not expressed in L1210/0 cells, and procaspase-6 was barely detectable and not efficiently processed. This apparently caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis observed in L1210/0 cells was not specific to staurosporine as it is also induced by other drugs (cisplatin and etoposide) that activated caspases in L1210/S cells (data not shown). Starting from this, we performed a detailed dissection of molecular events in both staurosporine-treated L1210/S and L1210/0 cells in order to identify potential defects in staurosporine-induced caspase activation in L1210/0 cells.Δψm Reduction Develops in Staurosporine-induced Apoptosis of Both L1210/S and L1210/0 Cells—An early event of many types of apoptosis is the opening of mitochondrial pores or megachannels, a process known as the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) (40Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of PT is the disruption of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. Therefore, the cytofluorometric determination of Δψm during staurosporine-induced apoptosis in both L1210/0 and L1210/S was performed using the potential-sensitive probe DiOC6(3). Treatment of L1210/S with 5 μm staurosporine caused an initial increase of Δψm as early as 30 min after the onset of treatment (Fig. 2A). This increase could reflect the transient mitochondrial hyperpolarization occurring before or concomitantly to cytochrome c release, and preceding caspase activation and subsequent membrane depolarization, as reported by several groups (41Vander Heiden M.G.

Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Then a pronounced reduction of Δψm began by 1 h, and after 3 h of treatment, most of the population showed loss of Δψm signal. In L1210/0 cells, however, the reduction of Δψm was first detected at 8 h, and only 30% of the cell population presented the decrease in Δψm after 12 h of treatment, even though the same morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis were observed in at least 80% of the cells. The fact that Δψm loss was delayed and less intense in L1210/0 compared with L1210/S cells may suggest that caspase activity could be necessary for a stronger disruption of Δψm during apoptosis.Fig. 2Alterations of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in L1210/0 and L1210/S cells associated with staurosporineinduced apoptosis. L1210/S and L1210/0 cells were treated at 37 °C with 5 μm staurosporine (STP) for 3 h and 12 h, respectively. A, the effect of staurosporine on mitochondrial function was analyzed at various times by flow cytometric staining with the potentiometric dye DiOC6(3). A leftward shift fluorescence indicating mitochondrial depolarization was rapidly observed in L1210/S. This depolarization was delayed and less pronounced in L1210/0 cells. An initial rightward shift of DiOC6(3) was detected in L1210/S cells, indicating a transient hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. B, cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c (Cytc) and AIF, after staurosporine treatment of L1210 cells.

Genetic deficiency of C1-Inh causes hereditary angioedema. A novel type of mutation (Δ3) in exon 3 of the C1-Inh gene, resulting in deletion of Asp62-Thr116 in this unique domain, was encountered in a hereditary angioedema pedigree. Because the domain is supposedly not essential for inhibitory activity, the unexpected loss-of-function of this deletion mutant was further investigated. The Δ3 mutant and three additional mutants starting at Pro76, Gly98, and Ser115, lacking increasing parts of the N-terminal domain, were produced recombinantly. C1-Inh76 and C1-Inh98 retained normal conformation and interaction kinetics with target proteases. In contrast, C1-Inh115 and Δ3, which both lack the connection between the serpin and the non-serpin domain via two disulfide bridges, were completely non-functional because of a complex-like and multimeric conformation, as demonstrated by several criteria. The Δ3 mutant also circulated in multimeric form in plasma from affected family members. The C1-Inh mutant reported here is unique in that deletion of an entire amino acid stretch from a domain not shared by other serpins leads to a loss-of-function. The deletion in the unique N-terminal domain results in a “multimerization phenotype” of C1-Inh, because of diminished stability of the central β-sheet. This phenotype, as well as the location of the disulfide bridges between the serpin and the non-serpin domain of C1-Inh, suggests that the function of the N-terminal region may be similar to one of the effects of heparin in antithrombin III, maintenance of the metastable serpin conformation.

C1-Inh is the major inhibitor of C1s and C1r of the classical pathway of complement and also an inhibitor of the contact system proteases, factor XIIa, kallikrein, and factor XIa (2Cooper N.R. Adv.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A lack of this inhibitor may result in recurrent episodes of acute, local, circumscribed edema of the skin or mucosa. The most serious and potentially life-threatening manifestation of the disease is laryngeal edema (10Davis A.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 595-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). HAE is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; affected individuals are heterozygous. Based on the relative levels of functional and antigenic C1-Inh, two types of HAE have traditionally been described. In type I (± 85% of HAE patients), defective expression of one allele results in low antigenic and functional levels. In type II (±15% of HAE patients), levels of functional C1-Inh are low, but C1-Inh antigen levels are normal because of the presence of a dysfunctional mutant protein. Although heterozygosity would suggest functional C1-Inh levels of around 50% in HAE, these levels are lower than 50%, typically 5–30%, which is ascribed to increased C1 activation and C1-Inh consumption (10Davis A.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 595-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Quastel M. Harrison R. Cicardi M. Alper C.A. Rosen F.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the description of low levels of non-functional C1-Inh mutants in patients with type I HAE has demonstrated that the distinction between types I and II HAE is not absolute (12Verpy E. Couture-Tosi E. Eldering E. Lopez-Trascasa M. Spath P. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 350-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, low levels of dysfunctional mutant protein may occur in cases where the mutation also leads to defective protein secretion (12Verpy E. Couture-Tosi E. Eldering E. Lopez-Trascasa M. Spath P. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 350-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Eldering E. Verpy E. Roem D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2579-2587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Many different mutations can lead to dysfunctional C1-Inh, as has recently been reviewed (14Bos I.G. Hack C.E. Abrahams J.P. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 518-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). C1-Inh is a human plasma glycoprotein and a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family to which antithrombin III (ATIII), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and α1-antitrypsin also belong. Serpins are suicide inhibitors that function as a set mousetrap by forming highly stable complexes with their cognate proteases. In its active form, a serpin has a metastable structure with a flexible reactive site loop that protrudes from the core of the molecule, the central β-sheet. The key residues P1-P1′ form the reactive site, a pseudosubstrate for the target protease. Upon proteolytic attack on this bond, the reactive site loop is pulled into the central β-sheet, inducing a dramatic conformational change that results in the formation of covalent complexes between inhibitor and protease (15Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 16Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies support the idea that during complex formation the catalytic triad of the protease becomes distorted, which may explain the remarkable stability of the complex (17Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 18Kaslik G. Patthy A. Balint M. Graf L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10608-10615Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because mutations in the conserved flexible hinge region convert most inhibitory serpins into substrates, it is currently believed that the velocity of this conformational change determines whether complex formation and inhibition occur or whether the serpin is cleaved and the protease released (20Wright H.T. Blajchman M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol.

Aulak K. Parad R.B. Stecklein H.P. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Kramer J. Strunk R.C. Bissler J. Rosen F.S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Levy N.J. Ramesh N. Cicardi M. Harrison R.A. Davis A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The conformational flexibility of serpins is also demonstrated by the existence of additional, biologically relevant conformations that are more stable. One of these is a latent, inactive form, adopted naturally by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and ATIII, in which the uncleaved reactive site loop is inserted into β-sheet A, and the C-terminal peptide stalk and strand 1C are reoriented along the side of the molecule (27Mottonen J.

Mushunje A. Zhou A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In ATIII and α1-AT this latent state can be artificially induced (29Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.S. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but artificial formation of latent C1-Inh has never succeeded (30Lomas D.A.

Secondly, non-covalent multimerization can occur upon denaturation, heating, or proteolysis at certain sites in the reactive site loop (32Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

Also, several disease-associated mutants of C1-Inh, ATIII, and α1-AT have this multimeric conformation (15Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), in some cases leading to accumulation of huge intracellular protein aggregates and loss of cellular function in diseases like emphysema (reviewed by Lomas and Carrell, Ref. 34Lomas D.A.

Conformational changes associated with latency or multimerization may result from similar structural causes, as demonstrated by ATIII-Rouen VI, in which a single point mutation results in the formation of latent monomers or multimers, depending on temperature (39Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Next to its canonical serpin domain, C1-Inh has a unique N-terminal domain of 116 amino acids. Two disulfide bridges linking cysteine 101 to cysteine 406 and cysteine 108 to cysteine 183 connect the N-terminal to the serpin domain (41Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thogersen H.C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Reduction of these disulfide bonds in the intact serpin reduces its conformational stability and induces a latent conformation by auto-insertion of the reactive site loop into the central A β-sheet (42Simonovic I. Patston P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is unique for C1-Inh, and its exact function is unknown. Its first 98 residues were shown not to be essential for complex formation (43Coutinho M. Aulak K.S. Davis A.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe a novel type of mutation in the C1-Inh gene that sheds additional light on the function of this domain. The mutation, detected in a Dutch HAE pedigree, involves a deletion of 165 base pairs in exon 3 of the C1-Inh gene, leading to loss of amino acids 62 to 116. Although located in the non-serpin domain, the deletion resulted in loss of functional C1-Inh. The unique features of this pathological C1-Inh mutant prompted investigation of the structural basis for the phenotype. Unexpectedly, the results revealed that the cysteine-containing fragment of the N-terminal domain of C1-Inh stabilizes the serpin domain by tethering the central β-sheet via disulfide bridges. Thus, the reactive site loop is prevented from spontaneous insertion, reminiscent of one of the roles played by heparin in ATIII. Materials—[35S]Methionine and 14C-methylated protein markers were obtained from the Radiochemical Center (Amersham Biosciences). Biotin was from Pierce (Rockford, IL) and coupled to proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified human plasma C1-Inh was a gift from Behringwerke (Marburg, Germany). Dithiothreitol and soybean trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Sigma; N-ethylmaleimide was purchased from BDH Biochemicals (Poole, UK). C1s for kinetic assays was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Human factor XIIa and kallikrein were purchased from Kordia (Leiden, the Netherlands). Biotinylated polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human C1-Inh and the monoclonal antibodies (mAb) RII (against human C1-Inh) and Kok12 (specific for cleaved or complexed human C1-Inh) have been described before (44Nuijens J.H.

Streptavidin coupled to polymerized horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Sanquin (Dept. of Immune Reagents, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Streptavidin coupled to monomeric horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Patient DNA Purification and Plasma Parameters—Blood samples were collected in siliconized vacutainer tubes (BD PharMingen). Soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 mm), and EDTA (10 mm) were added to prevent in vitro activation of the complement and contact systems. Tubes were centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 10 min, and plasma was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C until testing. Cells were collected and genomic DNA was purified according to the high salt precipitation protocol (46Dykes D.D. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Affected members were investigated for C1-Inh and C4 as reported previously (47Cugno M. Nuijens J. Hack E. Eerenberg A. Frangi D. Agostoni A. Cicardi M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or ELISAs were utilized as described below. PCR, Plasmid Construction, and Protein Expression—PCR on genomic DNA (0.5 μg) was performed with primers (0.5 μm) flanking exon 3 of the C1-Inh gene (28 cycles of 30 s, 90 °C; 60 s, 56 °C; 90 s, 72 °C). Forward primer, 5′-CTGACTATCCCTCATCTTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTAGTGGCTGCGACCTTAT-3′. 5′-ends correspond with nucleotides 1951 and 2947, respectively, of the published C1-Inh gene sequence (48Carter P.E.

Wild-type and mutant PCR products were purified from agarose gels, subcloned in a T-tailed vector (Promega), and two independent clones were sequenced (USB, Cleveland, OH). Subcloning of relevant fragments was done by digestion with BamHI and EcoNI and insertion into the corresponding sites in the C1-Inh expression plasmid (50Eldering E. Nuijens J.H. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11776-11779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cell transfection, metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were done as described before (13Eldering E.

Primers were designed that started at amino acid 76, 98, and 115 of C1-Inh according to the numbering of Bock et al. (41Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thogersen H.C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and enabled subcloning of the mutant gene in the plasmid for expression and secretion by P. pastoris. Transformation of the P. pastoris strain GS115 and C1-Inh expression were performed as described before (51Bos I.G. de Bruin E.C. Karuntu Y.A. Modderman P.W. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1648: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Electrophoresis was performed on Bio-Rad Mini Protean II and Hoefer SE600 systems. Immunoprecipitation of plasma samples or [35S]methionine-labeled COS media was done with mAbs coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting of HAE and normal plasma was performed by first adsorbing plasma samples (20 μl) onto mAb RII-Sepharose overnight, followed by five washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 (PT) and dissociation of bound C1-Inh by boiling in non-reducing sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 0.4% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-C1-Inh antibodies (2 μg/ml) for 2 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with peroxidase-conjugated horse polyclonal anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000, Sanquin). Blots were developed with chemoluminescence reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Reduction and Alkylation of C1-Inh—Plasma C1-Inh (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently with 250 mm N-ethylmaleimide to irreversibly alkylate the free cysteines. A control sample was treated with 250 mm N-ethylmaleimide only. This preparation was dialyzed twice against a 100-fold excess of phosphate-buffered saline. ELISAs—C1-Inh antigen was detected with an ELISA modified from a radioimmunoassay (45Nuijens J.H. Huijbregts C.C. Eerenberg-Belmer A.J. Abbink J.J. Strack v.S.R. Felt-Bersma R.J. Thijs L.G. Hack C.E.

Invest. 1989; 84: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as described earlier (53Bos I.G. van Mierlo G.J. Bleeker W.K. Rigter G.M. te Velthuis H. Dickneite G. Hack C.E. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Functional human C1-Inh was detected as described (54de Smet B.J. de Boer J.P. Agterberg J. Rigter G. Bleeker W.K. Hack C.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 56-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C1-Inh was bound to solid-phase mAb RII against human C1-Inh and detected with biotinylated C1s. Notably, this assay is an end-stage, and not a kinetic, assay that measures the number of functional C1-Inh molecules rather than the kinetics of the interaction between C1s and C1-Inh. Conformationally changed C1-Inh was measured in an ELISA system with the mAb Kok12 as coating antibody. This mAb reacts with neo-epitopes exposed on complexed or cleaved C1-Inh. C1-Inh multimers were detected in an ELISA with mAb RII both as coating and as detecting antibody. PT was used as the buffer for all incubation steps in the ELISAs. Kinetics of the Interaction between C1-Inh and Target Proteases—The interaction between C1-Inh and C1s, coagulation factor XIIa, or kallikrein was studied with the method of progress curves as described before (55Eldering E. Huijbregts C.C. Lubbers Y.T. Longstaff C. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7013-7020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed twice in triplicate with similar results. Heat Stability—Culture supernatants containing normal or mutant C1-Inh were incubated for 2 h at different temperatures, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Antigen remaining in solution was measured in an ELISA for C1-Inh antigen. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Plasma samples (200 μl) were loaded onto 5–25% (w/v) sucrose gradients in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C for 16 h. Fractions were tested in ELISAs for C1-Inh antigen or multimers. Plasma fractions were also tested for C1-Inh, IgG, and IgM on an automated nephelometer (Behringwerke) as a reference for the molecular mass of C1-Inh species. C1-inhibitor Protein and DNA Sequence of the Patient—The index patient had a typical history of HAE and was initially classified as a type I HAE based on levels of functional and antigenic levels of C1-Inh (17% both) and low C4 levels (30 mg/l). However, upon analysis by immune precipitation and immunoblotting, plasma from a member of the affected family appeared to contain low levels of an aberrant, low molecular mass form of C1-Inh of about 70 kDa, which was smaller than the intact and cleaved forms C1-Inh of 104 kDa and 97 kDa, respectively, which naturally occur in human plasma (Fig. 1). DNA sequencing of the pedigree, with primers flanking exon 3 of the C1-Inh gene, yielded an anomalous, specific PCR fragment. In addition to the normal fragment of 997 base pairs, a shorter fragment of ∼830 base pairs was observed that was cloned and sequenced (Fig. 2, a and b; GenBank™ AY291075). It appeared that a deletion of 165 base pairs within the coding sequence of exon 3 had occurred. As is virtually always the case in HAE, the index patient was heterozygous for this deletion (Fig. 2a). Exon 3 of the C1-Inh gene codes for part of the signal sequence, the entire NH2-terminal domain, and part of the serpin domain of C1-Inh. The deleted part is peculiar in nucleotide (27% A, 44% C, 12% G and 16% T) sequence. Many A/C-rich direct repeats of up to 11 nucleotides are present, which may have caused the deletion to occur. In addition, it contains Cys101 and Cys108, which connect the N-terminal domain to the serpin domain by forming disulfide bridges with Cys183 and Cys406 (41Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thogersen H.C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This deletion of 165 base pairs predicted a deletion of 55 amino acids of the N-terminal non-serpin domain, including two cysteines involved in the formation of the two disulfide bridges of the molecules. This mutant is further indicated as the Δ3 mutant. Expression and Activity of C1-Inh Mutants—In the first instance it seemed unclear why the in-frame deletion identified in the patient should cause HAE; it is located outside the serpin domain, and earlier studies have indicated that the N-terminal domain is dispensable for inhibitory capacity (43Coutinho M. Aulak K.S. Davis A.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation could be that the deletion severely impedes secretion, thereby explaining the type I form of HAE. Expression of the Δ3 mutant in COS cells indicated, however, that the mutant was in fact secreted, albeit at lower levels than WT C1-Inh but unable to form complexes with C1s. This suggested a disturbed functional interaction as the basis for disease, which is mostly associated with type II HAE. To assess in detail this impaired function of the N-terminal domain at a protein level, we decided to express and analyze several additional N-terminal deletion mutants, starting at amino acid 76, 98, and 115 (C1-Inh76, C1-Inh98, and C1-Inh115 respectively, summarized in Fig. 2c). To obtain sufficient amounts of recombinant protein for a detailed analysis of the inhibitory and kinetic properties of the N-terminal deletion mutants, we produced WT, C1-Inh76, C1-Inh98, and C1-Inh115 in P. pastoris. In a previous study we have shown that WT C1-Inh can be conveniently expressed in this system and is fully functionally active (50Eldering E. Nuijens J.H. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11776-11779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed at levels of 30, 35, 34, and 2 μg/ml, respectively. Supernatants of transfected cells or P. pastoris were analyzed by ELISA for C1-Inh antigen and function. It appeared that the mutants Δ3 and C1-INH115 were completely non-functional toward C1s (Fig. 3), whereas C1-Inh76 and C1-Inh98 displayed normal activity. Normal functional activity of the latter two mutants was confirmed in the kinetic analysis showing comparable association (k on) and dissociation (k off) constants of these mutants with C1s, kallikrein, and factor XIIa as WT C1-Inh (Table I). Thus, the decreased function of the Δ3 C1-Inh mutant likely was related to the absence of the linker sequence between the serpin domain and the N-terminal domain.Table IAssociation (K on ) and dissociation (K off ) rate constants of C1-Inh with various target proteases, as determined with progress curvesProteaseWT C1-InhC1-Inh76C1-Inh98K on × (m-1s-1)KoffK on × (m-1s-1)KoffK on × (m-1s-1)KoffCls6.3 × 1042.3 × 10-56.5 × 1042.5 × 10-54.4 × 1041.0 × 10-5Kallikrein8.2 × 1032.1 × 10-55.9 × 1033.5 × 10-53.9 × 1031.0 × 10-5XIIa5.7 × 1031.4 × 10-55.2 × 1031.0 × 10-61.6 × 1031.2 × 10-5 Open table in a new tab Heat Stability and Conformation of Normal and Mutant C1-Inh—Functional serpins, including C1-Inh, are in a metastable state that can be"

This was shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis and a number of in vitro and in vivo assays. EF-1δ provides the guanine nucleotide exchange activities on EF-1α during elongation step of protein synthesis.

Kinectin consists of a 120-kDa polypeptide and a 160-kDa polypeptide interacting through an α-helical coiled-coil domain to form a heterodimer (4Kumar J. Erickson H.P. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 120-kDa polypeptide is the truncated version of the 160-kDa polypeptide, lacking the first 232 amino acids, in the N terminus (4Kumar J. Erickson H.P. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the 160-kDa polypeptide consists of a transmembrane domain that anchors kinectin to organelle membranes, potentially with the help of the 7 myristylation sites throughout the molecule (3Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Kumar J. Erickson H.P. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The C terminus of kinectin consists of two functional domains. The kinesin-binding domain can interact with the cargo-binding site of the conventional kinesin and enhance the kinesin's microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity (5Ong L.L. Lim A.P. Er C.P. Kuznetsov S.A. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32854-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A separate domain interacts with small G-proteins such as Rho A and Rac 1 (6Hotta K. Tanaka K. Mino A. Kohno H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Fort P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8022-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The role of kinectin in organelle motility is further supported by antibody inhibition and kinectin-domain overexpression studies, in which the organelle motility is adversely affected both in vitro and in vivo (2Kumar J. Yu H. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Ong L.L. Lim A.P. Er C.P. Kuznetsov S.A. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32854-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The role of kinectin as a universal membrane anchor for kinesin has been questioned when kinectin's restricted intracellular and phylogenetic distributions were discovered. Kinectin is not detected in axons of cultured neurons where kinesin is the major motor responsible for fast anterograde transport (9Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 211: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinectin gene is not found in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila genomes, where conserved conventional kinesin heavy chain gene is present (10Goldstein L. Gunawardena S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F63-F68Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that additional or alternative membrane anchors for kinesin must exist for organelle motility. Recent yeast two-hybrid and biochemical studies have identified a few new kinesin-interacting partners on different organelles. For examples, Sunday Driver interacts with the tricopeptide repeats of the kinesin light-chain subunit of kinesin-1 and mediates the axonal transport of post-Golgi vesicles (11Bowman A.B. Kamal A. Ritchings B.W. Philp A.V. McGrail M. Gindhart J.G. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Kinesin-1 was proposed to link to a class of transport vesicles via the JIP-1 and JIP-2 scaffolding proteins that bind to members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (12Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Another scaffold protein, 14-3-3 proteins, may act as a membrane anchor for KIF1C (13Dorner C. Ciossek T. Muller S. Moller P.H. Ullrich A. Lammers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20267-20275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The transmembrane amyloid precursor protein is another potential membrane anchor for kinesin-1, which directly binds the tricopeptide repeats of the kinesin light chain (14Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The AP-1 clathrin-associated adaptor complex, which mediates the transport of clathrin-coated vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to plasma membrane, binds KIF13A (15Nakagawa T. Setou M. Seog D. Ogasawara K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). There are studies revealing a potential interaction between KIF3 and fodrin (brain spectrin) on neuronal vesicles (16Takeda S. Yamazaki H. Seog D.H. Kanai Y. Terada S. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The recently identified dendrite-specific kinesin KIF17 can also interact directly with the PDZ domain of mLin-10 (17Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N.

Therefore, a paradigm has emerged that motor proteins utilize different membrane anchors and the same motor protein, such as kinesin-1, can bind to different membrane anchors on different organelles (18Kamal A. Goldstein L.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since kinectin is primarily localized to the ER (1Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J.

Yu, manuscript in preparation. but not Golgi apparatus, its primary functions may be restricted to these organelle compartments. Different kinectin isoforms with combinations of variable domains (vd) have been reported in human, mouse and fox genomes (19Print C.G. Leung E. Harrison J.E. Watson J.D. Krissansen G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol.

There are at least five small (23–33 amino acid residues) variable domains scattered throughout the C terminus of kinectin. Two variable domains (vd3: amino acid residues 1177–1200 and vd4: amino acid residues 1229–1256) overlap the kinesin-binding domain on kinectin (5Ong L.L. Lim A.P. Er C.P. Kuznetsov S.A. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32854-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This implies that the kinectin isoforms lacking either vd3 or vd4 cannot serve as the membrane anchors for kinesin. Such isoforms without vd3 or vd4 have indeed been identified in cells (Fig. 1A) (20Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).2 We have investigated the function of one such kinectin isoform lacking vd4 in ER. We have isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library a naturally occurring kinectin isoform that contains variable domains vd1, vd2, vd3, vd5, and vd6 but lacks vd4 (Fig. 1A). This kinectin isoform did not interact with the conventional kinesin heavy chain in a yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1A). However, it interacted with another resident of the ER, the translation elongation factor-1 delta, in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. EF-1δ is a subunit of the protein complex that participates in the elongation step during the translation of mRNA. The EF-1 complex consists of four subunits, namely, α, β, δ, and γ. The GTP binding protein, EF-1α, is responsible for the transfer of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosome with the hydrolysis of GTP. The EF-1β and EF-1δ subunits are responsible for the nucleotide exchange activity, which converts the EF-1α•GDP to the active EF-1α•GTP (22Riis B. Rattan S.I. Clark B.F. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 420-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 23Sanders J. Raggiaschi R. Morales J. Moller W. Biochim. Biophys.

Both β and δ sequences appear unrelated other than the C-terminal domain, which is responsible for the nucleotide exchange activity (25Cormier P. Osborne H.B. Morales J. Bassez T. Minella O. Poulhe R. Belle R. Mulner-Lorillon O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 743Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The exact function of EF-1γ is not yet known, although there are studies indicating that EF-1γ can enhance the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of EF-1β, and its association with tubulin suggests that EF-1γ may help to anchor EF-1β to cell structures like microtubules and membranes (26Janssen G.M.

Disruption of the kinectin-EF-1δ interaction interferes with the EF-1δ distribution in ER. The results provide us with a better understanding of the kinectin function in the ER. The restriction enzymes used were from Promega (Madison, WI), and all of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Construction of the Kinectin Bait D—A pair of oligonucleotides flanking 2539–4143 base pair (bp) of the human kinectin gene (GenBank™ accession number Z22551) was designed to isolate different kinectin isoforms. A standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 14.1-14.35Google Scholar) was carried out using the human fetal brain, fetal liver, adult brain, and prostate libraries (Clontech). The amplified PCR products were subcloned into pTOPO vector (Invitrogen) by TA cloning. The different kinectin isoforms were grouped by restriction mapping, and their sequences were verified by sequencing. The region between 3142 and 4139 bp (amino acid residues 1024–1356) of an isoform was subcloned in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) of the pAS2–1 vector (Clontech) and renamed as bait D. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening (Clontech) was performed according to the supplied protocol. The expression of baits A, B, and D fusion proteins in yeast were determined by immunoblotting the yeast extract with GAL4 DNA-BD monoclonal antibody (Clontech). 3L. L. Ong, C. P. N. Er, A. Ho, M. T. Aung, and H. Yu, unpublished observations. The kinectin bait D was used to screen a human fetal brain Matchmaker cDNA library fused to the GAL4 DNA-activation domain (AD) of the pACT2 vector (Clontech). The bait and the amplified library were sequentially transformed into yeast strain Y190 (Clontech) using the lithium acetate method (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were assayed for their expression of histidine (HIS3) reporter gene by plating them onto the synthetic medium deficient in tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was included to limit the number of false HIS3 positives (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Colonies that grew successfully in the selective medium were further screened for their expression of the lacZ reporter gene by colony lift assay (31Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The cDNAs in the AD vector of the persistent positive clones were isolated. False positives were further eliminated by testing whether the clones could activate both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes with control baits (baits A, B, and BD vector alone). The primary sequences of the positive clones were determined with an ABI PRISM Big Dye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Kit using an ABI PRISM™ 377 DNA sequencer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were analyzed with the LASER-GENE (DNASTAR) and the BLAST 2.0 (National Library of Medicine) software. In Vitro GST Pull-down Assay—The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs with the kinectin baits A, B, and D were made by subcloning the corresponding cDNA into the expression vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). A His6-tagged fusion construct with EF-1δ was made by subcloning the EF-1δ cDNA into pRSET expression vector (Invitrogen). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21/pLysS (DE3) (generous gift from Niovi Santama, Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, University of Cyprus). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Intact bacterial cells containing the expressed fusion proteins were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Protein extracts were obtained by freezing and thawing the cell pellet and resuspending the pellet in GST purification buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) plus 5 mm dithiothreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aproptinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of the GST fusion proteins with baits A, B, and D were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads by end-over-end mixing in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with GST purification buffer to remove unbound proteins. The expressed His6-EF-1δ (36 kDa) fusion protein extract was allowed to interact with the GST-bait fusion protein-coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Any unbound proteins were removed through extensive washings. The proteins that remained bound to the immobilized GST-baits were released by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis (PAGE), and immunoblotting with mouse RGS-His antibody (Qiagen). Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, coupled to horseradish peroxidase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation of Kinectin with EF-1δ—African green monkey kidney cells, COS7, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. For transient transfection assays, GST-tagged kinectin bait D (64 kDa) and FLAG-tagged EF-1δ (36 kDa) were generated by subcloning the corresponding cDNA into the pXJ-GST and pXJ-FLAG mammalian expression vectors, respectively (32Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both constructs were co-transfected into COS7 cells cultured in a 60-mm dish using TransFast™ transfection reagent (Promega). The transfected cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS at 48 h after transfection. The cells were isolated into 1 ml of the ice-cold GST purification buffer containing protease inhibitors (as described above). Cell lysate was prepared by passing the cells through 25-gauge needle for 10 times. Intact cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 60 μl of the equilibrated 50% glutathione-agarose bead suspension was added to the cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with a mixture of anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies. Antibody binding was detected as described above. Anti-EF-1δ Polyclonal Antibody Preparation—The EF-1δ recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 using pRSET vector (Qiagen). The fusion protein was purified using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose bead affinity column (Qiagen). The purified EF-1δ protein was injected into rabbit by standard protocol (33Harlow E. Antibodies (A Laboratory Manual). Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-138Google Scholar). The antiserum was affinity-purified using the first 100 amino acids of the EF-1δ protein coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (34Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of EF-1δ by cdc2 Kinase—HeLa cell lysate was prepared using SF buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate) in the presence of protease inhibitors (as described above). 1 μg of the HeLa cell lysate was incubated with or without 10 units of cdc2 kinase in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2,2mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij 35, 100 μm ATP) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and the EF-1δ was detected by immunoblotting with the purified anti-EF-1δ polyclonal antibody. Antibody binding was detected with swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako), coupled to horseradish peroxidase according to the manufacturer's specifications. In Vitro Binding of the Endogenous EF-1δ (32 kDa) with Kinectin Baits—Bacterially-expressed kinectin baits A, B, and D were coupled onto glutathione-agarose beads as described above. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were harvested and re-suspended with one volume of the GST purification buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was prepared as described above and was added to the beads coated with GST-bait fusion protein and incubated with end-over-end mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with the purified anti-EF-1δ polyclonal antibody. In Vitro Binding of the Endogenous Kinectin with EF-1δ—Bacterially expressed EF-1δ were coupled onto glutathione-agarose beads. The HeLa cell lysate was prepared as described above and was added to the beads coated with GST-EF-1δ and incubated with end-over-end mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with CT-1 monoclonal antibody (generous gift from Dr. Martin Krönke, University of Cologne, Germany). Antibody binding was detected as described above. Real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis—The GST-tagged kinectin bait D (64 kDa) and His6-tagged EF-1δ (52 kDa) recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 using pGEX4T-1 and pET32 (Novagen) vectors, respectively. The GST-tagged and His6-tagged recombinant proteins were purified according to manufacturers' protocols (Amersham Biosciences & Novagen). The biomolecular interaction analysis was based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, which was performed with BIACORE 3000 (BIAcore AB). HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) was used as flow buffer, and the flow rate was kept at 5 μl/min. 1 mg/ml of GST-only and GST-bait D proteins were coupled to CM5 sensor chip surfaces to yield a signal of 4000 response unit (RU) using standard amine coupling procedure (35Nakazawa M. Moreira D. Laurent J. Le Guyader H. Fukami Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A control reference flow cell was included where no ligand bound. The surfaces were then inactivated with 1 m ethanolamine. 50 μl of 1 μm of the analyte was injected for 10 min and the binding kinectics was monitored for 16 min. After each interaction cycle, the surfaces were regenerated with 10 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The analytes were injected in triplicates in random order. All interaction experiments were performed at 25 °C. All binding curves were corrected for refractive index changes and nonspecific binding by subtraction of the control reference flow cell. The association and dissociation rate constants were deduced from the initial signal courses of the association and dissociation phases, assuming 1:1 Langmuir binding and employing the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). Mapping of the EF-1δ Binding Domain on Kinectin Bait D—The EF-1δ cDNA obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening was subcloned into the BD vector. A series of truncated clones of the kinectin bait D (D1 to D18) were constructed (Fig. 5) by PCR. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the AD vector, and their interaction with the EF-1δ was assayed using the yeast two-hybrid analysis as described above. A total of 50 yeast transformants were picked for each truncated clone to assay for the activation of HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Clones were considered as positive only when more than 90% of the transformants activated both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Immunofluorescence Assay—African green monkey kidney cells, CV1 cells, were seeded on coverglass overnight and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.01% saponin in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were blocked with 10% FCS in PBS for an hour prior to incubation with the primary antibodies, CT-1 monoclonal antibody, and anti-EF-1δ polyclonal antibody overnight. The cells were washed three times and followed by 1 h of incubation with the secondary antibodies, DIG-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG and Biotin-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako). The cells were incubated for another 1 h with the tertiary antibodies, FITC-conjugated sheep anti-DIG IgG and TRITC-conjugated Extravidin after the three washes with PBS. The coverglasses were washed thoroughly, mounted in FluorSave™ (Calbiochem) and imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Overexpression Studies—The EF-1δ binding domains on kinectin, baits D and D12, were subcloned into the pEGFP-C vector (Clontech) for optimal expression in mammalian cells. The pEGFP-C vector alone was used as control. CV1 cells were cultured and transfected as described above. 48-h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of nocodazole at 37 °C for 2 h and followed by another 3 h in the absence of nocodazole. Cells were subsequently fixed and stained with anti-EF-1δ polyclonal antibody prepared as described above. Transfected cells were identified by green fluorescence protein expression and scored either with distinct or disrupted EF-1δ distribution. A total of 30 cells were observed for each clone during each experiment. The data tabulated were based on three independent experiments. The Translation Elongation Factor-1 Delta Interacts with Kinectin in Yeast Two-hybrid Screenings—To identify binding partners for kinectin isoforms lacking either vd3 or vd4 (kinesin-binding domain), we first isolated naturally occurring kinectin isoforms as baits. A PCR strategy was designed to amplify the region between 2539 and 4143 bp of the human kinectin gene using a pair of primers in the conserved sequences. The PCR reaction was carried out using human fetal brain, fetal liver, adult brain and prostate libraries. The amplified PCR bands were subcloned into pTOPO vector by TA cloning. A total of 7 unique naturally occurring kinectin isoforms were isolated and classified into two categories, namely either with or without vd4. One of the kinectin isoforms that contains vd1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 but lacks vd4 (Fig. 1A) was chosen for yeast two-hybrid screenings. The region between 3142 and 4139 bp (amino acid residues 1024–1356), which contains vd2, vd3, and vd5, was subcloned into the BD vector and renamed as bait D. Bait D does not contain the predicted leucine zipper motifs (amino acid residues 934–962) in the core of a predicted α-helical coiled-coil. Baits A, B, and D showed no interaction with the conventional kinesin heavy chain in yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with our previous findings that the vd3 and vd4 of kinectin are required for kinesin binding (5Ong L.L. Lim A.P. Er C.P. Kuznetsov S.A. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32854-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In order to identify interacting partners of the kinectin isoforms that lack the kinesin-binding domain, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of the human fetal brain cDNA library. A total of 17 unique positive-clones were identified from screening ∼2.35 × 107 transformants. Among them, one of the positive clones has sequence identical to the published human translation elongation factor-1 delta sequence (EF-1δ, GenBank™ accession number NM001960). The plasmid obtained has an insert of 1200 bp in length and encodes the entire open reading frame of the EF-1δ. EF-1δ interacts specifically only with bait D, but not baits A or B in the yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1A). Baits A and B proteins were produced with the predicted molecular mass in yeast.3 GST-Kinectin Bait D Specifically Interacts with EF-1δ in Vitro—To verify that kinectin bait D binds to the full-length EF-1δ in vitro, we first performed a GST pull-down analysis. GST fusion constructs with the kinectin baits A, B, and D were made and expressed in E. coli. Equal amounts of the individual fusion protein extracts were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed extensively to remove unbound proteins such that only the kinectin baits remained bound to the beads. The His6-tagged EF-1δ construct was expressed in E. coli, and the cell extract was allowed to interact with the immobilized GST-bait fusion proteins. The proteins remained bound to the immobilized GST-baits after extensive washings were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti"
https://openalex.org/W1991437467,"Previously we obtained evidence based on engineering of Zn2+ binding sites that the extracellular parts of transmembrane segment 7 (TM7) and TM8 in the human dopamine transporter are important for transporter function. To further evaluate the role of this domain, we have employed the substituted cysteine accessibility method and performed 10 single cysteine substitutions at the extracellular ends of TM7 and TM8. The mutants were made in background mutants of the human dopamine transporter with either two (E2C) or five endogenous cysteines substituted (X5C) that render the transporter largely insensitive to cysteine modification. In two mutants (M371C and A399C), treatment with the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) led to a substantial inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake. In M371C this inactivation was enhanced by Na+ and blocked by dopamine. Inhibitors such as cocaine did not alter the effect of MTSET in M371C. The protection of M371C inactivation by dopamine required Na+. Because dopamine binding is believed to be Na+-independent, this suggests that dopamine induces a transport-associated conformational change that decreases the reactivity of M371C with MTSET. In contrast to M371C, cocaine decreased the reaction rate of A399C with MTSET, whereas dopamine had no effect. The protection by cocaine can either reflect that Ala-399 lines the cocaine binding crevice or that cocaine induces a conformational change that decreases the reactivity of A399C. The present findings add new functionality to the TM7/8 region by providing evidence for the occurrence of distinct Na+-, substrate-, and perhaps inhibitor-induced conformational changes critical for the proper function of the transporter.

Accordingly, the transporter plays a critical role in regulating the availability of dopamine in the synaptic cleft and thus in modulating the physiological functions of dopamine (1Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 2Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

Furthermore, the DAT is the principle target for the action of widely abused psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine (1Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev.

The transporter belongs to the family of Na+/Cl–-dependent transporters, along with transporters for several other neurotransmitters including the norepinephrine (NET), serotonin (SERT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT), and glycine transporters (3Norregaard L.

This family of transporters have been predicted to contain 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMs) connected by alternating extracellular and intracellular loops with an intracellular location of the N and C termini (Fig. 1) (1Amara S.G.

Relatively little is also known about the quaternary structure of the transporters, although increasing evidence suggests that they exist and function as oligomeric structures (9Hastrup H. Karlin A.

It is a general assumption that Na+/Cl–-dependent transporters work by an alternate access mechanism, in which the transporter interchanges between an “outward facing” conformation, in which the substrate binding site is accessible to the extracellular medium, and an “inward facing” conformation, in which the binding site is accessible to the intracellular environment (13Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. 1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). The translocation process is energetically coupled to the transmembrane Na+ gradient; thus, binding of Na+ together with substrate initiates translocation and transition of the transporter to the inward facing conformation, followed by release of substrate and Na+ to the intracellular environment. It is clear that this process involves major conformational changes in the transporter. Nevertheless, we currently have limited insight into the parts of the molecule that are involved in these conformational changes and accordingly the parts of the molecule that forms the predicted external and internal “gates” capable of controlling access to the substrate binding site from the extracellular and intracellular environment, respectively. It is interesting to note, however, that previous cysteine accessibility studies using sulfhydryl-specific MTS (methanethiosulfonate) reagents have led to the identification of some “conformationally sensitive” positions, such as two positions in TM3 of the NET and SERT (14Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a conserved cysteine in the first extracellular loop (Cys-90 in DAT) (15Ferrer J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a series of recent studies, we have obtained compelling evidence that a region encompassing the extracellular parts of TM7 and TM8 plays a critical role in the translocation process (6Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Initially, we identified an endogenous high affinity Zn2+ binding site in the hDAT with two of the Zn2+ coordinating residues situated in this part of the transporter (His-375 at the extracellular end of TM7 and Glu-396 at the extracellular end of TM8) (Fig. 1) (6Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we were able to engineer a series of artificial Zn2+ binding sites in the hDAT between the extracellular parts of TM7 and TM8 (8Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Given the strict geometrical requirements for binding of the zinc(II) ion, these results defined the close proximity between TM7 and TM8 in the tertiary structure of hDAT and the structural inferences allowed the development of a molecular model of the TM7/8 microdomain (8Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, the results supported a pivotal role of this domain for transporter function because Zn2+ binding to these sites potently inhibited substrate translocation in a noncompetitive manner (8Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this effect is that Zn2+ inhibits critical motion of TM7 relative to TM8 by imposing a structural constraint between the two helices. Alternatively, the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ could be caused by a change in the local electrostatic potential, leading to an indirect inhibition of the translocation process. In this study we have addressed this question and further explored the functional significance of the TM7/8 region for transporter function by application of the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). A series of single cysteine substitutions was carried out at the extracellular ends of TM7 and TM8 in background mutants of hDAT with either five (X5C) or two (E2C) endogenous cysteines substituted rendering the transporter largely insensitive to modification with cysteine-reactive reagents (15Ferrer J. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Two mutants (M371C and T399C) are strongly inactivated by the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET). Interestingly, the inactivation of M371C shows dependence on the presence of Na+ and is blocked by dopamine with no effect of the inhibitor cocaine. In contrast, inactivation of A399C is unaffected by sodium and dopamine but blocked by cocaine. We infer from the data that the TM7/8 region is highly conformationally active and likely undergoes critical conformational changes in response not only to substrates but also to sodium, as well as to inhibitors such as cocaine.

The cDNA encoding the hDAT mutant X5C, containing the mutations C90A, C135A, C306A, C319F, and C342A (15Ferrer J. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The hDAT E2C mutant in pCIHyg (15Ferrer J. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) containing the mutations C90A and C306A was also provided by Dr. Jonathan Javitch. Before further mutagenesis was performed, the X5C and E2C cDNA was excised from pCIN-4/pCIHyg and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV (18Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B.

Mutants were generated in this background by PCR-derived mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The generated PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into pRC/CMV-hDAT. All mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing using an ABI 310 automated sequencer according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Expression in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamycin (all from Invitrogen). WT and mutant transporters were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (20Johansen T.E. Scholler M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Gether U. Marray T. Schwartz T.W. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). [3H]Dopamine Uptake Experiments—Uptake assays were performed modified from Giros et al. (22Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar) using 2,5,6-[3H]dopamine (7–21 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Transfected COS-7 cells were plated in 12- or 24-well dishes (1–3 × 105 cells/well) to achieve an uptake level of 5–10% of total added [3H]dopamine. The uptake assays were carried out 2 days after transfection. Prior to the experiment, the cells were washed once in 500 μl of uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, 1 μm Ro 41-0960, pH 7.4) at room temperature. Non-labeled compounds were added to the cells in indicated concentrations, and uptake was initiated by addition of 40–100 nm [3H]dopamine in a final volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold uptake buffer, lysed in 300 μl of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and left for 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were subsequently transferred to 24-well counting plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by addition of 600 μl of Opti-phase HiSafe 3 scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mm dopamine (RBI, Natick, MA). All determinations were performed in triplicate. [3H]CFT Binding Experiments—Binding assays were carried out on intact COS-7 cells using [3H]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT) (85 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as radioligand. One day after transfection, cells were seeded in either 24-well dishes (105 cells/well) or 12-well dishes (3 × 105 cells/well) to achieve a binding level of 5–10% of total added [3H]CFT. Two days after transfection, competition binding assays were performed in a final volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer containing 2–3 nm [3H]CFT and the following molar concentrations of CFT: 0, 10–10, 10–9, 3 × 10–9, 10–8, 3 × 10–8, 10–7, 3 × 10–7,10–6,10–5, and 10–4. Binding was terminated after2hat4 °C by washing the cells twice in 500 μl of ice-cold uptake buffer prior to lysis in 250 μl of 1% SDS for 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were transferred to 24-well counting plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by addition of 500 μl of Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subsequent counting of the plates in a Wallac Tri-Lux β scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm CFT (RBI). Determinations were made in triplicate. [3H]Dopamine Uptake Experiments with MTSET Preincubation—Two days after transfection, cells seeded in 12- or 24-well plates were washed once with 500 μl of uptake buffer (see above). The cells were subsequently incubated with the indicated concentration of MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) at 37 °C for 10 min or as indicated. The stock MTSET solution in H2O was freshly prepared and diluted 10-fold directly into a total volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer before initiation of [3H]dopamine uptake, performed as described above. To investigate the effect of l-cysteine addition on reactivation, the cells were treated with 0.1 mm MTSET for 10 min at 37 °C as described above. Subsequently the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer, and incubated with 12 mml-cysteine at 37 °C in a total volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer for indicated periods of time before the [3H]dopamine uptake assay was performed. The effects of substrates and blockers on MTSET reactivity were investigated by incubation with 50 μm dopamine, 10 μm cocaine, or other substrate or inhibitor at 37 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer, followed by treatment with 0.1 mm MTSET for 0–10 min in the continued presence of substrate or inhibitor. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer before initiation of [3H]dopamine uptake assay. For the assessment of Na+ dependence, cells were treated with 0.1 mm MTSET for 10 min in either one of the following buffers: Na+ buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm LiCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, 1 μm Ro 41-0960, pH 7.4), Li+ buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm LiCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, 1 μm Ro 41-0960, pH 7.4) or NMDG buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm NMDE, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, 1 μm Ro 41-0960, pH 7.4), followed by 5 min of [3H]dopamine uptake assay, as described above. [3H]CFT Binding Experiments with MTSET Preincubation—Two days after transfection, cells seeded in 12- or 24-well plates were washed once with 500 μl of uptake buffer (see above). The effects of substrates and inhibitors on MTSET reactivity were investigated by preincubation with or without indicated concentrations of dopamine or cocaine for 10 min in a total volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer, followed by treatment with 0.1 mm MTSET for 0–10 min in the continued presence of substrate or inhibitor. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer before initiation of the [3H]CFT binding assay performed as described above. For the assessment of Na+ dependence, cells were treated with 0.1 mm MTSET for 10 min in Na+ buffer or NMDG buffer (buffer composition described above), followed by [3H]CFT binding assay, as described above. Data Calculations—Uptake data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 3.0 from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). The IC50 values used in the estimation of K M were calculated from means of pIC50 values and the S.E. interval from the pIC50 ± S.E. The K I values were calculated from the IC50-values using the equation K I = IC50/(1 + (L/K M)) (L = concentration of [3H]dopamine). Unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by either the Newman-Keuls or Dunnett multiple comparison post hoc test was used for statistical analysis, as indicated in legends to figures. MTSET Derivatization of Zn2 + Coordinating Residues—His-375 and Glu-396 are situated at the extracellular end of TM7 and TM8, respectively, and constitute two of the three coordinating residues in the endogenous high affinity Zn2+ binding site of the hDAT (Fig. 1) (6Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, they constituted two of the three coordinating residues in a series of designed sites in which the position of the third coordinating residue was varied (8Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At all these sites, Zn2+ binding leads to potent inhibition of dopamine uptake without affecting the ability for dopamine to bind, indicating that Zn2+ inhibits [3H]dopamine uptake by specifically inhibiting the translocation process (8Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this inhibition, we replaced, one at a time, His-375 and Glu-396 with cysteines. The substitutions were done in the X5C background, resulting in X5C-H375C and X5C-E396C. We hypothesized that, if Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake is caused by a simple change in the local electrostatic potential as a result of the presence of a positive charge, then modification of H375C and E396C with a positively charged cysteine-reactive compound such as MTSET (15Ferrer J. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) would be expected to result in decreased [3H]dopamine uptake. However, as shown in Fig. 2A, MTSET treatment did not lead to a substantial inhibition of transporter function. Five minutes of incubation with 1 mm MTSET prior to the [3H]dopamine uptake assay caused ∼35% stimulation of [3H]dopamine uptake in X5C-H375C and a modest ∼20% decrease in [3H]dopamine uptake in X5C-H396C (Fig. 2A). Saturation uptake experiments showed that these changes were caused by an increased V max in case of X5C-H375C and a decreased V max in case of X5C-E396C with no changes in K M (Table I). To ensure that reaction with MTSET had actually taken place, we measured the effect of Zn2+ on [3H]dopamine uptake in the two mutants. In the absence of MTSET, Zn2+ inhibited [3H]dopamine uptake in both X5C-H375C and X5C-E396C with IC50 values of 0.5 (0.4–0.6) μm and 0.1 (0.1–0.2) μm (means (S.E. interval)), respectively, versus 0.46 (0.41–0.53) μm in X5C (Fig. 2, B–D). This suggests that a cysteine residue can substitute for both His-375 and Glu-396 in the endogenous Zn2+ binding site. Following treatment with MTSET, high affinity Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake by the two mutants was eliminated (Fig. 2, C and D). This indicates that both H375C and E396C are accessible and react with MTSET but that the presence of a positive charge is not sufficient to cause a major inhibition of the translocation process but can cause either a minor inhibition (E396C) or even a potentiation (H375C).Table IDopamine uptake characteristics for hDAT-X5C and mutants with and without MTSET treatmentConstructBuffer1 mM MTSETnV max ± S.E.KM (S.E. interval)V max ± S.E.KM (S.E. interval)fmol/min/105 cellsμMfmol/min/105 cellsμMX5C1000 ± 1501.5 (1.3-1.8)950 ± 1501.5 (1.3-1.7)8X5C-M371C400 ± 600.7 (0.6-0.8)90 ± 133 (2-4)5X5C-H375C46 ± 81.1 (0.7-1.6)70 ± 151.6 (1.1-2.4)4X5C-E396C540 ± 1301.6 (1.2-2.0)450 ± 1001.3 (0.9-2.0)3X5C-A399C50 ± 100.35 (0.27-0.45)11 ± 41.5 (0.7-3.4)3 Open table in a new tab Identification of MTSET-sensitive Positions at the Extracellular Ends of TM7 and TM8 —Next we performed additional single cysteine substitutions at positions 371–374 at the extracellular end of TM7 and at positions 397–400 at the extracellular end of TM8 in the hDAT-X5C background (Fig. 1). The cysteine mutants were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for sensitivity to MTSET treatment in [3H]dopamine uptake experiments. All the mutants were functional (Table I and data not shown). Of the 11 mutants, only 2 (X5C-M371C and X5C-A399C) were inactivated to a substantial degree by MTSET (Fig. 3). In X5C-M371C, 5 min of treatment with 1 mm MTSET reduced [3H]dopamine uptake by ∼70%, whereas in the X5C-A399C mutant [3H]dopamine uptake was reduced by ∼76% (Fig. 3). In the other mutants, [3H]dopamine uptake was inhibited by <20% upon MTSET treatment (Fig. 3). Time Course and Concentration Dependence of MTSET Inactivation—The observed MTSET inactivation of X5C-M371C and X5C-A399C was further investigated by determining the time course of inactivation and the concentration dependence of inactivation. The maximal inhibition of X5C-A399C by MTSET inactivation was greater than that for X5C-M371C (Fig. 4). In addition, the time-course experiments showed that the rate of inactivation was faster in X5C-A399C than in X5C-M371C (X5C-A399C: t ½ = 0.45 min–1; X5C-M371C: t ½ = 1.44 min–1) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, dose-response experiments with MTSET showed that, after 10 min of incubation, maximal inhibition of X5C-A399C occurred at a concentration of 0.1 mm MTSET, whereas 0.5 mm MTSET was required in X5C-M371A (Fig. 4B). Thus, position 399 is more reactive with MTSET than position 371. This may result from increased accessibility and/or differences in the ionization of the substituted cysteines. The mechanism responsible for the observed inhibition on uptake capacity in X5C-M371C and X5C-A399C was investigated by performing saturation uptake experiments with [3H]dopamine with and without MTSET treatment. These experiments showed that treatment with 1 mm MTSET for 10 min elicited profound decreases in the V max values with only a marginal increase in the K M for [3H]dopamine uptake (Table I). We also mutated Met-371 and Ala-399 to valine to exclude the possibility that the observed MTSET inactivation was caused by reaction with an endogenous cysteine that was still present in the X5C construct and that had become reactive in X5C-M371C and X5C-A399C. Both mutants (X5C-M371V and X5C-A399V) were fully functional (data not shown), but they were essentially insensitive to MTSET treatment (Fig. 4C). A higher accessibility of X5C-A399C as compared with X5C-M371C was further supported by reactivation experiments in which we examined the ability of extracellularly applied l-cysteine to reduce the disulfide bridge between the cysteine sulfhydryl and the 2-trimethylammonium ethane-thiol of MTSET, and thereby reactivate X5C-M371C and X5C-A399C. Consistent with the faster MTSET reaction rate of the X5C-A399C mutant, this mutant was reactivated to a larger extent by free l-cysteine than was X5C-M371C (Fig. 5). Na + Dependence of MTSET Inactivation—Binding of Na+ is one of the initial events in the transport cycle, and it is believed to be accompanied by conformational changes. Therefore, we investigated whether the accessibility of MTSET to X5C-M371C an"

After purification, α and β showed activator activities of approximately 0.4 and 0.05%, respectively, as compared with that of native SK, measured in the presence of human plasmin, but the bi-domain constructs αβ and βγ showed much higher co-factor activities (3.5 and 0.7% of native SK, respectively). Resonant Mirror-based binding studies showed that the single-domain constructs had significantly lower affinities for “partner” HPG, whereas the affinities of the two-domain constructs were remarkably native-like with regards to both binary-mode as well as ternary mode (“substrate”) binding with HPG, suggesting that the vast difference in co-factor activity between the two- and three-domain structures did not arise merely from affinity differences between activator species and HPG. Remarkably, when the co-factor activities of the various constructs were measured with microplasminogen, the nearly 50-fold difference in the co-factor activity between the two- and three-domain SK constructs observed with full-length HPG as substrate was found to be dramatically attenuated, with all three types of constructs now exhibiting a low activity of approximately 1–2% compared to that of SK·HPN and HPG. Thus, the docking of substrate through the catalytic domain at the active site of SK-plasmin(ogen) is capable of engendering, at best, only a minimal level of co-factor activity in SK·HPN. Therefore, apart from conferring additional substrate affinity through kringle-mediated interactions, reported earlier (Dhar et al., 2002; J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13257), selective interactions between all three domains of SK and the kringle domains of substrate vastly accelerate the plasminogen activation reaction to near native levels.

Chem. 277, 13257), selective interactions between all three domains of SK and the kringle domains of substrate vastly accelerate the plasminogen activation reaction to near native levels. Streptokinase (SK) 1The abbreviations used are: SK, streptokinase; nSK, native-like streptokinase; HPG, human plasminogen; HPN, human plasmin; μPG, microplasminogen; EACA, ϵ-amino caproic acid; SAK, staphylokinase.1The abbreviations used are: SK, streptokinase; nSK, native-like streptokinase; HPG, human plasminogen; HPN, human plasmin; μPG, microplasminogen; EACA, ϵ-amino caproic acid; SAK, staphylokinase. is a widely used bacterial thrombolytic protein that is secreted by several species of β-hemolytic streptococci (1Castellino F.J. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 431-446Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2International Study of Infarct Survival-3 Collaborative GroupLancet. 1992; 339: 753-781Abstract PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). It consists of a single polypeptide chain of 414 residues and is organized into three structurally similar, independently folding domains (termed α, β, and γ in order from N to C terminus of the polypeptide) that are separated by coiled coils and small flexible regions at the two ends (3Conejero-Lara F.

Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Like several other well known thrombolytic proteins, such as urokinase and tissue-plasminogen activator, SK exerts its effects through the conversion of human plasminogen (HPG) to its proteolytically active form, plasmin (HPN). Thus, during the treatment of various circulatory disorders, e.g. myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, etc., HPN generated by the activation of HPG helps restore blood flow to the afflicted part by proteolytic dissolution of the fibrin in the pathological clot. In contrast to tissue-plasminogen activator and urokinase, which are intrinsically HPG-specific proteases and thus “directly” act on HPG, SK is an enzymatically inert protein (6Christensen L.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1947; 30: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, it recruits circulating HPG to generate HPG activating potential; SK first combines with “partner” HPG in an equimolar manner to form a tight, enzymatically active complex, the so-called SK·HPG “virgin” activator complex (7McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Reddy K.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which rapidly converts into a SK·HPN complex. The mature SK·HPN activator complex then catalytically transforms “substrate” molecules of HPG to HPN (1Castellino F.J. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 431-446Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Plasmin is essentially a protease with a trypsin-like side chain specificity and broad substrate specificity. Free HPN cannot activate substrate HPG to HPN, but once combined with SK, the hitherto “nonspecific” active site of HPN becomes inordinately specific for the cleavage of the Arg561-Val562 scissile peptide bond in substrate HPG (9Markus G. Werkheiser W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This remarkable alteration of the macromolecular substrate specificity of HPN by SK as a result of the latter's “protein co-factor” property, which has been a subject of intense investigations, is currently thought to be due to exosites generated on the SK·HPN activator complex, as demonstrated recently by the elegant use of active site-labeled fluorescent HPN derivatives (10Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Deciphering the molecular details of the mechanism and associated structure-function co-relations whereby SK modulates the substrate preference of the active site of plasmin(ogen) after complexation with the latter is undoubtedly vital to the successful design of improved SK-based thrombolytic proteins of the future (11Marder V.J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 1039-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Esmon C.T. Mather T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the fact that both participants are complex, multi-domain proteins: SK, with its three structurally homologous domains (3Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Smith R.A.G. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2583-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and HPG, composed of a catalytic and five kringle domains (1Castellino F.J. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 431-446Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Sottrup-Jensen L. Clayes H. Eajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinol. Thrombol. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar), greatly compounds the structure-function challenges involved in solving this question. The crystal structure of SK complexed with microplasmin (the catalytic protease domain of HPN, devoid of its five kringle domains) has provided insights regarding the molecular mechanism whereby SK manages to switch the substrate specificity of the active site of HPN (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), indications of which had also been gleaned earlier through solution studies (14Nihalani D. Raghava G.P.S. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that SK acts as a protein co-factor of the plasmin active site by forming a “three-sided valley” around the active center by virtue of its tri-domain structure. Thus, it has been postulated that the docking of the catalytic subunit of HPG onto the activator complex by protein-protein interactions facilitates cleavage of the scissile peptide bond in the macromolecular substrate by an otherwise nonspecific active site (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure does not provide any indication of whether the kringle domains of the substrate play any role in this process.In contrast to the three-domain structure of SK, staphylokinase (SAK), another functionally similar, “indirect” HPG activator protein but one that has a single domain only, also operates by docking substrate HPG into the active center of its binary complex with plasmin(ogen) (16Parry M.A.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.-P. Schlott B. Gührs K.-H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although SAK displays little sequence similarity with SK, its single domain bears a remarkable conformational similarity with one of the three SK domains in particular (the α domain) and all three domains of SK in general, which, in turn, are structurally homologous to each other (17Parry M.A.A. Zhang X.C. Bode W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 53-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the SAK·HPN activator complex is known to possess a significantly lower catalytic efficiency than SK·HPN (18Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shibata H. Nagaoka M. Sakai M. Sawada H. Watanabe T. Yokokura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Apart from the single-domain prototypic structure of SAK, another mechanistically similar plasminogen activator from Streptococcus uberis (abbreviated SUPA) has also been isolated that possesses a two-domain structural motif (20Johnsen L.B. Poulsen K. Kilian M. Petersen T.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Johnsen L.B. Rasmussen L. Petersen T. Etzerodt M. Fedosov S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6440-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, a compelling need exists to glean insights regarding the similarities and dissimilarities in the “design principles” between the three-domain SK, on the one hand, and the single- and two-domain structures of SAK and SUPA on the other, particularly in terms of the structure-function co-relations that underlie the interdomain co-operativity between the individual SK domains.Taking a minimalist approach, a pertinent question that can be posed in the above context is whether any of the isolated domains of SK also possess, like the single domain of SAK, the ability to bind with HPG in both substrate and partner modes and, if the answer is affirmative, whether this binding is functionally translated into a capability, even if highly compromised compared with native SK, to switch the nonspecific substrate preference of partner plasmin to that of a HPG activator enzyme. A recent study (22Loy J.A. Lin X. Schenone M. Castellino F.J. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14686-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has attempted to address this issue, particularly in terms of the functional properties of single SK domains, and elegantly demonstrated the presence of detectable, albeit very low levels of HPG activator activity in two of the three SK domains. The results of this study also stimulate curiosity about the possibility of a hierarchical generation of catalytic activity in SK (i.e. the possible existence of a progressive increase in co-factor activity from the single- to two-domain, and finally, to the three-domain native motif) and the need to gain meaningful insights into the design principle(s) selected by evolution for plasminogen activators of bacterial origin. As a first step in this direction, in the present study we have therefore expressed each of the three domains of SK, as well as their two-domain combinations (viz. αβ and βγ) in a heterologous expression system and compared their catalytic and binding properties both against full-length macromolecular substrate, HPG as well as its kringle-less derivative, microplasminogen (μPG). Thus, with this approach, we have attempted to explore the interdomain co-operation prevalent in SK, as well as between the SK·HPG activator complex and substrate HPG. The results presented below reveal that the kringle domains of substrate help not only in substrate docking, as proposed recently (23Dhar J. Pande A.H. Sundram V. Nanda J.S. Mande S.C. Sahni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13257-13267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Lin L.-F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but also in substrate turnover, even though they are distinctly apart from the immediate microenvironment of the “target” scissile peptide bond, the specific region of the substrate polypeptide that is selectively cleaved during plasminogen activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHPG was either purchased from Roche Applied Science or purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography (25Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). The cloning vector pBluescript II KS–, thermostable DNA polymerase (Pfu) and Escherichia coli strain XL-Blue were procured from Stratagene Inc. (La Jolla, CA). All other enzymes used for genetic manipulation were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The oligonucleotide primers were either synthesized in-house on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer model 492 or custom-synthesized by Ransom Hill Biosciences Inc. (Ramona, CA). DEAE-Sepharose (Fast-flow) and Chelating Sepharose were procured from Amersham Biosciences, and phenyl-agarose for hydrophobic interaction chromatography was purchased from Affinity Chromatography Ltd. The T7 RNA polymerase promoter-based expression vector, pET-23d and Bug buster® (a commercial reagent for rapid bacterial cell lysis) were procured from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). All other chemicals used were of the best commercial grade available.Expression and Purification of SK from E. coliThe plasmid construct for the intracellular expression of SK in E. coli (pET-23d-SK) under the control of the T7 phage RNA polymerase promoter has been described (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purification involved lyzing the cells by sonication followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation) and two chromatographic steps, viz. hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-agarose and anion exchange chromatography. This yielded homogeneous SK with an overall yield of 55–60% with a specific activity of 1.1 × 105 IU/mg protein (27Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Cloning of Single and Bi-domains of SKThe exact boundaries of individual domains were selected based on limited proteolysis data (4Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which also cross-correlated well with the limits defined by the crystal structure of SK (5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The sequences 1–143 and 143–293 were chosen to represent the α domain and the β domain, respectively (4Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The γ domain (SK293–414) was cloned from the region coding for residues 300–387, because the C-terminal end of the γ domain (residues 388–414) contains residues that are not critical for the functioning of full-length SK and forms a disorganized and flexible segment that undergoes rapid degradation in the presence of HPN (4Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A.G. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C.

Malke H. Gerlach D. Ferretti J.J. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The construction of the truncated derivatives of SK was carried out by PCR amplification of the desired sequence, using SK as template, and specific upstream and downstream primers that also contained specific restriction endonuclease (RE) sites to allow for facile, directional docking of the amplified fragment into pET-23d-SK. Primers for the construction of the α domain were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-AGCCAATTAGACGTCAGCGTTGCAGAAACTGTTGAGG-3′, and downstream primer, 5′-ATCTTGCTCGAGAACGCGCACATGTCCACTTAGCAA-3′. Primers for the construction of the β domain were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-TCAGCCATGGTTAGACCATATAAA-3′, and downstream primer, 5′-ATGGGGATCCTATTTCAAGTGACTGCGATCAAAGGG-3′. Primers for the construction of the γ domain were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-ATACCATGGTTGATGTCGATACTAATGAA-3′, and downstream primer, 5′-TTGCTCGAGGGCTAAATGATAGCTGGCATTCTC-3′. Construct αβ was prepared as follows: The “vector” DNA fragment obtained after digestion of pET-23d-β with the REs BglII and BseRI was ligated with the “insert” fragment obtained from the digestion of pET-23d-SK with the same REs. Primers for the construction of βγ were as follows: upstream primer, 5′-TCAGCCATGGTTAGACCATATAAA-3′, and downstream primer, 5′-ATAGGCTAAATGATAGCTAGCATTCTCTCCTTC-3′.Purification of His6-tagged α and γ Domains Using Metal Affinity ChromatographyThe single-domain constructs, α as well as γ, were expressed as proteins with His6 tag extensions at their C termini to aid their purification by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (30Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). The α domain was found predominantly in the form of inclusion bodies, whereas the γ domain remained soluble in the intracellular milieu of E. coli. Hence, inclusion bodies of the α domain obtained after lyses of the cells with Bug buster reagent were first dissolved in 8 m urea. The inclusion bodies of the α domain dissolved in 8 m urea and the soluble γ domain obtained after cell lysis were further diluted 15-fold in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm imidazole and 250 mm NaCl before loading on the immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrices. Successive washes with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 60 mm imidazole and 250 mm NaCl were given to remove unwanted, loosely bound proteins, and the His-tagged proteins were finally eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm imidazole and 250 mm NaCl.Purification of β Domain of SKThe β domain of SK (residues 143–293) was expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein at a level ∼30% of the total soluble protein fraction and was purified as described earlier (23Dhar J. Pande A.H. Sundram V. Nanda J.S. Mande S.C. Sahni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13257-13267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Purification of the Two-domain Constructs αβ (SK 1–293) and βγ (SK 143–414)The covalently contiguous two-domain construct, αβ, was expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli BL-21 cells, whereas the βγ protein was expressed predominantly as inclusion bodies. The purification involved lyzing the cells by sonication followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation) and two tandem chromatographic steps, namely hydrophobic ion chromatography on phenyl-agarose and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (Fast-flow) essentially as described for SK above. The eluted fractions contained protein that was more than 95% pure as analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Circular Dichroic Analysis of nSK/SK DomainsFar-UV CD spectra of SK/SK domains (concentration 0.15 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2) were recorded on a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter. Measurements were carried out from 190 to 250 nm in a 0.1-cm-pathlength cuvette, and the appropriate buffer base line was subtracted from the protein spectra. The final spectrum analyzed was an average of 10 scans. Secondary structure analysis to compute the content of α helix, β sheet, random coil, and other secondary structure(s) were carried out using the algorithm described by Yang et al. (31Yang J.T. Wu C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar).Preparation of MicroplasminogenMicroplasminogen, the catalytic domain of plasminogen (residues Lys539–Asn790), devoid of all the kringles was prepared by cleavage of HPG by HPN under alkaline conditions (0.1 n glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.5, 10:1 ratio of HPG and HPN) at 30 °C. Microplasminogen was purified from the reaction mixture by passing through a Lys-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by a Soyabean-trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose CL-4B column to absorb HPN and microplasmin, as reported (23Dhar J. Pande A.H. Sundram V. Nanda J.S. Mande S.C. Sahni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13257-13267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Shi G.-Y. Wu H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flow-through was then subjected to molecular sieve chromatography, after concentration by ultrafiltration, on a column (16 × 60 cm) of Superdex-75™ (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of μPG formed was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band moving at the position expected from its molecular size (32Shi G.-Y. Wu H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing. Activation with urokinase, which is known to be an efficient activator of μPG despite the absence of kringle domains in the latter, was used to establish that the rate of activation of this preparation, when used as substrate, was comparable with that obtained when using SK·HPN as the activator species.Assay for Detection of Extremely Low HPG Activation CapabilityCatalytic amounts of domains were added to the assay buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing 2 μm of HPG and chromogenic substrate (0.5 mm), and the change in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm as a function of time at 22 °C (Pathway I). To detect intrinsically low HPG activation capability in single-domain/bidomain construct(s) that may otherwise not be capable of activating the partner HPG unless provided with a preformed active site (i.e. only Pathway II capability), equimolar complexes of HPN and the SK derivative were premixed on ice for 1 min, and catalytic amounts were withdrawn and added to 2 μm HPG and chromogenic peptide substrate in the assay buffer containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) in case of single-domain proteins and 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) in case of the two-domain proteins. The reactions were recorded spectrophotometrically at 405 nm, and the progress curves obtained from corresponding control reactions (containing HPG and same amounts of HPN but no domain) were subtracted from the test reactions. The resultant curves so obtained were used to determine the rate of HPG activation, which was then expressed as a percentage of activity, relative to SK. The initial phase (0–8 min) was generally used for this calculation in both cases, to overcome any loss of activity at later stages caused by possible proteolytic stability.To establish whether the isolated domains had genuine activator activities over and above that associated with the background cells, E. coli BL21 cultures transformed with the pET-23d vector but not containing any domain-encoding insert, after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, were harvested and lyzed similarly to ones prepared for purifying the individual domain(s). These cell lysates were subjected to exactly the same treatments as the ones prepared from cultures harboring plasmids for α, β, or γ, including immobilized metal affinity chromatography and desalting steps. The fractions from “control” columns (on which the lysates containing just the expression plasmids without any SK domain insert were processed) identical in volume to the corresponding eluted protein fractions from the “test” columns (from which the domains were being purified) were collected in parallel and were then used for assessing HPG activator activity. The control fractions, which served to measure the background E. coli cell-associated HPG activator activity consistently, showed a very low level of activity (<0.005%) but one that was significantly lower than the activity observed with any of the truncated domain constructs.Determination of Kinetic Constants for HPG Activator ActivityVarying amounts of HPG were added to the assay cuvette containing fixed amounts of single-domain or bi-domain constructs and chromogenic substrate (0.5 mm), and the change in absorbance was monitored at 405 nm as a function of time at 22 °C. Also, the kinetics of HPG activation by the activator complexes were measured by transferring suitable aliquots of preformed complexes (single-domain or bi-domain constructs, and HPN) to the assay cuvette containing different concentrations of substrate HPG. To compute the k cat, the number of functional HPN active sites was determined by titration with an active site acylating reagent, p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzoate (7McClintock D.K. Bell P.H.

This was followed by the attachment of biotinylated HPG to the streptavidin captured on the cuvette. Nonspecifically bound HPG was then removed by repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline followed by three washes with 10 mm HCl. The net response chosen for the immobilized biotinylated HPG onto the cuvette was 700–800 arc seconds in all the experiments. The experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 250 mm NaCl, and 50 μm p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzoate (binding buffer).

In this study, we focused on the variations of the Repeat region, and searched for MAP4 isoforms with diverse Repeat region organizations. We successfully isolated four types of MAP4 cDNAs, which differed from each other in both the number and the arrangement of the repeat sequences, from a single source (bovine adrenal gland). To examine the functional differences among the isoforms, we prepared the microtubule-binding domain polypeptides of three of the four isoforms, and examined their activities. The isoform fragments showed similar degrees of microtubule assembly promoting activity and microtubule binding affinity. This result suggested that the Repeat region variation is not important for the control of microtubule dynamics, which is believed to be the main function of MAPs. On the other hand, the microtubule bundle-forming activity differed among the isoform fragments. The bundle formation was augmented by increasing the number of repeat sequences in the fragments. Based on these results, we propose the hypothesis that the role of the MAP4 isoforms is to regulate the surface charge of microtubules.

Several kinds of microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPs, microtubule-associated proteins; Pro-rich, proline rich; AP sequence, assembly-promoting sequence; MDBK, Madin-Darby bovine kidney; RT, reverse transcription; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. have been identified as accessory proteins that can bind to the surface of microtubules. MAPs stimulate tubulin polymerization and stabilize microtubules in vivo (1Dustin P. Microtubules. 2nd ed. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1984Crossref Google Scholar), by assembling tubulin molecules that are otherwise unpolymerizable because of the low subcellular concentration. Therefore, MAPs are believed to play an important role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics in living cells. Several MAPs (MAP1, MAP2, MAP4, and tau) have been purified from mammalian cells and tissues and characterized well at the biochemical level (2Wiche G. Oberkanins C. Himmler A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 124: 217-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). They are categorized as neural MAPs (MAP1, MAP2, and tau) and non-neural MAPs (MAP4), based on their cellular localization.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10626-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) have revealed that MAP2, MAP4, and tau are structurally similar, with an N-terminal projection domain and a C-terminal microtubule-binding domain (16Vallee R.B.

MAP2, MAP4, and tau have a homologous sequence of 18-amino acid residues responsible for microtubule-binding activity (assembly-promoting (AP) sequence) in the microtubule-binding domain (19Joly J.C. Flynn G. Purich D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2289-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Aizawa H. Kawasaki H. Murofushi H. Kotani S. Suzuki K. Sakai H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2289-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), MAP4 (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tau (21Ennulat D.J. Liem R.K. Hashim G.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5327-5330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because MAP4 not only distributes ubiquitously (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9West R.R. Tenbarge K.M. Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21886-21896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also possesses the structural characteristics common to neural MAPs (MAP2 and tau), analyses of MAP4 will provide clues toward understanding the microtubule-dependent, fundamental cellular processes. The MAP4 cDNA was originally isolated from Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the cDNA sequence, the microtubule-binding domain of MAP4 was roughly divided into three subdomains: a region rich in proline and basic residues (Pro-rich region), a region with a tandem organization of AP sequences (“Repeat region”), 2Although this region has been referred to as “the AP sequence region” in previous works (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Matui M. Kuroya T. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Katsuki M. Tokuraku K. Nakagawa H. Murofushi H. Kotani S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we used “the Repeat region” in this report, because this term is more commonly used. and a short C-terminal region with hydrophobic and acidic residues (“Tail region”). In the Repeat region, each AP sequence is flanked by interrepeat sequences that are 13–20 amino acids long. This initial report was immediately followed by the isolations of the mouse and human MAP4 cDNAs (9West R.R. Tenbarge K.M. Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21886-21896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chapin S.J. Lue C.M. Yu M.T. Bulinski J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In human and mouse tissues, MAP4 is encoded by a single gene (9West R.R. Tenbarge K.M. Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21886-21896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the alternative splicing of the MAP4 mRNA gives transcript variants with three to five AP sequences (9West R.R. Tenbarge K.M. Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21886-21896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chapin S.J. Lue C.M. Yu M.T. Bulinski J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There are still some disagreements on the genetic organizations of the bovine, human, and mouse MAP4 species: No isoform cDNA with an AP sequence organization similar to that of the bovine MAP4 has been detected in human or mouse tissues, whereas bovine MAP4 variants with three or five AP sequences have not been found so far. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether the alternative splicing in the Repeat region is a common characteristic of the expression of mammalian MAP4. In this report, we tried to solve this problem by cloning all of the MAP4 isoforms published at present from the bovine adrenal gland. We previously reported that the bovine adrenal gland is rich in an MAP species with an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa (23Kotani S. Murofushi H. Maekawa S. Sato C. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which turned out to be the bovine MAP4. The abundance of MAP4 in adrenal cells facilitates detailed biochemical analyses (24Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Kotani S. Rec. Res. Devel. Biochem. 2002; 3: 315-333Google Scholar). The presence of MAP4 isoforms with different AP sequence organizations suggests that each isoform is assigned to a specific function, depending on the number of AP sequences. In the case of tau, functional differences between the isoforms containing three and four AP sequences were reported (25Goode B.L. Chau M. Denis P.E. Feinstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38182-38189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26Utton M.A. Gibb G.M. Burdett I.D.J. Anderton B.H. Vandecandelaere A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34288-34297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although Chapin et al. (22Chapin S.J. Lue C.M. Yu M.T. Bulinski J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) demonstrated that several different MAP4 isoforms are expressed in different tissues and at various developmental stages, the functional differences of the MAP4 isoforms with three, four, and five repeats have not been elucidated. The tandem organization of the AP sequence had been considered to be important for the nucleation step of tubulin polymerization (20Aizawa H. Kawasaki H. Murofushi H. Kotani S. Suzuki K. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5885-5890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by allowing a MAP molecule to bind to several unpolymerized tubulin molecules simultaneously. Unfortunately, the experimental results did not support this idea. We have shown that the nucleation activity depends on the Pro-rich region, rather than the Repeat region (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and other groups (28Coffey R.C. Joly J.C. Cain B.D. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13199-13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have determined the binding stoichiometry between tubulin and MAPs, which revealed that one MAP molecule with three to five AP sequences can bind to no more than one or two tubulin molecules (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Coffey R.C. Joly J.C. Cain B.D. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13199-13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), clearly contradicting the idea that each AP sequence is active in binding to a separate tubulin molecule. In this study, we successfully isolated all of the MAP4 isoform cDNAs, which have been reported in different species, from a single source. We also investigated how MAP4 modifies its interaction with microtubules by changing the number of AP sequences, using recombinant fragments corresponding to the microtubule-binding domain of bovine MAP4 with three, four, and five AP sequences. This is the first report on the functional differences of MAP4 isoforms in vitro. Materials—Taxol was generously supplied by Dr. N. Lomax, of the Natural Products Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. It was dissolved in Me2SO to a stock concentration of 1 mm and was stored at –20 °C. Restriction enzymes, Taq polymerase (Ex Taq), RNase-free DNase, and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). DNA ligase was purchased from Toyobo Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Escherichia coli XL1-blue MRF′ and XL2-blue cells were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The protease-deficient E. coli BL-21(DE3)pLysS cells, the protein expression vector pET-21d(+), and the T-Vector pT7Blue were from Novagen (Madison, WI). The AlkPhos-Direct kit, the Hybond N+ nylon membranes, the AlkPhos direct hybridization buffer, and the ECF detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). The sources of other materials are given in the text. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Cloning of MAP4 Isoform cDNAs—MAP4 isoforms were cloned by either reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or cDNA library screening. To carry out RT-PCR, total cellular RNA was isolated from adult bovine adrenal gland (containing the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla) by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase to remove any contaminating DNA. The DNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT)18 primer pair and recombinant Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan). Oligonucleotide primers that would specifically amplify the cDNA encoding the Repeat region of bovine MAP4 were designed based on the previously published MAP4 sequence (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primers, AP-f and AP-r, with the sequences 5′-TGC CAA CGC TTC TGC CC-3′ (nucleotides 2610–2626; numbers indicate positions of primers in the MAP4 cDNA according to the numbering in Aizawa et al. (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and 5′-GCC CTC AGT CTT CAC GG-3′ (nucleotides 2999–3015), respectively, were purchased from Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). These primers spanned a 406-bp portion of the MAP4 cDNA between bases 2610 and 3015. Thirty rounds of amplification were carried out using the following parameters: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; annealing at 57 °C for 30 s; and primer extension at 72 °C for 120 s, on an Astec thermocycler (Astec, model PC-700, Fukuoka, Japan). The PCR was completed with a final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. The resulting PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis. For cloning PCR products into the T-Vector pT7Blue, the bands encoding the Repeat region of MAP4 were excised from an agarose gel and purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). Purified PCR products were then ligated into the vector. Plasmids from transformed E. coli XL2-blue cells were isolated and sequenced. To construct the cDNA library, total cellular RNA was prepared from bovine adrenal gland, and poly(A+) RNA was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. The cDNA library was constructed in the λ ZAP II phage vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and ∼2 × 105 recombinant phages were obtained. To isolate a partial cDNA probe for library screening, the pPA 4 gene (30Aizawa H. Emori Y. Mori A. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9841-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encoding the microtubule-binding domain of bovine MAP4, was cleaved with PstI, and a 618-bp fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA probe was labeled with alkaline phosphatase, using the AlkPhos-Direct kit. The cDNA library was plated out at a density of 2 × 104 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate. Plaques were lifted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes, and the filters were prehybridized in the AlkPhos direct hybridization buffer containing 5 mm NaCl and 5% blocking agent for 1 h at 55 °C. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 55 °C in the same solution. Washing and detection with ECF detection reagents were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 2 × 105 plaques was screened, and positive plaques were subjected to three successive rounds of purification through plaque isolation and rescreening. The isolated clones were converted in vivo to the plasmid form (pBluescriptSK(–)), using the ExAssist/SOLR System (Stratagene). The sequences of all cDNA clones were determined by electrophoresis, using a DSQ-1000 DNA sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Construction of Plasmids for the Bacterial Expression of MAP4 Fragment Polypeptides—To construct the pET-PA5T plasmid, for the expression of the PA5T fragment (containing the Pro-rich region, the Repeat region with five AP sequences, and the Tail region), the clone encoding the Repeat region with five AP sequences was first cleaved with KpnI (which cleaves at the unique KpnI site in MAP4 (see Ref. 8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for sequences) and at the KpnI site in the vector portion of the plasmid). The 2.2-kbp KpnI cDNA fragment from the clone was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and then was cleaved with NcoI. The 2.1-kbp NcoI/blunt-end cDNA fragment was purified and ligated in-frame into the expression plasmid vector pET21d(+), which had been pretreated with BamHI, T4 DNA polymerase, and NcoI. The resultant plasmid, pETPA5T, encodes a microtubule-binding domain containing five AP sequences (amino acid residues 579–1098; see Fig. 3A). To construct the plasmid pET-PA3T, for the expression of the PA3T fragment (containing the Pro-rich region, the Repeat region with three AP sequences, and the Tail region), the same procedure was used, except that a clone encoding the Repeat region with three AP sequences was used instead of the clone encoding that with five AP sequences. The resultant plasmid, pET-PA3T, encodes a microtubule-binding domain containing three AP sequences (amino acid residues 579–1029; Fig. 3A). To construct the plasmid pET-PA4T, for the expression of the PA4T fragment (containing the Pro-rich region, the Repeat region with four AP sequences, and the Tail region) with the same strategy, we used the PA 4 gene (30Aizawa H. Emori Y. Mori A. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9841-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, pET-PA4T, generates a microtubule-binding domain containing four AP sequences (amino acid residues 579–1072; Fig. 3A). None of the plasmids described here encode any additional amino acid residues on either the N- or C-terminal ends. The sequences of these constructs were confirmed as described above. Purification of Proteins—Microtubule protein was prepared from bovine brains by two cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization/depolymerization (31Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified from the two-cycle microtubule protein fractions by phosphocellulose column chromatography (32Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), and was stored at –80 °C. The recombinant plasmids for MAP4 fragments (the pET-PA3T, pETPA4T, and pET-PA5T plasmids) were each transformed into E. coli (BL-21(DE3)pLysS). The expression of these MAP4 fragments was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan) to a final concentration of 1 mm in LB medium (10 g/liter NaCl, 10 g/liter bactotryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, pH 7.2) containing chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and ampicillin (150 μg/ml) at 37 °C. The induction was continued for at least 2 h. The MAP4 fragments were purified from bacterial cells by successive column chromatographies (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the PA4T′ fragment (amino acid residues 534–1072) was carried out according to Aizawa et al. (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schematic structures of the MAP4 fragments used in this study are shown in Fig. 3A. Protein concentrations were determined in two ways, the conventional Folin-Lowry method (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the heated Biuret method of Dorsey (34Dorsey T.E. McDonald P.W. Roels O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Because the two methods gave the similar results, concentrations determined by the method of Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Preparation of Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Antiserum against the A4 fragment (30Aizawa H. Emori Y. Mori A. Murofushi H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9841-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained as described previously (36Katsuki M. Tokuraku K. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). An antibody specific to the A4 fragment was purified from the antiserum by membrane affinity adsorption (37Terasaki A.G. Nakagawa H. Kotani E. Mori H. Ohashi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 857-868PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of the MAP4 fragments was performed as described previously (38Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Matui M. Kuroya T. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the antibody is also reactive to MAP2 and tau, we call it the “anti-(AP sequence) antibody.” Analysis of the Binding of MAP4 Fragments to Taxol-stabilized Microtubules—The analysis of the binding of MAP4 fragments to taxolstabilized microtubules was performed as described previously (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of MAP4 fragments were mixed with tubulin in 100 MEM buffer (100 mm MES (pH 6.8), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm MgSO4) containing 0.5 mm GTP and 30 μm taxol (final volume, 40 μl). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C and were centrifuged. The pellets were resuspended, and then the supernatants and the pellet solutions were each electrophoresed. The two-dimensional band sizes of the MAP4 fragments and the tubulin on the polyacrylamide gels were measured by an imaging analyzer (scanner: GT9500, Epson, software: Scion Image). The amounts of proteins were determined by comparison with their respective calibration curves, which were prepared in advance by the same method. The Scatchard analysis was performed according to Coffey and Purich (39Coffey R.L. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1035-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant (K d) and the stoichiometry were calculated from the slope and the intercept, as determined by linear regression (40Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). Assay of the Assembly-promoting Activity of MAP4 Fragments under Taxol-free Conditions—Microtubule assembly was monitored by measuring either the amount of polymerized tubulin (sedimentation assay) (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or the change in absorbance at 350 nm (turbidity assay) (41Katsuki M. Tokuraku K. Nakagawa H. Murofushi H. Kotani S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The sedimentation assay was done as follows: Various concentrations of MAP4 fragments and tubulin were mixed at 0 °C in 100 MEM buffer containing 0.5 mm GTP. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and were centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min at 37 °C. The pellets were electrophoresed, and the amounts of polymerized tubulin were determined. In the turbidity assay, microtubule assembly was initiated by raising the temperature from 0 °C to 37 °C, and the subsequent polymerization was continuously monitored by the change in absorbance at 350 nm, using a Hitachi U-2000A spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). Electron Microscopy—Preparations of the microtubule samples for electron microscopic observations were carried out as described previously (27Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Nakagawa H. Kotani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For negative staining, the sample solutions were mounted on grids, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 MEM buffer at 37 °C for 5 min, and then stained with 2% uranyl acetate. For thin section observations, sample solutions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 37 °C. The pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 3% formaldehyde, and 1% tannic acid in 100 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for1hat 37 °C, and then were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 dissolved in the same buffer for 1 h. After dehydration with a graded ethanol series, the pellets were embedded in Poly/Bed 812 mixtures (Polyscience, Inc., Warrington, PA). Ultra-thin sections were cut on a Leica Super Nova ultra-microtome and were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and 0.1% lead citrate. Observations were performed with a JEOL JEM-100S electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Identification and Cloning of MAP4 Microtubule-binding Domain cDNAs—Since we have successfully established a purification system for milligram quantities of MAP4 from bovine adrenal cortex (24Tokuraku K. Katsuki M. Kotani S. Rec. Res. Devel. Biochem. 2002; 3: 315-333Google Scholar), we chose the bovine adrenal gland (containing both the adrenal cortex and medulla) for the source of MAP4 genes in this study. We first amplified cDNAs encoding the MAP4 Repeat region by an RT-PCR technique (Fig. 1A). The MAP4-specific primers were designed so we could obtain PCR products from any possible isoform that covers the Repeat region. If a transcript encoding the original bovine MAP4 (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified, then the size of the product would be 406 bp. As shown in Fig. 1B, we clearly detected a major band of ∼500 bp, along with two minor bands of ∼400 and 300 bp (lane 3). No amplification products were detected in the control sample (lane 2). Quantification of the three bands by using Image software (National Institutes of Health) revealed that the ratio of the band sizes of 500, 400, and 300 bp was 7:2:1. The data indicated that at least three cDNA variants exist that encode the MAP4 Repeat region. Unexpectedly, the band of ∼400 bp, which would correspond to the clone reported by Aizawa et al. (8Aizawa H. Emori Y. Murofushi H. Kawasaki H. Sakai H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not amplified well.

Their heat exchanger-mediated endothermy represents an interesting example of the evolutionary pressure associated with this specific characteristic. To assess the implications of endothermy for gas transport and the possible contribution of hemoglobin (Hb), we investigated the effect of temperature on the oxygen equilibria of purified isohemoglobin components V and III from the porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus). In the absence of ATP the effect of temperature on oxygen affinity is normal in both Hb III (P 50 = 0.9 and 2.2 torr at 10 and 26 °C, respectively) and Hb V (P 50 = 1.5 and 2.5 torr at 10 and 26 °C, respectively). In the presence of this effector P 50 decreases with increasing temperature in both components (P 50 at 10 and 26 °C = 9.9 and 8.4 torr (Hb III), respectively, and 9.6 and 7.4 torr (Hb V), respectively. The reverse temperature effect in the presence of ATP will reduce the risk of oxygen loss from the arterial to the venous blood by lowering the oxygen tension gradient between the blood vessels. The mechanism behind the reverse temperature effect resembles that found in the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), an endothermic teleost, thus evidencing further convergent evolution.

The mechanism behind the reverse temperature effect resembles that found in the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), an endothermic teleost, thus evidencing further convergent evolution. True tunas and lamnid sharks are the only fish that have developed endothermy. The fact that this characteristic has evolved independently in two such different families (Scombridae and Lamnidae, respectively) makes these species choice subjects for comparison of the traits associated with endothermy (1Block B.A. Finnerty J.R.

Endothermic fishes maintain body temperatures of up to 20 °C above ambient water temperatures, depending on species, water temperature, and activity level (5Carey F.G. Teal J.M. Comp. Biochem.

Graham J.B. Brill R.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 192: 33-44PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of high core body temperatures for gas transport, ion balance, oxygen consumption, aerobic capacity, and muscle performance have been the subject of extensive studies in endothermic tuna species (for review, see Refs. 8Jones D.R. Brill R.W. Mense D.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1986; 120: 201-213Google Scholar, 9Dewar H. Graham J. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 192: 13-31PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dickson K.A. Environ. Biol.

The porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) has a core body temperature of 8–10 °C above ambient water temperature (12Carey F.G. Teal J.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1969; 28: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and has one of the highest body temperatures among the Lamnidae (13Goldman K.J. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1997; 167: 423-429Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Carey F.G. Teal J.M. Kanwisher J.W. Physiol. Zool. 1981; 54: 334-344Crossref Google Scholar, 15Anderson S.D. Goldman K.J. Copeia. 2001; 3: 794-796Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As in tunas its endothermy is brought about by a number of countercurrent heat exchangers, rete mirabilia, placed in series with the heat-producing organ (16Carey F.G. Sci. Am. 1973; 228: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Graham J.B. Fish. Bull. (Wash. D. C.). 1975; 73: 219-229Google Scholar, 18Burne R.H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1923; 212B: 209-257Google Scholar). The lateral heat exchangers are placed between the surroundings and the internally located red muscle, and the major blood supply to the red muscle is directed through these via large cutaneous arteries and veins. By minimizing the heat loss via the blood, metabolically produced heat is retained within the active organ (5Carey F.G. Teal J.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1969; 28: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Carey F.G. Teal J.M. Kanwisher J.W. Lawson K.D. Am. Zool. 1971; 11: 137-145Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One consequence of heat exchanger-mediated endothermy is that factors other than heat may be exchanged. The smaller the arteries and veins constituting the heat exchanger are, the more efficient the heat retention and the warmer the fish can be relative to the surrounding water. However, decreased dimensions of the heat exchanger increase the risk of oxygen diffusing from the cold arterial blood to the warm venous blood. Already in 1960 Rossi-Fanelli and Antonini (19Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Nature. 1960; 186: 895-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) showed that temperature has virtually no effect on oxygen binding of R-state crystalline Hb 1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; MWC, Monod-Wyman-Changeux.1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; MWC, Monod-Wyman-Changeux. from the endothermic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) at pH values between 6.45 and 8.7. Further studies revealed that although temperature does not influence P 50 in the 10–30 °C temperature range, it does alter the shape of the oxygen equilibrium curve (20Carey G.F. Gibson Q.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), resulting from a normal temperature effect at low oxygen saturation and a reversed one at higher saturations. The heat exchanger-mediated endothermy represents a curious incidence of convergent evolution. In this context it is interesting to investigate whether endothermy in the porbeagle shark is associated with adaptations in the temperature sensitivities of Hb, as documented in Hb I of bluefin tuna (19Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Nature. 1960; 186: 895-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Carey G.F. Gibson Q.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This paper reports the effects of temperature, ATP, and pH on isolated Hb components III and V of the porbeagle shark. Previous studies on hemolysate indicate that the oxygen affinity of porbeagle shark blood is temperature-insensitive (22Hazard E.S. Gibson Q.H. Am. Soc. Zool. 1984; 24 (abstr.): A120Google Scholar, 23Andersen M.E. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Carey F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 331-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the allosteric mechanism behind the temperature effect remains to be investigated in purified isohemoglobins. Moreover the contribution of organic phosphates needs to be investigated in light of the observation that ATP induces a reverse temperature effect in striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) Hb (24Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Heparinized blood from a porbeagle shark (L. nasus) was supplied from North Sea fishermen. Red blood cells were lysed by addition of three volumes of 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.00 (25 °C). Following centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm to remove cell debris, the Hb stock solution was stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Isohemoglobins and Oxygen Binding Studies—Isolation of the individual Hbs was performed using preparative isoelectric focusing (column, type 8102, Amersham Biosciences) at 3.9–4.5 °C (Fig. 1) after CO equilibration of the hemolysate. The ampholytes (Amersham Biosciences AB) used were pH 6–8 (40%) and pH 6.7–7.7 (60%) in a sucrose gradient. The seven separated components were dialyzed against three changes of CO-equilibrated, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Three Hb components (Hb V, IV, and III) accounted by far for most of the Hb (Fig. 1). Their isoelectric points at 16 °C were 7.58, 7.62, and 7.68, respectively. Given the small differences in isoelectric points and the fact that fish Hbs with similar electrophoretic mobility exhibit basically similar functional properties (25Weber R.E. di Prisco G. Giardina B. Weber R.E. Hemoglobin Functions in Vertebrates: Molecular Adaptations to Extreme and Temperate Environments. Springer-Verlag, Milan, Italy2000: 23-27Google Scholar), further investigations were focused on Hb V and III. Hb concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using millimolar extinction coefficients of oxyhemoglobin: 14.37 (β) and 15.37 (α) at 542 and 577 nm, respectively. Hb solutions were concentrated where necessary by ultrafiltration using Centriprep YM-10 tubes (Amicon Bioseparations, Millipore). Oxygen binding was measured at heme concentrations of 0.29–0.30 mm in 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.304 ± 0.008. Values of pH were measured using a thermostatted BMS Mk2 capillary electrode (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) calibrated with S1500 and S1510 precision buffers (Radiometer). Oxygen binding equilibria were generated at 10, 16, 21, and 26 °C in the absence or presence of ATP (ATP/Hb4 ratio, >30) using a modified gas-diffusion chamber allowing stepwise increments of oxygen partial pressure (26Fago A. Bendixen E. Malte H. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15628-15635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The chamber was coupled to two cascaded Wösthoff pumps (type M201a-f and M301) for admixture of atmospheric air, O2, and pure N2 (99.998%). Based on close similarity of the temperature sensitivities of Hbs III and V, analysis of the interactive effects of pH in the absence and presence of ATP was limited to Hb III. Data Analysis—Extended Hill plots were analyzed using the MWC (two-state) model (27Monod J. Wyman J. Changeaux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6108) Google Scholar) S=LKTP(1+KTP)(q-1)+KRP(1+KRP)(q-1)L(1+KTP)q+(1+KRP)q(Eq. 1) where S denotes saturation, P the partial pressure of oxygen, L the allosteric constant, K T and K R the association constants for the low affinity (T, tense) and the high affinity (R, relaxed) forms, respectively, and q the number of interacting binding sites. Based on the results of Andersen et al. (23Andersen M.E. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Carey F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 331-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who performed ultracentrifugation on hemolysate of porbeagle shark blood and found the slope of the absorbance versus radius squared to be consistent with a homogenous solution of tetrameric hemoglobins, the Hb was assumed tetrameric, and a fixed value of q = 4 was imposed at all times. Non-linear least squares curve fitting was performed using the software package Mathematica® (Wolfram Research Inc., Cambridge, MA) employing the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Estimates of the standard errors of the fitted parameters were obtained from the diagonal elements of the curvature matrix associated with the fit (26Fago A. Bendixen E. Malte H. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15628-15635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To minimize the errors introduced by incomplete saturation or desaturation, when equilibrating with pure oxygen or nitrogen, respectively, the absorbance values at zero and full saturation were extrapolated from the data in the fitting procedure as described by Fago et al. (26Fago A. Bendixen E. Malte H. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15628-15635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). P 50, the oxygen tension at half-saturation of the Hb, was calculated as the PO2 value at log(S/(1–S)) = 0, and n 50 was calculated as ∂log(S/(1–S))/∂logPO2 at that PO2. The median oxygen tension P m was calculated from Pm=(1/KR)[(L+1)/(Lcq+1)](1/q)(Eq. 2) where c = K T/K R (28Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Haemoglobin.

Biol. 1995; 251: 703-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The free energy of heme-heme interaction ΔG was calculated according to Wyman et al. (30Wyman J. Gill S.J. Noll L. Giardina B. Colosimo A. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ΔG=RTln(L+1)(Lcq+1)(Lc+1)(Lcq-1+1)(Eq. 3) The difference in bond energies in the R and T states between the absence and presence of ATP was calculated as ΔG = RTln(K x,ATP/K x), where x denotes the T or R state. The heat of oxygenation was calculated according to the following relationship ΔH=2.303×R×ΔlogX/1T1-1T2(Eq. 4) where R is the gas constant, X is P 50, 1/L, 1/K T, or 1/K R, and T is the absolute temperature. ΔH app is ΔH at P 50 and includes the heat of release of effectors and solution of ligands and the heat of oxygen binding. Effects of Temperature and ATP—Extended Hill plots of the oxygen equilibria of Hbs III and V at pH 7.3 and at four temperatures (10, 16, 21, and 26 °C) each in the presence or absence of ATP are shown (Fig. 2). The MWC model was successfully fitted to the data. In all instances P 50 of the fitted curves was similar to P m, and the fitted curves were symmetrical around P 50. Both Hbs exhibit high intrinsic oxygen affinities (low P 50 values) (Table I) and small, normal temperature effects at half-saturation (ΔH = –40.1 and –20.7 kJ·mol–1 in Hbs III and V, respectively) at pH 7.3 (Table II). Increasing temperature from 10 to 26 °C increases P 50 from 0.9 to 2.2 torr (Hb III) and from 1.5 to 2.5 torr (Hb V) (Table I). The addition of ATP reduces the oxygen affinity in Hbs III and V, but less so at higher temperatures, resulting in a small reverse temperature effect in both Hbs (ΔH = 12.2 and 11.6 kJ·mol–1 in Hbs III and V, respectively) (Table II).Table IMWC and derived parameters for Hb V and IIIHb sampleTemperatureP50n50nmaxPmLog LS.E.aStandard error of the fitted parameters.Log KTS.E.aStandard error of the fitted parameters.Log KRS.E.aStandard error of the fitted parameters.ΔG°Ctorrtorrtorr-1torr-1kJ·(mol of heme)-1V101.501.931.941.442.660.219-0.6220.04170.5050.05611.42161.391.631.661.471.250.271-0.8140.3000.1500.06991.10211.461.281.281.500.7250.362-0.5700.1650.02110.07450.562262.541.221.262.680.3300.0994-1.0750.183-0.3040.02150.513V + ATP109.652.342.389.043.950.219-1.5140.02720.03130.07901.98168.522.522.538.393.330.271-1.650.0426-0.09070.06362.12217.812.302.307.663.000.362-1.520.0319-0.1340.05101.89267.442.142.157.702.180.0994-1.620.0710-0.3400.04481.76III100.8831.821.840.9231.650.148-0.6140.09390.4460.03761.30161.451.531.531.441.690.128-0.5160.02850.2630.03210.920211.941.481.492.021.100.0462-0.8090.0283-0.02250.01260.884262.161.161.192.270.0930.0791-1.050.188-0.2680.01350.384III + ATP109.892.362.399.333.840.299-1.540.0292-0.01060.07571.981610.92.332.3610.343.700.334-1.590.0266-0.09100.08681.98217.062.132.137.072.470.150-1.480.0327-0.2320.03951.69268.382.082.088.352.440.161-1.510.0249-0.3110.04341.65a Standard error of the fitted parameters.

A reverse temperature effect in the presence of ATP is seen. ATP additionally increases cooperativity expressed as n 50 (Fig. 3, lower panel), particularly at high temperature. As evident, Hb III and V show very similar oxygenation characteristics. Mechanisms of the Temperature Effect—The MWC parameters L, K R, and K T provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of temperature on the Hbs (Fig. 4 and Table I). At increasing temperature L decreases, indicating a destabilization of the T (tense) state relative to the R (relaxed) state (Fig. 4a). ATP stabilizes the T state (increases L) but only slightly affects the temperature sensitivity. Increasing temperature decreases oxygen affinity of the R and T states in Hb III and V, but more so in the R state (Fig. 4, b and c). ATP reduces the oxygen affinities of both the T and R states and their temperature sensitivities, making K T of both Hbs insensitive to temperature change, whereas K R is still somewhat reduced by increasing temperature. The effect of ATP on K R decreases with increasing temperatures, indicating that ATP also binds to the R state, particularly at low temperatures. The T state becomes less stable at high temperatures (L decreases), and the overall oxygen binding to the T state accordingly decreases. The reverse temperature effect in the presence of ATP thus stems from the combined effects of the reduction of L with increasing temperature and reduced temperature sensitivity of the T state and especially of the R state. These effects are reflected by the temperature invariance of the lower asymptotes of the extended Hill plots in Fig. 2 (constant K T values) and a change in the slope of the curve around log[S/(1–S)] = 0as L falls at higher temperatures. The change in K R is evident from the greater stability of the upper asymptotes of the curves in the presence of ATP than in its absence. Free Energies and Enthalpies of Reaction—In the absence of ATP the free energy of heme-heme interaction, ΔG, falls with increasing temperature (Table I). By stabilizing the T state, as evidenced by the temperature invariance of K T and the increase in L (Fig. 4), ATP increases the free energy of cooperativity but does so more at high than at low temperature, thus resulting in a low ATP sensitivity at high temperature. The change in ΔG mirrors the effect of temperature on L and n 50 and reflects the ATP-induced increased cooperativity. In both Hb III and V, ATP increases the apparent (overall) heat of oxygenation, ΔH app (ΔH at P 50), which becomes positive (Table II). This effect is consistent with the elevation of ΔH L, ΔH T, and ΔH R by ATP (Table II). The displacement of the lower asymptote of the Hill plots in the presence of ATP reflects the additional bond energies that stabilize the T state in the presence of the polyanionic phosphate anion (Fig. 2). The ATP-induced bond energy differences are greater in the T state than in the R state (4.8 –5.0 kJ·(mol of heme)–1 compared with 2.5–2.6 kJ·(mol of heme)–1 for both Hbs at 10 °C and pH 7.3; Table III). Additionally, the bond energy difference decreases with increasing temperature in both the T and R states. The difference in bond energy, ΔG T and ΔG R, with and without ATP is presented in Table III.Table IIIThe differences in bond energies of Hb III and V in the T or R state in the presence compared to the absence of ATPHbTemperatureΔGTΔGR°CkJ·(mol of heme)-1kJ·(mol of heme)-1V104.832.57164.631.33215.340.875263.150.210III105.042.48165.921.96213.761.18262.640.245 Open table in a new tab Effect of Changes in pH—Hill plots of oxygen equilibria of Hb III at 10 and 26 °C with and without ATP and at different pH values were fitted using the MWC model (Figs. 5 and 6). The pH sensitivities of P 50 and n 50 are shown in Fig. 7. At 10 °C Hb III shows a reverse Bohr effect between pH 8.3 and 7.5 (φ ∼ 0.5) that becomes normal at pH <7.5 (φ ∼ –0.6). At 26 °C the phosphate-free Hb show no Bohr effect in the experimental range of pH values. In the presence of ATP the Bohr effect becomes normal at both temperatures. Noticeably, the reverse temperature dependence with ATP present is marked at low pH and phases out at high pH (Fig. 7). The Bohr effect at pH ∼7.0 –7.3 in the presence of ATP is larger at 10 °C (φ ∼ –0.76) than at 26 °C (φ ∼ –0.3).Fig. 6Hill plots for oxygen equilibrium of Hb III with ATP (ATP/Hb >30) at different pH values. a, at 10 °C. b, at 26 °C.

At 10 °C without ATP L decreases from >104 at pH 8.0 to ∼102 at a pH of 7.6, indicating a destabilization of the T state at low pH. The reverse Bohr effect at 10 °C in the absence of ATP described previously concurs with the large fall in L as pH is lowered, whereas K T and K R remain unchanged (Fig. 8). With ATP present this effect is shifted to a lower pH (6.7); the pH effect becomes normal, K T decreases, and K R drops drastically as pH falls below 7.5. At 26 °C the effect of pH on L, K T, and K R is negligible in the absence of ATP. At 26 °C ATP elevates L by stabilizing the T state, in part because of a stabilizing effect of additional proton binding to the T state, its effect being larger at low pH. Concurrently, K T becomes lower and slightly decreases at lower pH values, and K R remains low and stable irrespective of the presence ATP (Fig. 8). Free Energies of Reaction—The free energy of heme-heme interaction (ΔG) is slightly higher at 10 °C than at 26 °C over the entire pH range and in the presence of ATP than in stripped Hb (Table IV). In the absence of ATP, ΔG varies only slightly with pH. With ATP ΔG decreases at low pH (<7.5 at 10 °C) and increases at high pH (>7.0 at 26 °C) (Table IV).Table IVThe free energy of heme-heme interaction for Hb III and V at different pH values, at 10 and 26 °C, and in the presence and absence of ATPTemperatureNo ATPATPpHΔGpHΔG°CkJ·(mol of heme)-1kJ·(mol of heme)-1106.7981.496.6991.497.0460.707.0191.247.3091.307.3131.987.6451.307.6562.377.9101.388.1412.58.3021.858.2822.68.6401.938.4702.05266.5630.776.4522.196.7170.476.6892.087.0550.376.9841.817.3050.387.2911.657.6100.487.5931.537.9190.697.9861.608.2080.848.2341.558.3520.79 Open table in a new tab The MWC model, which assumes functional homogeneity between the subunits comprising the tetrameric Hb, successfully describes the oxygen binding characteristics of porbeagle shark Hb. This indicates either that the chain heterogeneity found in porbeagle shark hemolysate (23Andersen M.E. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Carey F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 331-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is not found in the purified Hb components investigated in this study or that it does not influence oxygen binding. The reverse temperature effect on isolated Hb III and V from porbeagle shark resembles that in bluefin tuna Hb I in phosphate buffer (21Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Hbs from both species low temperature stabilizes the T state, and a reverse temperature effect on K R is seen at low pH. The difference between the two species is qualitative. In the bluefin tuna the stabilization of the T state at low temperature (high L) abolishes the T → R transition. Therefore, oxygen binds in the T state even at high oxygen saturation levels, revealing the presence of two functionally distinct subunits in the T state (21Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In porbeagle shark the T → R transition does occur, and we find no evidence for differences in the two subunits comprising the Hb. Our results thus agree with those of Andersen and co-workers (23Andersen M.E. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Carey F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 331-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found a reverse temperature effect in hemolysate in the 5–15 °C range and a decrease in L with rising temperature. Thus it appears that the evolutionary convergence of endothermic tunas and lamnid sharks includes changes in the functional mechanisms of their main Hb components. In porbeagle shark Hb the reverse temperature effect is only seen at pH values below 7.5 and in the presence of ATP (Fig. 7). We find that the reverse temperature effect is caused largely by an increase in the allosteric constant, L, with decreasing temperature (Fig. 4). Although acting in the opposite direction, the concurrent increase in K R at pH 7.3 in the presence of ATP is insufficient to counteract the effect of L. At lower pH values the temperature effect on K R becomes reversed, and this magnifies the overall reverse temperature effect. The effect of ATP on K R is most prominent at low pH, where it increases the magnitude of the reverse temperature effect, and more or less vanishes at pH values ≥7.7 (Fig. 8). The lack of an effect of ATP at 26 °C indicates that no ATP is allosterically bound to the oxyhemoglobin at this temperature. The bond energy per salt bridge is 4–8 kJ·mol–1 (31Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar), which suggests that an additional salt bridge per heme group constrains the T state when ATP is present (Table III). The small changes in the differential bond energy in the R state further indicate the preferential binding of ATP to the T state relative to the R state, although additional weaker bonds may be implicated, particularly at high temperature, where the difference bond energy is below 4 kJ·mol–1. At pH 7.3 (which likely falls in the physiological intraerythrocytic range) the overall ΔH app is negative (oxygenation is exothermic) in the absence of ATP but becomes positive (oxygenation is endothermic) with ATP (Table II). The increase is due to the positive heat of ATP and proton release from the Hb during the T → R transition. The fact that ΔH T is much less negative (or positive) than ΔH R is due to a greater ATP and proton release in the T state. Thus the addition of ATP obliterates the temperature effect in the T state, whereas it persists in the R state at high pH and is reversed at pH below 7.3 (Figs. 2, 4, and 7 and Table I). In bluefin tuna the temperature effect is normal in the T state (ΔH 1 is –8.0 kJ·mol–1, and ΔH 2 is –11.0 kJ·mol–1) and reversed in the R state (ΔH 3 and ΔH 4 are 10.4 and 21.3 kJ·mol–1, respectively) at pH 7.0 (21Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, in trout Hb I, the effect of temperature on CO binding shows opposite dependence on ligand saturation; ΔH T is 6 kJ·mol–1, and ΔH R is –11.3 kJ·mol–1 (21Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Wyman J. Gill S.J. Noll L. Giardina B. Colosimo A. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In tench (Tinca tinca) the addition of ATP increases ΔH T (–55.8 to –30.9 kJ·mol–1) and slightly decreases ΔH R (–60.5 to –68.0 kJ·mol–1) at pH 7.35, indicating that the proton release occurs gradually and that ATP does not bind to the R state (32Jensen F.B. Weber R.E. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1987; 157: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our results illustrate the complex relationship between pH and ΔH app (Fig. 7). In the presence of ATP at pH values below 7.7, ΔH app becomes increasingly positive with falling pH because of an increasing ΔH L that eventually becomes positive at pH <6.7 and an increasing ΔH R that becomes positive at pH <7.1 (Fig. 8, a and c). In spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), the ΔH app of stripped Hb also is pH-dependent with a value of –35 kJ·mol–1 at pH 7.0 and –44 kJ·mol–1at pH 7.9 (33Weber R.E. Wells R.M.G. Rossetti J.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 103: 109-120PubMed Google Scholar). The free energies of cooperativity, ΔG, at 10 and 26 °C with ATP (Hb III) are comparable to those found in tench (6.1 kJ·(mol of Hb)–1) (34Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Human Hb has a higher ΔG at 25 °C (8.8 kJ·(mol of Hb)–1 at pH 7.4), close to values found at 10 °C with ATP at high pH (Hb III, Table IV) and at 16 °C with ATP (Hb V, Table I) (35Imai K. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 798-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The Bohr effect in porbeagle shark Hb at 10 °C with ATP (φ ∼ –0.76) is large and similar to values for other active fishes. Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) and striped marlin have Bohr factors of –1.2 and –1.0, respectively (36Cech J.J. Laurs R.M. Graham J.B. J. Exp. Biol. 1984; 109: 21-34Google Scholar, 37Dobson G.P. Wood S.C. Daxboeck C. Perry S.F. Physiol. Zool. 1986; 59: 150-156Crossref Google Scholar), whereas those obtained from the moderately active blue shark (Prionace glauca) stripped hemoglobin with and without added inositol hexaphosphate are –1 and –0.4, respectively (38Pennelly R.P. Noble R.W. Riggs A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1975; 52B: 83-87Google Scholar). It is notable that the reverse Bohr effect at low temperature and in the absence of ATP extends to high pH values (7.5–8.3). The reverse Bohr effect is seen in other fish Hbs but is usually restricted to cathodic Hbs (for review, see Ref. 39Fago A. Carratore V. di Prisco G. Feuerlein R.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18897-18902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), where it also disappears when ATP is present. This suggests that upon oxygenation alkaline Bohr groups change pK value in the reverse direction from normal. Possible Implications for Oxygen Transport—Allosteric cofactors such as organic phosphates and protons lower the intrinsically high oxygen affinity of Hb to values that ensure oxygen unloading at oxygen tensions that are sufficiently high for physiological needs. Compared with small Bohr effects reported in sluggish elasmobranch species (40Wells R.M.G. Weber R.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 103: 95-108PubMed Google Scholar), active ones, like the porbeagle and mako sharks, have substantial Bohr effects at low temperature and in the presence of ATP (23Andersen M.E. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Carey F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 331-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH insensitivity on K R has been interpreted as advantageous under changing environmental oxygen tensions (34Weber R.E. Jensen F.B. Cox R.P. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1987; 157: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By maintaining a constant high affinity for oxygen in the R state, loading is protected during hypoxia and during exercise when the blood may become acidotic. In porbeagle shark K R falls at low temperature when pH is low, an effect not present at high temperature when environmental, dissolved oxygen concentration can be assumed to be lower and loading may become compromised. The concentration of ATP and other organic phosphates in nucleated fish red cells decreases under conditions of decreased oxygen availability, forming a regulatory mechanism that favors oxygen loading through the resulting increase in oxygen affinity. During exercise the affinity gain may, however, be offset by the decreased blood pH (Bohr effect). In elasmobranchs the presence of high urea levels may hinder oxygen affinity modulation by dampening the ATP effect as seen in stripped hemolysate of spiny dogfish (33Weber R.E. Wells R.M.G. Rossetti J.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1983; 103: 109-120PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of countercurrent heat exchangers in the porbeagle shark imposes a risk of oxygen loss from the arterial to the venous blood. However, as in the endothermic bluefin tuna, the presence of a reverse temperature effect in isolated Hb indicates that this risk is reduced. The increased oxygen affinity with rising temperature reduces the oxygen tension gradient between the arterial and venous blood. This adaptation to an efficient heat conservation mediated by heat exchangers may only be necessary in cases in which the heat exchangers are very efficient. As such the bluefin tuna and the porbeagle shark are the among the warmest species in their distantly related families, respectively, each representing very efficient countercurrent heat exchangers (6Carey F.G.

Lsc/p115-RhoGEF contains conserved DH and PH domains, an N-terminal RGS (regulator of G-protein signaling)-like domain, and a C-terminal predicted coiled-coil domain (see Fig. 1). Lsc/p115-RhoGEF is both an effector and a regulator of the heterotrimeric GTPase subunit Gα13. Gα13 activates Lsc/p115-RhoGEF exchange activity (11Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D.

This is of particular interest because it enables Lsc/p115-RhoGEF to couple ligand activation of G13-coupled receptors to Rho signaling pathways. Recently, targeted disruption of Lsc demonstrated that it is required for normal B and T lymphocyte function. Lsc–/– mice have reduced populations of splenic marginal zone B cells, enhanced marginal zone B cell chemotaxis, impaired proliferation of stimulated splenic B cells, and a reduced population of splenic T cells (13Girkontaite I.

Several ligands for G13-coupled receptors activate Rho and are known to affect lymphocyte function, including sphingosine 1-phosphate (14Sugimoto N. Takuwa N. Okamoto H. Sakurada S. Takuwa Y. Mol.

However, it is not known which ligands activate Lsc/p115-RhoGEF or which effector pathways are activated by Lsc/p115-RhoGEF signaling in vivo. To define Lsc signaling pathways in vivo, we set out to identify proteins that interact with regulatory regions of Lsc. Previous work demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal 110 or 152 amino acids (aa) C-terminal to the PH domain of p115-RhoGEF confers a gain of function in vivo (10Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N.

Deletion of the C-terminal 146 aa of Lsc conferred a 2–3-fold gain of function, suggesting that this region, containing a predicted coiled-coil domain, negatively regulates Lsc in vivo. We isolated a larger C-terminal fragment of Lsc itself in a screen for proteins that interact with this regulatory C terminus. We subsequently demonstrated that Lsc homo-oligomerizes and is negatively regulated through domains in its C terminus and that Lsc activity can be regulated by generating functionally distinct isoforms lacking these domains.

Cotransformants were grown on synthetic dropout medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and supplemented with 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Candidate clones were identified by selecting for activation of the HIS3 reporter gene and screening for activation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. HIS3 reporter gene expression was selected for by retrieving colonies ≥3 mm in diameter after 8 days of incubation at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase reporter activity was screened for by immersing a filter lift of cotransformed colonies in liquid nitrogen for 15 s and then exposing it to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) for 8 h at 30 °C. Blue colonies were scored positive for β-galactosidase activity. A total of 2.5 × 105 colonies were evaluated for expression of the HIS3 reporter gene; 20 of these had robust growth (≥3 mm in diameter), and three of these demonstrated β-galactosidase reporter activation. An additional four cotransformants were <3 mm in diameter, but had particularly strong β-galactosidase reporter activity. The two groups were combined, and a total of seven cotransformants were selected for further workup. The library plasmid from each clone was isolated as described (23ClontechYeast Protocols Handbook, PT3024-1. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar), and the library insert was sequenced. Colony Filter Lift β-Galactosidase Assay—Single yeast colonies were streaked in a patch (10 × 15 mm) on synthetic dropout medium lacking tryptophan and leucine and incubated for 72 h at 30 °C. Filter lifts of the patches were processed as described for the yeast two-hybrid screen. Yeast Liquid Culture β-Galactosidase Assay—This assay was conducted as described (23ClontechYeast Protocols Handbook, PT3024-1. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar) with the modifications noted below. Three independent colonies of each cotransformed strain were grown separately to logarithmic phase in synthetic defined medium lacking tryptophan and leucine; the absorbance at 600 nm was measured; and the yeast cells in a 1.5-ml aliquot were pelleted by centrifugation. Each pellet was washed and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (60 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 40 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O). 100-μl aliquots of resuspended cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and then 750 μl of 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol in buffer A and 150 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in buffer A were added. When the supernatant turned pale yellow, 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 was added; the mixture was centrifuged; and the absorbance of the supernatant at 420 nm was recorded. β-Galactosidase units = 1000 × A 420/(t × V × A 600), where t is the time in minutes from the addition of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside to the addition of Na2CO3, V is 0.1× starting cell volume of 1.5 ml/resuspended cell volume of 0.10 ml, and A 600 is the value for each sample measured during logarithmic growth phase (23ClontechYeast Protocols Handbook, PT3024-1. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase units were normalized to the controls indicated in the figure legends. SRE-mediated Transcription Assay—The pSRE.L reporter plasmid has been described (21Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The pRL-TK plasmid contains the Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase cDNA downstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter. COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in Falcon Primaria 24-well plates (BD Biosciences), transfected in serum-free medium for 3 h, and incubated in medium with 0.5% BCS for 24 h; and then the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities of the cell lysate were measured using the dual luciferase assay reporter system (Promega) with a MicroLumat Plus LB96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The firefly luciferase activities of cells transfected with Lsc and each Lsc mutant are presented as the mean ± S.D. of four independent wells in each experiment, where the measured firefly luciferase activity of each well was adjusted for transfection efficiency by calculating the ratio of measured firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity and then normalized to the control transfected with only pRL-TK, pSRE.L, and βgal-pBJ.KS. The firefly luciferase activities of Lsc and Lsc mutants were compared using a one-way analysis of variance; and if a difference existed, post hoc pairwise comparisons were made using the Student-Newman-Keuls test (24Glantz S. Primer of Bi statistics. 2nd ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using standard methods (25Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar) with the modifications noted below. COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in Falcon Primaria 6-well plates (BD Biosciences), transiently transfected for 12–16 h, and then incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% BCS for an additional 24 h. Cell lysates were harvested with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience)/50 ml of lysis buffer) and gentle scraping and spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was measured (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad) and equalized by dilution in lysis buffer. Anti-FLAG antibody M2 was added to 400 μl of supernatant; the mixture was incubated on ice for 3 h; protein A-Sepharose beads (100 μl of a 50:50 slurry) were added; and the samples were rocked for 1 h and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The beads were pelleted; the supernatant was removed; and 2× Laemmli buffer with 10% dithiothreitol was added. The samples were boiled for 5 min, subjected to PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and blotted sequentially with murine anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Crude lysate was removed prior to the addition of the M2 immunoprecipitating antibody, processed similarly, and blotted with either the 12CA5 or M2 antibody. The immunoblots were developed with the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and images were collected with a Storm 860 imager (Amersham Biosciences). Amplification of Lsc Partial cDNAs from Spleen—Lsc partial cDNA clones were amplified by PCR from mouse spleen first-strand cDNA using primers DL1026 and DL2080 with an annealing temperature of 60 °C for 40 cycles on a RoboCycler Gradient 96 temperature cycler (Stratagene). The PCR reaction products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis; and amplicons smaller than the common isoform amplicon were isolated, subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and sequenced. The sequences of these clones were aligned with the cDNA sequence of the common isoform of Lsc (GenBank™/EBI accession number U58203) to identify partial cDNAs lacking exonic sequence found in the common isoform. These clones were aligned with the Lsc genomic DNA sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number AC073679) to predict the 5′- and 3′-splice junction sequences corresponding to the absent exonic sequence. Because >98% of introns utilize the consensus 5′-GT/3′-AG intronic splice site dinucleotide pair (26Burset M. Seledtsov I.A. Solovyev V.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4364-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we considered only clones with this dinucleotide pair for further analysis. C-terminal Residues Negatively Regulate Lsc in Vivo—Before conducting a screen to identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of Lsc, we wanted to determine whether Lsc is negatively regulated by residues C-terminal to the PH domain. Activated Rho induces SRE-mediated transcription (27Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 28Treisman R. Alberts A.S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We compared the ability of Lsc and a mutant form of Lsc lacking the C-terminal 146 aa (Fig. 1) to activate SRE-mediated transcription from a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pSRE.L) in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Deletion of the C-terminal 146 aa conferred a 2–3-fold increase in fi"
https://openalex.org/W2124289032,"Previous studies on the folding mechanism of Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) showed that the final rate determining folding step was from an intermediate that contained two fully folded domains with N-terminal segments of approximately 55 residues and interdomain segments of approximately 50 residues that were still solvent exposed and subject to proteolysis. The interdomain segment contains 3 Pro residues near its N terminus and 2 Pro residues near its C terminus. The 5 Pro residues were each mutated to both a Gly and Ala residue, and each mutant SHMT was purified and characterized with respect to kinetic properties, stability, secondary structure, and folding mechanism. The results showed that Pro214 and Pro218 near the N terminus of the interdomain segment are not critical for folding, stability, or activity. The P216A mutant also retained most of the characteristics of the native enzyme, but its folding rate was altered. However, the P216G mutant was severely compromised in folding into a catalytically competent enzyme. Mutation of both Pro258 and Pro264 had altered folding kinetics and resulted in enzymes that expressed little catalytic activity. The Phe257–Pro258 bond is cis in its configuration, and the P258A mutant SHMT showed reduced thermal stability. Pro216, Pro258, and Pro264 are conserved in all 53 known sequences of this enzyme. The results are discussed in terms of the role of each Pro residue in maintaining the structure and function of SHMT and a possible role in pyridoxal 5′-phosphate addition to the apo-enzyme.

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; eSHMT, E. coli SHMT; H4PteGlu, tetrahydropteroylglutamate or tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PyP, pyridoxyl 5′-phosphate; FRET, fluorescence energy transfer.1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; eSHMT, E. coli SHMT; H4PteGlu, tetrahydropteroylglutamate or tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PyP, pyridoxyl 5′-phosphate; FRET, fluorescence energy transfer. catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine with the one-carbon group being transferred to H4PteGlu as the 5,10-CH2 adduct (1Schirch L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 83-112PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is the major source of one-carbon groups in the cell that are required for thymidylate, purine, and methionine biosynthesis (2Schirch L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New, York1984: 399-432Google Scholar). SHMT is a member of the family of enzymes that contain tightly bound PLP as a cofactor. This family of enzymes is involved in many reactions in amino acid metabolism and in the biosynthesis of most neurotransmitters (3McCormick D.B. Meyers R.A. Encycolpedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine. Vol. 6. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1997: 244-252Google Scholar). When PLP is removed from these enzymes, they form the functionally inactive apo forms. Little is known about the in vivo mechanism of activation of the apo forms of B6 enzymes by PLP addition. Here we continue our study on understanding the mechanism of PLP addition and its relationship to the folding mechanism of eSHMT. How and when PLP is added to apo-eSHMT from Escherichia coli during its biosynthesis and folding has been previously addressed (4Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Folding studies show that two domains fold rapidly and form a dimer without the involvement of PLP. An N-terminal segment of approximately 55 residues and an interdomain segment of approximately 50 amino acids remain sensitive to protease digestion until the final rate determining step in the formation of native apo-eSHMT. This 50-amino acid segment between the two domains not only contains Lys229, which forms the internal aldimine bond with the 4′ aldehyde of PLP, but several other residues involved in PLP binding. PLP appears to bind only to the fully formed apo enzyme. Denaturation studies in urea show that release of PLP from the active site is one of the first events to occur in the unfolding process, which is in agreement with the addition of PLP during or after the final folding step. The final folding step is very temperature-sensitive, with a half-life of 40 min at 4 °C and approximately 1 min at 30 °C. The rate determining step exhibits an enthalpy of activation of 22 kcal mol–1 (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At the boundaries of this interdomain segment are 5 Pro residues: 3 at the N-terminal end and 2 at the C-terminal end. The enthalpy of activation of converting a trans X–Pro peptide bond to the cis configuration is also approximately 20 kcal mol–1 (7Schmid X.F. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. Freeman, New York1992: 203-218Google Scholar). We proposed that one or more of these Pro residues would be in the cis configuration (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since those folding studies were published, the three-dimensional structure of eSHMT has been determined, and 1 of the 5 Pro residues is in the cis configuration. In this study we report the effect of changing each of the 5 Pro residues that flank the interdomain stretch of 50 amino acids to both Ala and Gly and determine the effects of these mutations on catalytic activity, stability, and folding kinetics. We conclude that 2 of the Pro residues are not critical for the folding process but that the other 3 Pro residues are important in folding and maintaining catalytic activity. The Pro that is most critical is the one that is in the cis configuration. From the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, we discuss the role of the 3 critical Pro residues in maintaining a competent active site. We also discuss the possible role of this 50-residue interdomain segment in the mechanism of converting apo-eSHMT into holo-eSHMT. Materials—All coenzymes, buffers, amino acids, column chromatography supports, reagents for bacterial growth, and ultra pure urea were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase was purified from an E. coli clone as previously described (8Schirch V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers for making mutant forms of eSHMT were obtained from Invitrogen. Mutant forms of eSHMT were made with the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). All of the restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The plasmid purification kit was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The selection primer of the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit contained a mutation in the plasmid that converts a BglII site into a AflIII site. The mutation primers contained both the desired mutation as well as a silent mutation that either destroyed or introduced a restriction site in the eSHMT gene. The mutations for Pro214, Pro216, and Pro218 were done in the W16F/W385F cDNA mutant of eSHMT, which contains only Trp183. The mutations for Pro258 and Pro264 were done in the W16F/W183F mutant cDNA of eSHMT, which contains only Trp385 (5Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mutant oligonucleotide sequences used to mutate each Pro to an Ala and Gly contained the changes as follows: Pro214, CCG to GCG/GGG (Ala/Gly); Pro216, CCG to GCG/GGG (Ala/Gly); Pro218, CCT to GCG/GGG (Ala/Gly); Pro258, CCT to GCT/GGT (Ala/Gly); and Pro264, CCG to GCA/GGA (Ala/Gly). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of both strands of the coding region for eSHMT. Purification of eSHMT Mutant Proteins—All mutant forms of eSHMT were expressed and purified as previously described for the wild-type enzyme (9Delle Fratte S. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Bossa F. Schirch V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 225: 395-401Google Scholar, 10Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Iurescia S. Condo I. Angelaccio S. Delle Fratte S. Bossa F. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In general, 6 liters of cells were grown in LB-ampicillin medium overnight and disrupted after harvesting in an Avestin Cell Disrupter (Ottawa, Canada). Each enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE Sephadex, phenyl-Sepharose, and hydroxylapetite chromatography. For some of the mutants a final purification was performed on a fast protein liquid chromatography MonoQ column (1.5 × 6 cm) with a 30-min linear gradient from 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, to 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 400 mm NaCl. Each mutant protein was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE patterns. P216G gave a very poor yield, and purity was only achieved after extensive purification on a sizing column and fast protein liquid chromatography. For this mutant we were able to only get approximately 2 mg of pure enzyme as compared with approximately 80 mg for all of the other Pro mutants. Each mutant eSHMT contained tightly bound PLP. This was removed to prepare the apo enzymes by chromatography on a 0.7 × 4-cm phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 35% ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and containing 100 mm l-cysteine. Under these high salt conditions the enzyme binds to the phenyl-Sepharose. The bound PLP reacts with l-cysteine to form a thiazolidine complex, which has reduced affinity for the enzyme and dissociates to leave column bound apo-eSHMT. After removing all of the PLP with the equilibration buffer, apo-eSHMT is eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Kinetic, Spectral, and Thermal Properties of Mutant Enzymes—K m and k cat values were determined for the conversion of serine and H4PteGlu to glycine and 5,10-CH2 H4PteGlu by coupling the NADP dependent oxidation of the product CH2-H4PteGlu to CH+-H4PteGlu and NADPH using methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (10Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus serine concentration was used to determine K m and k cat values with saturating levels of H4PteGlu (0.2 mm) used as the cosubstrate. The K d for H4PteGlu was determined by a spectrophotometric method involving the formation of an abortive complex with glycine that absorbs uniquely at 495 nm (10Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saturating levels of glycine (50 mm) were used, and the absorbance at 492 nm of the SHMT·Gly·H4PteGlu abortive complex was determined as a function of increasing concentrations of H4PteGlu. Spectra of each mutant eSHMT were obtained with a HP 8450A spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism spectra from 260 to 184 nm were obtained with an OLIS recording CD spectrophotometer using an absorbance value of 0.22 at 278 nm for each enzyme in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, in a 1-mm-pathlength cell. Thermal transition values were obtained in a Nano II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences, Corp., Salt Lake City, UT) at approximately 2 mg/ml concentration in the same buffer. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained with an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (Rochester, NY) with a scan time of 5 nm/s at room temperature. Equilibrium Unfolding of Mutant apo-eSHMTs—A concentrated solution of each apo-eSHMT was added to a series of urea solutions, in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, ranging in concentration from 0.2 to 8.0 m as previously described (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The final apo-eSHMT concentration was 0.15 mg/ml. The solutions were allowed to come to equilibrium by incubating for at least 2 h at 30 °C or overnight at 4 °C. The fluorescence spectrum of each mutant protein was taken with excitation at 290 nm and emission at 300–410 nm. This procedure was repeated but starting with unfolded apo-eSHMT in Tris-buffered 8 m urea. Determination of Refolding Rate Constants—Each mutant holo-eSHMT was reduced with NaCNBH3 as previously described (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PLP aldimine bond of the holo enzyme is reduced by this procedure to a stable secondary amine of PyP and is referred to as eSHMT·PyP. Reduction occurs with a spectral shift from 422 nm to 335 nm. The reduced mutant enzymes were unfolded in 8 m urea containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml of protein. Refolding was initiated by a 10-fold dilution of this solution at 30 °C in refolding buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The rate of refolding was followed by fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between the excitation of a single Trp residue (the energy donor) at 290 nm and the fluorescence of the covalently attached PyP moiety (energy acceptor) at 384 nm (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The rate constants and amplitudes for the appearance of fluorescence at 384 nm were determined by curve fitting routines in Sigma Plot. Expression, Purification, and Activity of Pro Mutants of eSHMT—As reported previously the 3 Trp residues Trp16, Trp183, and Trp385 in eSHMT can be replaced with Phe residues without significant alterations in the catalytic and stability properties of the enzyme (5Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the time when this work was published a three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme was not available. From studies using FRET measurements of site mutants, proteolytic digestion studies during folding and fluorescence quenching of Trp residues, we proposed a detailed mechanism for the folding of eSHMT (5Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A model of the final folding intermediate involved in the rate determining conversion to apo-eSHMT is shown in Fig. 1. Proteolytic digestion studies during folding showed that the active site Lys229, which forms the aldimine with PLP, is present on a sequence of approximately 50 amino acids between two rapidly folding domains that were protease resistant (Fig. 1, Domains 1 and 2). In addition to this interdomain segment, the N-terminal 55 amino acid residues were also susceptible to protease digestion, suggesting that this region of the protein was also not in its native state. The protease-resistant domain 1 stretches from Tyr55 to Thr224, and domain 2 stretches from Leu276 to the C-terminal Ala417. The rate determining step in forming the fully protease-resistant enzyme was the “folding in” of the N-terminal 55 amino acids and the interdomain segment, which occur at the same rate. We noted that the boundaries of the interdomain segment are populated by 5 Pro residues (Fig. 1). Pro residues 214, 216, and 218 are near the C terminus of domain 1, and Pro residues 258 and 264 are in the interdomain segment near the N terminus of domain 2. To probe the function of these Pro residues on the folding mechanism of eSHMT, each was changed to an Ala and Gly residue. The mutations for Pro214, Pro216, and Pro218 were done in the protein containing only the Trp at position 183, which is referred to as W183 eSHMT. The mutations of Pro258 and Pro264 were done in the construct containing only Trp385, which is referred to as W385 eSHMT. Having only one Trp residue permits an examination of the effect of these Pro residues on the folding of the domain with which they are most closely associated without interference of the fluorescence properties of the other two Trp residues. Each mutant enzyme was tested for catalytic activity and affinity for serine and H4PteGlu (Table I). Only P216G, P258A, P258G, P264A, and P264G exhibited greatly reduced catalytic activity. With P258A and P258G the activity is so low that affinity for serine and H4PteGlu could not be determined. However, with P258A the addition of serine caused a spectral shift of the bound PLP from 406 to 416 nm. This spectral shift permitted the determination of a K d for l-serine of 8.0 mm. The K d value of 8 mm is 25-fold higher than the K m value for l-serine with the wild-type enzyme. The other Pro mutants exhibited K m values for serine that are not significantly different from wild-type eSHMT. Only P216G showed a significant change in the affinity for H4PteGlu, which is 5.5-fold higher than wild-type eSHMT.Table IComparison of kinetic and folding properties of pro mutants of eSHMTeSHMTKm (Ser)Km (H4PteGlu)kcatk fold 1aRate constant for the appearance of fluorescence emission at 384 nm caused by fluorescence energy transfer.k fold 2mmμ mmin-1s-1s-1Wild type0.30153000.011 (100)bThe percentage of the signal amplitude that is associated with the given rate constant.P214A0.14202000.104 (10)0.0082 (90)P214G0.24202000.042 (29)0.0065 (71)P216A0.25202000.028 (66)0.0032 (34)P216G0.588536No FRET signalP218A0.13192700.056 (52)0.0065 (48)P218G0.13172000.059 (38)0.0074 (62)P258A8.0<0.5No FRET signalP258G<0.5No FRET signalP264A0.3317980.016 (41)0.0036 (59)P264G1.3370.059 (10)cThe total signal amplitude for P264G is only 15% of the total amplitude for P264A.0.0051 (90)a Rate constant for the appearance of fluorescence emission at 384 nm caused by fluorescence energy transfer.b The percentage of the signal amplitude that is associated with the given rate constant.c The total signal amplitude for P264G is only 15% of the total amplitude for P264A. Open table in a new tab Spectral Properties—With the exception of P258A and P258G, the spectral properties of each mutant eSHMT exhibits absorbance maxima at 418 and 322 nm. The wild-type enzyme shows a single absorbance maxima at 422 nm. The 322-nm peak was approximately 30–50% of the height of the 418-nm peak and varied with the mutant and the age of the enzyme preparation. This suggests that some of the bound PLP is not in its catalytically active form. This probably accounts for many of the k cat values being only approximately 200 instead of 300 under our assay conditions. The importance of these spectral difference will be addressed under “Discussion.” Each mutant protein was analyzed for secondary structure using circular dichroism spectroscopy. There was no significant difference in circular dichroic spectra between the mutant and the wild-type enzymes. Also, we had previously shown by circular dichroism that apparently complete secondary structure forms in less than a minute at 4 °C, but the final folding step takes up to 15 h to complete at this temperature (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We checked the circular dichroic spectrum of wild-type enzyme at 4 °C during the first 10 min after refolding had been initiated by dilution of an 8 m urea unfolded solution. The sample was then warmed to 30 °C, at which folding is completed in a few minutes. A second scan at this temperature showed no significant difference from the original spectrum taken at 4 °C. We conclude that the secondary structural elements are essentially complete after a few minutes at 4 °C when the enzyme is represented as the structure shown in Fig. 1. Stability of Pro Mutants—The ability of each mutant to undergo a reversible unfolding-folding cycle in increasing concentrations of urea was determined (5Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2987-2994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A plot of fluorescence emission at 330 nm versus urea concentration showed a sigmoidal decrease in fluorescence with increasing concentration of urea characteristic of a two-state folding curve. However, because each mutant enzyme contained only Trp183 or Trp385, this method follows only the degree of folding of either domain 1 or domain 2. The midpoint of the curve for W183 eSHMT is 2.5 m urea. Mutants P214A, P214G, and P218 A also had midpoints at 2.5 m urea. Mutants P216A and P216G exhibited midpoints at 2.0–2.2 m urea, showing that domain 1 in these mutants is slightly less stable. The urea midpoint of W385 eSHMT is 3.0 m urea (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The midpoint for P258A and P258G were also at 3.0 m urea, but for P264A and P264G the midpoint was at 2.5 m. These results suggest that the mutation of the 5 proline residues has only marginal effects on stability of domains 1 and 2 as determined by unfolding in urea. The thermal stability of each alanine mutant protein was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The thermal denaturation of eSHMT is irreversible. An apparent T m (T m, app) was determined from the peak in the thermogram for each Pro mutant in the absence and presence of 30 mm l-serine (Table II). Each Pro mutant showed similar heat stability (T m, app = 63–67 °C) and stabilization of approximately 5 °C upon the addition of serine. The exception is the P258A mutant, which exhibits a double thermal transition that is considerably lower than wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2). For this mutant there is no increase in thermal stability upon binding serine, even though spectral studies showed that serine binds to the active site with a K d of 8 mm (Table I). Most of the denaturation traces exhibited nonsymmetrical curves. This has been shown before to result from different domains in the enzyme unfolding at different temperatures and is consistent with the urea denaturation curves showing that domain 2 is slightly more stable than domain 1 (12Schirch V. Shostak K. Zamora M. Gautam-Basak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 759-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo-W183 eSHMT denatures approximately 3–4 degrees lower than holo-W183, suggesting that PLP binding does not greatly increase thermal stability in eSHMT (Table II).Table IIThermal stability of SHMT Pro mutants as determined by differential scanning calorimetrySHMTTm, appT m appaThis represents the highest molar heat capacity value and is not exactly equal to a defined T m value because the denaturation process involves irreversible aggregation.

Open table in a new tab Kinetics of Refolding—The refolding rate was determined by using FRET, which occurs during the final rate determining step in folding when the interdomain segment and the N-terminal 55 residues collapse into the native structure. The fluorescence traces for P214A and P216A eSHMT are shown in Fig. 3. We had previously shown that this final step in folding follows a first order reaction (6Cai K. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27311-27320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In these studies of Pro mutants, the traces are best fit by two parallel first order reactions. The two first order rate constants and their relative associated amplitudes (shown in parentheses) are recorded in Table I. The slower of the two rate constants is in the 0.008 s–1 range. These values are close to the values observed for wild-type eSHMT under these same conditions. The faster rate is not observed with wild-type eSHMT. Note that in the refolding of P214A, 90% of the amplitude follows a first order refolding path. With P216A 66% folds by the faster rate, and the 34% folding at the slower rate occurs approximately 2-fold slower than P214A. P216G, P258A, and P258G give no FRET signal, suggesting that in the final structure the PyP group is more than 40 Å distant from the Trp residue associated with its closest domain. Three-dimensional Structure of eSHMT— Fig. 4 shows the location of each of the 5 Pro residues, with respect to the active site PLP (shown in green). Pro214, Pro216, and Pro218 are part of a structural motif from Ala210 through His221 that forms a long loop between a β strand (Val222–Thr226) and an α helix (Ala205–Ala209). Although the loop is exposed to the solvent, the β strand and the α helix are buried and form a part of the catalytic site. Some of the residues from the β strand and α helix and others immediately preceding or following these secondary structures are known to play significant roles in PLP binding and catalytic activity. These include Asp200, His203, His228, and Lys229 (13Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pro216 is located in the middle of the loop, and whereas the side chains for Pro214 and Pro218 face the bulk solvent, that of Pro216 faces the interior of the protein and forms part of a hydrophobic patch The Pro258–Pro264 motif is also a loop, with the two Pro residues located at the ends of the loop and initiating and terminating two α-helices (Glu246–Phe257 and Leu265–Glu278, respectively). The loop region and part of the α-helices form a significant part of the catalytic site. The amide nitrogen of Gly263 makes a short hydrogen bond interaction with the phosphate of the PLP in the other monomer. The Pro258-Glu259-Gly260-Gln261-Gly262-Gly263-Pro264 motif is located at the interface of the two subunits and is involved in many direct hydrogen bond interactions across the subunit interface, including Asn134ND2 to Pro258O, Asn134ND2 to Gly259O, Phe135N to Gly259O, Gln100NE2 to Gly260O, and Ser99OG to Gly262N. There are a number of significant water-mediated interactions involving the loop region and residues from the other subunit and with PLP (Fig. 5). Pro Residues and Folding—The role of Pro residues in protein folding has been widely discussed and studied (14Eyles S.J. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14637-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Pro residues often act to slow down the folding process creating intermediates on the folding pathway. Of particular interest is the role of cis Pro residues that often cap α-helices or are involved in β turns. The reversible cis-trans interconversion of X–Pro peptide bonds exhibits a large enthalpy of activation of approximately 20 kcal mol–1 (15Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14637-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In the unfolded state the equilibrium favors the more stable trans form by a 3 or 4 to 1 ratio. Most Pro residues in proteins are trans, but approximately 6% are cis (16Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In small proteins and some larger ones Pro isomerization can be the rate determining step in folding and because Pro residues exist as a mixture of isomers in the unfolded state leads to multiple parall"

Antigen-specific activation of T lymphocytes occurs through the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR). 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; scTCR, single chain TCR; CDR, complementarity-determining region; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; MBP, myelin basic protein; RTL, recombinant TCR ligand; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Gp-BP, guinea pig basic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin. In order to initiate an immune response, antigenic peptides must be presented in the context of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In addition, co-receptors on the antigen-presenting cells must bind accessory molecules of the T cell in order for activation to occur. The TCR is a heterodimer consisting of α and β subunits containing variable and constant domains that are structurally similar to immunoglobulin molecules.

TCR recognition of specific MHC-peptide complexes occurs through the binding of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) within the variable (V) regions of the α and β chains. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure suggests that, in general, the CDR1 and CDR2 regions contact the α-helices of the MHC molecule, whereas CDR3 regions contact the peptide (3Garcia K.C.

The immunoreactive properties of the TCR molecule as an antigen have been of long standing interest but remain poorly understood. The most compelling evidence that the TCR itself can elicit immune responsiveness has been demonstrated in numerous studies, most notably in models of T cell-mediated autoimmunity. The protective effects of vaccination with attenuated, pathogenic T cells were first demonstrated in the model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and then extended to models of arthritis, thyroiditis, and diabetes (13Ben-Nun A. Wekerle H. Cohen I.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 60-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 14Lohse A.W. Cohen I.R. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1992; 14: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protection coincided with T cells expressing TCRs specific for the disease-inducing antigen. Subsequent studies showed that TCR protein (15Kumar V. Coulsell E. Ober B. Hubbard G. Sercarz E. Ward E.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5150-5156PubMed Google Scholar, 16Offner H. Adlard K. Bebo Jr., B.F.

The mechanism of action is unclear but may involve the induction of a regulatory T cell population. The observation of biased TCR gene expression in pathogenic T cell populations of certain mouse and rat models of EAE also led to the demonstration that antibodies to the TCR could successfully treat EAE (20Acha-Orbea H.

EAE is an autoimmune demyelinating disease with similar neuropathology to the human disease multiple sclerosis. EAE can be induced by a number of myelin component proteins and their derived peptides including myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (22Alvord Jr., E.C Alvord Jr., E.C.

In the Lewis rat model of EAE, active immunization with guinea pig basic protein (Gp-BP) resulted in the expansion and migration of MBP-reactive CD4+, MHC class II-restricted T cells into the central nervous system. These T cells were shown to be specific for an epitope corresponding to MBP residues 69–89 and demonstrated biased expression of Vβ8.2 and Vα2 TCR genes with the presence of specific motifs (24Buenafe A.C.

Importantly, these Vβ8.2 and Vα2 TCR genes were also present in T cell clones capable of transferring EAE to naive rats (27Burns F.R. Li X. Shen N. Offner H. Chou Y. Vandenbark A.A. Heber-Katz E. J.

We undertook the cloning and expression of a soluble single chain form of the C14 TCR (scTCR) so that we could investigate specific interactions at the combining site that culminate in pathogenesis. We also wished to use the C14 scTCR to investigate immunogenic properties of the scTCR itself. Unlike antibody molecules, the production of large amounts of soluble, nonaggregated TCR molecules has been difficult to achieve. The fact that the TCR exists mainly as a cell surface molecule in association with a number of other surface molecules probably contributes to the problem of poor solubility. A number of cloning strategies and in vitro refolding techniques have been reported to greatly improve the yield of soluble TCR, both as scTCR molecules (30Kurucz I. Jost C.R. George A.J. Andrew S.M.

Using an Escherichia coli expression system and a rapid dilution refolding method, we were able to produce 5–8 mg/l quantities of soluble C14 scTCR molecules. We report here the production, characterization, and antigenic properties of a two-domain scTCR derived from a pathogenic Lewis rat T cell clone. Homology-based Modeling of the C14 TCR—Structure-based homology modeling was based on the refined crystallographic coordinates of the murine D10 TCR engaged with a peptide-MHC class II complex (7Reinherz E.L. Tan D. Tang L. Kern P. Liu J. Xiong Y. Hussey R.E. Smolyar A. Hare B. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Chang H.C. Wagner G. Wang J. Science. 1999; 286: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Brookhaven National Laboratories, Upton, NY). Sequence alignment of the α and β chains from the C14 and D10 scTCRs provided a starting point for our studies. The program Sybyl (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) was used to generate graphic images using an O2 work station (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). Amino acid residues in the scTCR of D10 (Protein Data Bank accession number 1D9) were substituted with the rat C14 BV8S2 and AV2 TCR side chains, and the polypeptide backbone was modeled as a rigid body during structural refinement using local energy minimization. After 100 iterations of energy minimization, the total energy calculated for the C14 scTCR was 6568.5 kcal/mol. This compares favorably with a total energy of 1937 kcal/mol obtained after a parallel minimization of the D10 scTCR from a starting energy of 111,393 kcal/mol for the D10 crystal structure. Assembly of scTCR Genes—Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis for TCR gene usage (26Buenafe A.C. Tsu R.C. Bebo Jr., B. Bakke A.C. Vandenberk A.A. Offner H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5472-5483PubMed Google Scholar, 36Offner H. Buenafe A.C. Vainiene M. Celnik B. Weinberg A.D. Gold D.P. Hashim G.A. Vandenbark A.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 506-517PubMed Google Scholar) and sequencing analysis demonstrated that only a single Vα gene and a single Vβ gene were expressed in the A1 hybridoma, derived from the C14 encephalitogenic Lewis rat T cell clone specific for the BP-(69–89) peptide (29Chou Y.K. Vandenbark A.A. Jones R.E. Offner H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To construct the scTCR gene, primers containing appropriate restriction sites were designed to flank sequences encoding the V and J regions as follows: Vα primers, RVα2NcoI (5′-CGACCCATGGCTCAGCAGGTCAAACAAAGTCC) and RJαSmaI (5′-CGGACCCGGGCTTCACCACCAGTTGCG); Vβ primers, RVβ8Bam (5′-ATCAGGATCCGAAGCTGCAGTCACACAAAGC) and RJβSacI (5′-GATCGAGCTCAACCGTGAGCTTGGTGCCG). Vα- and Vβ-amplified genes were individually cloned into pCR2.1 using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the sequences were verified. The purified plasmids were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and the inserts were gel-purified on glass beads (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA) and then ligated into NcoI- and XhoI-digested pET21d (Novagen, Madison, WI) together with a linker region. The double-stranded linker regions, DAK (GSADDAKKDAAKKGS) (33Gregoire C. Malissen B. Mazza G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or G4S (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS) (7Reinherz E.L. Tan D. Tang L. Kern P. Liu J. Xiong Y. Hussey R.E. Smolyar A. Hare B. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Chang H.C. Wagner G. Wang J. Science. 1999; 286: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), encoded 15-amino acid residue spacers and were flanked by corresponding restriction sites (SmaI and BamHI) that connected the Vα and Vβ segments. Constructs were transformed into AD494-competent cells (Novagen). Colonies were screened by SDS-PAGE for the production of an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-inducible protein band of ∼28 kDa. scTCR Expression and Purification—A 4-ml overnight culture of the C14 scTCR was grown in Luria broth containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (15 μg/ml). The overnight culture was diluted into 1 liter of the same medium and grown to midlogarithmic phase (A 600 = 0.6) at 37 °C, and protein production was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3–4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g, resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), sonicated on ice, and repelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 min. After sonicating and washing two more times, the pellet was resuspended in binding buffer that contained 6 m urea and stirred for 72 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatants from 4 liters of bacterial culture were filtered (0.22 μm) and loaded onto a nickel-agarose column (HiTrap chelating column; Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer followed by 10 volumes of wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The protein was eluted with 6 volumes of binding buffer containing 500 mm imidizole and then dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, containing 6 m urea and 0.5 mm EDTA. The protein was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C with stirring and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75pg column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 m urea, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The column was loaded with 1–2 ml of dialyzed, dithiothreitol-treated protein and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Refolding of scTCR—scTCR protein was refolded using a rapid dilution protocol similar to that of Pecorari et al. (34Pecorari F. Tissot A.C. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, elutes containing the column-purified protein peak were combined and added to refolding buffer (1 m l-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm reduced glutathione, 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at a concentration of ≤60 μg/ml and stirred at 4 °C for 48 h. scTCR was dialyzed three times against 10 liters of PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and concentrated in Amicon 8400 and 8050 chambers using YM10 ultrafiltration membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). scTCR protein was further concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml using Centriprep 10 concentrators (Millipore) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min followed by 0.22-μm filtration. All refolded protein was stored at –80 °C. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Purified scTCR protein was resolved using SDS-PAGE in 15% acrylamide under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. The gel was either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western analysis. For Western blots, nonspecific protein was blocked by incubating for 1 h with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline. The membrane was incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the rat Vβ8.2 T cell receptor (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection was performed using Western Blue substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). Alternatively, the membrane was incubated with monoclonal antibody supernatants (1:500 dilution) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and detection was performed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (BioFX Labs, Owings Mills, MD). Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 75 (10/30) column attached to an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated using a low molecular weight gel filtration kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by 2 volumes of PBS, pH 7.4. scTCR protein in PBS, pH 7.4, was injected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and eluted using the same buffer. Surface Plasmon Resonance—OX-6 mAb specific for the rat MHC class II RT1.B molecule was coupled to a CM5 biosensor chip by standard amine coupling in 10 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, with a resulting final resonance of ∼10,000 resonance units. Rat RTL201, consisting of the α1 and β1 domains of RT1.B with MBP-(69–89) peptide covalently attached (37Burrows G.G. Chang J.W. Bachinger H-P. Bourdette D.N. Offner H. Vandenbark A.A.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 6366-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was immobilized on the chip by the OX-6 mAb at an Rmax of 100–400 resonance units for binding experiments. Kinetic measurements were performed on a Biacore 3000 in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min to minimize the effects of mass transfer limitation. scTCR proteins were injected in a series of concentrations with regeneration (10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.0) of the OX-6-coated chip and immobilization of fresh RTL201 before each injection of scTCR. Binding of scTCR to a control flow cell with OX-6 alone was subtracted for each concentration. Fitting of kinetic data to a 1:1 binding model with baseline drift was performed using Biaevaluation 3.0 software. Mice—BALB/c and B10.PL female mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) at 8–10 weeks of age. Mice were housed in the Animal Resource Facility at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center in accordance with institutional guidelines. Antibody Production—For production of serum and hybridoma antibodies, BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of scTCR protein emulsified with Complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) containing 100 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Difco). Two weeks later, mice were boosted intraperitoneally with 50 μg of scTCR in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. For the production of monoclonal Abs, mice were rested for 2 months after the boost and then injected intravenously with 10 μg of scTCR in saline. Three days after intravenous boost, spleens were obtained and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells as described (39Buenafe A.C. Rittenberg M.B. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After 10–14 days in HAT selection medium, supernatants were screened for scTCR-specific antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using 96-well polystyrene plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) coated with 10 μg/ml scTCR. Plates were blocked with PBS plus 1% BSA, incubated with supernatants, and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgM + IgA + IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Positive wells were detected by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. T Cell Lines—B10.Pl mice were immunized subcutaneously at four sites in the lower back with 100 μg of scTCR protein in CFA containing 100 μg of M. tuberculosis. Inguinal lymph nodes were obtained 10 days postimmunization, and a single cell suspension was prepared. Lymph node T cells (6 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with 25 μg/ml scTCR for 48 h in stimulation medium (RPMI containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% fetal calf serum) and then expanded in growth medium (RPMI containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal calf serum, 20 units/ml recombinant interleukin-2) for 5 days. scTCR-specific T cell lines were maintained by weekly stimulation with 2–10 μg/ml scTCR followed by expansion in growth medium. For proliferation assay, T cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in the presence of 4 × 105 irradiated antigen-presenting cells (thymocytes plus splenocytes)/well plus antigen for 72 h. [3H]Thymidine was added for the last 18 h of culture, after which the wells were harvested, and the amount of incorporated label was determined using a Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cloning and Modeling of the Recombinant C14 scTCR—A schematic diagram of the Vα2/Vβ8.2 scTCR construct is shown in Fig. 1A. Two different linkers, DAK (33Gregoire C. Malissen B. Mazza G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and G4S (7Reinherz E.L. Tan D. Tang L. Kern P. Liu J. Xiong Y. Hussey R.E. Smolyar A. Hare B. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Chang H.C. Wagner G. Wang J. Science. 1999; 286: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), were used to connect the Vα and Vβ chains in case the linker region should have an effect on refolding and solubility of the scTCR protein. A sequence encoding the C-terminal 6× histidine (His6) tag was present on the pCR2.1 vector and allowed for the purification of the recombinant scTCR proteins by nickel chelation chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the C14 Vα2 and Vβ8.2 genes used to encode the scTCR construct is shown in Fig. 1B. We took this opportunity to compare these sequences to the Vα2 and Vβ8.2 genes of the murine D10 TCR, since the crystal structure coordinates of the D10 scTCR (7Reinherz E.L. Tan D. Tang L. Kern P. Liu J. Xiong Y. Hussey R.E. Smolyar A. Hare B. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Chang H.C. Wagner G. Wang J. Science. 1999; 286: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) were available. The C14 and D10 Vα2 sequences were 75.5% homologous, and the Vβ8.2 sequences were 80.4% homologous at the amino acid level (including residues up to the C-terminal Cys). Homology increased to 83.3 and 84.5%, respectively, when the CDR loops were excluded. Coordinates of the D10 crystal structure were used to derive a molecular model (Fig. 1C) of the C14 TCR. The linkers and His6 tag are not shown due to the flexibility of their structure. The Vβ8.2 CDR3 loop in the C14 TCR is one residue shorter than that in the D10 TCR, although the C14 and D10 Vα2 CDR3 loops are the same length. Previous studies identified the presence of motifs in the Vβ8.2 CDR3 (Asp96-Ser97) (24Buenafe A.C. Vainiene M. Celnik B. Vandenbark A.A. Offner H. J.
