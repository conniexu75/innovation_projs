It is suggested that this is a metabolic product rather than the result of diet or intestinal bacterial decomposition although there seems to be no biochemical reason for its presence."
https://openalex.org/W2042101623,"Evidence is presented to show that modern mollusk shells from rivers can have anomalous radiocarbon ages, owing mainly to incorporation of inactive (carbon-14-deficient) carbon from humus, probably through the food web, as well as by the pathway of carbon dioxide from humus decay. The resultant effect, in addition to the variable contributions of atmospheric carbon dioxide, fermentative carbon dioxide from bottom muds, and, locally, of carbonate carbon from dissolving limestones, makes the initial carbon-14-activity of ancient fresh-water shell indeterminate, but within limits. Consequent errors of shell radiocarbon dates may be as large as several thousand years for river shells."
https://openalex.org/W2073111740,"An increase in the rate of mutation has been found in Drosophila melanogaster reared on a basic medium that was irradiated with a sterilizing dose (150,000 rads) of cobalt-60 gamma rays. In Muller-5 tests, sex-linked recessive lethals occurred only in the F(2) progenies of the male test flies obtained from breeding the parent flies on irradiated medium, while visible changes occurred in experimental cultures from both the control and irradiated media. The frequency of sex-linked recessive lethals was 0.35, 0.55, and 0.8 percent in three independent experiments. Visible changes were two to six times more frequent in the irradiated series than in the controls."

https://openalex.org/W1980003279,"Measurements were made of the natural C/sup 14/ activity of shells from living clams and snails collected from a variety of environments. Three samples were measured, representing growth in lime-poor, fairly soft, and lime-rich waters. The tracer study indicated that a snail can incorporate 10 to 12% inorganic C in making its shell and the remainder of the C in the shell carbonate must come from food or the atmosphere, and the resulting C/sup 14//C/sup 12/ ratio will be essentially the same as in those sources. The control laboratory snails ate modern food (lettuce), whereas the natural snails ate food with a C/ sup 14/ /C/sup 12/ ratio similar to their environment and so showed the greater deficiency in C/sup 14/. The limiting value of a system in contact with the atmosphere is 50% dead C, theoretically possible, but not yet measured anywhere. Even such a great deficiency in C /sup 14/ as this produces a constant error in the dating of unknown nonmarine carbonate samples of one C/sup 14/ half life (5568 or 5730 years). Of greater significance is the postdepositional alteration and replacement of the original shell composition, which can add or subtract material. Neither visual nor mineralogicmore » criteria can be used to predict the degree of this alteration. This can be determined only by mass spectrometric isotopic studies. (auth)« less"

https://openalex.org/W2001852558,"Nuclear explosions in Nevada in July 1962 caused an average intake of about 58,000 picocuries of I131 and a peak intake of 800,000 picocuries of I131 by Utah residents consuming one liter of milk per day. Corresponding infant thyroid doses were about 1 rad (average) and 14 rad (peak)."
https://openalex.org/W2090760430,"Polyploid human cells in culture often have paired sex chromatin masses. They are neither chance juxtapositions of randomly distributed X chromosomes nor manifestations of a propensity for pairing. The pairs are characteristic of the first polyploid interphase. They are thought to reflect the persistent differentiation of X chromosomes, as proposed in the Lyon hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986086755,"Recent advances in the biophysics and biochemistry of the nucleic acids have clearly shown that these are the molecules entrusted by nature with the task of storage and transfer of genetic information. Rapid developments in the status of the coding problem provide us with the promise that the day is near when we shall have full understanding of the genetic language. Attention is gradually being focused upon the mechanisms which control the transcription of the genetic message, and which, by the exertion of such control, bring about organized biological activity of the cell and orderly development of a single cell into a multicellular organism. What substances in the cell could be expected to serve in the control of genetic activity; to program the transcription and expression of the genetic language?"
