https://openalex.org/W3039783515,"Versatile chemical transformations of surface functional groups in two-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) open up a previously unexplored design space for this broad class of functional materials. We introduce a general strategy to install and remove surface groups by performing substitution and elimination reactions in molten inorganic salts. Successful synthesis of MXenes with oxygen, imido, sulfur, chlorine, selenium, bromine, and tellurium surface terminations, as well as bare MXenes (no surface termination), was demonstrated. These MXenes show distinctive structural and electronic properties. For example, the surface groups control interatomic distances in the MXene lattice, and Ti n +1 C n ( n = 1, 2) MXenes terminated with telluride (Te 2− ) ligands show a giant (&gt;18%) in-plane lattice expansion compared with the unstrained titanium carbide lattice. The surface groups also control superconductivity of niobium carbide MXenes."

It is unclear whether convalescing patients have a risk of reinfection. We generated a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that was characterized by interstitial pneumonia and systemic viral dissemination mainly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Rhesus macaques reinfected with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain during the early recovery phase of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection did not show detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations of viral disease, or histopathological changes. Comparing the humoral and cellular immunity between primary infection and rechallenge revealed notably enhanced neutralizing antibody and immune responses. Our results suggest that primary SARS-CoV-2 exposure protects against subsequent reinfection in rhesus macaques."
https://openalex.org/W3039508055,"Synapse remodeling is essential to encode experiences into neuronal circuits. Here, we define a molecular interaction between neurons and microglia that drives experience-dependent synapse remodeling in the hippocampus. We find that the cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is expressed by adult hippocampal neurons in an experience-dependent manner and defines a neuronal subset primed for synaptic plasticity. Loss of neuronal IL-33 or the microglial IL-33 receptor leads to impaired spine plasticity, reduced newborn neuron integration, and diminished precision of remote fear memories. Memory precision and neuronal IL-33 are decreased in aged mice, and IL-33 gain of function mitigates age-related decreases in spine plasticity. We find that neuronal IL-33 instructs microglial engulfment of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that its loss leads to impaired ECM engulfment and a concomitant accumulation of ECM proteins in contact with synapses. These data define a cellular mechanism through which microglia regulate experience-dependent synapse remodeling and promote memory consolidation."

A bipolar membrane can potentially enhance efficiency by bridging acidic hydrogen evolution to basic oxygen evolution. Oener et al. undertook a systematic study of how catalysts paired with such a membrane might accelerate the preliminary step of water dissociation into protons and hydroxide ions. Using insights from this study for optimal catalyst integration, they were able to substantially lower the overpotential of a bipolar membrane electrolyzer. Science , this issue p. 1099"

These results suggest that CD81 functions as a key sensor of external inputs and controls beige APC proliferation and whole-body energy homeostasis. Adipose tissues comprise a dynamic metabolic organ that remodels the cellular size and composition in response to a variety of internal and external cues, including nutritional states and temperatures. Such metabolic adaptation that involves lipolysis, lipogenesis, adipogenesis, and thermogenesis, plays a central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis (Chouchani and Kajimura, 2019Chouchani E.T. Kajimura S. Metabolic adaptation and maladaptation in adipose tissue.Nat. Metab. 2019; 1: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A notable adaptive process within adipose tissues that has attracted particular attention is the “browning” or “beiging” of white adipose tissue (WAT), in which numerous mitochondria-enriched thermogenic adipocytes with multi-locular lipid droplets (a.k.a., beige adipocytes) emerge within WAT (Wu et al., 2012Wu J.

Arch J.R. Ashwell M. Brown adipose tissue in the parametrial fat pad of the mouse.FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Importantly, adult humans possess beige fat: adult human brown adipose tissue (BAT) from the supraclavicular region contains mitochondria-enriched adipocytes that display a molecular signature resembling murine beige adipocytes (Lidell et al., 2013Lidell M.E.

Emerging evidence suggests that increased beige fat biogenesis improves metabolic health in ways far beyond the induction of thermogenesis (Kajimura et al., 2015Kajimura S. Spiegelman B.M. Seale P.

For instance, selective activation of beige fat biogenesis improves systemic glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, reduces WAT inflammation and fibrosis, and protects against hepatic steatosis (Hasegawa et al., 2018Hasegawa Y.

Conversely, impaired beige fat biogenesis results in insulin resistance, adipose tissue inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis (Cohen et al., 2014Cohen P. Levy J.D. Zhang Y. Frontini A.

Thus, a better understanding of the regulatory circuits of beige fat biogenesis continues to be a significant area of research as it may lead to the development of therapeutic measures that improve metabolic health. However, the developmental origins and regulation of beige fat are insufficiently understood. Lineage tracing analyses suggest that beige fat biogenesis involves both de novo differentiation from adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) and reinstatement of thermogenic activity in mature white adipocytes (Shao et al., 2019Shao M. Wang Q.A. Song A. Vishvanath L. Busbuso N.C. Scherer P.E. Gupta R.K. Cellular Origins of Beige Fat Cells Revisited.Diabetes. 2019; 68: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As for de novo beige adipogenesis, previous studies report that progenitors expressing Acta2, Pax3, Pdgfra, or Pdgfrb in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT give rise to beige adipocytes following cold exposure (Berry et al., 2016Berry D.C.

Of note, PDGFRα and Sca1 are expressed on the cell surface of adipose stromal cells that differentiate into both beige and white adipocytes (Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013Berry R. Rodeheffer M.S.

USA. 2011; 108: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar); however, both markers are also expressed in other stromal populations in adipose tissues and many organs. For example, a subset of PDGFRα+ cells in WAT expressing high levels of CD9 or ITGA5 are profibrogenic and drive adipose tissue fibrosis (Lin et al., 2018Lin J.Z. Rabhi N. Farmer S.R.

Thus, it remains unclear what distinguishes beige APCs from other stromal cell types. Accordingly, this study employed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNA-seq) in order to identify beige APCs. To characterize adipose stromal cells at single-cell resolution, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of lineage-negative (Lin−) stromal cells from murine interscapular BAT (iBAT), inguinal WAT (Ing WAT), and epididymal WAT (Epi WAT) (Figures S1A–S1D). We employed the Fluidigm C1 system that allowed for deeper sequencing (∼1–2 million reads/cell) despite fewer number of cells, as compared to the 10X Genomics platform that has been applied to adipose tissues (Burl et al., 2018Burl R.B.

This scRNA-seq analysis identified at least five distinct clusters (types I–V) based on a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) map (Figure 1A). Among these groups, we found that stromal cells in the type III cluster expressed a number of genes (73.1% of the total type III-enriched genes) that were involved in vascular smooth muscle development and contraction (Figure 1B). For instance, violin plots showed that the type III cells expressed high levels of Sm22 and Acta2 (encoding alpha-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA]). Of note, most of these stromal cells, except type II cells, expressed high levels of Pdgfra (Figure 1C). Instead, the majority of type II cells expressed high levels of Pdgfrb and Ednrb, indicative of an endothelial signature (Hepler et al., 2018Hepler C. Shan B. Zhang Q. Henry G.H. Shao M.

This “vascular smooth muscle” gene signature in type III cells caught our attention because stromal cells expressing Acta2 or Sm22 contribute to beige adipogenesis in Ing WAT (Berry et al., 2016Berry D.C.

Commun. 2016; 7: 10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; Long et al., 2014Long J.Z. Svensson K.J. Tsai L. Zeng X. Roh H.C. Kong X. Rao R.R. Lou J. Lokurkar I. Baur W. et al.A smooth muscle-like origin for beige adipocytes.Cell Metab. 2014; 19: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To isolate live type III cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we first searched for cell surface markers that were enriched in this cluster (Figure 1D). Among 370 known cell surface molecules, several candidates, including Pdgfra, Ly6a (coding Sca1), and Cd81, were highly expressed in type III cells relative to other groups (top 20 genes are listed in Table S1). Scatterplots from our scRNA-seq data showed that Cd81 was expressed in a subset of APCs that express Ly6a/Sca1 and Pdgfra (Figure 1E). A recent study reported that human CD34− APCs (Lin−: CD29+: CD34−) differentiate to beige adipocytes expressing high levels of Ucp1 and Cited1 (Raajendiran et al., 2019Raajendiran A. Ooi G. Bayliss J. O’Brien P.E. Schittenhelm R.B. Clark A.K. Taylor R.A. Rodeheffer M.S. Burton P.R. Watt M.J. Identification of Metabolically Distinct Adipocyte Progenitor Cells in Human Adipose Tissues.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 1528-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, 57% of the Cd81-expressing cells lacked Cd34 expression. Moreover, we analyzed a recently published scRNA-seq dataset of mouse APCs (Hepler et al., 2018Hepler C. Shan B. Zhang Q. Henry G.H. Shao M. Vishvanath L. Ghaben A.L. Mobley A.B. Strand D. Hon G.C. Gupta R.K. Identification of functionally distinct fibro-inflammatory and adipogenic stromal subpopulations in visceral adipose tissue of adult mice.eLife. 2018; 7: e39636Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and validated the existence of a stromal population expressing high levels of Cd81, Sca1, Acta2, and Sm22 within this dataset (Figure S1E). Accordingly, we aimed to isolate live type III cells by using antibodies against these cell-surface markers, followed by FACS. To establish the method, we first isolated Lin− stromal cells expressing α-SMA in Ing WAT by using Acta2-CreERT2; Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato reporter mice that label all the α-SMA+ cells following tamoxifen (Figure 1F). We found that CD81 protein expression was significantly higher in Lin−: Sca1+: tdTomato+ (α-SMA+) cells than other populations (Figure 1G, H). Conversely, isolated CD81+ cells (Lin−: Sca1+: CD81+) from Ing WAT-derived SVFs expressed significantly higher levels of the smooth muscle-related genes, including Acta2, Sm22, Myl9, and Myh11, relative to CD81− cells (Lin−: Sca1+: CD81−) in Ing WAT (Figure 1I). Of note, the gene signature of isolated Lin− Sca1+ CD81+ cells from the Ing WAT resembled that of type III cells (Figure S1F), and PDGFRα and Sca1 marked nearly the same CD81+ stromal population within the WAT of mice (Figure S1G). These data suggest that CD81 marks a subset of Sca1+ PDGFRα+ stromal cells possessing a smooth muscle-like signature and serves as a useful cell surface marker to isolate the type III cells from mouse WAT. CD81, one of the tetraspanin family members, was originally identified as the target of an antiproliferative antibody for a human lymphoma cell line (Oren et al., 1990Oren R. Takahashi S. Doss C. Levy R. Levy S. TAPA-1, the target of an antiproliferative antibody, defines a new family of transmembrane proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To test if CD81 marks beige fat progenitors, we isolated CD81+ and CD81− cells from the SVF of mouse Ing WAT by FACS (Figure 2A). After reaching confluency in culture, the sorted cells were differentiated under adipogenic conditions (Figure S2A). Oil-Red-O staining showed that CD81+ cells differentiated into mature adipocytes, whereas CD81− cells showed limited adipogenic capacity even though they expressed Sca1 (Figure 2B). Differentiated CD81+ cells expressed many brown/beige fat-selective genes, such as Ucp1, Pgc1a, Cidea, and Cox8b (Figure 2C). Moreover, differentiated CD81+ cells expressed significantly higher mRNA levels of Ucp1 and Pgc1a relative to CD81− cells, particularly after the cells were stimulated with norepinephrine (NE) (Figure 2D). It is worth noting that CD81+ cells possessed a cell-intrinsic capacity for beige adipogenesis without the browning cues (PPARγ agonists or NE): differentiated CD81+ cells expressed high levels of Ucp1, Pgc1a, Cidea, and Cox8b, even under the culture condition without rosiglitazone during the adipogenic induction phase (Figures S2B and S2C). Furthermore, differentiated CD81+ cells expressed higher protein levels of UCP1 and members of the mitochondrial OXPHOS complex than did CD81− cells, both in the presence and absence of forskolin (cyclic AMP [cAMP]) (Figure 2E). Importantly, CD81+-derived differentiated adipocytes responded to NE by increasing both their total and uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR), whereas CD81− cells did not have such responsiveness to NE (Figures 2F and S2D).Figure S2CD81+ Stromal Cells Give Rise to Beige Adipocytes, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Schematic illustration of the experiments in culture cell studies. CD81+ cells (Lin-: Sca1+: CD81+) and CD81- cells (Lin-: Sca1+: CD81-) were isolated from the SVFs of Ing WAT of BL6 mice (8-10 weeks of age) after overnight culture. Isolated cells were differentiated for 6 days under an adipogenic condition and stimulated with or without norepinephrine (NE) for 4 hours prior to harvest.

https://openalex.org/W3040234635,"Targeting glycolysis has been considered therapeutically intractable owing to its essential housekeeping role. However, the context-dependent requirement for individual glycolytic steps has not been fully explored. We show that CRISPR-mediated targeting of glycolysis in T cells in mice results in global loss of Th17 cells, whereas deficiency of the glycolytic enzyme glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi1) selectively eliminates inflammatory encephalitogenic and colitogenic Th17 cells, without substantially affecting homeostatic microbiota-specific Th17 cells. In homeostatic Th17 cells, partial blockade of glycolysis upon Gpi1 inactivation was compensated by pentose phosphate pathway flux and increased mitochondrial respiration. In contrast, inflammatory Th17 cells experience a hypoxic microenvironment known to limit mitochondrial respiration, which is incompatible with loss of Gpi1. Our study suggests that inhibiting glycolysis by targeting Gpi1 could be an effective therapeutic strategy with minimum toxicity for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, and, more generally, that metabolic redundancies can be exploited for selective targeting of disease processes."
https://openalex.org/W3039726380,"Uromodulin is the most abundant protein in human urine, and it forms filaments that antagonize the adhesion of uropathogens; however, the filament structure and mechanism of protection remain poorly understood. We used cryo–electron tomography to show that the uromodulin filament consists of a zigzag-shaped backbone with laterally protruding arms. N-glycosylation mapping and biophysical assays revealed that uromodulin acts as a multivalent ligand for the bacterial type 1 pilus adhesin, presenting specific epitopes on the regularly spaced arms. Imaging of uromodulin-uropathogen interactions in vitro and in patient urine showed that uromodulin filaments associate with uropathogens and mediate bacterial aggregation, which likely prevents adhesion and allows clearance by micturition. These results provide a framework for understanding uromodulin in urinary tract infections and in its more enigmatic roles in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3035743549,"Presynaptic CaV2 channels are essential for Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. In addition, there are two competing models for their roles in synapse structure. First, Ca2+ channels or Ca2+ entry may control synapse assembly. Second, active zone proteins may scaffold CaV2s to presynaptic release sites, and synapse structure is CaV2 independent. Here, we ablated all three CaV2s using conditional knockout in cultured hippocampal neurons or at the calyx of Held, which abolished evoked exocytosis. Compellingly, synapse and active zone structure, vesicle docking, and transsynaptic nano-organization were unimpaired. Similarly, long-term blockade of action potentials and Ca2+ entry did not disrupt active zone assembly. Although CaV2 knockout impaired the localization of β subunits, α2δ-1 localized normally. Rescue with CaV2 restored exocytosis, and CaV2 active zone targeting depended on the intracellular C-terminus. We conclude that synapse assembly is independent of CaV2s or Ca2+ entry through them. Instead, active zone proteins recruit and anchor CaV2s via CaV2 C-termini."
https://openalex.org/W3038297716,"To gain a better insight into the selenium nanoparticle (nSe) benefits/toxicity, this experiment was carried out to address the behavior of bitter melon seedlings to nSe (0, 1, 4, 10, 30, and 50 mgL-1) or bulk form (selenate). Low doses of nSe increased biomass accumulation, while concentrations of 10 mgL-1 and above were associated with stem bending, impaired root meristem, and severe toxicity. Responses to nSe were distinct from that of bulk in that the nano-type exhibited a higher efficiency to stimulate growth and organogenesis than the bulk. The bulk form displayed higher phytotoxicity than the nano-type counterpart. According to the MSAP-based analysis, nSe mediated substantial variation in DNA cytosine methylation, reflecting the epigenetic modification. By increasing the concentration of nSe, the expression of the WRKY1 transcription factor linearly up-regulated (mean = 7.9-fold). Transcriptions of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 4-Coumarate: CoA-ligase (4CL) genes were also induced. The nSe treatments at low concentrations enhanced the activity of leaf nitrate reductase (mean = 52%) in contrast with the treatment at toxic concentrations. The toxic concentration of nSe increased leaf proline concentration by 80%. The nSe supplement also stimulated the activities of peroxidase (mean = 35%) and catalase (mean = 10%) enzymes. The nSe-treated seedlings exhibited higher PAL activity (mean = 39%) and soluble phenols (mean = 50%). The nSe toxicity was associated with a disrupted differentiation of xylem conducting tissue. The callus formation and performance of the explants originated from the nSe-treated seedlings had a different trend than that of the control. This experiment provides new insights into the nSe-associated advantage/ cytotoxicity and further highlights the necessity of designing convincing studies to introduce novel methods for plant cell/tissue cultures and agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3039382149,"The most aggressive B cell lymphomas frequently manifest extranodal distribution and carry somatic mutations in the poorly characterized gene TBL1XR1. Here, we show that TBL1XR1 mutations skew the humoral immune response toward generating abnormal immature memory B cells (MB), while impairing plasma cell differentiation. At the molecular level, TBL1XR1 mutants co-opt SMRT/HDAC3 repressor complexes toward binding the MB cell transcription factor (TF) BACH2 at the expense of the germinal center (GC) TF BCL6, leading to pre-memory transcriptional reprogramming and cell-fate bias. Upon antigen recall, TBL1XR1 mutant MB cells fail to differentiate into plasma cells and instead preferentially reenter new GC reactions, providing evidence for a cyclic reentry lymphomagenesis mechanism. Ultimately, TBL1XR1 alterations lead to a striking extranodal immunoblastic lymphoma phenotype that mimics the human disease. Both human and murine lymphomas feature expanded MB-like cell populations, consistent with a MB-cell origin and delineating an unforeseen pathway for malignant transformation of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3039009690,"Global climate change has led to a significant increase in temperature over the last century and has been associated with significant increases in the severity and frequency of heat injury (HI). The consequences of HI included dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, leading to acute kidney injury, which is now recognized as a clear risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to investigate the effects of HI on the risk of CKD. This nationwide longitudinal population-based retrospective cohort study utilized the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) data. We enrolled patients with HI who were followed in NHIRD system between 2000 and 2013.We excluded patients diagnosed with CKD or genital-urinary system-related disease before the date of the new HI diagnosis. The control cohort consisted of individuals without HI history. The patients and control cohort were selected by 1:4 matching according to the following baseline variables: sex, age, index year, and comorbidities. The outcome measure was CKD diagnosis. In total, 815 patients diagnosed with HI were identified. During the 13 year observation period, we identified 72 CKD events (8.83%) in the heat stroke group and 143 (4.38%) CKD events in the control group. Patients with heat stroke had an increased risk of CKD than the control patients (adjusted HR = 4.346, P < 0.001) during the follow-up period. The risk of end-stage renal disease was also significantly increased in the heat stroke group than in the control group (adjusted hazards ratio: 9.078, p < 0.001). HI-related CKD may represent one of the first epidemics due to global warming. When compared to those without HI, patients with HI have an increased CKD risk."
https://openalex.org/W3040161811,"Recent studies describe the use of UAVs in collecting blow samples from large whales to analyze the microbial and viral community in exhaled air. Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples’ collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale’s respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W3040580907,"Chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD) is a multifactorial inflammatory disease that affects patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Multiple organs, including the lacrimal glands (LGs), are negatively affected by cGVHD and lose function due to the resultant fibrosis. An abnormal immune response is thought to be a major factor in the development of chronic ocular GVHD, which is currently treated primarily with immunosuppressive therapies. However, all the treatments yield unsatisfactory outcomes, and additional treatment strategies are needed. To meet this unmet medical need, we aimed to elucidate an additional pathway of chronic ocular GVHD. Our findings suggest a potential association between chronic ocular GVHD pathogenesis and stress-induced cellular senescence through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells produce cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6 and CXCL9. Indeed, senescent cell accumulation was presumably associated with cGVHD development in LGs, as evidenced by the improvement in LGs after the selective elimination of senescent cells (senolysis) with ABT-263. Results in the sclerodermatous cGVHD mouse model suggest that inhibiting the major components of the SASP, including IL-6 and CXCL9, with senolytics is a potential novel strategy for treating cGVHD-affected LGs. Taken together, our results indicate a potential association between the SASP and cGVHD development in LGs and suggest that targeted senolytic treatment may be a new therapeutic option for this disease."

We report the generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific for canine PD-1 and PD-L1. Antibodies were initially assessed for their capacity to block the binding of recombinant canine PD-1 to recombinant canine PD-L1 and then ranked based on efficiency of binding as judged by flow cytometry. Selected antibodies were capable of detecting PD-1 and PD-L1 on canine tissues by flow cytometry and Western blot. Anti-PD-L1 worked for immunocytochemistry and anti-PD-1 worked for immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine tissues, suggesting the usage of this antibody with archived tissues. Additionally, anti-PD-L1 (JC071) revealed significantly increased PD-L1 expression on canine monocytes after stimulation with peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide. Together, these antibodies display specificity for the natural canine ligand using a variety of potential diagnostic applications. Importantly, multiple PD-L1-specific antibodies amplified IFN-γ production in a canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) concanavlin A (Con A) stimulation assay, demonstrating functional activity."

However, the mechanism of beneficial role of Allicin on energy homeostasis is not well studied. Gut microbiota (GM) profoundly affects host metabolism via microbiota-host interactions and coevolution. Here, we investigated the interventions of beneficial microbiome induced by Allicin on energy homeostasis, particularly obesity, and related complications. Interestingly, Allicin treatment significantly improved GM composition and induced the most significant alteration enrichment of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Importantly, transplantation of the Allicin-induced GM to HFD mice (AGMT) played a remarkable role in decreasing adiposity, maintaining glucose homeostasis, and ameliorating hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, AGMT was effective in modulating lipid metabolism, activated brown adipose tissues (BATs), induced browning in sWAT, reduced inflammation, and inhibited the degradation of intestinal villi. Mechanically, AGMT significantly increased Blautia [short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing microbiota] and Bifidobacterium in HFD mice, also increased the SCFAs in the cecum, which has been proved many beneficial effects on energy homeostasis. Our study highlights that Allicin-induced host-gut microbe interactions plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis, which provides a promising potential therapy for obesity and metabolic disorders based on host-microbe interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3040127350,"Chronic stress-evoked depression has been implied to associate with the decline of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Caffeine has been known to combat stress-evoked depression. Herein, we aim to investigate whether the protective effect of caffeine on depression is related with improving adult hippocampus neurogenesis and explore the mechanisms. Mouse chronic water immersion restraint stress (CWIRS) model, corticosterone (CORT)-established cell stress model, a coculture system containing CORT-treated BV-2 cells and hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) were utilized. Results showed that CWIRS caused obvious depressive-like disorders, abnormal 5-HT signaling, and elevated-plasma CORT levels. Notably, microglia activation-evoked brain inflammation and inhibited neurogenesis were also observed in the hippocampus of stressed mice. In comparison, intragastric administration of caffeine (10 and 20 mg/kg, 28 days) significantly reverted CWIRS-induced depressive behaviors, neurogenesis recession and microglia activation in the hippocampus. Further evidences from both in vivo and in vitro mechanistic experiments demonstrated that caffeine treatment significantly suppressed microglia activation via the A2AR/MEK/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway. The results suggested that CORT-induced microglia activation contributes to stress-mediated neurogenesis recession. The antidepression effect of caffeine was associated with unlocking microglia activation-induced neurogenesis inhibition."

Despite surgical treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer, the rate of recurrence is high. In addition, although tumor biomarkers are frequently used to confirm advanced pancreatic cancer, this is not accurate and the biomarkers currently used cannot indicate prognosis. This study sought to evaluate circulating tumor DNA as a tumor biomarker to prognosticate pancreatic cancer. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and liver metastasis (N = 104) were included, and blood samples were collected from all patients. The mutant allele frequency was measured using amplicon-based deep sequencing on a cell-free DNA panel covering 14 genes with > 240 hot spots. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, 50% (N = 52) had detectable ctDNA levels, with TP53 (45%, N = 47) and KRAS (42.3%, N = 44) mutations the most common. Patients with detectable circulating tumor DNA levels also had significantly worse overall survival and progression free survival than ctDNA negative patients (8.4 vs 16 months, P<0.0001 for overall survival; 3.2 vs 7.9 months, P<0.0001 for progression-free survival). In a multivariate analysis, ctDNA status was independently associated with overall survival and progression-free survival (HR = 3.1, 95%CI = 1.9–5.0, P<0.0001; HR 2.6, 95%CI = 1.7–4.0, P<0.0001, respectively). Moreover, circulating tumor DNA significantly correlated with a higher number of liver metastases, the presence of lung and/or peritoneal metastases, tumor burden, and higher carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels. This study supports the use of circulating tumor DNA as an independent prognostic marker for advanced pancreatic cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3039842602,"Recurrent caries, the development of carious lesions at the interface between the restorative material and the tooth structure, is highly prevalent and represents the primary cause for failure of dental restorations. Correspondingly, we exploited the self-assembly and strong antibiofilm activity of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides (AAMPs) to form novel coatings on dentin that aimed to prevent recurrent caries at susceptible cavosurface margins. AAMPs are alternative to traditional antimicrobial agents and antibiotics with the ability to target the complex and heterogeneous organization of microbial communities. Unlike approaches that have focused on using these AAMPs in aqueous solutions for a transient activity, here we assess the effects on microcosm biofilms of a long-acting AAMPs-based antibiofilm coating to protect the tooth-composite interface. Genomewise, we studied the impact of AAMPs coatings on the dental plaque microbial community. We found that non-native all D-amino acids AAMPs coatings induced a marked shift in the plaque community and selectively targeted three primary acidogenic colonizers, including the most common taxa around Class II composite restorations. Accordingly, we investigated the translational potential of our antibiofilm dentin using multiphoton pulsed near infra-red laser for deep bioimaging to assess the impact of AAMPs-coated dentin on plaque biofilms along dentin-composite interfaces. Multiphoton enabled us to record the antibiofilm potency of AAMPs-coated dentin on plaque biofilms throughout exaggeratedly failed interfaces. In conclusion, AAMPs-coatings on dentin showed selective and long-acting antibiofilm activity against three dominant acidogenic colonizers and potential to resist recurrent caries to promote and sustain the interfacial integrity of adhesive-based interfaces."

https://openalex.org/W3038536713,"Garcinoic acid (GA or δ-T3-13'COOH), is a natural vitamin E metabolite that has preliminarily been identified as a modulator of nuclear receptors involved in β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated GA's effects on Aβ oligomer formation and deposition. Specifically, we compared them with those of other vitamin E analogs and the soy isoflavone genistein, a natural agonist of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) that has therapeutic potential for managing AD. GA significantly reduced Aβ aggregation and accumulation in mouse cortical astrocytes. Similarly to genistein, GA up-regulated PPARγ expression and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) efflux in these cells with an efficacy that was comparable with that of its metabolic precursor δ-tocotrienol and higher than those of α-tocopherol metabolites. Unlike for genistein and the other vitamin E compounds, the GA-induced restoration of ApoE efflux was not affected by pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ activity, and specific activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) was observed together with ApoE and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) membrane transporter up-regulation in both the mouse astrocytes and brain tissue. These effects of GA were associated with reduced Aβ deposition in the brain of TgCRND8 mice, a transgenic AD model. In conclusion, GA holds potential for preventing Aβ oligomerization and deposition in the brain. The mechanistic aspects of GA's properties appear to be distinct from those of other vitamin E metabolites and of genistein."

https://openalex.org/W3040361748,"Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common and highly invasive form of cancer. SCC arises due to ultraviolet light exposure and is associated with increased expression of pro-cancer genes and reduced expression of cancer suppressors. Actin-Like Protein 6A (ACTL6A, BAF53a) is an important protein subunit of the SWI/SNF epigenetic chromatin regulatory complex. ACTL6A is elevated in cancer cells and has been implicated as a driver of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. In the present study, we show that ACTL6A drives SCC cell proliferation, spheroid formation, invasion and migration, and that these activities are markedly reduced by ACTL6A knockdown. We further show that ACTL6A expression is associated with reduced levels of the p21Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor protein. Molecular studies show that ACTL6A interacts with p53 DNA response elements in the p21Cip1 gene promoter to suppress p21Cip1 promoter activity and mRNA and protein level. Additional studies show that an increase in p21Cip1 expression in ACTL6A knockdown cells is required for suppression of the SCC cell phenotype, suggesting that p21Cip1 is a mediator of ACTL6A action. We further show that this regulation is p53 independent. These findings suggest that ACTL6A suppresses p21Cip1 promoter activity to reduce p21Cip1 protein as a mechanism to maintain the aggressive epidermal SCC phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3040514422,"The scope of practice of the osteopathic profession in Italy is underreported. The first part of the present study investigated the Italian osteopaths' profile, focusing on the socio-demographic information and geographical distribution together with the main characteristics of their education. The OPERA-IT study highlighted that the majority of respondents declared to work as sole practitioners (58.4%), while the remaining declared to work as part of a team. Since teamwork and networking are recognized as fundamental aspects of healthcare, the present study aims to compare the osteopathic practice, diagnostic and treatment modalities of osteopaths who work as a sole practitioner and osteopaths who work as part of a team to highlight possible differences. Moreover, patients' characteristics will be presented. The OPERA-IT study population was chosen to provide a representative sample. A web campaign was set up to inform the Italian osteopaths before the beginning of the study. The OPERA IT study used a previously tested questionnaire. The questionnaire was translated into Italian following the World Health Organization recommendation. The questionnaire was composed of 57 items grouped in five sections, namely: socio-demographics, osteopathic education and training, working profile, organization, and management of the clinical practice and patient profile. The survey was delivered online through a dedicated platform. The survey was completed by 4,816 individuals. Osteopaths who work as sole practitioners represented the majority of the sample (n = 2814; 58.4%). Osteopaths who work as part of a team declared to collaborate mostly with physiotherapists (n = 1121; 23.3%), physicians with speciality (n = 1040; 21.6%), and other osteopaths (n = 943; 19.6%). The two groups showed heterogeneous characteristics. Significative differences were observed in all the factors, namely: geographical distribution, age, gender, training, working contract and working place, daily consultations and time for each consultation, fees, and the average waiting period to book an appointment. The principal component analysis supported a ten-component model and explained 80.5% of the total variance. The analysis showed that osteopaths working as sole practitioners have an increased probability (OR = 0.91; CI 95%: 0.88–0.94; p<0.01) of using systemic diagnostic and treatment techniques and have distinct clinical features with higher probability (OR = 0.92; 0.88–0.96; p<0.01) of spending less time with patients, being paid less but treating a higher number of patients per week. The most represented patients’ age groups were 41–64 years old (n = 4452; 92.4%) and 21–40 years old (n = 4291; 89.1%). Similarly, the most reported new patients’ age groups were 41–64 years old (n = 4221; 87.7%) and 21–40 years old (n = 3364; 69.9%). The most common presenting complaints were back pain, neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, sciatica, shoulder pain, and headaches. Osteopathic practice in Italy seems to be characterised by interprofessional collaboration, mostly with physiotherapists. Our results highlighted two different profiles in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and work modalities between osteopaths who work as sole practitioners and those who work as part of a team. Although according to the respondents, people of all ages consult Italian osteopaths, the majority of patients are adults. Most of them have been referred to osteopathy by other patients or acquaintances. Patients seek osteopathic care mostly for musculoskeletal related complaints."
https://openalex.org/W3040024315,"During the preimplantation period of pregnancy in eutherian mammals, transcriptional and proteomic changes in the uterine endometrium are required to facilitate receptivity to an implanting blastocyst. These changes are mediated, in part, by proteins produced by the developing conceptus (inner cell mass and extraembryonic membranes). We hypothesized that this common process in early pregnancy in eutheria may be facilitated by highly conserved conceptus-derived proteins such as macrophage capping protein (CAPG). We propose that CAPG may share functionality in modifying the transcriptome of the endometrial epithelial cells to facilitate receptivity to implantation in species with different implantation strategies. A recombinant bovine form of CAPG (91% sequence identity between bovine and human) was produced and bovine endometrial epithelial (bEECs) and stromal (bESCs) and human endometrial epithelial cells (hEECs) were cultured for 24 hours with and without recombinant bovine CAPG (rbCAPG). RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis were used to assess the transcriptional response to rbCAPG (Control, vehicle, CAPG 10, 100, 1000 ng/mL: n = 3 biological replicates per treatment per species). Treatment of bEECs with CAPG resulted in alterations in the abundance of 1052 transcripts (629 increased and 423 decreased) compared to vehicle controls. Treatment of hEECs with bovine CAPG increased expression of transcripts previously known to interact with CAPG in different systems (CAPZB, CAPZA2, ADD1, and ADK) compared with vehicle controls (P < .05). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CAPG, a highly conserved protein in eutherian mammals, elicits a transcriptional response in the endometrial epithelium in species with different implantation strategies that may contribute to pregnancy success."
https://openalex.org/W3040119987,"Ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation alter the functional diversity of forests. Generalising the magnitude of change in functional diversity of fragmented landscapes and its drivers is challenging because of the multiple scales at which landscape fragmentation takes place. Here we propose a multi-scale approach to determine whether fragmentation processes at the local and landscape scales are reducing functional diversity of trees in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. We employ a structural equation modelling approach using five key plant traits (seed length, dispersal mode, shade tolerance, maximum tree height, and wood density) to better understand the functional responses of trees to fragmentation at multiple scales. Our results suggest both direct and indirect effects of forest fragmentation on tree functional richness, evenness and divergence. A reduction in fragment area appears to exacerbate the negative effects resulting from an increased amount of edge habitat and loss of shape complexity, further reducing richness and evenness of traits related to resource acquisition and favouring tree species with fast growth. As anthropogenic disturbances affect forests around the world, we advocate to include the direct and indirect effects of forest fragmentation processes to gain a better understanding of shifts in functional diversity that can inform future management efforts."

The binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) on the EC surface is necessary for directed migration of these cells. Here, we used TAXIScan, an optically accessible real-time horizontal cell dynamics assay approach, and demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which is abundantly expressed in ECs, mediates VEGF/VEGFR-2-dependent directed migration. We noted that a continuous supply of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained VEGFR-2 to the plasma membrane is required to maintain VEGFR-2 at the cell surface. siRNA-mediated NOX4 silencing decreased the ER-retained form of VEGFR-2, resulting in decreased cell surface expression levels of the receptor. We also found that ER-localized NOX4 interacts with ER-retained VEGFR-2 and thereby stabilizes this ER-retained form at the protein level in the ER.

Thus, Nox4 is involved in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. The directed migration of ECs is an important process that occurs during angiogenesis. VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling is required for directed migration (29Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. Vascular endothelial growth factor effect on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and platelet-activating factor synthesis is Flk-1-dependent.J. Biol.

The present study investigated whether Nox4 is involved in VEGF/VEGFR-2-dependent directed migration using TAXIScan, which visualizes the migration of cells using various parameters. The siRNA-mediated silencing of Nox4 leads to decreased cell surface levels of VEGFR-2, resulting in decreased velocity and directionality of ECs. The maintenance of surface VEGFR-2 levels depends on the continuous supply of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained form of the receptor to the plasma membrane, and Nox4 is involved in stabilization of the ER-retained form at the protein level in the ER. Thus, Nox4 regulates the directed migration of ECs by maintaining surface VEGFR-2 levels. We first investigated the migratory capacity of EA.hy926 cells, which are cells obtained from a cultured cell line derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells and possess many of the unique characteristics of ECs (30Edgell C.J.

Cells were tracked using TAXIScan, which is a real-time assay device for imaging cell migration (Fig. 1A) (32Kanegasaki S. Nomura Y. Nitta N. Akiyama S. Tamatani T. Goshoh Y. Yoshida T. Sato T.

Two-dimensional trajectories using various concentrations of FBS are shown in Fig. 1C.

To investigate whether Nox and Nox-derived ROS are involved in FBS-dependent cell migration, we treated EA.hy926 cells with the Nox inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The H2O2 released by the treated cells was measured by a sensitive fluorimetric assay; the assay is based on the oxidation of homovanillic acid (HVA) into a fluorescent dimer, which is catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Fig. 2A). H2O2 (0.2 μm) was added from a standard H2O2 solution to the HVA-HRP detection system, and then any corresponding increase in fluorescence was checked (Fig. 2B). The H2O2-dependent relative fluorescence intensity was attenuated to background level by the addition of 6,000 units/ml catalase, which decomposes H2O2 to water and oxygen. The H2O2 generated by the EA.hy926 cells increased fluorescence intensity, which was decreased by DPI treatment. The cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion using flow cytometry and was unaffected by the DPI or NAC treatment (Fig. 2C). The mean migration directionality and velocity toward the FBS of DPI- or NAC-treated cells were significantly lower than those of control cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, endothelial Nox activity and ROS are required for cell migration. Nox4 is abundantly expressed in the endothelial cells (21Kuroda J. Nakagawa K. Yamasaki T. Nakamura K. Takeya R. Kuribayashi F.

To investigate whether Nox4 is involved in directed migration, we treated EA.hy926 cells with siRNA targeting Nox4, resulting in an almost complete depletion of Nox4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Specificity of the rabbit polyclonal anti-Nox4 antibody was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of HeLa cells transfected with FLAG–Nox1–5 (a FLAG tag inserted at the N terminus of Nox1–Nox5) expression vectors (Fig. 3C). Nox4 knockdown markedly decreased H2O2 levels in EA.hy926 cells (Fig. 3D). Nox2 knockdown (Fig. 3E) did not affect the H2O2 generation by EA.hy926 cells (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that Nox4 is a major source of H2O2 produced in EA.hy926 cells. Transfection with Nox4- or Nox2-targeted siRNA did not affect the cell viability (Fig. 3F). We examined the migration of Nox4- or Nox2-knockdown EA.hy926 cells and found that the mean migration directionality and velocity of Nox4-silenced cells was significantly lower than those of control cells (Fig. 3, G and H). We obtained the same results using another siRNA sequence (Fig. S1). Treatment of EAhy.926 cells with Nox2-specific siRNA did not affect the directionality or velocity of cell migration (Fig. 3, G and H). Several studies have identified the mechanisms of Nox-derived ROS-mediated angiogenesis driven in a VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling-dependent manner (11Kim Y.W. Byzova T.V.

Because Nox4 knockdown cells showed reduced directional migration, we investigated the expression pattern of VEGFR-2. Transfection with Nox4-targeted siRNA reduced VEGFR-2 protein expression by around 70% compared with that of cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 4A). A second Nox4-specific siRNA also blocked VEGFR-2 protein expression compared with control RNA, whereas Nox2-specific siRNA did not decrease VEGFR-2 protein expression (Fig. S2). However, Nox4 silencing did not affect VEGFR-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the link between Nox4 and VEGFR-2 expression is not transcriptionally controlled. To examine whether the decreased amount of VEGFR-2 protein seen with depletion of Nox4 affected the cell surface levels of VEGFR-2 protein, we performed a cell surface biotinylation assay to analyze the effect of Nox4 knockdown on levels of VEGFR-2 at the plasma membrane. The results showed that Nox4 knockdown markedly reduced the cell surface levels of VEGFR-2 (Fig. 4C). The reduction of surface VEGFR-2 levels induced by Nox4 knockdown attenuated the migration of ECs toward human recombinant VEGF-A injected as a ligand (Fig. 4, D and E). Immunoblotting using the anti-VEGFR-2 antibody showed that VEGFR-2 existed as a doublet, with the higher-molecular-weight form being the predominant species (Fig. 5A, lane 1). The higher-molecular-weight band was endoglycosidase H (Endo H) resistant, whereas the lower-molecular-weight band was Endo H sensitive (Fig. 5B, lane 3). Furthermore, the Endo H-resistant species was sensitive to treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Thus, in ECs, VEGFR-2 was found at both the cell surface (Endo H-resistant form) and the ER (Endo H-sensitive form), which is responsible for membrane protein maturation. The binding of VEGF leads to rapid internalization of VEGFR-2 (37Lampugnani M.G. Orsenigo F. Gagliani M.C. Tacchetti C. Dejana E.

To investigate the role of ER-retained VEGFR-2 in the maintenance of surface VEGFR-2 levels, we examined the effects of brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, by inhibiting coat protein complex I (40Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. Brefeldin A causes disassembly of the Golgi complex and accumulation of secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol.Chem. 1988; 263 (3192548): 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VEGFR-2 carrying complex-type glycan (Endo H resistant) was reduced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Consistent with this, BFA treatment decreased the cell surface VEGFR-2 levels (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that the maintenance of cell surface VEGFR-2 depends on the continuous transport of VEGFR-2 from the ER. Interestingly, the Endo H-sensitive band was decreased in Nox4 knockdown cells (Fig. 5A, lane 2, and B, lanes 7–9), suggesting that VEGFR-2 protein is influenced by Nox4 expression in the ER. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of Nox4 on the stability of ER-retained VEGFR-2. Nox4-silenced or control EA.hy926 cells were preincubated with BFA to retain VEGFR-2 in the ER. Cells were then treated with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit the de novo synthesis of VEGFR-2 in a time course experiment (0, 1, 3, 6, and 7.5 h), and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. In Nox4 knockdown cells, the VEGFR-2 protein levels decreased to ∼40% after 7.5 h of exposure to CHX (Fig. 5E), indicating that existing VEGFR-2 protein is easily degraded in the absence of Nox4 protein. H2O2 diffuses easily between extra- and intracellular environments (41Forman H.J. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Signaling functions of reactive oxygen species.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20050630): 835-84210.1021/bi9020378Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Indeed, ER-localized Nox4-derived H2O2 was trapped by extracellular catalase in the HVA-HRP detection system (Fig. 2, A and B). We investigated whether removal of extracellular H2O2 affects cell migration. Addition of catalase had no effect on FBS- or VEGF-A-dependent cell migration (Fig. 6, A and B, and Fig. S3). VEGFR-2 protein expression levels were decreased in DPI-treated cells (Fig. 6C, lane 2). The addition of exogenous H2O2 did not restore the expression level of VEGFR-2 (Fig. 6C, lane 3). These results indicate that the stabilizing effect of ER-retained VEGFR-2 by Nox4 required the production of H2O2 in the closed space between Nox4 and VEGFR-2. To determine the effect of Nox4 on the stabilization of ER-retained VEGFR-2, we investigated whether Nox4 physically interacts with VEGFR-2. Confocal imaging showed that GFP–Nox4 was predominantly present in the compartments of the ER (Fig. 6D, upper), which is consistent with previous studies (42Janiszewski M. Lopes L.R. Carmo A.O.

To demonstrate the binding of endogenous Nox4 to ER-retained VEGFR-2, cell lysates derived from BFA-treated cells, which did not include cell surface-localized VEGFR-2 protein (Fig. 5, B–D), were subjected to a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nox4 using an anti-Nox4 antibody led to an expected coprecipitation of endogenous p22phox (Fig. 6E), a partner protein that forms a complex in the membrane with Nox4 (46Ambasta R.K.

Under the same experimental conditions, we also observed that ER-retained VEGFR-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with Nox4 (Fig. 6E), demonstrating that Nox4 interacts with the ER-retained form in the ER compartments.

Early identification of patients at risk for HCC recurrence is of paramount importance since early treatment of recurrent HCC after LT may be associated with increased survival. We evaluated incidence of and predictors for HCC recurrence, with a focus on the course of AFP levels. Methods We performed a retrospective, single-center study of 99 HCC patients who underwent LT between January 28th, 1997 and May 11th, 2016. A multi-stage proportional hazards model with three stages was used to evaluate potential predictive markers, both by univariate and multivariable analysis, for influences on 1) recurrence after transplantation, 2) mortality without HCC recurrence, and 3) mortality after recurrence. Results 19/99 HCC patients showed recurrence after LT. Waiting time was not associated with overall HCC recurrence (HR = 1, p = 0.979). Similarly, waiting time did not affect mortality in LT recipients both with (HR = 0.97, p = 0.282) or without (HR = 0.99, p = 0.685) HCC recurrence. Log10-transformed AFP values at the time of LT (HR 1.75, p = 0.023) as well as after LT (HR 2.07, p = 0.037) were significantly associated with recurrence. Median survival in patients with a ratio (AFP at recurrence divided by AFP 3 months before recurrence) of 0.5 was greater than 70 months, as compared to a median of only 8 months in patients with a ratio of 5. Conclusion A rise in AFP levels rather than an absolute threshold could help to identify patients at short-term risk for HCC recurrence post LT, which may allow intensification of the surveillance strategy on an individualized basis."
https://openalex.org/W3040128587,"Purpose Developing a Dialogue/Virtual Agent (VA) that can handle complex tasks (need) of the user pertaining to multiple intents of a domain is challenging as it requires the agent to simultaneously deal with multiple subtasks. However, majority of these end-to-end dialogue systems incorporate only user semantics as inputs in the learning process and ignore other useful user behavior and information. Sentiment of the user at the time of conversation plays an important role in securing maximum user gratification. So, incorporating sentiment of the user during the policy learning becomes even more crucial, more so when serving composite tasks of the user. Methodology As a first step towards enabling the development of sentiment aided VA for multi-intent conversations, this paper proposes a new dataset, annotated with its corresponding intents, slot and sentiment (considering the entire dialogue history) labels, named SentiVA, collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. In order to integrate these multiple aspects, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) specifically options based VA is proposed to learn strategies for managing multi-intent conversations. Along with task success based immediate rewards, sentiment based immediate rewards are also incorporated in the hierarchical value functions to make the VA user adaptive. Findings Empirically, the paper shows that task based and sentiment based immediate rewards cumulatively are required to ensure successful task completion and attain maximum user satisfaction in a multi-intent scenario instead of any of these rewards alone. Practical implications The eventual evaluators and consumers of dialogue systems are users. Thus, to ensure a fulfilling conversational experience involving maximum user satisfaction requires VA to consider user sentiment at every time-step in its decision making policy. Originality This work is the first attempt in incorporating sentiment based rewards in the HRL framework."
https://openalex.org/W3039765948,"Introduction People Living with HIV (PLHIV) bear a disproportionate burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Despite their significant toll across populations globally, the NCD burden among key populations (KP) in Kenya remains unknown. The burden of four NCD-categories (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes) was evaluated among female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) at the Sex Workers Outreach Program (SWOP) clinics in Nairobi Kenya. Methods A retrospective medical chart review was conducted at the SWOP clinics among KP clients ≥15 years living with HIV enrolled between October 1, 2012 and September 30, 2015. The prevalence of the four NCD-categories were assessed at enrollment and during subsequent routine quarterly follow-up care visits as per the Ministry of Health guidelines. Prevalence at enrollment was determined and distributions of co-morbidities assessed using Chi-square and t-tests as appropriate during follow-up visits. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to identify factors associated with NCD diagnoses. Results Overall, 1,478 individuals’ records were analyzed; 1,392 (94.2%) were from FSWs while 86 (5.8%) were from MSM over the three-year period. FSWs’ median age was 35.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 30.1–41.6) while MSM were younger at 26.8 years (IQR 23.2–32.1). At enrollment into the HIV care program, most KPs (86.6%) were at an early WHO clinical stage (stage I–II) and 1462 (98.9%) were on first-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART). A total of 271, 18.3% (95% CI: 16.4–20.4%), KPs living with HIV had an NCD diagnosis in their clinical chart records during the study period. Majority of these cases, 258 (95.2%) were noted among FSWs. Cardiovascular disease that included hypertension was present in 249/271, 91.8%, of KPs with a documented NCD. Using a proxy of two or more elevated blood pressure readings taken < 12 months apart, prevalence of hypertension rose from 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6–1.7) that was documented in the charts during the first year to 16.3% (95% CI: 14.4–18.3) in the third year. Chronic respiratory disease mainly asthma was present in 16/271, a prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6–1.8) in the study population. Cancer in general was detected in 10/271, prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3–1.2) over the same period. Interestingly, diabetes was not noted in the study group. Lastly, significant associations between NCD diagnosis with increasing age, body-mass index and CD4 + cell-counts were noted in univariate analysis. However, except for categories of ≥ BMI 30 kg/m2 and age ≥ 45, the associations were not sustained in adjusted risk estimates. Conclusion In Kenya, KP living with HIV and on ART have a high prevalence of NCD diagnoses. Multiple NCD risk factors were also noted against a backdrop of a changing HIV epidemic in the study population. This calls for scaling up focus on both HIV and NCD prevention and care in targeted populations at increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. Hence, KP programs could include integrated HIV-NCD screening and care in their guidelines."

Cholera outbreak has become more common in Addis Ababa particularly in the rainy seasons; however, there is a paucity of data on risk factors associated with cholera outbreaks rendering interventions difficult. We investigated the outbreak to identify its etiology, source, risk factors and in order to control the outbreak. Methods We compared cases with health center-based unmatched controls (1:2). Cases were patients aged ≥5 years with acute watery diarrhea, with or without vomiting while controls were persons aged ≥5 years without history of acute watery diarrhea. We interviewed our study participants using structured questionnaire to collect demographic and cholera risk factors data. We described the outbreak over time, and then tested our hypotheses using unconditional logistic regression. Results The outbreak began on 7 September, 2017 reaching its peak on 23 September, 2017 and ended on 01 October, 2017. We identified a total of 25 cases (Median age: 38 years; IQR: 20 years) and recruited 50 controls (Median age: 35 years; IQR: 29 years). All case-patients had acute watery diarrhea and dehydration requiring intravenous fluids. All cases were admitted to cholera treatment center but there were no deaths. Stool and water samples yielded isolates of Vibrio cholerae O1 of serological subtype Ogawa. Consumption of contaminated holy water (AOR: 20.5, 95%CI: 3.50, 119.61) and raw vegetables (AOR: 15.3, 95%CI: 3, 81.51) were independent risk factors whereas washing hands with soap after visiting latrine (AOR: 0.04, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.25) was independent protective factor. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated cholera foodborne transmission via consumption of raw vegetables, and its waterborne transmission via consumption of contaminated holy water. Washing hands with soap after visiting latrine was protective. We recommended cooking of vegetables and promoting hand washing."

A total of 133 aerobic culturable isolates were recovered and identified from the gut of tilapia, belonging to 35 species of 12 genera in three bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria). Among them, 6 bacterial isolates of Bacillus baekryungensis, Bacillus marisflavi, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus methylotrophicus, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas taiwanensis were isolated from all the five experimental groups. The Bray-Curtis analysis showed that the bacterial communities among the five groups displayed obvious differences. In addition, this result of bioactivity showed that approximate 43% of the aerobic culturable gut bacteria of tilapia displayed a distinct anti-bacterial activity against at least one of four fish pathogens Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus iniae, Micrococcus luteus and Vibrio parahemolyticus. Furthermore, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Streptomyces rutgersensis displayed strong activity against all four indicator bacteria. These results contribute to our understanding of the intestinal bacterial diversity of tilapia when fed with woody forages and how certain antimicrobial bacteria flourished under such diets. This can aid in the further exploitation of new diets and probiotic sources in aquaculture."

In our current study, we implemented a paradigm to assess the effects of disrupting the right posterior parietal cortex on dynamic stabilization of body sway with and without Light Touch after a graded, unpredictable mechanical perturbation. We hypothesized that the benefit of Light Touch would be amplified in the more dynamic context of an external perturbation, reducing body sway and muscle activations before, at and after a perturbation. Furthermore, we expected sway stabilization would be impaired following disruption of the right Posterior Parietal Cortex as a result of increased postural stiffness. Thirteen young adults stood blindfolded in Tandem-Romberg stance on a force plate and were required either to keep light fingertip contact to an earth-fixed reference point or to stand without fingertip contact. During every trial, a robotic arm pushed a participant’s right shoulder in medio-lateral direction. The testing consisted of 4 blocks before TMS stimulation and 8 blocks after, which alternated between Light Touch and No Touch conditions. In summary, we found a strong effect of Light Touch, which resulted in improved stability following a perturbation. Light Touch decreased the immediate sway response, steady state sway following re-stabilization, as well as muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior. Furthermore, we saw gradual decrease of muscle activity over time, which indicates an adaptive process following exposure to repetitive trials of perturbations. We were not able to confirm our hypothesis that disruption of the rPPC leads to increased postural stiffness. However, after disruption of the rPPC, muscle activity of the Tibialis Anterior is decreased more compared to sham. We conclude that rPPC disruption enhanced the intra-session adaptation to the disturbing effects of the perturbation."

Available information on patterns of genetic differentiation in C. acutus shows a complex structuring influenced by interspecific interactions (mainly hybridization) and anthropogenic actions (mostly historical hunting, recent poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and unintentional translocation of individuals). In this study, we used data on mitochondrial DNA control region and 11 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the degree of population structure of C. acutus in South America, North America, Central America and the Greater Antilles. We used traditional genetic differentiation indices, Bayesian clustering and multivariate methods to create a more comprehensive picture of the genetic relationships within the species across its range. Analyses of mtDNA and microsatellite loci show evidence of a strong population genetic structure in the American crocodile, with unique populations in each sampling locality. Our results support previous findings showing large degrees of genetic differentiation between the continental and the Greater Antillean C. acutus. We report three new haplotypes unique to Venezuela, which are considerably less distant from the Central and North American haplotypes than to the Greater Antillean ones. Our findings reveal genetic population differentiation between Cuban and Jamaican C. acutus and offer the first evidence of strong genetic differentiation among the populations of Greater Antillean C. acutus."
https://openalex.org/W3040575262,"Japan has been recognized for its excellent universal health coverage system. However, the migrant population faces many barriers in accessing health services in Japan. Japan hosts around 260,000 international students, mostly from developing countries. Among them, language school students tripled from 2011 to 2017, against the backdrop of labor shortage in Japan. Most of these students are also engaged as cheap laborers and are vulnerable populations with poor access to health services. Several socio-economic and behavioral factors may increase their vulnerability to HIV and prevent them from accessing HIV testing in Japan. We examined the factors associated with access to HIV testing among international students in language schools in Tokyo. We conducted a cross-sectional study among international students studying in Japanese language schools in Tokyo. We collected data from 769 Chinese, Vietnamese, and Nepalese students using a self-administered questionnaire. We measured their access to HIV testing through questions on their knowledge of where to receive HIV testing and utilization of HIV testing. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Nepalese students were less likely to know where to receive HIV testing in Japan than Chinese students (AOR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.01–0.96). Students who did not need Japanese language interpreters during visits to health facilities were more likely to know where to receive HIV testing (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.14–3.25). Students who did not have knowledge of free and anonymous HIV testing in Japan were also less likely to know where to receive HIV testing in Japan (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.08–0.42). Students who did not have knowledge of free and anonymous HIV testing (OR = 0.05, 95% CI 0.02–0.10) and who had not utilized HIV testing in their home country (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.06–0.27) were less likely to utilize HIV testing in Japan. Factors associated with access to HIV testing among Japanese language school students in Tokyo are nationality, need for Japanese language interpreters, perceived access to doctors/health workers, utilization of HIV testing in the home country, and knowledge of free and anonymous HIV testing. These findings may help to design interventions for improving access to HIV testing among international students in Japan."

In this study, we induced fatigue-like behavior in mice using targeted pelvic irradiation to mimic the clinical treatment regimen and assess cognitive behavioral changes. We observed that pelvic irradiation produced a robust fatigue phenotype, a reduced rate of spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze test, and no behavioral change in an open field test. We found that reversal learning for fatigued mice was slower with respect to time, but not with respect to effort put into the test, suggesting that fatigue may impact the ability or motivation to work at a cognitive task without impairing cognitive capabilities. In addition, we found that mice undergoing pelvic irradiation show lower whole-brain levels of mature BDNF, and that whole-brain proBDNF levels also correlate with spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze test. These results suggest that changes in BDNF levels could be both a cause and an effect of fatigue-related changes in behavior."

In this work, we designed a color-based genetic assay to investigate plasmid stability in K. phaffii and constructed vectors bearing K. phaffii centromeres and the ADE3 marker. These genetic tools were evaluated in terms of mitotic stability by transforming an ade2/ade3 auxotrophic strain and regarding plasmid copy number by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results confirmed that the centromeric plasmids were maintained at low copy numbers as a result of typical chromosome-like segregation during cell division. These features, combined with in vivo assembly possibilities, prompt these plasmids as a new addition to the K. phaffii genetic toolbox."
https://openalex.org/W3040660278,"Aortic aneurysm refers to dilatation of the aorta due to loss of elasticity and degenerative weakening of its wall. A preventive role for osteoprotegerin (Opg) in the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm has been reported in the CaCl2-induced aneurysm model, whereas Opg was found to promote suprarenal aortic aneurysm in the AngII-induced ApoE knockout mouse aneurysm model. To determine whether there is a common underlying mechanism to explain the impact of Opg deficiency on the vascular structure of the two aneurysm models, we analyzed suprarenal aortic tissue of 6-month-old ApoE-/-Opg-/- mice after AngII infusion for 28 days. Less aortic dissection and aortic lumen dilatation, more adventitial thickening, and higher expression of collagen I and Trail were observed in ApoE-/-Opg-/- mice relative to ApoE-/-Opg+/+ mice. An accumulation of α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin double-positive myofibroblasts was noted in the thickened adventitia of ApoE-/-Opg-/- mice. Our results suggest that fibrotic remodeling of the aorta induced by myofibroblast accumulation might be an important pathological event which tends to limit AngII-induced aortic dilatation in ApoE -/-Opg-/- mice."

Results Patients who later developed IBD had significantly higher plasma cotinine levels compared to controls. In multivariable analysis, higher log-cotinine was associated with a higher risk of developing IBD (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.01–1.63)). After stratifying for time to diagnosis, the association was only significant in subjects with shorter time (< 5.1 years) to diagnosis (OR 1.45 (1.09–1.92)). The findings were similar for UC- and CD-cases, but did not reach statistical significance in CD-cases. Although plasma cotinine concentrations were higher in snuff users compared to combusted tobacco users, no increase in the risk of IBD and lower risk of developing IBD among subjects with shorter time (< 5.1 years) to diagnosis was seen among snuff users. Conclusions Cotinine, a biomarker of tobacco use, is associated with increased risk of developing late-onset IBD in general, and UC in particular. No increased risk among snuff users indicates that other components in combusted tobacco than nicotine may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD among smokers."
https://openalex.org/W3039267435,"This study examined the influence of bioaugmentation on metal concentrations (aluminum, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel and zinc) in anaerobically digested sewage sludge. To improve the digestion efficiency, bioaugmentation with a mixture of wild-living Archaea and Bacteria (MAB) from Yellowstone National Park, USA, was used. The total concentration of all metals was higher in the digestate than in the feedstock. During anaerobic digestion, the percent increase in the concentration of most of metals was slightly higher in the bioaugmented runs than in the un-augmented runs, but these differences were not statistically significant. However, the percent increase in cadmium and cobalt concentration was significantly higher in the bioaugmented runs than in the un-augmented runs. At MAB doses of 9 and 13% v/v, cadmium concentration in the digestate was 211 and 308% higher than in the feedstock, respectively, and cobalt concentration was 138 and 165%, respectively. Bioaugmentation increased over 4 times the percentage of Pseudomonas sp. in the biomass that are able to efficiently accumulate metals by both extracellular adsorption and intracellular uptake. Biogas production was not affected by the increased metal concentrations. In conclusion, bioaugmentation increased the concentration of metals in dry sludge, which means that it could potentially have negative effects on the environment."
