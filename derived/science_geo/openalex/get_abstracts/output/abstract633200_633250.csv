https://openalex.org/W2945681432,"Here, we describe the discovery of a naturally occurring human antibody (Ab), FluA-20, that recognizes a new site of vulnerability on the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain and reacts with most influenza A viruses. Structural characterization of FluA-20 with H1 and H3 head domains revealed a novel epitope in the HA trimer interface, suggesting previously unrecognized dynamic features of the trimeric HA protein. The critical HA residues recognized by FluA-20 remain conserved across most subtypes of influenza A viruses, which explains the Ab's extraordinary breadth. The Ab rapidly disrupted the integrity of HA protein trimers, inhibited cell-to-cell spread of virus in culture, and protected mice against challenge with viruses of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, or H7N9 subtypes when used as prophylaxis or therapy. The FluA-20 Ab has uncovered an exceedingly conserved protective determinant in the influenza HA head domain trimer interface that is an unexpected new target for anti-influenza therapeutics and vaccines."

Our study provides a benchmark for assessing EBOV vaccine-induced immunity. The West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014–2016 was the largest ever recorded, responsible for more than 11,000 deaths (WHO, 2016WHOEbola Situation Report - 30 March 2016.http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-30-march-2016Date: 2016Google Scholar). The experiences of the more than 17,000 survivors have reshaped our knowledge of human immune responses to Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Although once thought to cause suppression of the host immune response (Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004Geisbert T.W. Jahrling P.B. Exotic emerging viral diseases: progress and challenges.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S110-S121Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), we now know that EBOV infection leads to extensive activation of B and T cells and high levels of inflammatory molecule expression during acute infection (McElroy et al., 2015McElroy A.K.

The robust B cell responses induced by EBOV infection eventually lead to the generation of highly potent protective antibodies, as shown by the ability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from human survivors to protect against EVD in vivo (Parren et al., 2002Parren P.W. Geisbert T.W. Maruyama T. Jahrling P.B. Burton D.R. Pre- and postexposure prophylaxis of Ebola virus infection in an animal model by passive transfer of a neutralizing human antibody.J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 6024-6030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these mAbs have typically been isolated several months or years after infection, so it is unclear what role they play in the initial control of infection. Longitudinal serological studies in human survivors of EBOV infection, coupled with a detailed molecular profiling of their B cell responses, could help to answer whether protective antibodies appear early enough to help control acute infection. Such studies could also reveal whether there are common themes in the protective human immune response against EBOV that could be used to guide vaccine design and evaluation. Such studies are critically needed as EBOV continues to cause disease outbreaks, including the 2018 Équateur and Kivu outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (WHO, 2018WHOEbola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo.https://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/drc-2018/en/Date: 2018Google Scholar). Between August and December of 2014, four EBOV-infected patients were treated at Emory University Hospital (Lyon et al., 2014Lyon G.M. Mehta A.K. Varkey J.B. Brantly K. Plyler L. McElroy A.K.

All four patients agreed to enroll in a 3-year follow-up study, offering a unique opportunity to track the evolution of their immune responses. Here, we present an analysis of B cell responses in these four donors, focusing primarily on antibodies to the EBOV surface glycoprotein. Longitudinal blood samples were collected from the four EVD patients following their discharge from the hospital. Antibodies against EBOV glycoprotein (GP) were tracked by ELISA and virus-neutralizing antibodies were measured by plaque reduction assay (Figure 1A). At discharge, all four patients had high GP-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers that persisted over 2 years. GP-specific IgM fell over time to background levels, while IgA levels remained elevated (Figure 1B). All four donors had sustained IgG responses to EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (VP40) (Figure 1C). In contrast to ELISA titers, neutralizing antibody responses were low or absent at discharge and rose slowly over 1 year (Figure 1A). We next examined the subclass composition of the GP-specific IgG response (Figure 1D, top). IgG1 levels were near peak at discharge and declined relatively slowly. GP-specific IgG1 correlated closely with total GP-specific IgG (Figure S1), suggesting that IgG1 made up most of the response. IgG2 was not detectable, while IgG3 was highest early and declined relatively rapidly, except in donor EVD9 where there was a second peak around 1 year after symptom onset. GP-specific IgG4 appeared in EVD2, EVD9, and EVD15 only at late time points (1–2 years post-infection). We observed similar patterns of subclass usage over time (sustained IgG1, declining IgG3, and delayed IgG4) when we examined NP-specific responses (Figure 1D, bottom). We performed longitudinal antibody repertoire sequencing to examine the global effects of EBOV infection on the B cell compartment. The first sample analyzed in each donor corresponded to the peak of the blood antibody secreting cell (ASC) response (Figure 2A). As we reported previously, 20%–60% of all B cells at this time point were ASCs (CD38hi/CD27hi) and another 5%–10% were activated B cells (ABCs; CD71+/CD20+) (McElroy et al., 2015McElroy A.K.

A high frequency of antigen-specific cells are found among ASCs after vaccination or infection (Wrammert et al., 2008Wrammert J. Smith K. Miller J. Langley W.A. Kokko K. Larsen C. Zheng N.Y. Mays I.

We used peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA for all repertoire sequencing except EVD9 day 40, where RNA from sorted ASCs was used. Repertoire sequencing of a representative healthy donor is shown in the top row of Figure 2B. IgM sequences have low somatic hypermutation (SHM; green circles) and show small clone sizes, while IgG sequences display significant SHM (purple circles) and evidence of clonal expansion (larger circle sizes). In contrast, sequences with low SHM dominated the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 compartments at the peak of the ASC response in EVD5 (Figure 2C, row 2). Low SHM was also seen in IgG sequences at this time point for subjects EVD2 and EVD9 (Figure S2) and in IgA sequences for all three donors (Figures 2B and S2). Thus, at the ASC peak, most IgG transcripts and a large fraction of IgA transcripts were made by cells recently recruited from the naive B cell pool. At the next time point analyzed, an increased prevalence of low mutation clones was still apparent, particularly among IgG1 and IgG3 sequences, the isotypes most commonly utilized by virus-specific antibodies (Ferrante et al., 1990Ferrante A. Beard L.J. Feldman R.G. IgG subclass distribution of antibodies to bacterial and viral antigens.Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1990; 9: S16-S24PubMed Google Scholar). We note that the RNA template quantity from the EVD5 day 60 sample was limited, resulting in fewer total clones being detected in this sample (Figure 2B, third row). The average SHM% seen in IGH sequences from the four EVD donors and 13 healthy controls is shown in Figure 2C. Figure 2D shows the percentage of lineages with low levels of SHM (<1.5% SHM). SHM levels in class-switched IGH transcripts from EVD2, EVD5, and EVD9 were reduced and the frequency of low SHM lineages increased relative to controls for 2–3 months. These changes were not seen in EVD15, who had the lowest viremia (McElroy et al., 2015McElroy A.K. Akondy R.S. Davis C.W. Ellebedy A.H. Mehta A.K. Kraft C.S. Lyon G.M. Ribner B.S. Varkey J. Sidney J. et al.Human Ebola virus infection results in substantial immune activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 4719-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To track EBOV-specific B cells by flow cytometry, we used fluorescently labeled EBOV GP probes. We tested several GP isoforms as sort probes (Figure S3A) (Fusco et al., 2015Fusco M.L. Hashiguchi T. Cassan R. Biggins J.E. Murin C.D. Warfield K.L. Li S. Holtsberg F.W. Shulenin S. Vu H. et al.Protective mAbs and Cross-Reactive mAbs Raised by Immunization with Engineered Marburg Virus GPs.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1005016Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two were selected for use: full-length GP ectodomain (GPec) and cleaved GP (GPcl). The mucin and glycan cap domains have been removed from GPcl, exposing the NPC1 binding site (Chandran et al., 2005Chandran K. Sullivan N.J. Felbor U. Whelan S.P. Cunningham J.M. Endosomal proteolysis of the Ebola virus glycoprotein is necessary for infection.Science. 2005; 308: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, Côté et al., 2011Côté M. Misasi J. Ren T.

Ruthel G. et al.Ebola virus entry requires the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1.Nature. 2011; 477: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). A higher number of memory B cells bound GPcl compared to GPec (Figure S3B), suggesting that the B cell response preferentially targeted epitopes that are exposed in GPcl but masked in GPec. GP-specific MBCs were highest in EVD5 but detectable in all four donors (Figure 3A). The activation/proliferation marker CD71 was expressed by most GP-binding B cells early after infection (Figure S3C) and remained elevated for 6–12 months (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting continued antigen-driven activation of GP-specific cells. Consistent with this, there was a progressive increase in GP-specific antibody avidity during convalescence (Figure 3D). We found further evidence of ongoing immune activation when we examined plasma levels of the chemokine CXCL13, a known biomarker for germinal center activity (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016Havenar-Daughton C. Lindqvist M. Heit A. Wu J.E. Reiss S.M. Kendric K. Bélanger S. Kasturi S.P. Landais E. Akondy R.S. et al.IAVI Protocol C Principal InvestigatorsCXCL13 is a plasma biomarker of germinal center activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 2702-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). All four patients had elevated CXCL13 while hospitalized, and persistent elevation was seen for ∼1 year in donors EVD2, EVD5, and EVD9 (Figure 3E). There was a transient drop in CXCL13 in EVD9 after this patient was treated for EBOV-associated uveitis and received corticosteroids, which suppress CXCL13 production (Meraouna et al., 2006Meraouna A. Cizeron-Clairac G. Panse R.L. Bismuth J. Truffault F. Tallaksen C. Berrih-Aknin S. The chemokine CXCL13 is a key molecule in autoimmune myasthenia gravis.Blood. 2006; 108: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Varkey et al., 2015Varkey J.B. Shantha J.G. Crozier I.

Med. 2015; 372: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To characterize the evolution of the EBOV-specific antibody response in more detail, we cloned antibodies from single GPcl and/or GPec binding B cells. We obtained 723 unique paired heavy and light chain sequences, 367 of which were produced as mAbs (Table S1). 314 mAbs (86%) bound at least one EBOV GP isoform by ELISA. SHM in these GP-specific mAbs was low at early time points but increased by 6 months post-discharge in EVD2, EVD5, and EVD9 (Figure 3F). Due to limited sample quantity, GP-binding mAbs could only be sorted from EVD15 on the day of hospital discharge (day 14). Interestingly, higher SHM levels were seen in these mAbs, despite their early time of isolation. We next examined our repertoire sequencing dataset for additional members of the GP-binding antibody lineages. SHM increased over time in these lineages in EVD2, EVD5, and EVD9 (Figures 3G and 3H). GP-binding lineages from EVD15 had higher SHM at the ASC peak compared to the other three subjects (p < 0.0001 by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and did not show increased SHM over time. We utilized additional strategies for isolating EBOV-specific antibodies from B cells beyond GPcl/ec staining. We screened plasma from the four survivors for IgG against a library of 15-mer peptides from GP, in case some of these peptides were not present or accessible on the GP sort probes. IgG from all four donors bound to peptides in heptad repeat region 2 (HR2) and the membrane proximal extracellular region (MPER) of GP (Figure S3D), perhaps commensurate with the linear presentation of these sequences in the GP structure. We used a fluorescently labeled MPER peptide to sort B cells for mAb cloning (Figure S3E) and isolated a single MPER-specific mAb from EVD2. As an additional strategy to capture EBOV-specific B cells, we sorted CD71+ ABC from early time points that failed to bind GPec/cl. 53 mAbs were isolated from GPec/GPcl negative CD71+ ABCs from EVD5 1 month after discharge. Sixteen (30%) were specific for an EBOV antigen (Figure S3F), with VP40 the most common target. Three mAbs (5%) bound GP by ELISA and were evaluated along with the MPER mAb and the mAbs from GPcl/ec binding cells. To measure binding of mAbs to GP displayed in a similar orientation to that on viral particles, we established a stable GP-expressing cell line (Jurkat-GP). EBOV-specific mAbs selectively bound to Jurkat-GP cells and not the parental line (Figure 4A). We tested whether these cells could be treated with thermolysin to cleave off the glycan cap and mucin domains of GP, as previously demonstrated for pseudovirus particles (Kaletsky et al., 2007Kaletsky R.L. Simmons G. Bates P. Proteolysis of the Ebola virus glycoproteins enhances virus binding and infectivity.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13378-13384Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As expected, thermolysin treatment prevented the binding of glycan cap-specific mAb c13C6 (Olinger et al., 2012Olinger Jr., G.G. Pettitt J. Kim D. Working C. Bohorov O. Bratcher B. Hiatt E. Hume S.D. Johnson A.K. Morton J. et al.Delayed treatment of Ebola virus infection with plant-derived monoclonal antibodies provides protection in rhesus macaques.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rodriguez L.L. Jahrling P.B. Sanchez A. Khan A.S. Nichol S.T. Peters C.J. Parren P.W. Burton D.R. Ebola virus can be effectively neutralized by antibody produced in natural human infection.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6024-6030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that binds to the GP base (Figure 4B). We then used these cells to assess binding of plasma IgG from the EVD survivors (Figures 4C and 4D). Interestingly, IgG binding for all four donors was 10- to 100-fold higher to thermolysin-cleaved GP than to native GP on Jurkat cells (Figure 4D). This matches our earlier findings that most GP-specific MBCs bound soluble GPcl better than GPec by flow cytometry (Figure 3A). Surprisingly, selective binding of serum IgG to GPcl was not apparent by ELISA (Figure 4E). This appeared to be due, at least in part, to changes in epitope accessibility when GPec was bound directly to the ELISA plate (Figure S4A), similar to previous findings (Hangartner et al., 2006Hangartner L.

Luciferase-expressing EBOV lacking the VP30 gene was incubated with the indicated mAbs at 10 μg/ml for 2 hours at 37°C, then added to VP30-expressing Vero cell cultures in duplicate wells. Luciferase activity was measured three days later. mAbs were considered neutralizing if the luciferase signal was reduced by > 90% compared to the average signal in six wells incubated with virus plus negative control antibody. Bars for neutralizing mAbs are colored red. Neg. control = VP35-specific mAb 5-69.3.2. Pos. control = mAb 226/8.1. The SD of three replicate assays is shown. We next used a biologically contained luciferase-expressing EBOV to screen our panel of mAbs for neutralization activity (Figure S4B) (Halfmann et al., 2008Halfmann P. Kim J.H. Ebihara H. Noda T. Neumann G. Feldmann H. Kawaoka Y. Generation of biologically contained Ebola viruses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overall, only 11 mAbs out of 318 isolated from GP-binding B cells (∼3.5%) were neutralizing. Neutralization was strongly correlated with the ability of a given mAb to bind to native GP on Jurkat-GP cells (Figure 4F). The majority of the non-neutralizing mAbs bound epitopes that were exposed only after thermolysin treatment. Thirty-five mAbs failed to bind either native or cleaved GP on Jurkat cells despite binding GP by ELISA. Most of these mAbs were able to bind Jurkat-GP cells treated with the reducing agent DTT, which has been shown to increase exposure of epitopes on the GP base (Francica et al., 2010Francica J.R. Varela-Rohena A. Medvec A. Plesa G. Riley J.L. Bates P. Steric shielding of surface epitopes and impaired immune recognition induced by the ebola virus glycoprotein.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001098Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We next sought to characterize mAbs from ASCs. As we reported previously, EVD2 and EVD5 both showed a strong, ongoing blood ASC response 1 month after discharge (day 59/60 post symptom onset), much of which was EBOV-specific (McElroy et al., 2015McElroy A.K. Akondy R.S. Davis C.W. Ellebedy A.H. Mehta A.K. Kraft C.S. Lyon G.M. Ribner B.S. Varkey J. Sidney J. et al.Human Ebola virus infection results in substantial immune activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 4719-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We sorted ASCs (without antigen labeling), cloned and expressed mAbs, and characterized their specificity (Figure 4G; Table S1). Approximately one third of the 102 ASC mAbs bound an EBOV antigen, with GP the most common target. The difference in the median hypermutation levels between EBOV antigen-binding versus non-binding mAbs was not statistically significant (Figure 4H). SHM levels in both groups of mAbs were lower than we have previously seen in ASCs derived from recall responses (Priyamvada et al., 2016Priyamvada L. Cho A. Onlamoon N. Zheng N.Y. Huang M. Kovalenkov Y. Chokephaibulkit K. Angkasekwinai N. Pattanapanyasat K.

https://openalex.org/W2945953636,"Summary Vaccines to generate durable humoral immunity against antigenically evolving pathogens such as the influenza virus must elicit antibodies that recognize conserved epitopes. Analysis of single memory B cells from immunized human donors has led us to characterize a previously unrecognized epitope of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) that is immunogenic in humans and conserved among influenza subtypes. Structures show that an unrelated antibody from a participant in an experimental infection protocol recognized the epitope as well. IgGs specific for this antigenic determinant do not block viral infection in vitro, but passive administration to mice affords robust IgG subtype-dependent protection against influenza infection. The epitope, occluded in the pre-fusion form of HA, is at the contact surface between HA head domains; reversible molecular “breathing” of the HA trimer can expose the interface to antibody and B cells. Antigens that present this broadly immunogenic HA epitope may be good candidates for inclusion in “universal” flu vaccines."

Additionally, our model captures several other key behavioral and neurophysiological characteristics of working memory. Working memory is the ability to hold information “in mind.” It acts as a workspace on which information can be held, manipulated, and then used to guide behavior. In this way, it plays a critical role in cognition, decoupling behavior from the immediate sensory world. However, the circuit mechanisms that support working memory remain unclear. In particular, existing models fail to capture key behavioral and neural characteristics of working memory. Working memory has two defining behavioral characteristics. First, it is highly flexible: one can hold anything in mind and can do it from the first experience. This provides cognition with its versatility, allowing us to think and learn about anything. Second, working memory has a severely limited capacity. Humans and monkeys are able to maintain only 3 or 4 objects at once (Luck and Vogel, 1997Luck S.J. Vogel E.K. The capacity of visual working memory for features and conjunctions.Nature. 1997; 390: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (2848) Google Scholar, Cowan, 2010Cowan N.

In other words, although one can hold anything in mind, one can only hold a few of them at a time. In addition to these behavioral characteristics, previous work has identified several neural characteristics of working memory. First, the contents of working memory are thought to be represented in both the persistent activity of neurons (Funahashi et al., 1989Funahashi S. Bruce C.J. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey’s dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar, Fuster, 1999Fuster J.M.

Constantinidis C. Romo R. Wang X.-J. Stable population coding for working memory coexists with heterogeneous neural dynamics in prefrontal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. 2015; 19: 394-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Second, working memory representations are distributed across the brain: they have been observed in prefrontal, parietal, and sensory cortex (for review, see Christophel et al., 2017Christophel T.B. Klink P.C. Spitzer B. Roelfsema P.R. Haynes J.D. The distributed nature of working memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21: 111-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Third, increasing the number of items held in working memory (the “memory load”) increases the overall activity in these brain regions (up to an individual capacity limit; Curtis and D’Esposito, 2003Curtis C.E. D’Esposito M. Persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex during working memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2003; 7: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2014Ma W.J. Husain M. Bays P.M. Changing concepts of working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). However, increasing memory load also reduces the selectivity of individual neurons in a divisive-normalization-like manner; the firing rate of neurons selective for one item is decreased with the addition of other items. This normalization is thought to lead to the reduced memory performance and accuracy at high memory loads (Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J. Siegel M. Roy J.E. Miller E.K. Neural substrates of cognitive capacity limitations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11252-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Sprague et al., 2014Sprague T.C. Ester E.F. Serences J.T. Reconstructions of information in visual spatial working memory degrade with memory load.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Theoretical models have captured some, but not all, of these characteristics. The dominant model of working memory is that recurrent network interactions, either within or between brain regions, give rise to persistent neural activity (Wang, 2001Wang X.J. Synaptic reverberation underlying mnemonic persistent activity.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, Barak and Tsodyks, 2014Barak O. Tsodyks M. Working models of working memory.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 25: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These models have a limited capacity, as lateral inhibition limits the number of simultaneous patterns of activity that can be maintained (Edin et al., 2009Edin F. Klingberg T. Johansson P. McNab F. Tegnér J. Compte A. Mechanism for top-down control of working memory capacity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 6802-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Swan and Wyble, 2014Swan G. Wyble B. The binding pool: a model of shared neural resources for distinct items in visual working memory.Atten. Percept. Psychophys. 2014; 76: 2136-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, these models are inflexible. They rely on fine-tuning of connections to embed stable fixed points in the network dynamics specific to the content being stored. These connections must be hardwired or learned for each type of information, and so the network cannot flexibly represent novel, unexpected stimuli. Indeed, networks of this type in the brain seem to encode ecologically relevant information, such as heading direction (Kim et al., 2017Kim S.S. Rouault H. Druckmann S. Jayaraman V. Ring attractor dynamics in the Drosophila central brain.Science. 2017; 356: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Models that represent working memory as a result of transient dynamics in neural activity are similarly inflexible. They require learning to embed the dynamics, to decode the temporally evolving representations, or to ensure the dynamics are orthogonal to mnemonic representations (Vogels et al., 2005Vogels T.P. Rajan K. Abbott L.F. Neural network dynamics.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, Druckmann and Chklovskii, 2012Druckmann S. Chklovskii D.B.

Short term memory in echo state networks.2002http://www.faculty.jacobs-university.de/hjaeger/pubs/STMEchoStatesTechRep.pdfGoogle Scholar). Other models capture the flexibility of working memory, such as those that hypothesize working memory representations, are encoded in short-term synaptic plasticity or changes in single-cell biophysics (Loewenstein and Sompolinsky, 2003Loewenstein Y. Sompolinsky H. Temporal integration by calcium dynamics in a model neuron.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Hasselmo and Stern, 2006Hasselmo M.E. Stern C.E.

Barak O. Tsodyks M. Synaptic theory of working memory.Science. 2008; 319: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). However, these models do not directly explain the limited capacity of working memory and do not capture many of the neurophysiological characteristics of working memory, such as the coexistence of persistent and dynamic representations seen in neural data. Here, we propose a flexible model of working memory that relies on random reciprocal connections to generate persistent activity. As the connections are random, they are inherently untuned with respect to the content being stored and do not need to be learned, allowing the network to maintain any representation. However, this flexibility comes at a cost—when multiple memories are stored in the network, they begin to interfere, resulting in a divisive-normalization-like reduction of responses and imposing a capacity limit on the network. Thus, our model provides a mechanistic explanation for the limited capacity of working memory; it is a necessary trade-off for its flexibility. We model a simplified two-layer network of Poisson spiking neurons (Figure 1A; see STAR Methods for a detailed description). The first layer is the “sensory network” and consists of 8 independent ring-like sub-networks (each with 512 neurons). These sub-networks mimic simplified sensory networks and can be thought of as encoding the identity of independent stimuli at different locations in space. Therefore, we can vary working memory load by varying the number of sensory sub-networks receiving inputs. Neurons within each sensory sub-network are arranged topographically according to selectivity. Position around the ring corresponds to specific values of an encoded feature, such as color or orientation. Consistent with biological observations, connections within a sensory sub-network have a center-surround structure: neurons with similar selectivity share excitatory connections although inhibition is broader (Figure 1A, inset; Kiyonaga and Egner, 2016Kiyonaga A. Egner T. Center-surround inhibition in working memory.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2017Kim S.S. Rouault H. Druckmann S. Jayaraman V. Ring attractor dynamics in the Drosophila central brain.Science. 2017; 356: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, recurrent excitation within each sub-network is too low to maintain memories alone. For simplicity, we first consider a network without connections between sensory sub-networks, although this constraint is relaxed in later models. The second layer is the “random network” (1,024 neurons, a four-fold compression from the sensory network). Neurons in this layer are randomly and reciprocally connected to neurons in the sensory network. Each neuron in the random network has bi-directional excitatory connections with a random subset of neurons in the sensory network (with likelihood γ; here, 0.35). Importantly, all sensory neurons converge onto the same random network. The connections between the sensory and random networks are balanced such that individual neurons receive an equal amount of excitatory and inhibitory drive (i.e., the summed input weight to each neuron from the other network is zero). To achieve this, all pairs of random and sensory neurons without excitatory connections have direct, weak, inhibitory connections (see STAR Methods for details). Such excitation-inhibition balance is consistent with neurophysiological findings (Vogels et al., 2011Vogels T.P. Sprekeler H. Zenke F. Clopath C. Gerstner W. Inhibitory plasticity balances excitation and inhibition in sensory pathways and memory networks.Science. 2011; 334: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, Vogels and Abbott, 2005Vogels T.P. Abbott L.F. Signal propagation and logic gating in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10786-10795Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Mariño et al., 2005Mariño J. Schummers J. Lyon D.C. Schwabe L. Beck O. Wiesing P. Obermayer K. Sur M. Invariant computations in local cortical networks with balanced excitation and inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Despite this simple architecture, the network is able to maintain stimulus inputs over extended memory delays (Figure 1B). This is due to the bi-directional and reciprocal connections between the sensory and random networks. Activity in the sensory network feeds forward into the random network, activating a random subset of neurons (Figure 1B, bottom). In turn, neurons from the random network feed back into the sensory network, maintaining activity after the stimulus input is removed (Figure 1B, top; sensory sub-networks 1–4). The reciprocal nature of the connections ensures the synaptic drive fed back into a sensory sub-network from the random network closely matches its own representation (Figure S1A). In this way, the network can flexibly maintain the representation of any input into the sensory network. Neurons from the random network project back to multiple sensory sub-networks. However, activity in the random network does not lead to spuriously sustained representations in other, unstimulated sensory sub-networks (Figure 1B; sub-networks 7 and 8). As feedback connections are random and balanced, they destructively interfere at other locations. In other words, the feedback input from the random network to other sensory sub-networks is orthogonal to their encoding space. Neurons in the sensory network show physiologically realistic tuning curves due to their center-surround architecture (Figures 2A and 2B ). This tuning is effectively inherited by the random network, although with greater complexity (Figures 2C and 2D), matching neurophysiological findings (Funahashi et al., 1989Funahashi S. Bruce C.J. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey’s dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar, Zaksas and Pasternak, 2006Zaksas D. Pasternak T.

Sharp emergence of feature-selective sustained activity along the dorsal visual pathway.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, as connectivity is random, the tuning of neurons in the random network is not consistent across inputs to different sensory networks (Figure 2E). This leads to neurons in the random network showing “linear conjunctive” coding (Figure 2F), preferring different input values for different sensory sub-networks (e.g., different colors at different locations) and responding to unique combinations of inputs into multiple sensory sub-networks. Such linear conjunctive representations are consistent with experimental observations in prefrontal cortex (Fusi et al., 2016Fusi S. Miller E.K. Rigotti M. Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Lindsay et al., 2017Lindsay G.W. Rigotti M. Warden M.R. Miller E.K. Fusi S. Hebbian learning in a random network captures selectivity properties of the prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 11021-11036Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Multiple memories can be stored in the network simultaneously (Figure 1B). For a few items (typically ≤3), memories do not significantly interfere—there is sufficient space in the high-dimensional random network for maintaining multiple patterns. However, as the number of sensory inputs is increased, interference in the random network also increases, eventually causing memory failures (Figure 1B; sub-networks 5 and 6). Figure 3A shows the percentage of correct memories at the end of the delay period as a function of load (i.e., number of items presented; see STAR Methods for details). This closely matches behavioral results in both humans and monkeys (Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J. Siegel M. Roy J.E. Miller E.K. Neural substrates of cognitive capacity limitations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11252-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Cowan, 2010Cowan N. The magical mystery four: how is working memory capacity limited, and why?.Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2010; 19: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Indeed, the decrease in performance with working memory load in the model was highly correlated with experiments (r = 0.97; p = 0.0054; to experimental data from Luck and Vogel, 1997Luck S.J. Vogel E.K. The capacity of visual working memory for features and conjunctions.Nature. 1997; 390: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (2848) Google Scholar; see STAR Methods for details). Also consistent with behavior, the speed of forgetting during the delay period increased with load (Figure 3B). As with all of our results, this is not due to tuning of network parameters; parameters were set to maximize the total number of items remembered across all loads, not to match any behavioral or electrophysiological results (see STAR Methods). Errors in working memory increased with the number of items held in memory (Figures 3C and S1B). Errors also accumulated more quickly at higher loads (Figure 3D). The increase in error was not just due to forgetting of inputs—even when an input was successfully maintained, memory error increased with memory load (Figures 3E and 3F). This is consistent with behavioral studies that have shown increases in memory error, even below working memory capacity limits (Rademaker et al., 2018Rademaker R.L. Park Y.E. Sack A.T. Tong F.

Rapid forgetting results from competition over time between items in visual working memory.J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem. Cogn. 2017; 43: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, the load-dependent decrease in memory accuracy was highly correlated between the model and experiments (r = 0.997; p = 0.00205; experimental data from Ma et al., 2014Ma W.J. Husain M. Bays P.M. Changing concepts of working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Together, these results show how our model bridges the gap between “discrete” models, where memories are completely forgotten, and “continuous” models, where interference between memories decreases their accuracy. To directly test the model’s ability to generalize across these results, we fit the model parameters to match either memory performance or memory accuracy (see STAR Methods for details). Models fit on one dataset generalized to capture the other dataset (Figures S1D and S1E; note, this is the only model fit directly to experimental data). Our model provides a simple mechanistic explanation for the limited capacity of working memory: it is due to interference in neural representations in the shared random network. This is a natural consequence of the convergent, random connectivity between the two non-linear networks; as multiple inputs are presented to the sensory networks, their representations interfere in the random network, disrupting maintenance. This is an unavoidable consequence of the convergence and does not depend on network parameters (as we show below). In this way, our model suggests capacity limits are a necessary trade-off for the flexibility of working memory. The model makes specific predictions about how neural activity should change as more items are held in working memory. First, increasing the number of stimulus inputs increases the overall average firing rate in the random network, saturating at the capacity limit of the network (∼3 or 4 items; Figure 4A). This is consistent with experimental observations of gross activity levels in prefrontal and parietal cortex; both blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and evoked potentials increase with working memory load, saturating at an individual’s capacity limit (Curtis and D’Esposito, 2003Curtis C.E. D’Esposito M. Persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex during working memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2003; 7: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2014Ma W.J. Husain M. Bays P.M. Changing concepts of working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Again, the model was highly correlated with experiments (r = 0.998; p = 1.97 × 10−6; experimental data from Ma et al., 2014Ma W.J. Husain M. Bays P.M. Changing concepts of working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Second, the model predicts maintaining multiple memories will reduce the response of selective neurons in the random network (Figure 4B). This is consistent with experimental observations, which have shown divisive-normalization-like regularization of mnemonic responses in single neurons and across the population (Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J. Siegel M. Roy J.E. Miller E.K. Neural substrates of cognitive capacity limitations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11252-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Sprague et al., 2014Sprague T.C. Ester E.F. Serences J.T. Reconstructions of information in visual spatial working memory degrade with memory load.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our model provides a potential circuit mechanism for such divisive-normalization-like regularization, suggesting it is the result of balanced excitation-inhibition between networks. The low fraction of connectivity (γ) and balanced excitation-inhibition means that a neuron in the random network that is selective for one stimulus is more likely to be inhibited than excited by a second stimulus (see STAR Methods). Thus, the response of selective neurons is reduced as items are added to memory (Figure 4B). This effect can be seen across the population. Figure 4C shows the relative response of neurons in the random network to two stimuli either presented separately (x axis) or together (y axis). As noted above, the overall average response increases when two stimuli are presented. However, the response to the pair of stimuli was not a summation of the response to each stimulus alone; rather, it was a sublinear mixture (slope is ∼0.50). This is consistent with electrophysiological results during perception (Reynolds et al., 1999Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Desimone R. Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1736-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with divisive normalization models that predict the response to two stimuli should be the average of the response to each stimulus alone (resulting in a slope of 0.5). Divisive normalization has been observed in many cognitive domains (Carandini and Heeger, 1994Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Summation and division by neurons in primate visual cortex.Science. 1994; 264: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Carandini and Heeger, 2011Carandini M. Heeger D.J.

Indeed, in working memory, divisive-normalization-like regularization may explain the observed decrease in stimulus information with memory load: it reduces selectivity, which reduces information (Figure 4D; Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J.

Reconstructions of information in visual spatial working memory degrade with memory load.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). More broadly, our model suggests excitation-inhibition balance within a convergent, non-linear network could be a circuit mechanism for implementing divisive normalization. Interference between memory representations also provides a simple mechanistic explanation for the reduced memory precision at higher memory loads (Ma et al., 2014Ma W.J. Husain M. Bays P.M. Changing concepts of working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, Bays and Husain, 2008Bays P.M. Husain M. Dynamic shifts of limited working memory resources in human vision.Science. 2008; 321: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In our model, memory representations drift over time, due to the accumulation of noise from Poisson variability in neural spiking (Burak and Fiete, 2012Burak Y. Fiete I.R. Fundamental limits on persistent activity in networks of noisy neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 17645-17650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The increased interference in the random network at higher memory loads leads to weaker feedback, reducing the representation in the sensory network. This reduction both allows noise to have a greater impact, causing an increase in drift (Figures 3C–3F), and impairs decoding of memory representations (Bays, 2014Bays P.M. Noise in neural populations accounts for errors in working memory.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 3632-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Bays, 2015Bays P.M. Spikes not slots: noise in neural populations limits working memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2015; 19: 431-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given the model’s prediction that interference impairs memory performance, reducing interference between memories should improve working memory performance and accuracy. Indeed, how much two stimulus representations overlapped in the random network strongly determined the ability to accurately maintain both memories. Figure 5A shows memory performance was impaired when two memories were less correlated, reflecting greater interference between the memories in the random network (see also Figure S1C). Conversely, more correlated memories were better remembered. Surprisingly, errors in memory accumulated over time in a way that reduced interference between memories (Figure 5B). Both of these predictions are testable hypotheses that could be addressed with future electrophysiology or imaging experiments. The model captures several more key electrophysiological findings related to working memory. First, we observe persistent mnemonic activity, consistent with electrophysiological results in both monkeys and humans (Funahashi et al., 1989Funahashi S. Bruce C.J. Goldman-Rakic P.S.

GPI-APs form nanoclusters generated by cortical acto-myosin activity. While our understanding of the physical principles governing this process is emerging, the molecular machinery and functional relevance of GPI-AP nanoclustering are unknown. Here, we first show that a membrane receptor signaling pathway directs nanocluster formation. Arg-Gly-Asp motif-containing ligands bound to the β1-integrin receptor activate src and focal adhesion kinases, resulting in RhoA signaling. This cascade triggers actin-nucleation via specific formins, which, along with myosin activity, drive the nanoclustering of membrane proteins with actin-binding domains. Concurrently, talin-mediated activation of the mechano-transducer vinculin is required for the coupling of the acto-myosin machinery to inner-leaflet lipids, thereby generating GPI-AP nanoclusters. Second, we show that these nanoclusters are functional; disruption of their formation either in GPI-anchor remodeling mutants or in vinculin mutants impairs cell spreading and migration, hallmarks of integrin function."

To investigate which subpopulation of OT neurons contributes to this effect, we developed a novel method: virus-delivered genetic activity-induced tagging of cell ensembles (vGATE). With the vGATE method, we identified and permanently tagged a small subpopulation of OT cells, which, by optogenetic stimulation, strongly attenuated contextual fear-induced freezing, and pharmacogenetic silencing of tagged OT neurons impaired context-specific fear extinction, demonstrating that the tagged OT neurons are sufficient and necessary, respectively, to control contextual fear. Intriguingly, OT cell terminals of fear-experienced rats displayed enhanced glutamate release in the amygdala. Furthermore, rats exposed to another round of fear conditioning displayed 5-fold more activated magnocellular OT neurons in a novel environment than a familiar one, possibly for a generalized fear response.

RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is responsible for transcription of all protein-coding genes and a number of non-coding RNAs. Whereas much work has focused on transcriptional initiation and its regulation, it is becoming increasingly clear that regulation of post-initiation events is crucial for gene expression as well. For example, co-transcriptional mRNA processing and the transition from elongating to terminating RNAPII, in particular, have emerged as significant points of regulation that still remain poorly understood (Proudfoot, 2016Proudfoot N.J. Transcriptional termination in mammals: Stopping the RNA polymerase II juggernaut.Science. 2016; 352: aad9926Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Looking to other branches of the evolutionary tree, it is clear that gene expression can be potently regulated via transcript termination. For example, the N protein of bacteriophage λ activates the lytic phase of phage development by suppressing the activity of transcriptional terminators that otherwise prevent phage protein synthesis in infected Escherichia coli cells. Anti-terminator proteins are encoded by the E. coli genome itself as well (Santangelo and Artsimovitch, 2011Santangelo T.J. Artsimovitch I. Termination and antitermination: RNA polymerase runs a stop sign.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, whereas the site of transcript termination in prokaryotes is determined by where RNAP disengages, the process consists of two coupled events in eukaryotes: cleavage and polyadenylation of the mRNA transcript, followed by RNAPII disassociation from the DNA template (i.e., transcriptional termination), which typically takes place a few kilobases downstream of the polyadenylation (polyA) site in mammalian cells. In eukaryotes, the 3′ end of the mRNA transcripts is thus dictated by the site of transcript cleavage, not by where RNAPII terminates transcription. Two, not necessarily mutually exclusive, models exist to describe RNAPII termination in eukaryotes. In the torpedo model, cleavage of the nascent transcript provides an entry point for the exonuclease XRN2 to degrade RNA attached to RNAPII from the 5′ end, which facilitates termination once it catches up with RNAPII (Connelly and Manley, 1988Connelly S.

Transcriptional termination in mammals: Stopping the RNA polymerase II juggernaut.Science. 2016; 352: aad9926Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Alternatively, or additionally, the allosteric model posits that transcription through a functional polyA site brings about a conformational change in the RNAPII elongation complex, making it termination competent, which helps explains why transcript cleavage it not strictly required for termination in vitro (Edwalds-Gilbert et al., 1993Edwalds-Gilbert G.

Cell. 2015; 59: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A common feature of both models is the recognition of polyA sites by the RNAPII complex as a prerequisite for termination. Correct polyA site selection thus ensures correct maturation of the final mRNA transcript and plays a decisive role in determining the expression of a plethora of mRNA isoforms across the human genome. Intriguingly, the majority of human genes also express alternative, short mRNA isoforms, often of doubtful functional relevance (Zerbino et al., 2018Zerbino D.R. Achuthan P. Akanni W. Amode M.R. Barrell D. Bhai J. Billis K. Cummins C. Gall A. Girón C.G. et al.Ensembl 2018.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D754-D761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been estimated that close to 70% of human genes utilize more than one polyA site, resulting in transcripts with varying coding or regulatory capacity or both (Derti et al., 2012Derti A. Garrett-Engele P. Macisaac K.D. Stevens R.C. Sriram S. Chen R. Rohl C.A. Johnson J.M. Babak T. A quantitative atlas of polyadenylation in five mammals.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Because unwanted, early polyA site selection can have deleterious effects, aberrant transcripts originating from cryptic polyA sites must be suppressed through transcriptional quality-control mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Selection of cryptic, early polyA sites resulting in prematurely terminated mRNAs have been linked to disease (Elkon et al., 2013Elkon R. Ugalde A.P. Agami R. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation: extent, regulation and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and recently it was shown that widespread use of intronic polyA (IpA) sites in leukemia results in the expression of truncated proteins lacking the tumor-suppressive functions of the corresponding full-length proteins (Lee et al., 2018Lee S.H. Singh I. Tisdale S. Abdel-Wahab O. Leslie C.S. Mayr C. Widespread intronic polyadenylation inactivates tumour suppressor genes in leukaemia.Nature. 2018; 561: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Considering that higher eukaryotes often possess multiple polyA sites per gene, it would seem an obvious advantage to have evolved anti-termination factors to specifically regulate the usage of early polyA sites, but no candidate protein(s) for this critical role has so far been identified. In eukaryotes, most mRNA-processing events are coupled to transcription through the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) on the largest subunit of RNAPII, RPB1/POLR2A, which carries the consensus sequence Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 (52 repeats in humans, and 26 in yeast) (Buratowski, 2009Buratowski S.

The RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) code.Chem. Rev. 2013; 113: 8456-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation pattern of the CTD changes dynamically during the transcription cycle to facilitate, or hinder, the recruitment of RNAPII co-factors, including numerous RNA-binding proteins that control the maturation of transcripts (Corden, 2013Corden J.L.

Notes. 2015; 8: 616Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Understanding the coupling between CTD phosphorylation and co-transcriptional mRNA processing remains a major challenge. We sought to shed new light on co-transcriptional processes by focusing on the human SCAF4 and SCAF8 proteins. These proteins were initially discovered among a group of SR (serine-arginine rich), CTD-associated factors (SCAFs) uncovered in a yeast-two-hybrid screen for mammalian proteins that interact with the CTD of RNAPII (Yuryev et al., 1996Yuryev A.

USA. 1996; 93: 6975-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, to date their molecular function remains largely unknown. The most closely related yeast orthologs of SCAF4 and SCAF8 are Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nrd1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Seb1. Whereas Nrd1 preferentially binds RNAPII via CTD Ser5P and regulates transcriptional termination of non-polyadenylated transcripts as part of the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 complex (Arigo et al., 2006Arigo J.T.

We used a multi-omic, genome-wide approach to investigate the function of SCAF4 and SCAF8 in human cells. Our data indicate that, while SCAF4 and SCAF8 have evolved interesting and important individual functions, their redundant, essential function appears to be as mRNA anti-terminators that suppress the use of early alternative polyA sites and thereby the accumulation of non-functional, truncated proteins. SCAF4 and SCAF8 likely arose via a gene duplication that occurred in vertebrates (Zerbino et al., 2018Zerbino D.R. Achuthan P. Akanni W. Amode M.R. Barrell D. Bhai J. Billis K. Cummins C. Gall A. Girón C.G. et al.Ensembl 2018.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D754-D761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The encoded proteins have significant sequence homology (38% identity and 50% similarity), and both contain a CTD-interaction domain (CID), characteristic of termination factors such as their orthologs in yeast, Nrd1 and Seb1, and termination factor PCF11 (Figures 1A and S1A–S1C). To study the function of SCAF4 and SCAF8, we used CRISPR technology to generate single SCAF4 KO (4KO), single SCAF8 KO (8KO), as well as double-knockout (dKO) cell lines, which also contained a single copy of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible SCAF4 or SCAF8 rescue construct, with the encoded GFP-tagged protein expressed at near-endogenous levels (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1D). Cell lines were maintained in the presence of Dox to ensure expression of the CRISPR-resistant rescue gene during and after KO cell line generation. Removal of Dox resulted in the loss of the rescue protein: at days 3–5, SCAF4 or SCAF8 were undetectable (Figures 1C and S1D). At this time, the KOs did not exhibit any signs of stress, as indicated by normal cell-cycle profiles, and absence of DNA damage and apoptotic markers (data not shown). However, while the single KOs maintained normal proliferation rates, the SCAF4 SCAF8 dKOs failed to proliferate (Figures S1E and S1F). Notably, dKO cells did not grow when seeded as single cells for colony formation (Figures 1D and 1E). Lethality could be rescued by the expression of either SCAF4 or SCAF8, suggesting that the encoded proteins share a common, essential function.Figure S1SCAF4 and SCAF8 Are Highly Similar, Functionally Redundant Proteins Containing a CID Also Found in Known Termination Factors, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Alignment of SCAF4 and SCAF8 protein sequences showing identical and conserved residues below.

Error bars represent ± SD. SCAF4 and SCAF8 are exclusively nuclear (Figure 1F), and immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments indicated that they both associate only with the transcriptionally engaged, hyper-phosphorylated form of RNAPII (Figures 2A and S2A). We thus detected Ser2P-, Ser5P-, Ser7P-, Thr4P-, and Tyr1P-modified RNAPII associated with SCAF4 and SCAF8 (Figure S2B). To investigate the potential direct recognition of phosphorylated CTD repeats, we examined binding of the SCAF proteins to chemically phosphorylated CTD peptides in vitro (Figure 2B). Purified, full-length SCAF proteins bound only to phosphorylated CTD peptides, with a very strong preference for peptides carrying Ser2-Ser5 double-phosphorylation and markedly less binding to peptides phosphorylated only at Ser2. Importantly, double-phosphorylation at Tyr1 and Ser2 markedly reduced binding relative to Ser2 phosphorylation alone (Figure 2B), suggesting that the strong preference for Ser2-Ser5 bi-phosphorylation is position specific and not simply due to the increased negative charge of double-phosphorylated repeats. Ser5P RNAPII is generally enriched in the beginning of genes, whereas Ser2P RNAPII levels increase through the gene and peak around the termination site (Hintermair et al., 2012Hintermair C.

Although SCAF4 and SCAF8 recognize the same form of the RNAPII CTD, we never detected SCAF4 in SCAF8 IPs, or vice versa, indicating that they cannot bind the same RNAPII complex (Figures 2A and S2A), and opening the possibility that they might both functionally compete and complement each other. Purification indicated that SCAF4 and SCAF8 are not part of stable complexes with other subunits (Figures S2C and S2D). To identify interaction partners, we used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze FLAG-SCAF IPs derived from solubilized chromatin (Figure S3A). The strongest interactor for both SCAF4 and SCAF8 was RNAPII (Figures S3B and S3C). In addition, we identified subunits from the PAF complex, the RPRD1-RPAP2 complex involved in Ser5P dephosphorylation (Ni et al., 2014Ni Z. Xu C. Guo X. Hunter G.O. Kuznetsova O.V. Tempel W. Marcon E. Zhong G. Guo H. Kuo W.W. et al.RPRD1A and RPRD1B are human RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain scaffolds for Ser5 dephosphorylation.Nat. Struct. Mol.

We note that while SCAF4 and SCAF8 failed to interact with each other, the CTD-associated SCAF1 and SCAF11 proteins were consistently found as interactors of both factors, presumably through a common interaction with RNAPII, opening the possibility that more than one SCAF protein (but not SCAF4 and SCAF8) can bind RNAPII at the same time, and suggesting that SCAF4 and SCAF8 might compete for the same binding surface on the body of RNAPII (see Discussion for details). Interestingly, we failed to detect SETX (human ortholog of S. cerevisiae Sen1) and components of the RNA exosome (Table S1), which interact with the SCAF4/8 ortholog Nrd1 in budding yeast (Vasiljeva and Buratowski, 2006Vasiljeva L. Buratowski S. Nrd1 interacts with the nuclear exosome for 3′ processing of RNA polymerase II transcripts.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Taken together, these interactomes support the idea that SCAF4 and SCAF8 are associated with RNAPII elongation complexes. Interestingly, the SCAF4/SCAF8 interactors also included 3′ end-processing factors, detected most prominently in SCAF4 IPs, suggesting that the SCAFs might also associate with terminating RNAPII (Figures 2C–2E and S3C). These processing factors included members of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, CPSF1, CPSF2, CPSF3, and WDR33. Western blot analysis confirmed these interactions (Figures 2E and S2B). In order to examine the effect of SCAF4 and SCAF8 on gene expression, we used the KO cell lines and a wide variety of genome-wide techniques (Figure 3A). Due to the manner in which these cell lines were generated (see Figures 1B, S3D, and S3E), a total of 12 cell types (6 different cell lines grown with or without Dox) were often analyzed together. For example, dKOs were generated either by first knocking out SCAF4 and then SCAF8, or vice versa, and these different cell lines were in turn derived from cell lines containing either a Dox-inducible SCAF4 or a SCAF8 rescue gene, giving rise to a total of 4 genotypically identical SCAF4 SCAF8 dKO cell lines (Figures S3D and S3E). Moreover, a dKO that expresses a rescue gene (i.e., grown in the presence of Dox) is effectively a single KO; for example, a dKO expressing the SCAF4 rescue gene is genotypically and phenotypically a SCAF8 single KO cell line (See Figures 1D and S3D–S3F). To monitor nascent transcription, we used a short pulse of 4-thiouridine (4SU) to label newly synthesized transcripts (Figure S4A). To obtain high-resolution profiles, an RNA fragmentation step was employed, similar to in transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) (Schwalb et al., 2016Schwalb B. Michel M. Zacher B. Frühauf K. Demel C. Tresch A. Gagneur J. Cramer P. TT-seq maps the human transient transcriptome.Science. 2016; 352: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Figure S4A). Although our protocol uses a different fragmentation method, we will refer to it as TT-seq for simplicity. This approach gave rise to high-quality data sets for which principal component analysis showed that most of the variation between samples from the 12 different conditions was indeed explained by “genotypic” status (Figure S4B). For simplicity, we thus merged experiments based on their genotype (e.g., data for SCAF4 KO were derived from SCAF4 KO, dKO1/GFP-SCAF8, and dKO2/GFP-SCAF8 together). Metagene analysis of sense and anti-sense transcription for protein-encoding genes showed remarkably similar profiles overall (Figure 3B). Importantly, we did not observe an increase in divergent, anti-sense transcription originating near the transcription start site (TSS) of protein-encoding genes (Figures 3B and S4C), and we also failed to detect differences in either sense or anti-sense transcription for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (Figure S4D). These results suggest that, in contrast to Nrd1 in S. cerevisiae, SCAF4 and SCAF8 do not serve to restrict anti-sense transcription or terminate snRNA or snoRNA genes in human cells. Interestingly, for a subset of genes, an increase in nascent transcripts up to 50–100 kb downstream of the transcription end site (TES) was detected, specifically in the SCAF4 KO (Figures 3C–3G, S4E, and S4F). The termination window downstream of the TES has a median length of ∼3,500 bp in human cells (Schwalb et al., 2016Schwalb B. Michel M. Zacher B. Frühauf K. Demel C. Tresch A. Gagneur J. Cramer P. TT-seq maps the human transient transcriptome.Science. 2016; 352: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), suggesting that RNAPII in SCAF4 KO cells continue transcription beyond normal termination sites, also known as transcriptional readthrough (Rutkowski et al., 2015Rutkowski A.J. Erhard F. L’Hernault A. Bonfert T. Schilhabel M. Crump C. Rosenstiel P. Efstathiou S. Zimmer R. Friedel C.C. Dölken L. Widespread disruption of host transcription termination in HSV-1 infection.Nat.

Indeed, most of the variance in the TT-seq data was observed between this KO (which had increased RNA levels downstream of canonical termination windows) and the remaining cell types (which did not) (Figures S4B and S4G). Many genes (n = 1,281) displayed ≥1.5-fold increase in nascent RNA in a 50 kb region downstream of the TES (Table S2). Importantly, we did not detect elevated transcript levels in the SCAF4 SCAF8 dKOs (Figures 3C–3E and 3G), indicating that terminator readthrough is unlikely to cause lethality in the dKOs and also showing that such readthrough depends on SCAF8. Although other explanations cannot be ruled out, these results agree with a model in which SCAF4 and SCAF8 compete for the same RNAPII complex: in the absence of SCAF4, SCAF8 may thus freely associ"
https://openalex.org/W2946404578,"Spinal transmission of pruritoceptive (itch) signals requires transneuronal signaling by gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) produced by a subpopulation of dorsal horn excitatory interneurons. These neurons also express the glutamatergic marker vGluT2, raising the question of why glutamate alone is insufficient for spinal itch relay. Using optogenetics together with slice electrophysiology and mouse behavior, we demonstrate that baseline synaptic coupling between GRP and GRP receptor (GRPR) neurons is too weak for suprathreshold excitation. Only when we mimicked the endogenous firing of GRP neurons and stimulated them repetitively to fire bursts of action potentials did GRPR neurons depolarize progressively and become excitable by GRP neurons. GRPR but not glutamate receptor antagonism prevented this action. Provoking itch-like behavior by optogenetic activation of spinal GRP neurons required similar stimulation paradigms. These results establish a spinal gating mechanism for itch that requires sustained repetitive activity of presynaptic GRP neurons and postsynaptic GRP signaling to drive GRPR neuron output."
https://openalex.org/W2945691382,"DNA N6-adenine methylation (6mA) has recently been described in diverse eukaryotes, spanning unicellular organisms to metazoa. Here, we report a DNA 6mA methyltransferase complex in ciliates, termed MTA1c. It consists of two MT-A70 proteins and two homeobox-like DNA-binding proteins and specifically methylates dsDNA. Disruption of the catalytic subunit, MTA1, in the ciliate Oxytricha leads to genome-wide loss of 6mA and abolishment of the consensus ApT dimethylated motif. Mutants fail to complete the sexual cycle, which normally coincides with peak MTA1 expression. We investigate the impact of 6mA on nucleosome occupancy in vitro by reconstructing complete, full-length Oxytricha chromosomes harboring 6mA in native or ectopic positions. We show that 6mA directly disfavors nucleosomes in vitro in a local, quantitative manner, independent of DNA sequence. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler ACF can overcome this effect. Our study identifies a diverged DNA N6-adenine methyltransferase and defines the role of 6mA in chromatin organization."

Taken together, our findings provide a molecular and cellular basis for adrenal sex dimorphism that may contribute to the increased incidence of adrenal diseases in females. Tissue renewal is an essential process that ensures continued organ function in the aging organism. Dramatic progress toward an understanding of tissue homeostasis in many tissues has been made. By contrast, little is known about the extent to which the adrenal cortex renews, despite the fact that it represents one of the main sites of steroid synthesis in the mammalian organism. Adrenals are composed of a neural crest-derived medulla and the adrenal cortex, which originates from the intermediate mesoderm. The development of the adrenal cortex commences with an adrenal primordium around embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) in mice (for a review, see Bandiera et al., 2015Bandiera R. Sacco S. Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Schedl A. Steroidogenic organ development and homeostasis: A WT1-centric view.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2015; 408: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SHH, released from this primordium, induces recruitment of surrounding Gli1+ mesenchymal cells to the steroidogenic lineage (King et al., 2009King P. Paul A. Laufer E. Shh signaling regulates adrenocortical development and identifies progenitors of steroidogenic lineages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21185-21190Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Lerario et al., 2017Lerario A.M. Finco I. LaPensee C. Hammer G.D. Molecular Mechanisms of Stem/Progenitor Cell Maintenance in the Adrenal Cortex.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2017; 8: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When formed, the adult cortex adopts its zonated organization, with the zona glomerulosa (zG), zona fasciculata (zF), and zona reticularis (zR) producing mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens, respectively. Mice lack the zR, but instead have an X zone that represents a developmental remnant, disappearing at puberty in males and during first pregnancy in females. Recent studies have demonstrated that zonation depends on the antagonistic action of β-catenin and PKA signaling (Drelon et al., 2016Drelon C. Berthon A. Sahut-Barnola I. Mathieu M. Dumontet T. Rodriguez S. Batisse-Lignier M. Tabbal H. Tauveron I. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. et al.PKA inhibits WNT signalling in adrenal cortex zonation and prevents malignant tumour development.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12751Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RSPO3, a signaling molecule released from the mesenchymal adrenal capsule, activates β-catenin in sub-capsular steroidogenic cells, conferring the zG fate (Vidal et al., 2016Vidal V. Sacco S. Rocha A.S. da Silva F. Panzolini C. Dumontet T. Doan T.M. Shan J. Rak-Raszewska A. Bird T. et al.The adrenal capsule is a signaling center controlling cell renewal and zonation through Rspo3.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Steroidogenic cells situated closer to the medullary position do not receive R-spondin and WNT signals and adopt the zF fate (Figure 1A). Several reports suggested continuous turnover of the adrenal cortex, with steroidogenic cells being born in the outer cortex, followed by centripetal migration and stereotypic apoptosis when they reach the cortico-medullary boundary (Chang et al., 2013Chang S.P.

However, the vast majority of studies have been restricted to males, and differences or similitudes in adult tissue turnover between the two sexes remain unknown. This is surprising given the well-established sexual dimorphism in the adrenal gland. Indeed, female adrenals in mice are larger, which has been attributed to an increased zF resulting from differential growth after puberty (Bielohuby et al., 2007Bielohuby M. Herbach N. Wanke R.

Most importantly, adrenal pathologies, including Cushing syndrome (Steffensen et al., 2010Steffensen C. Bak A.M. Rubeck K.Z. Jørgensen J.O.

Pellegriti G. Prognostic Factors for Adrenocortical Carcinoma Outcomes.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2016; 7: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Despite these striking differences, the cellular basis of this sex bias remains largely unknown. Here we addressed the cellular dynamics of adrenal tissue homeostasis in both sexes. We show that the adult adrenal cortex is subject to rapid and sex-specific turnover that results in complete replacement of the steroidogenic tissue every 3 months in females. We further show that, although renewal in male adrenals is primarily driven by proliferation of cells situated in the zG, female adrenals also recruit mesenchymal cells from the capsule. Both proliferation and stem cell recruitment are suppressed by male hormones, providing a molecular explanation for the sex-specific activity. To address whether adrenal sex differences may be reflected in tissue renewal, we first used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling (2-day pulse) (Figure 1B) in fully matured (12 weeks of age) mice and quantified proliferation rates in different adrenal compartments. BrdU-labeled steroidogenic cells were predominantly observed in the zG and the outer zone of the zF, whereas deeper zones were devoid of proliferation (FigureS1A), consistent with a previous report (Chang et al., 2013Chang S.P. Morrison H.D. Nilsson F. Kenyon C.J. West J.D. Morley S.D. Cell proliferation, movement and differentiation during maintenance of the adult mouse adrenal cortex.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e81865Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Overall, females showed a 6.3-fold (p = 0.007) higher proliferation rate in steroidogenic cells compared with males (Figure 1B; Figure S1A). Differences were particularly striking in the outer zF, where we observed a 15-fold higher number of proliferating cells in females (p < 0.0001; Figure 1B). The much higher proliferation rate in females was surprising because organ size is maintained throughout adult life in both sexes. We therefore speculated that the high level of proliferation in females may be counter-balanced by increased apoptosis. Indeed, quantification revealed a 2.0-fold (p = 0.038) higher number of caspase-3 positive cells at the juxtamedullary boundary (Figure 1C; Figure S1B), ensuring maintenance of tissue size. To gain insights into the cellular dynamics of adrenal cortex homeostasis, we next performed lineage-tracing experiments using tamoxifen-inducible Cre lines to activate GFP expression (mTmG) (Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar) in different cellular compartments. Axin2 and Wnt4 are two β-catenin (CTNNB1) downstream targets, and tamoxifen activation with Axin2-CreERT2 (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) or Wnt4-CreERT2 driver lines (Kobayashi et al., 2008Kobayashi A. Valerius M.T. Mugford J.W. Carroll T.J. Self M. Oliver G. McMahon A.P. Six2 defines and regulates a multipotent self-renewing nephron progenitor population throughout mammalian kidney development.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) resulted in GFP labeling of zG cells in both sexes 2 days after induction (Figure 1D; Figures S1C and S1D). Over time, the number of GFP-labeled cells increased, and in females, the entire cortex was replaced by 3 months after induction (Figure 1D). Quantification of GFP-labeled cells using the Wnt4-CreERT2 line revealed that renewal was considerably slower in males (Figure 1E; Figure S1E), and only 41.8% and 74.6% of cells were replaced after 3 and 6 months, respectively, despite the fact that males exhibit a significantly thinner cortex compared with females (Bielohuby et al., 2007Bielohuby M. Herbach N. Wanke R. Maser-Gluth C. Beuschlein F. Wolf E. Hoeflich A. Growth analysis of the mouse adrenal gland from weaning to adulthood: time- and gender-dependent alterations of cell size and number in the cortical compartment.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E139-E146Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A higher index of proliferation in females was not limited to steroidogenic cells but was also detected in NR2F2+ capsular cells (4-fold, p = 0.0016; Figure 2A; Figure S2A). Because capsular cells are essential for initial formation of the adult adrenal cortex (King et al., 2009King P. Paul A. Laufer E. Shh signaling regulates adrenocortical development and identifies progenitors of steroidogenic lineages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21185-21190Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we wondered whether this population may also contribute to sex-specific adrenal cell renewal. Lineage-tracing experiments using the Gli1-CreERT2 strain (Ahn and Joyner, 2004Ahn S. Joyner A.L. Dynamic changes in the response of cells to positive hedgehog signaling during mouse limb patterning.Cell. 2004; 118: 505-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) in 3-week-old animals (1-month chase) revealed recruitment of capsular cells to the steroidogenic lineage in both sexes (Figures S2B and S2C). By 6 weeks after birth, however, this contribution had almost entirely ceased in males (Figure S2B), and only occasional GFP+ steroidogenic cells were detected in adults, even after long-term labeling (Figure 2B). In contrast, induction in adult females (12 weeks) resulted in recruitment of GFP-labeled steroidogenic (zG and zF) cells as early as 1 week after induction (Figure 2B; Figure S2D). After 1 month, the number of capsule-derived steroidogenic cells was 16.1-fold higher in females than in males (Figure 2C; Figure S2B; p = 0,013). Upon reaching the zF, a proportion of GFP+ cells proliferated further (Figure 2D; Figure S2E). Taken together, these data show that, although cell turnover in adult males relies on progenitors located within the zG, in females, capsular stem cells proliferate continuously and contribute significantly to tissue renewal. The GFP label was maintained in the capsule over the entire period analyzed (6 months), indicating continuous self-renewal of this compartment (Figure S2F). To assess whether the observed sexual dimorphism is sex-chromosome-dependent, we employed Sf1-Cre; Sox9fl/fl XY (Lavery et al., 2012Lavery R. Chassot A.A. Pauper E. Gregoire E.P. Klopfenstein M. de Rooij D.G. Mark M. Schedl A. Ghyselinck N.B. Chaboissier M.C. Testicular differentiation occurs in absence of R-spondin1 and Sox9 in mouse sex reversals.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003170Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Tg(Wt1:Sox9) XX (Vidal et al., 2001Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. de Rooij D.G. Schedl A. Sox9 induces testis development in XX transgenic mice.Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) mice, two genetic models that present sex reversal phenotypes and develop as XY females and XX males, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B ). Morphological and histological analysis revealed that Tg(Wt1-Sox9) XX males developed adrenals that lacked the X zone and resembled wild-type male organs in both weight and histology (Figures S3A and S3B). Analogously, XY females (Sf1-Cre; Sox9fl/fl XY) had significantly larger adrenals than male controls and displayed the X zone, resembling control females (Figures S3C and S3D). Quantification of BrdU incorporation in the capsular compartment revealed a significant increase in proliferation in XY females (Figure 3A; p = 0.0024) and a decrease in XX males (Figure 3B; p = 0.0006) compared with control males and females, respectively. Strikingly, lineage-tracing analysis of Gli1+ cells on a Tg(Wt1-Sox9) transgenic background (induction at 12 weeks, 1-month chase) showed that GFP+ cells in XX males remained restricted to the capsule, a pattern resembling XY males rather than XX females (Figure 3C, D; p = 0.0051). The above sex reversal analysis suggested that sex-specific proliferation and recruitment do not depend on sex chromosomes but, rather, are controlled by hormones. To confirm this hypothesis, we gonadectomized 10-week-old Gli1-CreERT2;mTmG males and females, induced GFP expression by tamoxifen treatment 2 weeks later, and analyzed the adrenal glands after a 4-week chase (Figure 4A). Consistent with a previous report (Hershkovitz et al., 2007Hershkovitz L. Beuschlein F. Klammer S. Krup M. Weinstein Y. Adrenal 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the mouse catabolizes progesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone and is restricted to the X-zone.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 976-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), bilateral orchiectomy induced a secondary X zone (20αHSD+) at the juxto-medullary boundary (Figure S4A). Proliferation and cell recruitment of capsular cells were unaffected in adrenals in females that had undergone ovariectomy (Figures 4A–4C), suggesting that ovarian hormones, such as estrogens and progesterone, do not significantly influence adrenal cell renewal. By contrast, orchiectomized males showed a 3.5-fold increase in the proliferative index compared with sham males (Figure 4A; p < 0.0001). Similarly, recruitment of capsular cells to the steroidogenic lineage was 3 times higher after testis removal than in sham males (Figures 4B and 4C; p = 0.0012), suggesting that the reduction in androgens permitted activation of this stem cell compartment. To further assess the contribution of androgens to sex-specific differences in adrenal homeostasis, we performed ovariectomy of Gli1-CreERT2;mTmG females at 8 weeks of age and treated them for 6 consecutive weeks with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the primary androgen produced by testes (Figure 4D). As reported previously (Hershkovitz et al., 2007Hershkovitz L. Beuschlein F. Klammer S. Krup M. Weinstein Y. Adrenal 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the mouse catabolizes progesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone and is restricted to the X-zone.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 976-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), DHT administration induced X zone regression (Figure S4B), demonstrating successful treatment. BrdU labeling revealed a significant reduction in capsular cell proliferation 3.2-fold compared with controls (Figure 4D; p < 0.0001). Importantly, the recruitment of Gli1+ capsular cells was almost entirely suppressed (81-fold decrease; Figures 4E and S4C; p = 0.0002). Moreover, DHT treatment of pregnant females (E14.5 onward) also strongly inhibited capsular cell recruitment during adrenal development (26.7-fold; p < 0.0001; Figures S4D–S4F). We conclude that androgens negatively affect proliferation and capsular cell recruitment. Studying tissue homeostasis is an important objective when considering aging, responses to tissue damage, and its links to cancer. Previous studies have suggested that the adrenal cortex is undergoing active cell replacement, but the degree of tissue turnover and a potential effect of sex on this process remained poorly characterized. Here we performed an in-depth analysis of tissue dynamics in the adult adrenal cortex and demonstrate that this tissue is subject to an unexpectedly high level of cell renewal that leads to complete replacement of the steroidogenic compartment every few months. The directed proliferation in the outer cortex, centripetal migration of cells, and stereotypic apoptosis at the cortico-medullary boundary suggest an organ-intrinsic requirement for this rapid turnover. Because steroid hormone synthesis generates reactive oxygen substrates (ROS) as by-products (Prasad and Dhar, 2014Prasad K. Dhar I. Oxidative stress as a mechanism of added sugar-induced cardiovascular disease.Int. J. Angiol. 2014; 23: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Zangar et al., 2004Zangar R. Davydov D.R. Verma S. Mechanisms that regulate production of reactive oxygen species by cytochrome P450.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 199: 316-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we can speculate that the active tissue renewal has been adopted to avoid accumulation of damage in steroid-producing cells. Future experiments are needed to address this hypothesis. Even more surprising than the rapid turnover of the adrenal cortex are the dramatic differences observed in stem cell dynamics between males and females. A recent paper by Dumontet et al., 2018Dumontet T. Sahut-Barnola I. Septier A. Montanier N. Plotton I. Roucher-Boulez F. Ducros V. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Pointud J.C. Zubair M. et al.PKA signaling drives reticularis differentiation and sexually dimorphic adrenal cortex renewal.JCI Insight. 2018; 3: 98394Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar reported sex differences in the migration of adrenal steroidogenic cells in the postnatal period, but their experimental setup (a constitutive Cre line) did not allow them to analyze tissue turnover in adults. Our study now demonstrates that a striking sex difference in tissue renewal persists throughout life. Although we did not perform lineage tracing beyond 6 months, by extrapolating from our data we estimate that the male adrenal cortex appears to be replaced every 9 months, which is in stark contrast to the rapid turnover of 3 months in females. In addition to the differences in proliferation, our study demonstrates that females, but not males, continuously recruit capsular stem cells to the steroidogenic cell lineage. Why females require this high level of tissue turnover and the need for continuous recruitment of capsular cells is presently unknown, but we can assume a physiological reason for this dimorphism. In this respect, it will be interesting to determine whether the recruited cells are distinct in terms of transcriptional signature and/or hormone production. Apart from organs involved in reproduction (including the mammary gland), stem cell activity is usually not considered to be sex-specific. However, a recent study in Drosophila reported differences in gut stem cell proliferation that appears to be under control of the chromosomal sex determination system (Hudry et al., 2016Hudry B. Khadayate S. Miguel-Aliaga I. The sexual identity of adult intestinal stem cells controls organ size and plasticity.Nature. 2016; 530: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the stem cell dimorphism reported here involves hormonal control. The fact that orchiectomy rather than ovariectomy influenced proliferation and stem cell recruitment suggests that androgens rather than female hormones regulate adrenal cortex turnover. In line with this hypothesis, hormone treatment with DHT suppressed proliferation and capsular stem cell recruitment in ovariectomized females. Testosterone has been shown previously to affect proliferation of human mesenchymal stem and endothelial progenitor cells, at least in vitro, although this study described a pro-proliferative action (Corotchi et al., 2016Corotchi M.C. Popa M.A. Simionescu M. Testosterone stimulates proliferation and preserves stemness of human adult mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells.Rom. J. Morphol. Embryol. 2016; 57: 75-80PubMed Google Scholar). That androgens can influence adrenal gene expression and the phenotype in a mouse model for Cushing syndrome has been reported recently (Dumontet et al., 2018Dumontet T. Sahut-Barnola I. Septier A. Montanier N. Plotton I. Roucher-Boulez F. Ducros V. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Pointud J.C. Zubair M. et al.PKA signaling drives reticularis differentiation and sexually dimorphic adrenal cortex renewal.JCI Insight. 2018; 3: 98394Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it will now be important to determine how transcriptional changes translate into altered stem cell activity. It is tempting to speculate that the dramatic differences in adrenal stem cell activity of the opposite sex are linked to the much higher prevalence of adrenal diseases in women. Indeed, the significantly higher proliferation rate observed in females is expected to cause an accumulation of mutations and increase the risk of developing cancer. Future research will need to focus on how these differences translate into sex-specific diseases, which, in the long run, may pave the way for development of sex-specific treatment options. Because sexual dimorphism on the histological, molecular, and phenotypic levels is not restricted to the adrenal gland (Karp et al., 2017Karp N.A. Mason J. Beaudet A.L. Benjamini Y. Bower L. Braun R.E. Brown S.D.M. Chesler E.J. Dickinson M.E. Flenniken A.M. et al.International Mouse Phenotyping ConsortiumPrevalence of sexual dimorphism in mammalian phenotypic traits.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15475Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it is likely that sex-specific stem cell activity may also occur in other organ systems. Surprisingly, research in many fields, but in particular in endocrinology, is often limited to one sex (often male) to avoid recurring physiological changes because of changes in hormones in the menstrual cycle (Beery and Zucker, 2011Beery A.K. Zucker I. Sex bias in neuroscience and biomedical research.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2011; 35: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, Yoon et al., 2014Yoon D.Y. Mansukhani N.A.

Our data highlight the profound differences sex hormones have in tissues and underline the importance of analyzing phenotypes and basic molecular processes in both sexes.

If not otherwise stated, all lines were maintained and bred on mixed genetic background. Male and female mice were equally used and littermates were preferentially chosen for experimental group. Unless specifically stated, all experiments were conducted at 12 weeks of age. For proliferation quantification in the adrenal capsule and cortex, 1mg/ml of BrdU (Sigma) was dissolved in autoclaved water with 5% sugar and given as drinking water to 12weeks of age C57BL/6J (Charles River, Europe) mice. The solution was changed every other day and mice were sacrificed after 48hours (cortex) or 7 days of treatment (capsule). Tissues were processed as described for Immunofluorescence analysis. Every 5th section was stained for NR2F2 and BrdU (capsule) or DAB2 and BrdU (cortex). Axin2-CreERT, Wnt4-CreERT2, and Gli1-CreERT2 were activated by a single intraperitoneal injection on two consecutive days of Tamoxifen (Sigma). 100 μl/20 g of mouse weight from a solution of 20mg/ml of Tamoxifen in corn oil was administrated per mouse. For adult experiments, animals were induced at 12 weeks of age (unless stated otherwise). For experiments during embryogenesis, the CRE recombinase was activated at E15.5 by intraperitoneally injecting 100 μl/20 g of mouse weight (pregnant female) from a solution of 20mg/ml of Tamoxifen (made up in corn oil). Beginning two weeks after surgery, oophorectomized females were injected twice daily subcutaneously with 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one (75 μg in 5% ethanol and corn oil) or oil only for a period of 6 weeks. For developmental studies, pregnant females were injected twice daily subcutaneously with 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one (75 μg in 5% ethanol and corn oil) from E14.5 onward. For immunofluorescence analysis of paraffin-embedded samples, adrenal tissues were fixed overnight at 4°C with 4% paraformaldehyde, progressively dehydrated and paraffin embedded. Sections of 5 μm were cut and unmasked with PT Link (Dako Agilent Pathology Solutions) at pH6. Sections were blocked for 1h with 10% Normal Donkey Serum (Jackson Immunoresearch), 3% BSA (Sigma) and 0,1% Tween-20 (Sigma). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 degrees diluted in 3% NDS, 3% BSA, 0,1% Tween-20 as follows: anti-NR2F2, anti-DAB2, anti-3β-HSD, anti-AR and anti-α20-HSD at 1:200; anti-BrdU (NB500-169) at 1:100; anti-BrdU (3D4) at 1:250; anti-GFP at 1:500. The next day, sections were incubated at room temperature with secondary antibodies diluted 1:400 in PBS-0.1%Tween-20 and mounted in antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Vectashield). For immunofluorescence analysis of thick sections, freshly dissected adrenals were fixed for 1hour in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, embedded in low melting point agarose and cut with a vibratome at a thickness of 50 μm per section. Sections were mounted in antifade mounting medium with DAPI. Counting results were processed using Graph Pad Prism 7.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was determined with a two-tailed unpaired Students t test. For the quantification of the proliferation in the capsule, 5 sections of whole adrenals were counted per animal (n = 5 males, n = 6 females). The number of double positive cells for NR2F2 and BrdU was normalized on the total number of NR2F2 positive cells. In the cortex, 3 sections were counted per animal (n = 4 males and females). The number of double positive cells for BrdU and DAB2 was normalized on the total number of DAB2 positive cells for the zona glomerulosa. For the zona fasciculata, the number of BrdU positive cells was normalized on the total number of cells. The quantification of the cell turnover was used by measuring the distance from the capsule to the innermost GFP positive cell normalized on the total thickness of the cortex (excluding the X-zone) in 3 regions of 3 nonconsecutive sections per animal (n ≥ 3). For proliferation analysis of the recruited capsular cells, the number of BrdU/GFP double positive cells in the cortex was normalized on the total number of GFP positive cells in the cortex (n = 4 for males and females). For the sex reverse models, both adrenals were weighed for each animal. Mean adrenal weights were normalized on body weight (n ≥ 5). Gonadectomized animals were compared to age matched animals undergoing the surgical procedure without removal of the gonads. DHT-treated females after oophorectomy were compared to oil-treated females after oophorectomy.

https://openalex.org/W2946352594,"Enterovirus B (EV-B), a major proportion of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae, is the causative agent of severe human infectious diseases. Although cellular receptors for coxsackievirus B in EV-B have been identified, receptors mediating virus entry, especially the uncoating process of echovirus and other EV-B remain obscure. Here, we found that human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the uncoating receptor for major EV-B. FcRn binds to the virus particles in the “canyon” through its FCGRT subunit. By obtaining multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures at different stages of virus entry at atomic or near-atomic resolution, we deciphered the underlying mechanisms of enterovirus attachment and uncoating. These structures revealed that different from the attachment receptor CD55, binding of FcRn to the virions induces efficient release of “pocket factor” under acidic conditions and initiates the conformational changes in viral particle, providing a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of enterovirus entry."

The discovery of the poly(A) tail as the specialized sequence feature at the 3′ end of eukaryotic mRNAs dates back nearly fifty years (Darnell et al., 1971Darnell J.E. Wall R. Tushinski R.J.

USA. 1971; 68: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Virtually all eukaryotic mRNAs (with the notable exception of mammalian replication-dependent histone mRNAs) feature a string of adenosines that are added to the 3′ end of the nascent transcript by the nuclear poly(A) polymerase (Edmonds, 2002Edmonds M. A history of poly A sequences: from formation to factors to function.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 285-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the poly(A) tail synthesized upon transcription termination varies in different species, from about 90 nucleotides in yeast to 200 to 250 in mammals (reviewed in Eckmann et al., 2011Eckmann C.R. Rammelt C. Wahle E. Control of poly(A) tail length.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2011; 2: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The crucial roles of the poly(A) tail in mRNA export, translation, and decay, however, are universally conserved and largely mediated by its specific binding partners, the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) (reviewed in Eliseeva et al., 2013Eliseeva I.A.

Wahle E. Structure and function of poly(A) binding proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic PABPs are predominant components of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) (Singh et al., 2015Singh G. Pratt G. Yeo G.W. Moore M.J.

Evidence over the years has resulted in the notion that yeast Pab1 and its mammalian orthologue poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) coat the 3′ end of cytoplasmic mRNAs, packaging them into poly(A) RNPs (reviewed in Eliseeva et al., 2013Eliseeva I.A.

Cytoplasmic PABPs are very abundant proteins (μM concentration), bind poly-adenylate RNAs with very high affinity (nM Kd), and organize the poly(A) tail into a repeating pattern with a periodicity of about 27 nucleotides, the footprint of a single PABP (Baer and Kornberg, 1980Baer B.W.

The RNA-binding properties of Pab1 and PABPC1 lie in their N-terminal region, which consists of four consecutive RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains (reviewed in Eliseeva et al., 2013Eliseeva I.A.

The two N-terminal RRM1 and RRM2 domains function as a single module that is essentially responsible for the adenosine-binding specificity and affinity characteristic of the full-length protein (Kühn and Pieler, 1996Kühn U.

Although it has been generally assumed that RRM3 and RRM4 may form a similar structural module, it is nevertheless clear that they are functionally different, at least in terms of RNA-binding properties (Kühn and Pieler, 1996Kühn U.

The RRM domains also contribute to protein-protein interactions. RRM2, for example, binds a component of the translation initiation machinery (eIF4G) (Safaee et al., 2012Safaee N. Kozlov G. Noronha A.M. Xie J. Wilds C.J. Gehring K. Interdomain allostery promotes assembly of the poly(A) mRNA complex with PABP and eIF4G.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The main protein-binding platform of PABP, however, resides in the C-terminal region of the molecule (reviewed in Xie et al., 2014Xie J. Kozlov G. Gehring K. The “tale” of poly(A) binding protein: The MLLE domain and PAM2-containing proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1839: 1062-1068PubMed Google Scholar). At the very C terminus, the Mademoiselle (MLLE) domain recognizes short sequence motifs (known as PAM2) that are present, for example, in factors involved in translation termination (eRF3) (Hoshino et al., 1999Hoshino S. Imai M. Kobayashi T. Uchida N. Katada T. The eukaryotic polypeptide chain releasing factor (eRF3/GSPT) carrying the translation termination signal to the 3′-Poly(A) tail of mRNA.

Finally, the linker between the last RRM and the MLLE domains plays an important role in mediating the cooperative binding of multiple PABP molecules to the poly(A) tail (Simón and Séraphin, 2007Simón E. Séraphin B. A specific role for the C-terminal region of the Poly(A)-binding protein in mRNA decay.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6017-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The poly(A) RNA-dependent oligomerization of Pab1 and PABPC1 is a hallmark of the repetitive organization of the poly(A) RNP. The poly(A) RNP is one of the most dynamic features of an mRNP. During the lifetime of the transcript, the poly(A) tail is gradually shortened, eventually leading to mRNA degradation (reviewed in Eckmann et al., 2011Eckmann C.R. Rammelt C. Wahle E. Control of poly(A) tail length.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2011; 2: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Jalkanen et al., 2014Jalkanen A.L. Coleman S.J. Wilusz J. Determinants and implications of mRNA poly(A) tail size--does this protein make my tail look big?.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 34: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PABP plays an interesting dichotomous role in this context. On the one hand, it physically protects the 3′ end of the transcript from unspecific degradation (Ford et al., 1997Ford L.P. Bagga P.S. Wilusz J. The poly(A) tail inhibits the assembly of a 3′-to-5′ exonuclease in an in vitro RNA stability system.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is required for poly(A) tail shortening (Caponigro and Parker, 1995Caponigro G. Parker R.

Indeed, the cytoplasmic PABP interacts with and stimulates Pan2-Pan3, the deadenylase complex that trims long poly(A) tails (Uchida et al., 2004Uchida N. Hoshino S. Katada T. Identification of a human cytoplasmic poly(A) nuclease complex stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, PABP interacts with Ccr4-Not, the deadenylase complex that triggers mRNA decay (Daugeron et al., 2001Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Séraphin B.

Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and human cells have shown that deadenylation proceeds in distinct phases (Decker and Parker, 1993Decker C.J. Parker R.

Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In vivo, S. cerevisiae Pan2-Pan3 performs the initial trimming of the 3′ end to about 50 to 70 adenosines and can continue shortening until the poly(A) tract reaches a critical length of 25 to 40 nucleotides (Beilharz and Preiss, 2007Beilharz T.H.

Positive and negative regulation of poly(A) nuclease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5521-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Deadenylation then transitions from this initial slow phase to a second phase that commits the mRNA to turnover (Decker and Parker, 1993Decker C.J. Parker R. A turnover pathway for both stable and unstable mRNAs in yeast: evidence for a requirement for deadenylation.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In the turnover phase, Ccr4-Not erodes the poly(A) tail even further to a short poly(A), rendering the transcript susceptible to decapping followed by 5′-3′ degradation via Xrn1 and/or to 3′-5′ degradation by the exosome-Ski complex (Daugeron et al., 2001Daugeron M.C.

Chang T.-C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Concerted action of poly(A) nucleases and decapping enzyme in mammalian mRNA turnover.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underpinning the transition between the Pan2-Pan3 and Ccr4-Not complexes and the basis for their different substrate preferences are unknown. How Pan2-Pan3 specifically recognizes early poly(A) RNPs and why it stops after shortening them to a discrete size is currently not understood. Furthermore, insights into the structure of the poly(A) RNP have remained largely elusive, despite its central role in the life of a mature mRNA. Here, we address these questions by employing biochemical and structural approaches. We first established a biochemical system to reproduce the in vivo properties of yeast poly(A) RNP deadenylation in an in vitro setting with purified components (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C ). To mimic the poly(A) tail of a newly synthesized yeast mRNP entering the cytoplasm, we produced a model RNA substrate with a stretch of 90 adenosines (A) at the 3′ end by in vitro transcription (model-90A RNA). Given the Pab1 RNA-binding footprint of 27 nt (Baer and Kornberg, 1983Baer B.W. Kornberg R.D. The protein responsible for the repeating structure of cytoplasmic poly(A)-ribonucleoprotein.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Sachs et al., 1986Sachs A.B. Bond M.W. Kornberg R.D. A single gene from yeast for both nuclear and cytoplasmic polyadenylate-binding proteins: domain structure and expression.Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), three protomers are expected to cover a 90A RNA. We thus reconstituted a model-90A RNP using a three-fold molar excess of Pab1 and added recombinant Pan2-Pan3 to initiate deadenylation. The experiment resulted in the rapid and prominent accumulation of ∼70A intermediate fragments that were then converted into ∼40A fragments, eventually leading to a rather slow and weak accumulation of 10A RNA products (Figure 1C). The pattern of RNA intermediates in this reconstituted system was dependent on and stimulated by the presence of Pab1 (Figure 1B) and suggested that Pan2-Pan3 degrades the poly(A) tail in bursts that are connected to the stepwise removal of Pab1 molecules. In the deadenylation assay, the degradation rates decreased gradually as the substrate was shortened (Figure 1C). The half-life of the model-90A RNA was three-fold shorter than that of the 70A intermediate fragment and roughly nine-fold shorter than that of the ∼40A fragments, indicating that longer RNPs were degraded faster (Figure S1A and Table S2). To analyze the apparent preference of Pan2-Pan3 for longer poly(A) RNPs, we employed a substrate competition assay. We incubated Pan2-Pan3 with a labeled 90A RNP substrate and challenged it with increasing amounts of either unlabeled 40A RNP (Figure 2A) or unlabeled 90A RNP (Figure S1B). In this assay, the more unlabeled 90A poly(A) RNP was present in the reaction, the less degradation of the radioactively labeled 90A RNP was observed. When challenging the reaction with unlabeled 40A RNP, however, there was essentially no inhibitory effect on deadenylation of the labeled 90A RNP (Figure 2A), demonstrating that Pan2-Pan3 has a clear preference for longer poly(A) RNPs.Figure 2Impact of poly(A) Tail Length on the Interaction with Pan2-Pan3Show full caption(A) Poly(A) tail length preference of Pan2-Pan3.

The sequential action of Pan2-Pan3 and Ccr4-Not deduced from in vivo experiments has suggested that the two deadenylase complexes have different substrate preferences (Decker and Parker, 1993Decker C.J.

To recapitulate their interplay in an in vitro setting, we challenged Pan2-Pan3 by adding recombinant catalytic subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex, Caf1-Ccr4 (which have been shown to act on poly(A) RNAs and poly(A) RNPs, respectively; Webster et al., 2018Webster M.W.

Cell. 2018; 70: 1081-1088.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nuclease assays with either individual or both deadenylases showed that Pan2-Pan3 activity indeed dominated in the case of a 90A and a 70A RNP substrate, whereas Caf1-Ccr4 activity dominated with a 40A RNP substrate (Figure 1E and Figure S1E). Interestingly, the combination of Pan2-Pan3 and Caf1-Ccr4 resulted in an overall more productive deadenylation of the full substrate than either enzyme alone (Figure 1E and Figure S1E). Both Pan2-Pan3 and the combination of Pan2-Pan3 plus Ccr4-Not deadenylate long poly(A) RNPs with comparable rates. This indicates that the observed increase in overall deadenylation is a product of a synergistic effect between both deadenylases rather than a result of a mere increase in total deadenylase concentration (Figure S1E). Such cumulative effect is in line with the complementary specificities of each enzyme in acting preferentially at different deadenylation stages and, in turn, suggests how the sequential series of these enzymatic activities may be more efficient than either one alone. Finally, the activities of both S. cerevisiae deadenylases, Pan2-Pan3 (Figure 1B), but also Caf1-Ccr4 (Figure 1E, lane CC) are stimulated by Pab1. This aligns well with similar observations recently reported for the human and S. pombe proteins (Webster et al., 2018Webster M.W. Chen Y.-H. Stowell J.A.W. Alhusaini N. Sweet T. Graveley B.R.

We conclude that Pan2-Pan3 can effectively degrade a poly(A) tail long enough to span three Pab1 protomers to a shorter tail spanning two Pab1 protomers but is ineffective when the poly(A) tail has been shortened to span a single Pab1 (i.e., in the 30A to 40A range). The in vitro system reconstituted with purified components can thus reproduce the phased length distribution of poly(A) tail lengths in yeast, and it also recapitulates the in vivo substrate specificity of the two deadenylase complexes. The observation that Pan2-Pan3 is more active on long poly(A) tails raises the question of whether the deadenylation properties of this complex are connected to its substrate-binding properties. The current view is that poly(A) RNP substrates are recognized by the N-terminal domain of Pan3: the Zinc-finger domain has been shown to interact with a poly(A) RNA (Wolf et al., 2014Wolf J. Valkov E. Allen M.D. Meineke B. Gordiyenko Y. McLaughlin S.H. Olsen T.M. Robinson C.V. Bycroft M. Stewart M. Passmore L.A.

However, the mechanism of catechin to prevent inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused by TNF-α remains unknown. Therefore, the effects of catechin on the gene expression of cytokines and the activation of cell signals in TNF-α induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. The effects of catechin on adipogenesis and cell viability were detected by Oil Red O staining and CCK-8 assay, respectively. The genes expression of cytokines was determined by real-time RT-PCR. The expression of NF-κB, AMPK, FOXO3a and SIRT1 on translation level was determined by western blotting analysis. The results demonstrated that catechin significantly enhanced adipogenesis and cell viability. catechin inhibited the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p35, and inflammatory enzymes including iNOS and COX-2, but enhanced the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-4 and IL-10. Catechin also inhibited the activation of NF-κB, AMPK, FOXO3a and SIRT1, but increased the phosphorylation level of the above factors. All these results indicated that as a potential therapeutic strategy catechin has the ability of attenuating inflammatory response triggered by TNF-α through signaling cascades involved in inflammation and cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2946241244,"The precision and reliability of synaptic information transfer depend on the molecular organization of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) within the presynaptic membrane. Alternative splicing of exon 47 affects the C-terminal structure of VGCCs and their affinity to intracellular partners and synaptic vesicles (SVs). We show that hippocampal synapses expressing VGCCs either with exon 47 (CaV2.1+47) or without (CaV2.1Δ47) differ in release probability and short-term plasticity. Tracking single channels revealed transient visits (∼100 ms) of presynaptic VGCCs in nanodomains (∼80 nm) that were controlled by neuronal network activity. Surprisingly, despite harboring prominent binding sites to scaffold proteins, CaV2.1+47 persistently displayed higher mobility within nanodomains. Synaptic accumulation of CaV2.1 was accomplished by optogenetic clustering, but only CaV2.1+47 increased transmitter release and enhanced synaptic short-term depression. We propose that exon 47-related alternative splicing of CaV2.1 channels controls synapse-specific release properties at the level of channel mobility-dependent coupling between VGCCs and SVs."
https://openalex.org/W2945579521,"Craving for cocaine progressively increases in cocaine users during drug-free periods, contributing to relapse. The projection from the infralimbic cortex to the nucleus accumbens shell (IL-NAc) is thought to inhibit cocaine seeking. However, it is not known whether and how IL-NAc neurons contribute to the increased motivation associated with a drug-free period. We first performed cellular resolution imaging of IL-NAc neurons in rats during a drug-seeking test. This revealed neurons with spatial selectivity within the cocaine-associated context, a decrease in activity around the time of cocaine seeking, and an inverse relationship between cocaine-seeking activity and subsequent cocaine motivation. All these properties were reduced by a drug-free period. Next, we transiently activated this projection, which resulted in reduced drug seeking, regardless of the drug-free period. Taken together, this suggests that altered IL-NAc activity after a drug-free period may enhance cocaine motivation without fundamentally altering the projection's ability to inhibit drug seeking."
https://openalex.org/W2946321518,"We recently demonstrated that mammalian cells harbor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-capped messenger RNAs that are hydrolyzed by the DXO deNADding enzyme. Here, we report that the Nudix protein Nudt12 is a second mammalian deNADding enzyme structurally and mechanistically distinct from DXO and targeting different RNAs. The crystal structure of mouse Nudt12 in complex with the deNADding product AMP and three Mg2+ ions at 1.6 A resolution provides insights into the molecular basis of the deNADding activity in the NAD pyrophosphate. Disruption of the Nudt12 gene stabilizes transfected NAD-capped RNA in cells, and its endogenous NAD-capped mRNA targets are enriched in those encoding proteins involved in cellular energetics. Furthermore, exposure of cells to nutrient or environmental stress manifests changes in NAD-capped RNA levels that are selectively responsive to Nudt12 or DXO, respectively, indicating an association of deNADding to cellular metabolism. Structural and biochemical analyses identify Nudt12 as a novel mRNA deNADing enzyme in mammalian cells, which has a different substrate preference compared to the deNADing enzyme DXO."

In contrast to adult mice, we show that isolation from the nursing nest, not milk deprivation or ingestion, activated Agrp neurons. Non-nutritive suckling and warm temperatures blunted this effect. Using in vivo fiber photometry, neonatal Agrp neurons showed a rapid increase in activity upon isolation from the nest, an effect rapidly diminished following reunion with littermates. Neonates unable to release GABA from Agrp neurons expressed blunted emission of isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. Chemogenetic overactivation of these neurons further increased emission of these ultrasonic vocalizations, but not milk ingestion. We uncovered important functional properties of hypothalamic Agrp neurons during mouse development, suggesting these neurons facilitate offspring-to-caregiver bonding.

Here, we studied the functional ontogeny of Agrp neurons during breastfeeding using postnatal day 10 mice. In contrast to adult mice, we show that isolation from the nursing nest, not milk deprivation or ingestion, activated Agrp neurons. Non-nutritive suckling and warm temperatures blunted this effect. Using in vivo fiber photometry, neonatal Agrp neurons showed a rapid increase in activity upon isolation from the nest, an effect rapidly diminished following reunion with littermates. Neonates unable to release GABA from Agrp neurons expressed blunted emission of isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. Chemogenetic overactivation of these neurons further increased emission of these ultrasonic vocalizations, but not milk ingestion. We uncovered important functional properties of hypothalamic Agrp neurons during mouse development, suggesting these neurons facilitate offspring-to-caregiver bonding. Agouti-related peptide (Agrp) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus serve as a central coordinator to regulate food intake. Ablation of these neurons leads to aphagia in adult mice (Gropp et al., 2005Gropp E. Shanabrough M. Borok E. Xu A.W. Janoschek R. Buch T. Plum L. Balthasar N. Hampel B.

NPY/AgRP neurons are essential for feeding in adult mice but can be ablated in neonates.Science. 2005; 310: 683-685Google Scholar), but not in neonates, suggesting that Agrp neurons do not contribute to ingestive behaviors early in development. In support of this view, Agrp neurons show delayed development in rodents (Nilsson et al., 2005Nilsson I. Johansen J.E. Schalling M. Hökfelt T. Fetissov S.O.

Ontogeny of the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y system.Physiol. Behav. 2003; 79: 47-63Google Scholar). However, impairing development of Agrp neurons during the first postnatal week in mice has persistent consequences to metabolism and behavior (Dietrich et al., 2012Dietrich M.O. Bober J.

Here, we assessed the functional ontogeny of Agrp neurons in early postnatal development of mice at postnatal day 10 (P10) and during the weaning period during postnatal days 15–21 (P15–P21). In adult mice, nutrient deprivation activates Agrp neurons (Hahn et al., 1998Hahn T.M. Breininger J.F. Baskin D.G. Schwartz M.W. Coexpression of Agrp and NPY in fasting-activated hypothalamic neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 271-272Google Scholar, Takahashi and Cone, 2005Takahashi K.A. Cone R.D.

So, we investigated the extent to which Agrp neurons respond to a lack of nutrients in neonatal mice. To test this, we isolated P10 mice from the nest for 90 min or 8 h to prevent nutrient intake via milk ingestion (Figure 1A). A 90-min time from onset of separation maximizes Fos expression (Barros et al., 2015Barros V.N. Mundim M. Galindo L.T. Bittencourt S. Porcionatto M. Mello L.E. The pattern of c-Fos expression and its refractory period in the brain of rats and monkeys.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 72Google Scholar). Both periods of isolation increased Agrp neuronal activity, as indicated by the increased number of Fos positive Agrp neurons upon isolation (nest: 3.14 ± 0.96%, n = 9; isolation/90 min: 31.19 ± 1.89%, n = 10; isolation/8 h: 46.19 ± 2.04%, n = 3; F2, 19 = 128.6, p < 10−11, one-way ANOVA; Figures 1B–1D). Because 90 min significantly increased Fos positive Agrp neurons, we tested whether this period of isolation also stimulated milk intake. We measured milk intake by calculating the change in body weight in animals that remained in the nest for 90 min compared to animals isolated for 90 min followed by re-introduction to the nest for an additional 90-min period (Figure 1E). In this protocol, we did not observe significant differences in the body-weight changes between the two experimental conditions (nest: 62.1 ± 15.4 mg, n = 12; reunion: 76.2 ± 14.4 mg, n = 12; t22 = 0.65, p = 0.51, unpaired t test; Figure 1F). Thus, activation of Agrp neurons after 90 min of isolation from the nest in P10 mice is not significant to increase milk intake. Moreover, the increased activation of Agrp neurons does not seem to arise from a generalized stress response, as corticosterone levels did not increase after isolation (nest: 9.96 ± 1.85 ng/mL, n = 7; isolation: 12.40 ± 1.85 ng/mL, n = 11; t16 = 0.88, p = 0.39, unpaired t test; Figure 1G), and testing pups in the presence of a predator odor for 90 min did not alter Fos labeling in Agrp neurons (nest: 1.19 ± 0.92%, n = 2; isolation: 23.82 ± 4.78%, n = 4; isolation and predator odor: 22.71 ± 1.59%, n = 5; F2, 8 = 9.73, p = 0.007, one-way ANOVA; Figures 1H–1J). To evaluate whether the activation of Agrp neurons upon isolation from nest is due to caloric deprivation, we isolated P10 mice while orally infusing bovine or mouse derived milk (Figure 1K). We confirmed milk ingestion by adding a colored dye to the milk to verify its presence in the stomach (Figure 1L). Surprisingly, our results showed no significant difference between the activation of Agrp neurons between the groups that received an oral infusion of milk and the control group that received a passive oral probe with no milk infusion (nest: 1.51 ± 0.65%, n = 5; isolation and no infusion: 27.88 ± 2.39%, n = 12; isolation and mouse milk: 30.73 ± 1.93%, n = 8; isolation and bovine milk: 24.24 ± 3.14%, n = 8; F3, 29 = 19.38, p < 10−6, one-way ANOVA; Figures 1M–1O). Next, we tested the hypothesis that Agrp neuron activity in P10 mice increases upon separation in anticipation of future nutrient deprivation. To this end, we investigated the extent to which isolation from the nest activates Agrp neurons when dissociating milk intake and the nest. P7 mice were housed with a foster non-lactating dam and were manually fed milk by an investigator (Figure 1P). All neonates quickly developed locomotor activity toward the investigator at feeding onset, which suggests a learned association that the milk source was outside the home nest. We then assessed activation of Agrp neurons at P10 at either isolation or return to the home cage with the foster dam for a period of 90 min after all pups were previously fed with equal volumes of milk. Similar to our previous experiments, isolation from the home nest strongly increased the number of Fos positive Agrp neurons compared to mice that returned to the home cage (foster dam: 15.59 ± 3.26%, n = 6; isolation: 64.39 ± 3.94%, n = 8; t12 = 9.06, p < 10−5, unpaired t test; Figures 1Q and 1R). Taken together, these results suggest that activation of Agrp neurons in P10 mice following isolation from the nest does not require milk deprivation or anticipation of milk deprivation, which stands in contrast to adult mice. Our next goal was to evaluate the relative importance of different components of the nest environment and mother-infant interaction that contribute to Agrp neuron activation in P10 mice after isolation from the nest. In the nursing nest, pups receive care from the dam. An important feature of maternal care is neonatal attachment to the mother’s nipple and suckling. So, we investigated the extent to which suckling alters the activation of Agrp neurons. We fostered P10 mice with non-lactating dams, non-lactating dams with protruded nipples, and lactating dams (Figure 2A). In all cases, foster dams promptly retrieved the pups and placed them in the nest. All foster dams displayed maternal behaviors, such as grooming and licking and arched-back “nursing” of pups, as expected. Interestingly, all foster dams blunted the activation of Agrp neurons in P10 mice compared to isolated pups (nest: 2.10 ± 0.21%, n = 6; isolation: 26.47 ± 1.57%, n = 6; non-lactating foster dam: 16.59 ± 1.64%, n = 7; non-lactating foster dam with protruded nipples: 8.66 ± 1.26%, n = 6; lactating foster dam: 10.29 ± 0.65%, n = 4; F4, 24 = 50.29, p < 10−10, one-way ANOVA; Figures 2B and 2C). Attachment of pups to the foster dam’s nipples further decreased the number of Fos-labeled Agrp neurons compared to pups placed with a foster dam with non-protruded nipples to prevent nipple attachment (Figures 2B and 2C). The effect of nipple attachment was irrespective of milk availability, as the expression of Fos in pups showed a similar magnitude when placed with lactating and non-lactating foster dams with protruded nipples (Figures 2B and 2C). Overall, activation of Agrp neurons in P10 mice is blunted by non-nutritive suckling, an important component of maternal care, and is not further reduced by availability of milk in the dam’s nipples. The nursing nest provides critical thermal insulation, which reduces heat loss from neonates that have not fully developed homeostatic mechanisms for thermoregulation. Dams contribute to thermal insulation by building a nest and skin-to-skin contact with pups (Figure 2D). To test the effects of thermal insulation on the activation of Agrp neurons, we isolated P10 mice at room temperature or at a thermoneutral temperature (≈35°C; Figure 2E). Because temperature exchanges in the nest occur by skin-to-skin contact, we included an additional control group, in which we provided thermal support by irradiating heat (≈35°C) from underneath (Figure 2E). 90 min of isolation at thermoneutrality or with thermal support strongly suppressed activation of Agrp neurons in P10 mice as assayed by Fos labeling compared with pups isolated at room temperature (nest: 0.77 ± 0.39%, n = 5; isolation and room temperature: 22.19 ± 2.53%, n = 7; isolation and thermoneutrality: 5.90 ± 0.86%, n = 10; isolation and thermal support: 2.75 ± 0.51%, n = 8; F3, 26 = 47.31, p = 10−10, one-way ANOVA; Figures 2F and 2G). Thus, Agrp neurons in P10 mice respond to the withdrawal of thermal insulation when isolated from the nursing nest. This factor holds primary importance for the responses of these neurons to isolation. Next, we tested the extent to which the response of Agrp neurons in P10 mice to the withdrawal of thermal insulation was dependent on prior experience with drops in ambient temperature. To prevent mice from experiencing ambient temperatures lower than nest temperatures, we repeated the experiments in animals born and raised in a thermoneutral environment (Figure 2H). P10 mice raised at thermoneutrality showed increased Fos-labeled Agrp neurons when isolated at room temperature but not at thermoneutrality (nest and thermoneutrality: 0.62 ± 0.33%, n = 2; isolation and room temperature: 27.94 ± 3.13%, n = 3; isolation and thermoneutrality: 6.16 ± 1.54%, n = 3; F2, 5 = 37.91, p = 0.001, one-way ANOVA; Figures 2I and 2J). Thus, the response of Agrp neurons to withdrawal of thermal insulation in P10 mice does not require previous experiences with drops in ambient temperature. In the previous experiments, we could not elucidate the temporal dynamics of physiological activation of Agrp neurons. For example, Agrp neurons after isolation (Figure 3A) could slowly increase their activity similar to a homeostat (Figure 3B). Alternatively, these neurons could rapidly respond to isolation (Figure 3C) similar to an alarm and reflexive system. A third alternative suggests that Agrp neurons could show delayed activation (Figure 3D), suggesting a thresholding mechanism triggers these neurons in neonates. To better understand the natural activity dynamics of Agrp neurons early in postnatal development, we injected an adeno-associated virus encoding jGCaMP7s in a Cre-dependent manner in newborn AgrpCre/Cre mice (Figures 3E–G) (Dana et al., 2018Dana H. Sun Y. Mohar B. Hulse B. Hasseman J.P. Tsegaye G. Tsang A. Wong A. Patel R. Macklin J.J. et al.High-performance GFP-based calcium indicators for imaging activity in neuronal populations and microcompartments.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/434589Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We then used fiber photometry to measure calcium transients originating from Agrp neurons upon isolation-reunion in P13–14 pups (Figure 3A). We found that pup isolation from the nest increased activity of Agrp neurons that occurred within seconds (Figures 3H and 3I) and persisted throughout the isolation period (10 min). After this initial separation, reunion of the isolated animal with the litter immediately decreased the activity of Agrp neurons (Figures 3H and 3I). The suppression of Agrp neuronal activity was robust and rapid, normalizing the detected signal to pre-isolation levels in less than 30 s (Figures 3H and 3I). All animals tested showed this response to isolation-reunion, suggesting a general model in which Agrp neurons in neonates rapidly respond to disruptions in the nest conditions (Figure 3C). In most neonatal mammals, including mice, disruptions in the nest condition lead to infant vocalization (Hofer, 1994Hofer M.A. Hidden regulators in attachment, separation, and loss.Monogr. Soc. Res. Child Dev. 1994; 59: 192-207Google Scholar). In mice and rats, neonates emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from the dam (Noirot, 1966Noirot E. Ultra-sounds in young rodents. I. Changes with age in albino mice.Anim. Behav. 1966; 14: 459-462Google Scholar, Noirot, 1968Noirot E. Ultrasounds in young rodents. II. Changes with age in albino rats.Anim. Behav. 1968; 16: 129-134Google Scholar, Zippelius and Schleidt, 1956Zippelius H.-M. Schleidt W.M. Ultraschall-Laute bei jungen Mäusen.Naturwissenschaften. 1956; 43: 502Google Scholar) (Figures 4A and 4B ). We investigated whether activation of Agrp neurons in neonates upon isolation from the nest could modulate emission of USVs. First, we confirmed that isolation from the nest induced vocal behavior in P10 mice (Figure 4A). We then investigated whether isolation at thermoneutrality would influence USVs, since these conditions blunt activation of Agrp neurons upon isolation (Figure 2). Analysis of vocal behavior showed a rapid increase in USV emission upon isolation from the nest (Figures 4B–4E), an effect that blunted at thermoneutrality (nest, n = 3; isolated and room temperature, n = 16; isolated and thermoneutrality, n = 4; F2,20 = 18.08, p < 10−4, one-way ANOVA; Figures 4C–4E). Thus, vocal behavior dynamics in neonatal mice follow the dynamics of Agrp neuron activation upon isolation in these experimental conditions. To test the extent to which Agrp neurons contribute to vocal behavior of P10 mice upon isolation, we tested animals lacking the transmitters released by Agrp neurons (NPY and GABA) (Hahn et al., 1998Hahn T.M.

Heterogeneity in the neuropeptide Y-containing neurons of the rat arcuate nucleus: GABAergic and non-GABAergic subpopulations.Brain Res. 1997; 756: 283-286Google Scholar). We recorded the emission of USVs in NpyKO and AgrpVgat-KO mice and their littermate controls following 10 minutes isolation in P10 mice. Animals lacking NPY exhibited a similar number of USVs after isolation compared to controls (control: 343.4 ± 56.8 USVs, n = 12; NpyKO/+: 384.5 ± 69.3 USVs, n = 17; NpyKO/KO: 348.0 ± 91.7 USVs, n = 7; p = 0.74, Kruskal-Wallis [KW] test; Figure 4F). In contrast, AgrpVgat-KO mice had a significant decrease in emission of USVs upon isolation (control: 321.0 ± 50.4 USVs, n = 10; AgrpVgat-KO: 57.7 ± 14.6 USVs, n = 14; U = 2, p < 10−5, Mann-Whitney test; Figures 4G and 4H). We further analyzed the spectro-temporal characteristics of 3,427 USVs from control mice and 786 USVs from AgrpVgat-KO mice. We characterized individual USVs by changes in spectro-temporal characteristics, such as duration, frequency, and bandwidth. Compared to control mice, USVs from AgrpVgat-KO mice decreased in duration of 9.5 ms (control: 37.84 ± 0.45 ms; AgrpVgat-KO: 28.31 ± 0.84 ms; D = 0.176, p = 10−15, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test; Figure 4I), in mean frequency of 1.9 kHz (control: 82.20 ± 0.28 kHz; AgrpVgat-KO: 80.24 ± 0.55 kHz; D = 0.10, p = 10−15, KS test; Figure 4J), and in bandwidth of 5.6 kHz (control: 22.86 ± 0.35 kHz; AgrpVgat-KO: 17.20 ± 0.67 kHz; D = 0.17, p = 10−15, KS test; Figure 4K). We also found an overall decrease in the number of vocalizations across most USV categories (Figures 4L–4X) (Grimsley et al., 2011Grimsley J.M. Monaghan J.J. Wenstrup J.J. Development of social vocalizations in mice.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17460Google Scholar). However, we observed an increase in the incidence of “short” vocalizations, when analyzing the relative frequency of USV categories (Figure 4Y). This syllable represents the simplest form of vocalization by neonatal mice based on spectro-temporal characteristics (Figures 4L–4V). Thus, lacking GABA release from Agrp neurons, P10 AgrpVgat-KO mice led to fewer and simpler USVs compared to control animals. Taken together, these findings indicate Agrp neurons are critically positioned to modulate the emission of USVs in neonatal mice. We further tested whether chemogenetic activation of Agrp neurons could modulate emission of USV in isolated P10 pups using AgrpTrpv1 mice (Dietrich et al., 2015Dietrich M.O. Zimmer M.R. Bober J.

Subcutaneous injection of capsaicin (10 mg/kg) in AgrpTrpv1 mice robustly activated Agrp neurons in young pups (Figure 5B; n = 5 mice per group; U = 0, p = 0.004, Mann-Whitney test). Chemogenetic activation of Agrp neurons using the AgrpTrpv1 animal model induced a 61% increase in USV emission in P10 mice (control: 686.7 ± 50.22 USVs, n = 32; AgrpTrpv1: 1040.0 ± 66.56 USVs, n = 24; t51 = 4.318, p < 0.0001; 2-tailed unpaired t test; Figures 5C–5E).Figure S1PCR-Based Analysis for Genotyping Agrptrpv1 and Control Mice, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Illustrative diagram of the tissue collection and PCR-based analysis genotyping.(B) Genomic DNA samples from P15 mice were extracted and amplified using primers for Trpv1 knockout allele.

The upper band (667 bp) shows that the excised allele for Trpv1 is specifically expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We also analyzed the spectro-temporal characteristics of a total of 21,019 USVs from control mice and 24,976 vocalizations from AgrpTrpv1 mice. Upon activation of Agrp neurons, the USV duration decreased by 4 ms (control: 51.42 ± 0.23 ms; AgrpTrpv1: 47.09 ± 0.19 ms; D = 0.077, p = 10−15, KS test; Figure 5F), the mean frequency increased by 3 kHz (control: 77.50 ± 0.08 kHz; AgrpTrpv1: 80.96 ± 0.07 kHz; D = 0.12, p = 10−15, KS test; Figure 5G), and the bandwidth increased by 2 kHz (control: 27.31 ± 0.13 kHz; AgrpTrpv1: 29.84 ± 0.12 kHz; D = 0.07, p = 10−15, KS test; Figure 5H). The selected categories of USVs induced by activation of Agrp neurons (Figure 5I) showed a higher complexity compared to those suppressed in AgrpVgat-KO mice (Figure 4). Interestingly, when we analyzed the relative frequency of USV categories, we found a selective increase in the frequency of “chevrons” upon chemogenetic activation of Agrp neurons (Figures 5J and 4N). To further corroborate these findings, we used a second software tool MUPET to classify vocalizations based on their shape (Van Segbroeck et al., 2017Van Segbroeck M. Knoll A.T. Levitt P. Narayanan S. MUPET-Mouse Ultrasonic Profile ExTraction: A Signal Processing Tool for Rapid and Unsupervised Analysis of Ultrasonic Vocalizations.Neuron. 2017; 94: 465-485Google Scholar). We found six clusters of vocalizations that showed a more than 2.5-fold increase upon activation of Agrp neurons (Figures 5K and 5L). These clusters were very similar to each other, resembling our previous analysis (Figures 4G and 4H). We also found that activation of Agrp neurons suppressed vocalizations in cluster 39 (Figures 5K and 5M). The USVs in cluster 39 were simpler in shape, resembling vocalizations predominantly emitted by AgrpVgat-KO pups (Figure 4). In contrast to mice lacking GABA release by Agrp neurons, chemogenetic activation of these neurons stimulated USV emission at a higher rate and with higher complexity. Together, these results strongly suggest a model in which neonatal Agrp neurons are rapidly activated upon isolation from the nest, which modulates USV emission, presumably to attract the dam. Neonatal behavior is linked to maternal behavior, as the former can enhance and entrain the behavior of the latter. Based on our previous results, we expected that chemogenetic activation of Agrp neurons in the neonate would change the response of the dam toward the neonate. We devised a test to assess maternal responsiveness to P10 mice, the “maternal preference test” (Figure 5N). In this test, maternal responsiveness was measured as the time of dam-pup interaction. We found maternal exploratory behavior was strongly skewed toward AgrpTrpv1 pups compared to controls (preference index - control: 44.96 ± 13.68 s, n = 25; AgrpTrpv1: 125.1 ± 21.74 s, n = 25; t24 = 2.69; p = 0.01, 2-tailed paired t test; Figures 5O and 5P). These results support the model in which neonatal Agrp neurons modulate vocal behaviors signaling the dam should return to the nest. In young pups, contact with the dam is critical for suckling behavior and ingestion of breast milk. Thus, we next devised behavior experiments to test whether activation of Agrp neurons in pups would drive behaviors toward the dam, including exploratory activity, suckling, and milk intake. We eliminated active participation by the dam as the driver of these behaviors by examining the behavior of P10 mice toward anesthetized dams (Figure 6A). In anesthetized dams, milk ejection decreases considerably (Lincoln et al., 1973Lincoln D.W. Hill A. Wakerley J.B. The milk-ejection reflex of the rat: an intermittent function not abolished by surgical levels of anaesthesia.J. Endocrinol. 1973; 57: 459-476Google Scholar), so suckling under these conditions is considered non-nutritive. Indeed, we did not observe the stretching reflex in pups that suckled during our experiments, which is a pathognomonic sign of milk ejection and ingestion (Vorherr et al., 1967Vorherr H. Kleeman C.R. Lehman E. Oxytocin-induced stretch reaction in suckling mice and rats: a semiquantitative bio-assay for oxytocin.Endocrinology. 1967; 81: 711-715Google Scholar). Activation of Agrp neurons in P10 mice increased the total number of pups that attached to the dam’s nipples (control: 9 out of 22; AgrpTrpv1: 13 out of 15; p = 0.005, chi-square test; Figure 6B) and increased the distance traveled in the testing chamber (control: 0.75 ± 0.14 m, n = 22; AgrpTrpv1: 1.20 ± 0.21 m, n = 15; U = 94, p = 0.027, Mann-Whitney test; Figures 6C and 6D). We then compared nipple attachment behavior of P10 mice, excluding animals that did not attach to the dam’s nipples from post hoc analysis. Chemogenetic activation of Agrp neurons did not change the frequency (control: 3.11 ± 1.23; AgrpTrpv1: 3.61 ± 0.83; U = 51, p = 0.63, Mann-Whitney test; Figure 6E), latency (control: 279.9 ± 57.4 s; AgrpTrpv1: 485.4 ± 86.2 s; U = 35, p = 0.12, Mann-Whitney test; Figure 6F), or the duration of nipple attachment (control: 719.4 ± 128.0 s; AgrpTrpv1: 529.8 ± 99.86 s; U = 39, p = 0.20, Mann-Whitney test; Figure 6G). Thus, while chemogenetic activation of Agrp neurons in P10 mice increased the probability of attaching to the dam’s nipples, it did not change the observable microstructure of nipple attachment behavior. Next, we investigated the influence of the environmental temperature on nipple attachment behavior (Figure 6H). Thermal support from underneath the testing chamber completely suppressed nipple attachment behavior in P10 control mice (0 out of 11 pups tested attached), while 4 out of 10 pups with activated Agrp neurons attached to the dam’s nipples (p = 0.019, chi-square test; Figure 6I). Interestingly, the arousal response of P10 mice upon activation of Agrp neurons was intact, as measured by the distance traveled during the test (control: 0.30 ± 0.07 m, n = 11; AgrpTrpv1: 1.03 ± 0.19 m, n = 10; U = 13, p = 0.002, Mann-Whitney test; Figures 6J and 6K). When we analyzed the different components of nipple attachment behavior of the four P10 mice that successfully attached, we found the frequency of attachments was largely suppressed with mice only attaching once during the test (Figure 6L). The latency to attach (386.5 ± 49.62 s; Figure 6M) was similar to the other experimental conditions (Figures 6F and 6S). The duration animals remained attached to the nipples (787.9 ± 48.20 s; Figure 6N) was within the range of our other experiments (Figures 6G and 6T). We conclude providing warmth did not blunt the arousal response after activating Agrp neurons but did suppress nipple attachment behavior of P10 mice. Taken together, our behavioral experiments further support the importance of a thermal stimulus in neonates to modulate the functional properties of Agrp neurons. We then assessed whether a lactating anaesthetized dam would alter attachment by P10 mice. Oxytocin triggers the milk ejection reflex following nipple stimulation by the pups during suckling (Lincoln and Paisley, 1982Lincoln D.W. Paisley A.C. Neuroendocrine control of milk ejection.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1982; 65: 571-586Google Scholar). To facilitate milk ejection, we injected a group of anesthetized dams"

Our demonstration that GSTs are key in vivo regulators of axonal mitochondrial length and number provides a potential mechanistic link. Most neurons are generated during embryogenesis and are subsequently maintained throughout the entire life of an organism. Mitochondria are integral to sustaining neuronal health, and the long polarized processes of neurons pose a unique challenge for adequate mitochondrial positioning and maintenance. Cellular homeostasis and adequate ATP production is thought to be achieved in axons through regulation of several essential mitochondrial processes, including mitochondrial fusion, fission, biogenesis, degradation, and transport (Harbauer, 2017Harbauer A.B. Mitochondrial health maintenance in axons.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2017; 45: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The major pathways responsible for regulating these have been increasingly well described over the past decade and are highly conserved from humans to Drosophila (Hewitt and Whitworth, 2017Hewitt V.L. Whitworth A.J. Mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease: lessons from Drosophila.Curr. Top. Dev.

Neurol. 2015; 274: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but whether they uniformly regulate mitochondrial biology similarly in all neuronal compartments remains an open question. Rapid and dynamic changes in mitochondrial length occur in response to the ever-changing environment of the cell (van der Bliek et al., 2013van der Bliek A.M. Shen Q. Kawajiri S. Mechanisms of mitochondrial fission and fusion.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a011072Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Conditions that increase mitochondrial ATP consumption lead to enhanced fusion, allowing for the mixing of mtDNA and proteins, whereas metabolic signals that grossly uncouple the mitochondria may result in fusion inhibition and occur as a prerequisite to mitophagy and/or neurodegeneration (van der Bliek et al., 2013van der Bliek A.M. Shen Q. Kawajiri S. Mechanisms of mitochondrial fission and fusion.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a011072Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Increased mitochondrial length can be classically achieved through increased function of the mitochondrial fusion proteins mitofusin (MFN) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) or decreased activity of the mitochondrial fission factors dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and fission mitochondrial 1 (FIS1) (van der Bliek et al., 2013van der Bliek A.M. Shen Q. Kawajiri S. Mechanisms of mitochondrial fission and fusion.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a011072Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The precise cellular processes that control the expression and function of these molecules for the dynamic regulation of mitochondria in long axon stretches are not well understood under physiological conditions or in complex diseases. Few key upstream modulating factors of the fission-fusion machinery have been identified (Anding et al., 2018Anding A.L. Wang C. Chang T.-K. Sliter D.A. Powers C.M. Hofmann K. Youle R.J.

Oxidation and reduction (redox) reactions of the glutathione (GSH) pathway take place in all cells and are essential for vital metabolic processes, including the production of ATP. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), reductases (GR), and peroxidases (GPx) control redox homeostasis and tightly balance the ratio of the antioxidant GSH and the toxic species oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (Aquilano et al., 2014Aquilano K. Baldelli S. Ciriolo M.R. Glutathione: new roles in redox signaling for an old antioxidant.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Mitochondria can be affected by GSH redox changes that manifest in neurological diseases and stress response conditions by several mechanisms. First, mitochondria cannot produce GSH themselves, so they rely on its import from the cytoplasm for the adequate detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Marí et al., 2009Marí M. Morales A. Colell A. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mitochondrial glutathione, a key survival antioxidant.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2685-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, Ribas et al., 2014Ribas V. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Glutathione and mitochondria.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Second, GSSG accumulation can cause widespread oxidation of proteins and lipids, including essential mitochondrial proteins of the electron transport chain (Marí et al., 2009Marí M. Morales A. Colell A. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mitochondrial glutathione, a key survival antioxidant.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2685-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, Ribas et al., 2014Ribas V. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Glutathione and mitochondria.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). While large shifts in intracellular redox are detrimental to cells, small shifts in the GSH:GSSG ratio have been reported to induce mitochondrial-associated changes that are not associated with toxicity in vitro (Shutt et al., 2012Shutt T. Geoffrion M. Milne R. McBride H.M. The intracellular redox state is a core determinant of mitochondrial fusion.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this study, we developed a high-throughput method to identify new molecules required for axonal mitochondrial maintenance in vivo. We discovered that a novel GST, Gfzf, homologous to GSTT1 in humans, regulates mitochondrial length in axons and functions by altering redox balance. Ablation of gfzf was found to cause the oligomerization of the outer mitochondrial membrane fusion factor Marf, a fly homolog of MFN, to initiate the fusion process and induce a complete fusion of the inner membrane through a secondary OPA1-mediated response. We show that mitochondrial fusion events also require the coordinated action of the specific GPx Jafrac1 and can be ameliorated by the expression of the GR TrxR-1. Loss of this GST caused significant functional changes within the neuron, including mitochondrial trafficking and electrophysiology. GSTs can therefore be classified as new essential upstream regulators of redox-mediated mitochondrial fusion. Mitochondrial maintenance processes present in non-polarized cells may occur in the axonal compartment of neurons (Amiri and Hollenbeck, 2008Amiri M. Hollenbeck P.J.

Mitochondrial trafficking in neurons.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a011304Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but the similarities or differences remain poorly defined. We devised an in vivo forward genetic screen to identify new factors controlling mitochondrial dynamics in axons with single axon and mitochondrial resolution using Drosophila (Figure 1A). We used the MARCM system to visualize a subset of glutamatergic neurons in the adult Drosophila wing (Neukomm et al., 2014Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Gonzalez M.A. Züchner S. Freeman M.R. Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and simultaneously labeled mitochondria (Figure 1B). Flies were fed the chemical mutagen ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and crossed to generate progeny containing MARCM clones in the F1 generation (Neukomm et al., 2017Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Seeds A.M. Hampel S. Coutinho-Budd J.C. Farley J.E. Wong J. Karadeniz Y.B. Osterloh J.M. Sheehan A.E. Freeman M.R. Axon death pathways converge on axundead to promote functional and structural axon disassembly.Neuron. 2017; 95: 78-91.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These animals were screened for changes in mitochondrial number, size, and position. This approach allowed us to discover both lethal and nonlethal mutants that regulate mitochondrial in adult post-mitotic neurons in vivo. To begin characterizing this system, we assayed the effects of loss-of-function manipulations of known molecules that regulate mitochondrial biology at 7 days post-eclosion (p.e.) (Figure 1C). Mitochondria in control neurons were distributed throughout the cell body and the axon and were stereotyped in size and density per unit axon area (Figure 1Ci). Induction of neuronal clones with a null mutation in the mitochondrial transport gene Milton resulted in the failure of mitochondria to enter the axonal compartment (Figure 1Cii), in agreement with Vagnoni et al., 2016Vagnoni A. Hoffmann P.C. Bullock S.L. Reducing Lissencephaly-1 levels augments mitochondrial transport and has a protective effect in adult Drosophila neurons.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Mutations in mitochondrial fission gene Drp1 caused fusion of mitochondria in the axon and a hyperfusion phenotype in the cell body (Figure 1Ciii; Figure S1). Mutants lacking the fusion factor Marf exhibited a significant shortening of mitochondria within the axon and a diffuse appearance in the soma (Figure 1Civ). Given the high efficiency and resolution of this system for examining mitochondrial phenotypes in axons in an in vivo setting and the potential to identify new regulators of mitochondrial physiology, we screened through ∼8,000 mutagenized chromosomes on the left arm of the 3rd chromosome (representing ∼20% of the Drosophila genome). We discovered one lethal mutant, line #541, where mitochondria were significantly longer in axons compared to non-mutagenized controls, which we functionally characterize below. A combination of whole-genome sequencing and deficiency mapping was used to identify a premature stop mutation in GST-containing FLYWCH zinc-finger protein (gfzf), a GST gene, that caused the long mitochondrial phenotype. Outcrossed flies that retained the phenotype were always associated with lethality. We found three overlapping deficiencies that failed to complement #541 in the genomic region of gfzf mutation revealed by the sequencing. Based on this observation and rescue experiments (below) we refer to mutant #541 as gfzf−/−. Increased mitochondrial length in gfzf−/− mutants was found to be age dependent (Figure 2). While only a minimal phenotypic difference was observed at 2 days p.e., excessively long mitochondria were observed at both 7 and 28 days (Figure 2A). Mitochondrial morphology was also altered in the neuronal cell bodies of gfzf−/− mutant clones at later time points (Figure 2A). Quantification of mitochondrial length in axons revealed that at 7 and 28 days, mitochondria were on average 3–4 times longer than age-matched controls (Figure 2B), and the total number of mitochondria significantly decreased (Figure 2C). For instance, by 28 days p.e., one single long mitochondrion was observed in a 60 μm length of mutant axon, whereas control neurons contained ∼5 shorter mitochondria (Figure 2C). Analysis of the frequency distribution of mitochondrial length in gfzf−/− mutant axons revealed a shift in length from a typical control range of 0.1–2.61 μm to a much broader range of 0.41 to >5 μm (Figure 2D). In the experiments described above, mitochondrial lengths were analyzed in a defined region of the proximal wing (Figure 1A). However, given the substantial length of these glutamatergic neurons, we wished to determine whether the alterations in mitochondrial length observed in gfzf#541 mutants were present throughout the axon, and this was indeed the case (Figures S2A and S2B). A frequency distribution shift of mitochondrial length also manifested as animals aged (Figures S2C–S2E). Therefore, gfzf−/− mutants affected mitochondrial length in axons independent of their location relative to the soma, and the effect increases with age. The total percentage axonal area occupied by mitochondria in the distal wing was further quantified within the axon and cell body compartments and not significantly changed (Figures S2F and S2G). This indicated that the mitochondrial phenotype is likely a fission-fusion deficit that does not affect biogenesis or degradation pathways. To confirm that the stop mutation in gfzf−/− was indeed responsible for the alterations in mitochondrial size, we expressed a full-length wild-type gfzf cDNA in gfzf#541 mutant clones. Upstream activating sequence (UAS)-mediated expression of gfzf was sufficient to rescue long mitochondrial phenotypes observed in the axons and cell bodies at 7 days p.e. (Figure 3A). Expression of 5xUAS-gfzf significantly reduced mitochondrial length compared to baseline, equivalent to those observed in controls (Figures 3B and 3C). A genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone also fully rescued the mitochondrial phenotype in gfzf#541 mutants (Venken et al., 2009Venken K.J.T. Carlson J.W. Schulze K.L. Pan H. He Y. Spokony R. Wan K.H. Koriabine M. de Jong P.J. White K.P. et al.Versatile P[acman] BAC libraries for transgenesis studies in Drosophila melanogaster.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), (Figures 3B and 3C). Autonomous expression of gfzfΔN, which still harbors the GST domain (but lacks the zinc finger [ZNF] domains), was also sufficient to rescue the mitochondrial phenotype in gfzf mutants. These findings argue that the GST domain is the key regulatory domain in Gfzf necessary to modulate mitochondrial length in axons. A range of other mutants of gfzf have been generated (Provost et al., 2006Provost E. Hersperger G. Timmons L. Ho W.Q. Hersperger E. Alcazar R. Shearn A. Loss-of-function mutations in a glutathione S-transferase suppress the prune-Killer of prune lethal interaction.Genetics. 2006; 172: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), outlined in (Figure S3A), but we found that the nature of these mutations was less severe than gfzf#541. gfzf#541 was the only allele that failed to complement the lethality of a deficiency lacking gfzf, or a transposon inserted in gfzf Mi(MIC)gfzfMI08697 (Figure S3B). We therefore propose that gfzf#541 is a null allele and will also refer to gfzf#541 as gfzf−/−. gfzfCZ811 also failed to complement most other alleles, including gfzf−/− and the Mi(MIC)gfzfMI08697 line, and showed increased mitochondrial length and decreased mitochondrial number (Figures S3C–S3E). No clones were observed gfzfCL1027, suggesting this chromosome arm may harbor an additional cell lethal mutation. This independently derived allele further confirms that loss of Gfzf causes increased mitochondrial length. Rescue experiments indicate that embryonic lethality caused by Gfzf loss was likely not the result of neuronal-specific deficits, decreased GST activity, or mitochondrial fusion perturbations (Figure S3F). Therefore, Gfzf seems to have a dual role: an essential role in fly development in other tissues that does not depend on GST activity and a role to maintain mitochondrial length in adult neurons in which GST is both necessary and sufficient. The GST domain of Gfzf has a 30% identity and 48% homology with the GST domain of human GSTT1 (Figure S3G). Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA)-mediated targeting of the mammalian GST homolog GSTT1 was also sufficient to increase mitochondrial length in cultured neurons in vitro (Figure S4), arguing for strong conservation of GST-mediated regulation of mitochondrial size. Mitochondrial phenotypes were first rescued by expression of Gfzf in gfzf−/− clones confirming the causative gene (Figure 3A) before investigating the interaction with other GSTs. There are multiple GSTs in the Drosophila genome, all of which can likely regulate GSH:GSSG ratios. To determine whether the ability of the GST domain of Gfzf to regulate mitochondrial length was specific, we tested whether other cytoplasmic localized GSTs could compensate for Gfzf or directly regulate mitochondrial length in axons (Figures 3B and 3C). We found that the expression of dGstO1 could reduce mitochondrial length in gfzf−/− neurons (Figure 3B). This suggests that GST-domain-containing proteins in Drosophila have the general ability to regulate mitochondria and may function synergistically to determine axonal mitochondrial length. GST-domain-containing proteins are highly conserved between the fruit fly and humans. We further found that mitochondrial length in gfzf−/− clones was rescued by expression of hGSTT1, (Figure 3B), but not hGSTT2, hGSTO1, hGSTO2, and hGSTM1 (Table S1), arguing that human GSTT1 may be the most conserved GST-containing protein for maintaining mitochondria dynamics in neurons. Rescue of mitochondrial length was always accompanied with a rescue in number per unit of axon length (Figure 3C), supporting a causal link between these phenotypes. Genetic manipulations that lead to dramatic changes in mitochondrial morphology are also tightly associated with perturbation of mitochondrial physiology and age-dependent neurodegeneration. We used in vivo live-cell imaging to assess mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, mitochondrial age and redox potential specific to GSSG and H2O2, in gfzf mutant clones, using 5xUAS-mito-GCaMP5, 5xUAS-mitoTimer, 5xUAS-mito-Grx1-roGFP2 and 5xUAS-mito-roGFP2-Orp1 respectively (Figures 3D–3G). We detected no significant differences in the fluorescence intensity of mitochondrial localized GCaMP5 (Figure 3D) and mitoTimer (Figure 3E). These data support the notion that mitochondria in gfzf−/− mutant axons remain broadly functional. There was a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity depicting GSSG within the mitochondria from 7 days, which was not detectable in controls (Figure 3F). The fluorescence signal denoting H2O2 levels remained unchanged (Figure 3G). Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings in aged flies further indicated that these dynamic mitochondrial changes were associated with neuronal response phenotypes (Figures 3H–3M). Amplitude of the off-transient was reduced, the time to reach half-maximal corneal depolarization was delayed, and the time to fully repolarize was shortened in gfzf−/− backgrounds relative to wild type (WT). Changes were rescued by a BAC clone or pan-neuronal knockdown of Marf, suggesting that physiological responses were directly related to the GSH pathway and mitochondrial hyperfusion (Figures S5A–S5C). gfzf−/− mutant axons remain intact in vivo, and baseline Ca2+ levels were not significantly different from control, yet a significant decrease in mitochondrial transport was observed (Figures S5D–S5G). This indicates that large mitochondria had significantly higher GSSG content, which may impact bioenergetics, transport, and neuronal function. We generated a transgenic stock containing 5xUAS-gfzf::GFP and drove its expression using the pan-neuronal synapsin1-Gal4 driver. Gfzf::GFP was observed throughout the neuron (Figure S6A). The localization of this molecule in cultured Drosophila S2 cells is also cytoplasmic (Dai et al., 2004Dai M.-S. Sun X.-X. Qin J. Smolik S.M. Lu H. Identification and characterization of a novel Drosophila melanogaster glutathione S-transferase-containing FLYWCH zinc finger protein.Gene. 2004; 342: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Regulation of mitochondrial size by Gfzf was also observed in other neuronal subtypes (Figures S6B–S6E). Interestingly, morphological changes in mitochondria were not observed at synaptic terminals or in glial clones (Figures S7A and S7B), suggesting that synaptic and glial mitochondrial size may be regulated by different mechanisms or other GSTs. Finally, we examined other organelles (lysosomes, endosomes, and peroxisomes) and observed no differences in distribution, number, and size of these vesicles between genotypes (Figures S7C–S7E). Together these data indicate that the Gfzf selectively regulates mitochondria in a pan-neuronal fashion and contributes to shaping the mitochondrial network in the axonal and cell body compartments. To explore the mechanism by which long mitochondria are generated in gfzf mutant clones, we examined the epistatic relationship between Gfzf and known fission and fusion factors. We found that increased expression of Drp1, Marf, or Pink1 and RNAi-mediated knockdown of Marf or Opa1 in adult neurons in vivo were sufficient to rescue the long mitochondrial phenotype of gfzf−/− mutants (Figures 4A and 4B ). Knockdown of the mitochondrial fusion factors Opa1 and Marf caused a complete rescue of the long mitochondrial phenotype, which was also observed in double mutants of gfzf−/−, Opa1+/− (Figure 4B). In each case, factors that increased mitochondrial length resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial number (Figure 4C). Interestingly, we found that promoting fusion by expression of Marf caused a biphasic shift in mitochondrial length and number (Figures 4D and 4E) and ultimately age-dependent neurodegeneration (Figure 4F). We simultaneously knocked down Marf in neurons overexpressing Gfzf, and no additive effect was observed, providing further epistatic evidence that Gfzf and Marf act in the same genetic pathway (Table S2). These observations indicate the increased mitochondrial length observed in gfzf−/− mutant clones can be reversed by altering factors in the classical fission-fusion pathway and suggest that increased mitochondrial length in gfzf null clones is caused by hyperfusion of mitochondria. The GST activity of Gfzf is therefore a novel potential upstream modulator of inner and outer mitochondrial membrane fusion. GSTs bind GSH to oxidized molecules and lipids for the purpose of cellular detoxification (Marí et al., 2009Marí M. Morales A. Colell A. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mitochondrial glutathione, a key survival antioxidant.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2685-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, Ribas et al., 2014Ribas V. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Glutathione and mitochondria.Front. Pharmacol. 2014; 5: 151Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), producing GSSG as a byproduct. We speculated that GSTs might modulate the capacity of Marf to drive mitochondrial fusion through a shift in the GSH:GSSG ratio. To test this possibility, we used two small-molecule treatments to change the redox state in cultured mouse primary cortical neurons: L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) to block GSH synthesis (Dai et al., 2004Dai M.-S. Sun X.-X. Qin J. Smolik S.M. Lu H. Identification and characterization of a novel Drosophila melanogaster glutathione S-transferase-containing FLYWCH zinc finger protein.Gene. 2004; 342: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and diamide (Dia) to induce the rapid conversion of GSH to GSSG. We found that 48 h of BSO treatment or 1 h of Dia treatment resulted in clear morphological changes of mitochondria in cortical neuron projections (Figures 5A and 5B ). Under these conditions, there was no evidence of cell death (Table S3). Mitochondria in neurites were significantly longer following BSO or Dia treatments compared to vehicle (Figure 5C), and the number of mitochondria was reduced compared to vehicle treatment (Figure 5D), phenocopying genetic in vivo data. These results show that reducing GSH:GSSG ratios initiates increases in mitochondrial length in mammalian neuronal projections. To explore how increased GSSG might modulate known components of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, we examined mitofusin 2 (MFN2) localization in primary neuron cultures. Treatment with BSO or Dia resulted in MFN2-positive puncta that were larger in size and fewer in number compared to vehicle conditions (Figure 5E). This suggests that heightened GSSG levels might act by increasing oligomerization of MFN2 to promote fusion, as described previously (Shutt et al., 2012Shutt T. Geoffrion M. Milne R. McBride H.M. The intracellular redox state is a core determinant of mitochondrial fusion.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis further showed that the redox state had no obvious effect on fission-fusion factors other than MFN2 (Figures 5F and 5G). These experiments support the notion that GST-dependent modulation of glutathione redox balance is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which MFN2 oligomerization can be altered to modulate mitochondrial dynamics in axons.

https://openalex.org/W2945040241,"Circulating serum amyloid A (SAA) is increased in various inflammatory conditions. The human SAA protein family comprises the acute phase SAA1/SAA2, known to activate a large set of innate and adaptive immune cells, and the constitutive SAA4. The liver synthesis of SAA1/SAA2 is well-established but there is still an open debate on extrahepatic SAA expression especially in macrophages. We aimed to investigate the ability of human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to express SAA1, SAA2 and SAA4 at both the transcriptional and protein levels, as previous studies almost exclusively dealt with monocytic cell lines. Monocytes and derived macrophages from healthy donors were stimulated under various conditions. In parallel with SAA, pro-inflammatory IL1A, IL1B and IL6 cytokine expression was assessed. While LPS alone was non-effective, a combined LPS/dexamethasone treatment induced SAA1 and to a lesser extent SAA2 transcription in human monocytes and macrophages. In contrast, as expected, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was strongly induced following stimulation with LPS, an effect which was dampened in the presence of dexamethasone. Furthermore, in monocytes polarized towards a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, SAA expression in response to LPS/dexamethasone was potentiated; a result mainly seen for SAA1. However, a major discrepancy was observed between SAA mRNA and intracellular protein levels under the experimental conditions used. Our results demonstrate that human monocytes and macrophages can express SAA genes, mainly SAA1 in response to an inflammatory environment. While SAA is considered as a member of a large cytokine network, its expression in the monocytes-macrophages in response to LPS-dexamethasone is strikingly different from that observed for classic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As monocytes-macrophages are major players in chronic inflammatory diseases, it may be hypothesized that SAA production from macrophages may contribute to the local inflammatory microenvironment, especially when macrophages are compactly organized in granulomas as in sarcoidosis."

This study aimed at quantifying ESBL/pAmpC-E. coli occurrence and transfer in Italy's broiler production pyramid. Three production chains of an integrated broiler company were investigated. Cloacal swabs were taken from parent stock chickens and offspring broiler flocks in four fattening farms per chain. Carcasses from sampled broiler flocks were collected at slaughterhouse. Samples were processed on selective media, and E. coli colonies were screened for ESBL/pAmpC production. ESBL/pAmpC genes and E. coli phylogroups were determined by PCR and sequencing. Average pairwise overlap of ESBL/pAmpC E. coli gene and phylogroup occurrences between subsequent production stages was estimated using the proportional similarity index, modelling uncertainty in a Monte Carlo simulation setting. In total, 820 samples were processed, from which 513 ESBL/pAmpC E. coli isolates were obtained. We found a high prevalence (92.5%, 95%CI 72.1-98.3%) in day-old parent stock chicks, in which blaCMY-2 predominated; prevalence then dropped to 20% (12.9-29.6%) at laying phase. In fattening broilers, prevalence was 69.2% (53.6-81.3%) at the start of production, 54.2% (38.9-68.6%) at slaughter time, and 61.3% (48.1-72.9%) in carcasses. Significantly decreasing and increasing trends for respectively blaCMY-2 and blaCTX-M-1 gene occurrences were found across subsequent production stages. ESBL/pAmpC E. coli genetic background appeared complex and bla-gene/phylogroup associations indicated clonal and horizontal transmission. Modelling revealed that the average transfer of ESBL/pAmpC E. coli genes between subsequent production stages was 47.7% (42.3-53.4%). We concluded that ESBL/pAmpC E. coli in the broiler production pyramid is prevalent, with substantial transfer between subsequent production levels."
https://openalex.org/W2945194478,"Uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) are important DNA repair enzymes that excise uracil from DNA, yielding an abasic site. Recently, UdgX, an unconventional UDG with extremely tight binding to DNA containing uracil, was discovered. The structure of UdgX from Mycobacterium smegmatis in complex with DNA shows an overall similarity to that of family 4 UDGs except for a protruding loop at the entrance of the uracil-binding pocket. Surprisingly, H109 in the loop was found to make a covalent bond to the abasic site to form a stable intermediate, while the excised uracil remained in the pocket of the active site. H109 functions as a nucleophile to attack the oxocarbenium ion, substituting for the catalytic water molecule found in other UDGs. To our knowledge, this change from a catalytic water attack to a direct nucleophilic attack by the histidine residue is unprecedented. UdgX utilizes a unique mechanism of protecting cytotoxic abasic sites from exposure to the cellular environment. Structural analysis of uracil DNA glycosylases in complex with DNA reveals that conserved H109 acts as a nucleophile to attack the oxocarbenium ion and makes a covalent bond to the abasic site after uracil excision to form a stable intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2944970584,"Homologous recombination (HR) is considered a major driving force of evolution because it generates and expands genetic diversity. Evidence of HR between coinfecting herpesvirus DNA genomes can be found frequently both in vitro and in clinical isolates. Each herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication compartment (RC) derives from a single incoming genome and maintains a specific territory within the nucleus. This raises intriguing questions about where and when coinfecting viral genomes interact. To study the spatiotemporal requirements for intergenomic recombination, we developed an assay with dual-color FISH that enables detection of HR between different pairs of coinfecting HSV-1 genomes. Our results revealed that HR increases intermingling of RCs derived from different genomes. Furthermore, inhibition of RC movement reduces the rate of HR events among coinfecting viruses. Finally, we observed correlation between nuclear size and the number of RCs per nucleus. Our findings suggest that both viral replication and recombination are subject to nuclear spatial constraints. Other DNA viruses and cellular DNA are likely to encounter similar restrictions.-Tomer, E., Cohen, E. M., Drayman, N., Afriat, A., Weitzman, M. D., Zaritsky, A., Kobiler, O.

https://openalex.org/W2944870578,"Progression through states of pluripotency is required for cells in early mammalian embryos to transition away from heightened self-renewal and toward competency for lineage specification. Here, we use a CRISPR mutagenesis screen in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to identify unexpected roles for nuclear export and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis during the exit out of the naive state of pluripotency. Mutation of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump encoded by Atp2b1 increased intracellular Ca2+ such that it overcame effects of intracellular Ca2+ reduction, which is required for naive exit. Persistent self-renewal of ESCs was supported both in Atp2b1−/− Tcf7l1−/− double-knockout ESCs passaged in defined media alone (no LIF or inhibitors) and in wild-type cells passaged in media containing only calcitonin and a GSK3 inhibitor. These new findings suggest a central role for intracellular Ca2+ in safeguarding naive pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2945541944,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) in 3' untranslated regions (3' UTR) plays an important role in regulating transcript abundance, localization, and interaction with microRNAs. Length-variation of 3'UTRs by APA contributes to efficient proliferation of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated APA in single cancer cells and tumor microenvironment cells to understand the physiological implication of APA in different cell types. We analyzed APA patterns and the expression level of genes from the 515 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from 11 breast cancer patients. Although the overall 3'UTR length of individual genes was distributed equally in tumor and non-tumor cells, we found a differential pattern of polyadenylation in gene sets between tumor and non-tumor cells. In addition, we found a differential pattern of APA across tumor types using scRNA-seq data from 3 glioblastoma patients and 1 renal cell carcinoma patients. In detail, 1,176 gene sets and 53 genes showed the distinct pattern of 3'UTR shortening and over-expression as signatures for five cell types including B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, myeloid cells, stromal cells, and breast cancer cells. Functional categories of gene sets for cellular proliferation demonstrated concordant regulation of APA and gene expression specific to cell types. The expression of APA genes in breast cancer was significantly correlated with the clinical outcome of earlier stage breast cancer patients. We identified cell type-specific APA in single cells, which allows the identification of cell types based on 3'UTR length variation in combination with gene expression. Specifically, an immune-specific APA signature in breast cancer could be utilized as a prognostic marker of early stage breast cancer."

In this study we evaluate the diagnostic image quality in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and time-of-flight angiographic MR sequences when using a flexible, navigator-based prospective motion correction system (iMOCO).Five healthy volunteers were scanned during different movement scenarios with and without (+/-) iMOCO activated. An experienced neuroradiologist graded images for image quality criteria (grey-white-matter discrimination, basal ganglia, and small structure and vessel delineation), and general image quality on a four-grade scale.In scans with deliberate motion, there was a significant improvement in the image quality with iMOCO compared to the scans without iMOCO in both general image impression (T1 p<0.01, T2 p<0.01, TOF p = 0.03) and in anatomical grading (T1 p<0.01, T2 p<0.01, TOF p = 0.01). Subjective image quality was considered non-diagnostic in 91% of the scans with motion -iMOCO, but only in 4% of the scans with motion +iMOCO. iMOCO performed best in the T1-weighted sequence and least well in the angiography sequence. iMOCO was not shown to have any negative effect on diagnostic image quality, as no significant difference in diagnostic quality was seen between scans -iMOCO and +iMOCO with no deliberate movement.The evaluation showed that iMOCO enables substantial improvements in image quality in scans affected by subject movement, recovering important diagnostic information in an otherwise unusable scan."
https://openalex.org/W2946132400,"Introduction Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major health concern and have substantial effects on morbidity and mortality and increase healthcare costs. We investigated the effect of a hospital-wide program for the prevention of HAIs on additional length of stay (LOS). Methods We analyzed data from a prospective, single-center, quasi-experimental study with two surveillance periods before and after implementation of an infection prevention intervention program. HAI diagnosis was made according to surveillance definition criteria established by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A multistate model was used to estimate additional LOS for patients with HAI in both surveillance periods. Results During the first and second periods, 1,568 and 2,336 HAIs were identified among 26,943 and 35,211 patients, respectively. For HAI patients exclusively treated in a general ward, additional LOS was 8.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 6.8–10.0) days in the first period and 9.6 (95% CI: 8.3–11.0) days in the second period (p = 0.26). For HAI patients treated in both an intensive care unit (ICU) and a general ward, additional LOS was 8.1 (95% CI: 6.3–9.9) days in the first period to 7.3 (95% CI: 6.1–8.5) days in the second period (p = 0.47). Conclusions Healthcare-associated infections prolong LOS. A hospital-wide infection control program did not alter the prolongation of LOS."
https://openalex.org/W2944941733,"Water point mapping databases, generated through surveys of water sources such as wells and boreholes, are now available in many low and middle income countries, but often suffer from incomplete coverage. To address the partial coverage in such databases and gain insights into spatial patterns of water resource use, this study investigated the use of a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach to predict the geospatial distribution of drinking-water sources, using two types of unimproved sources in Kenya as illustration. Geographic locations of unprotected dug wells and surface water sources derived from the Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx) database were used as inputs to the MaxEnt model alongside geological/hydrogeological and socio-economic covariates. Predictive performance of the MaxEnt models was high (all > 0.9) based on Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUC), and the predicted spatial distribution of water point was broadly consistent with household use of these unimproved drinking-water sources reported in household survey and census data. In developing countries where geospatial datasets concerning drinking-water sources often have necessarily limited resolution or incomplete spatial coverage, the modelled surface can provide an initial indication of the geography of unimproved drinking-water sources to target unserved populations and assess water source vulnerability to contamination and hazards."
https://openalex.org/W2945565118,"Background Image-based blood flow simulations have been increasingly applied to investigate intracranial aneurysm (IA) hemodynamics. However, the acceptance among physicians remains limited due to the high variability in the underlying assumptions and quality of results. Methods To evaluate the vessel segmentation as one of the most important sources of error, the international Multiple Aneurysms AnaTomy CHallenge 2018 (MATCH) was announced. 26 research groups from 13 different countries segmented three datasets, which contained five IAs in total. Based on these segmentations, 73 time-dependent blood flow simulations under consistent conditions were carried out. Afterwards, relevant flow and shear parameters (e.g., neck inflow rate, parent vessel flow rate, spatial mean velocity, and wall shear stress) were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results Regarding the entire vasculature, the variability of the segmented vessel radius is 0.13 mm, consistent and independent of the local vessel radius. However, the centerline velocity shows increased variability in more distal vessels. Focusing on the aneurysms, clear differences in morphological and hemodynamic parameters were observed. The quantification of the segmentation-induced variability showed approximately a 14% difference among the groups for the parent vessel flow rate. Regarding the mean aneurysmal velocity and the neck inflow rate, a variation of 30% and 46% was observed, respectively. Finally, time-averaged wall shear stresses varied between 28% and 51%, depending on the aneurysm in question. Conclusions MATCH reveals the effect of state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on subsequent hemodynamic simulations for IA research. The observed variations may lead to an inappropriate interpretation of the simulation results and thus, can lead to inappropriate conclusions by physicians. Therefore, accurate segmentation of the region of interest is necessary to obtain reliable and clinically helpful flow information."

These household contacts, particularly children, should receive preventive therapy to prevent them from falling ill. However, few people receive preventive therapy worldwide. We sought to determine whether a community-based accompaniment intervention could improve tuberculosis contact management. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of household contacts of tuberculosis patients who initiated treatment during September 2015-June 2016 in Lima, Peru. Enrolled households received an intervention comprising home visits, transport vouchers, assistance coordinating evaluation procedures, and adherence support during preventive therapy. To evaluate the impact of the intervention, we conducted retrospective chart reviews of all patients initiating treatment during 6-month baseline and intervention periods. Results We enrolled 314 household contacts of 109 index patients. Of these, 283 (90%) completed evaluation, and 4 (1%) were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Preventive therapy was prescribed for 35/38 (92%) contacts 0–19 years old who were eligible under Peruvian guidelines. Preventive therapy was also prescribed for 6/26 (23%) contacts with unknown eligibility due to lack of a tuberculin skin test (TST), and 20/69 (29%) who were ineligible either because of a negative TST result or exposure to a drug-resistant or extrapulmonary case. Of the 61 contacts who were prescribed preventive therapy, 57 (93%) initiated treatment, and 51 (91%) completed treatment. The proportion of contacts who completed evaluation increased from 42% during the baseline period to 71% during the evaluation period (risk ratio [RR] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.41–2.13). The proportion of contacts who initiated preventive therapy increased from 15% to 40% (RR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.42–4.22). Conclusion Accompaniment of TB patient households greatly improved the evaluation of household contacts for TB and increased the use of preventive therapy."

Kicking is a soccer fundamental, which depends on many different and complex factors (technique, foot-ball interaction, ball flight, etc.). Therefore, it is important to identify players that are able to perform faster kicks using both dominant and non-dominant leg. The current study investigated some basic variables of different soccer kicking speed and their relevance to success in youth soccer academy. 119 players from the first and the second division participated to this study. They were randomly divided into age groups (U-15, U-17, and U19) and team status (first team, reserves). The diagnostic ability of the different ball kicking speed tests in capturing differences between first team players and reserves among different age categories were computed using the receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results demonstrated that first team players achieved better results when comparing to reserves in each category. In addition, differences were greater in the U-15 and the U-17 than in the U-19 age group. In conclusion, ball kicking speed could be one of the possible identification tools to evaluate players' success in youth soccer."

While the field has made tremendous progress in understanding the effect of particle physicochemical properties on particle-macrophage interactions, it is not known how macrophage functions like cytokine production are affected while presenting active ligands on particles with altered physical properties. Moreover, it is unknown if ligand presentation through an altered particle shape can elicit differential macrophage cytokine responses and if responses are ligand dependent. Therefore, we investigated the influence of geometric particle presentation of diverse ligands, bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulin-G and ovalbumin, on macrophage inflammatory cytokine response. Our results indicate that for similar ligand densities, ligand presentation on rods enhanced production of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) compared to spheres regardless of the nature of the ligand and its cellular receptor. Surprisingly, TNF-α responses were affected by ligand density in a shape-dependent manner and did not correlate to total particle-macrophage association. This study demonstrates the ability of geometric manipulation of particle ligands to alter macrophage cytokine response irrespective of the nature of the ligand."

In this study, we identified a core unit consisting of Met7 and Leu90 in NAC1’s N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–130), which is critical for its homodimerization and stability. Furthermore, using a combination of computational analysis of the NAC1 dimerization interface and high-throughput screening (HTS) for small molecules that inhibit NAC1 homodimerization, we identified a compound (NIC3) that selectively binds to the conserved Leu-90 of NAC1 and prevents its homodimerization, leading to proteasomal NAC1 degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate that NIC3-mediated down-regulation of NAC1 protein sensitizes drug-resistant tumor cells to conventional chemotherapy and enhances the antimetastatic effect of the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab both in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we identified a core unit consisting of Met7 and Leu90 in the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–130) of NAC1, which is critical for its dimerization and stability. To test our hypothesis that inhibiting the dimerization of NAC1 can destabilize NAC1 protein and promote its degradation, we searched for chemicals able to inhibit the homodimerization of NAC1 using a combination approach of computational analysis of the dimerization interface and high-throughput screening. Here, we report a compound, NIC3, that has the ability to selectively bind with the conserved Leu90 of NAC1 and to inhibit NAC1 dimerization, resulting in proteasomal degradation of the NAC1 protein. We further assessed the therapeutic potential of NIC3 in combination therapy. We showed both in vitro and in vivo that down-regulation of NAC1 protein by NIC3 significantly overcame tumor cell resistance to conventional chemotherapy and enhanced antimetastatic efficacy of the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. The results of this study not only underscore the potential of NAC1 as an anticancer target but also demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of the small-molecule inhibitors of NAC1 dimerization in cancer treatment. The conserved BTB/POZ domain is essential for NAC1 dimerization, which plays important roles in tumor development (11Nakayama K. Nakayama N. Davidson B. Sheu J.J. Jinawath N. Santillan A. Salani R. Bristow R.E. Morin P.J. Kurman R.J. Wang T.L. Shih I.-M. A BTB/POZ protein, NAC-1, is related to tumor recurrence and is essential for tumor growth and survival.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To study this, we first assessed the association of the two forms of NAC1 proteins tagged with either V5 or Myc epitopes by co-IP after their coexpression in HEK-293T cells. Fig. 1A demonstrates the association of V5-NAC1 with Myc-NAC1 in the cells. To further assess the interaction between two tagged NAC1 proteins, we used bacterially expressed GST-NAC1 protein in an in vitro dimerization assay. Fig. 1B shows that with increasing concentrations of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a noncleavable bivalent chemical cross-linker that is commonly used to detect direct protein–protein interactions, the intensity of NAC1 monomers was reduced gradually accompanied by the appearance of the expected NAC1 homodimers. NAC1 homodimers could not be detected in the bacterially expressed NAC1(ΔN130) protein (BTB/POZ domain deletion) (Fig. 1C). To identify the sites in BTB/POZ domain required for association between the two tagged NAC1 proteins, contacts between atoms of the protein were examined using the Protein Contacts module in Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Among them, one dimerization core unit consisting of four residues, Met7 and Leu90 from one chain and the same residues from another chain, appears to be crucial for NAC1 dimerization (Fig. S1, A and B). To further delineate the role of binding residues (Met7 and Leu90) in dimerization, using a site-directed mutagenesis method we generated two different tagged NAC1 mutants in which Leu90 sites were altered to Arg. We found that single Leu90 mutation decreased NAC1 dimer formation, and double Leu90 mutations further decreased NAC1 dimerization (Figs. 1D and S2A). Fig. S2B shows that with increasing concentrations of DSS the intensity of NAC1 monomers was reduced gradually and was accompanied by the appearance of the expected NAC1 homodimers; NAC1 homodimers could not be detected in the NAC1(S91A) protein. Introduction of Leu90 mutation led to a significant reduction of NAC1 protein amount in HEK-293T cells, and reduction of NAC1 protein caused by Leu90 mutation could be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1E). The pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that NAC1 mutant (L90A) had a shorter half-life than WT NAC1 (4.6 h versus 20 min) (Fig. 1F). Notably, ubiquitination of the NAC1 mutant (L90A) was significantly increased as compared with WT NAC1 (Fig. S2C). These results suggest that the dimerization core unit of NAC1 consisting of Leu90 and Met7 is critical for the formation of stable NAC1 dimers; disrupting this core unit would suppress NAC1 dimerization and destabilize this protein. To search for small-molecule compounds able to target the dimeric interface of NAC1, we screened ∼200,000 compounds using an in silico docking approach (Fig. 2A). Of the 50 hits, one compound, NIC3 (Fig. 2B), was chosen for the current study based on the molecular docking showing that the nitrogen atoms in NIC3 form hydrogen bonds with the critical dimerization core residue Leu90, and this confers this compound druglike properties (Figs. 2, C–E, and S3). Validation of NIC3 as an inhibitor of NAC1 dimerization was carried out using co-IP assay. We showed that NIC3 could abolish co-IP of ectopic NAC1 protein tagged with V5 or Myc epitopes (Fig. 2F). Using the purified NAC1 protein (GST-NAC1) and nondenaturing PAGE analysis, we also showed the inhibition of formation of NAC1 dimerization by NIC3 in vitro (Fig. 2G). In these experiments, we incubated the bacterially expressed proteins with increasing concentrations of NIC3 and demonstrated that NAC1 dimerization was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. To determine how NIC3 docks into NAC1, we prepared several chemical probes (Fig. S4). Structure–activity relationship studies revealed that nitrogen atoms are essential for inhibition of the NAC1 dimerization as the NIC3 treatment was able to dissociate the dimeric NAC1 into monomers, whereas analogue 1 could not inhibit the formation of NAC1 dimerization and decrease NAC1 level (Fig. 3, A–C). Based on this information, we synthesized a positive probe (PP) and a negative probe (NP) with biotin and an ester bond linker (Fig. 3D). We found that the biotin-tagged positive probe possessed the ability to effectively inhibit NAC1 expression, whereas the biotin-tagged negative probe did not have this ability at the same concentration (Fig. 3E), and reduction of NAC1 protein caused by PP could be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, NAC1 dimerization was inhibited, and ubiquitination of the NAC1 protein was significantly increased by PP (Fig. 3, G and H). In co-IP experiments, we detected the association of NAC1 with PP but not with NP (Fig. 4A). To determine whether NIC3 directly binds to NAC1, we generated a bacterially expressed GST-NAC1 protein. The purified GST-NAC1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of PP bound to biotin-GSH particles followed by immunoblotting with biotin antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, the intensity of GST-NAC1 increased with increasing concentrations of PP. However, NIC3 lost its inhibitory effect on NAC1 dimerization when the nitrogen atoms were replaced with oxygen atoms (Fig. 3B). Molecular docking demonstrated that Leu90, Ser91, and Met92 form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atoms of NIC3 (Fig. 2, C–E). To determine which of these residues are critical for the binding with NIC3, we mutated these leucine, serine, and methionine residues of NAC1 to alanine residues (Fig. 4, C and D). Among these mutants, we found that L90A mutant completely lost the ability to bind to NIC3, whereas S91A and M92A retained binding to NIC3 in a manner similar to WT NAC1 (Fig. 4, C and D). To determine the effects of those mutations on NAC1 structure, we calculated and compared the backbone root-mean-square deviations between the WT NAC1 and each of the mutants. None of the mutants showed significant structural changes, suggesting that neither L90A nor other NAC1 mutants tested in the studies have significant effects on the NAC1 monomer structure as compared with the WT (Fig. S1, C and D). These results imply that NIC3 can efficiently and specifically dock into NAC1 and that Leu90 of NAC1 is essential for its interaction with NIC3.Figure 4Leu90 of NAC1 is essential for its binding to NIC3. A, HeLa cells were incubated with 20 μm PP or NP for 24 h. The lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with a biotin antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were examined by immunoblotting (IB) with an NAC1 antibody. B, GST-NAC1 fusion protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of PP for 12 h at 4 °C followed by immunoblotting with biotin or GST. C and D, HEK-293T cells were transfected with V5-NAC1, V5-NAC1(L90A), V5-NAC1(S91A), or V5-NAC1(M92A) plasmids or Myc-NAC1, Myc-NAC1(L90A), Myc-NAC1(S91A), or Myc-NAC1(M92A) plasmids for 12 h followed by treatment with PP (20 μm) or NP (20 μm) for 24 h and with 5 μm MG132 for an additional 6 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a biotin antibody followed by immunoblotting for V5 or Myc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the dimerization of NAC1 contributed to its stability (Fig. 1), we next wanted to know whether inhibiting NAC1 dimerization by NIC3 would facilitate proteasomal degradation of NAC1 protein. In these experiments, we first treated HeLa cells with a series of concentrations of NIC3 for different periods of time and then analyzed the level of endogenous NAC1 protein using immunoblotting. Fig. 5, A and B, show that NIC3 treatment caused a reduction of NAC1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Similar effects of NIC3 on the NAC1 level were observed in SKOV3 cells (Fig. S2D). The mRNA level of NAC1 was not affected by NIC3 treatment, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5C). NIC3 treatment also reduced the level of ectopic V5-tagged NAC1 in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 5D). The reduction of NAC1 protein in the NIC3-treated cells could be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5E). Fig. 5F shows that the turnover of NAC1 protein was greatly facilitated in the cells treated with NIC3 as compared with that in the control cells (t½, 53 versus 560 min), as measured by pulse-chase experiments. Additionally, NIC3 treatment enhanced the ubiquitination of NAC1 protein (Figs. 5G and S2C). To confirm these findings, we examined the effects of NIC3 on the NAC1-regulated proteins HIF-1α and Gadd45-interacting protein 1 (16Nakayama K. Nakayama N. Wang T.L. Shih I.-M.

We found that NIC3 treatment indeed affected HIF-1α and Gadd45-interacting protein 1 (Fig. S9), further supporting the role of NIC3 in accelerating the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of NAC1 protein via prohibiting its dimerization.

Therefore, we determined the effects of NIC3 on tumor-cell sensitivity to cisplatin and Adriamycin, two commonly used anticancer drugs, in drug-resistant cancer cell lines. NIC3 itself did not show any cytotoxicity in the cancer cell lines until the concentration reached 100–1000 μm (Fig. S5). To test whether NIC3 can sensitize drug-resistant tumor cells to cisplatin or Adriamycin, we used the sublethal concentration of 20 μm, which can inhibit NAC1 expression significantly. The human MCF-7/ADR (Adriamycin-resistant) and HeLa/DDP (cisplatin-resistant) cell lines were used in these experiments. We observed that combination treatment of NIC3 with Adriamycin or cisplatin significantly augmented the cytotoxic effect in the resistant cancer cell lines (Fig. 6, A–D). The increased cytotoxicity seen in the cells treated with the combination of cisplatin or Adriamycin with NIC3 was associated with enhanced apoptosis, as evidenced by elevated levels of cleaved PARP (Fig. 6, E and F). We also showed that the combination of cisplatin or Adriamycin with NIC3 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death in the human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 (Fig. S6, A–C). By contrast, NIC3 did not show a sensitizing effect in ES-2, an ovarian cancer cell line that has low intrinsic NAC1 expression (Fig. S7, A and B). Furthermore, NIC3 can also reverse drug"

Hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP) is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor metastasis. Here, using HEK293T and HeLa cells, along with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, live-cell imaging, and protein-stability assays, we report that HPIP expression oscillates throughout the cell cycle and that its depletion delays cell division. We noted that by utilizing its D box and IR domain, HPIP plays a dual role both as a substrate and inhibitor, respectively, of the APC/C complex. We observed that HPIP enhances the G2/M transition of the cell cycle by transiently stabilizing cyclin B1 by preventing APC/C–Cdc20–mediated degradation, thereby ensuring timely mitotic entry. We also uncovered that HPIP associates with the mitotic spindle and that its depletion leads to the formation of multiple mitotic spindles and chromosomal abnormalities, results in defects in cytokinesis, and delays mitotic exit. Our findings uncover HPIP as both a substrate and an inhibitor of APC/C–Cdc20 that maintains the temporal stability of cyclin B1 during the G2/M transition and thereby controls mitosis and cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2945572186,"Most viruses are known to spontaneously generate defective viral genomes (DVG) due to errors during replication. These DVGs are subgenomic and contain deletions that render them unable to complete a full replication cycle in the absence of a co-infecting, non-defective helper virus. DVGs, especially of the copyback type, frequently observed with paramyxoviruses, have been recognized to be important triggers of the antiviral innate immune response. DVGs have therefore gained interest for their potential to alter the attenuation and immunogenicity of vaccines. To investigate this potential, accurate identification and quantification of DVGs is essential. Conventional methods, such as RT-PCR, are labor intensive and will only detect primer sequence-specific species. High throughput sequencing (HTS) is much better suited for this undertaking. Here, we present an HTS-based algorithm called DVG-profiler to identify and quantify all DVG sequences in an HTS data set generated from a virus preparation. DVG-profiler identifies DVG breakpoints relative to a reference genome and reports the directionality of each segment from within the same read. The specificity and sensitivity of the algorithm was assessed using both in silico data sets as well as HTS data obtained from parainfluenza virus 5, Sendai virus and mumps virus preparations. HTS data from the latter were also compared with conventional RT-PCR data and with data obtained using an alternative algorithm. The data presented here demonstrate the high specificity, sensitivity, and robustness of DVG-profiler. This algorithm was implemented within an open source cloud-based computing environment for analyzing HTS data. DVG-profiler might prove valuable not only in basic virus research but also in monitoring live attenuated vaccines for DVG content and to assure vaccine lot to lot consistency."
https://openalex.org/W2945738993,"The development of an effective vaccine against HIV infection remains a global priority. Dendritic cell (DC)-based HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine is a promising approach which aims at optimizing the HIV-specific immune response using primed DCs to promote and enhance both the cellular and humoral arms of immunity. Since the Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein (EboGP) has strong DC-targeting ability, we investigated whether EboGP is able to direct HIV particles towards DCs efficiently and promote potent HIV-specific immune responses. Our results indicate that the incorporation of EboGP into non-replicating virus-like particles (VLPs) enhances their ability to target human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Also, a mucin-like domain deleted EboGP (EboGPΔM) can further enhanced the MDDCs and MDMs-targeting ability. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of EboGP on HIV immunogenicity in mice, and the results revealed a significantly stronger HIV-specific humoral immune response when immunized with EboGP-pseudotyped HIV VLPs compared with those immunized with HIV VLPs. Splenocytes harvested from mice immunized with EboGP-pseudotyped HIV VLPs secreted increased levels of macrophage inflammatory proteins-1α (MIP-1α) and IL-4 upon stimulation with HIV Env and/or Gag peptides compared with those harvested from mice immunized with HIV VLPs. Collectively, this study provides evidence for the first time that the incorporation of EboGP in HIV VLPs can facilitate DC and macrophage targeting and induce more potent immune responses against HIV."

Because N7-CH3 dG is unstable, leading to deglycosylation and ring-opening, its miscoding potential is not well-understood. Here, we employed a 2′-fluoro isostere approach to synthesize an oligonucleotide containing an analog of this lesion (N7-CH3 2′-F dG) and examined its miscoding potential with four Y-family translesion synthesis DNA polymerases (pols): human pol (hpol) η, hpol κ, and hpol ι and Dpo4 from the archaeal thermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus. We found that hpol η and Dpo4 can bypass the N7-CH3 2′-F dG adduct, albeit with some stalling, but hpol κ is strongly blocked at this lesion site, whereas hpol ι showed no distinction with the lesion and the control templates. hpol η yielded the highest level of misincorporation opposite the adduct by inserting dATP or dTTP. Moreover, hpol η did not extend well past an N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dT mispair. MS-based sequence analysis confirmed that hpol η catalyzes mainly error-free incorporation of dC, with misincorporation of dA and dG in 5–10% of products. We conclude that N7-CH3 2′-F dG and, by inference, N7-CH3 dG have miscoding and mutagenic potential.

Despite its abundance, N7-CH3 dG has been largely ignored in favor of other alkylated bases due to its instability to depurination and base-catalyzed ring-opening. It has been assumed that N7-CH3 dG is not miscoding because it should not alter the canonical Watson–Crick hydrogen-bonding pattern (32Lee S. Bowman B.R. Ueno Y. Wang S. Verdine G.L.

However, the techniques that were used to reach this conclusion were not very sensitive compared with modern methods, and only a few model DNA polymerases were considered (21Boysen G. Pachkowski B.F.

Even a low level of misincorporation across a very abundant lesion would be similar in risk to a highly miscoding but rare lesion. Koag et al. (37Koag M.C. Kou Y. Ouzon-Shubeita H. Lee S. Transition-state destabilization reveals how human DNA polymerase β proceeds across the chemically unstable lesion N7-methylguanine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24966350): 8755-876610.1093/nar/gku554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) employed an isosteric fluorine transition-state destabilization approach to stabilize the glycosidic bond, to avoid depurination and mild deprotection conditions to prevent ring-opening to N7-CH3 FAPY dG. Although the lesion inhibited catalysis by pol β, replication was reported to be highly accurate (i.e. dCTP was inserted opposite N7-CH3 dG) (37Koag M.C. Kou Y. Ouzon-Shubeita H. Lee S. Transition-state destabilization reveals how human DNA polymerase β proceeds across the chemically unstable lesion N7-methylguanine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24966350): 8755-876610.1093/nar/gku554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We used this 2′-fluoro analog, N7-CH3 2′-F dG, and analyzed its miscoding potential with several Y-family translesion synthesis polymerases (human pols (hpols) η, κ, and ι and Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4). N7-CH3 2′-F dG caused miscoding with hpol η and has mutagenic potential, which we infer is the case with N7-CH3 dG. A fluorine analog of the lesion (N7-CH3 2′-F dG) was prepared by modifying the approach of Lee et al. (32Lee S. Bowman B.R. Ueno Y. Wang S. Verdine G.L. Synthesis and structure of duplex DNA containing the genotoxic nucleobase lesion N7-methylguanine.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130 (18686953): 11570-1157110.1021/ja8025328Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Scheme S1 and Figs. S1–S4). The 23-mer oligonucleotides were characterized by LC-ESI-MS (Figs. S5B and S6A). The N7-CH3 2′-F dG–containing oligonucleotide was resistant to cleavage by FPG glycosylase, further confirming its identity as the intact lesion rather than the ring-opened N7-CH3 FAPY 2′-F dG oligonucleotide, which is a substrate for this glycosylase (Fig. S6B). Following alkaline treatment to form the FAPY lesion, FPG glycosylase cleaved the lesion (Fig. S6B). We conclude that the desired N7-CH3 2′-F dG lesion was present and that the two potential problems, depurination and ring-opening, had been avoided. Four Y-family DNA polymerases were studied (hpol η, hpol κ, hpol ι, and Dpo4). hpol η and Dpo4 were the most effective of these in producing full-length extension products, although they both stalled following the P + 3 and P + 2 products, respectively (Fig. 1, A and D). In contrast, hpol κ stalled at the adduct (Fig. 1B), and hpol ι showed no distinction between the control templates and the adduct, stalling before the dG templates and the lesion (Fig. 1C). To determine the insertions across the adduct, primer extension experiments were done with individual dNTPs. hpol η and Dpo4 were highly error-prone with all three templates examined (Fig. 2, A and D). Dpo4 did not misincorporate dATP in the 2′-F dG control. In contrast with these two polymerases, hpol κ and hpol ι incorporated only the correct dCTP for all three templates under the same conditions (Fig. 2, B and C), and these two polymerases were not examined further. Rates for dCTP insertion by hpol κ were estimated (in single-nucleotide incorporation experiments) to be 1.9 min−1 for dG, 1.4 min−1 for 2′-F dG, and 0.9 min−1 for N7-CH3 2′-F dG (i.e. there was a ∼2-fold reduction in the rates when hpol κ encountered the lesion). For hpol ι, the rates of insertion of dCTP across the templates were 0.51 min−1 for dG, 0.56 min−1 for 2′-F dG, and 0.47 min−1 for N7-CH3 2′-F dG. Thus, the rates when hpol ι encountered the lesion were comparable with the control templates. Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed for hpol η and Dpo4 (Table 1, Table 2). The catalytic efficiencies and misincorporation frequencies for dG and 2′-F dG were comparable, as noted previously (38Zhao L. Christov P.P. Kozekov I.D. Pence M.G. Pallan P.S. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. Replication of N2,3-ethenoguanine by DNA polymerases.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2012; 51 (22488769): 5466-546910.1002/anie.201109004Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that fluorine had little or no impact on polymerase recognition. With all three templates, hpol η preferred to insert dCTP relative to other dNTPs (Table 1 and Fig. 3). However, there was a 2-fold lower efficiency for incorporation of dCTP at the N7-CH3 2′-F dG lesion compared with dG and 2′-F dG. The efficiency for misinsertion of dATP was similar for all three templates, but the misinsertion frequency ∼2-fold higher with N7-CH3 2′-F dG (Table 1 and Figs. 3 and S7). The catalytic efficiency for dGTP misincorporation was ∼3-fold lower for the N7-CH3 2′-F dG lesion (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The efficiency for dTTP misincorporation was 3.5-fold greater for the N7-CH3 2′-F dG lesion compared with the control templates, and the misincorporation frequency was 5- and 11-fold higher relative to dG and 2′-F dG (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Thus, the misincorporation frequency for N7-CH3 2′-F dG was in the order dTTP > dATP > dGTP, ranging from 1 to 4% (Figs.

Reactions were done at 37 °C for 5–10 min by incubating 120 nm primer–template DNA complex with varying concentrations of hpol η. For A, B, and C, 8 nmol of hpol η was used, and the reaction was done for 10 min. In the case of D, we used 8 nmol of hpol η was used, and the reaction was done for 5 min; for E, 10 nmol of hpol η was used, and the reaction was conducted for 5 min; and for F, 5 nmol of hpol η was used, and the reaction was conducted for 5 min, varying concentrations of dGTP and dTTP.

There was a 4-fold lower efficiency for insertion across the lesion compared with 2′-F dG (Figs. S8 and S9). The efficiencies for incorporating other dNTPs were in the order dATP > dTTP > dGTP (Table 2). Steady-state insertion kinetics provides information on dNTP insertion across a lesion but does not provide information about extension past the lesion. Steady-state kinetics were done for further extension after the correct bp (N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dC) and a mispair (N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dT). dT was used as the misincorporated base opposite the lesion because it showed the greatest misincorporation frequency in the steady-state insertion kinetics with hpol η (Table 1). With the mispairs (2′-F dG:dT and N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dT), only dATP was incorporated opposite the next residue (dT) (Fig. S10). The efficiency of hpol η for incorporating dATP past the mispair was ∼4-fold lower for the lesion N7-CH3 2′-F dG than 2′-F dG, indicating some resistance to extension past the mispair (Table 3 and Fig. 5). On the other hand, the efficiency of hpol η for inserting dATP past the N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dC bp was 21-fold higher than the 2′-F dG:dC control, indicating that the correct pair was preferentially extended past the lesion. For the 2′-F dG control and lesion, dCTP had a similar efficiency of misincorporation past the correct pair. Finally, dTTP was misincorporated with a 6-fold higher efficiency for the lesion than the 2′-F dG control (Table 3 and Fig. 5).Table 3Steady-state kinetics of single nucleotide extension past 2′-F dG:dC, 2′-F dG:dT and N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dC, and N7-CH3 2′-F dG:dT base pairs by hpol ηTemplate basePairingdNTPkcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1μmμm−1 min−12′-F dGMispairdATP1.1 ± 0.14.2 ± 1.20.26 ± 0.08N7-CH3 2′-F dGdATP0.49 ± 0.047.1 ± 2.40.07 ± 0.022′-F dGCorrectdATP1.1 ± 0.115 ± 30.07 ± 0.02N7-CH3 2′-F dGdATP2.1 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.32′-F dGCorrectdCTP0.95 ± 0.065.5 ± 2.20.17 ± 0.07N7-CH3 2′-F dGdCTP0.75 ± 0.034.6 ± 1.10.16 ± 0.042′-F dGCorrectdGTP2.1 ± 0.066.9 ± 1.00.3 ± 0.1N7-CH3 2′-F dGdGTP0.97 ± 0.033.8 ± 0.70.26 ± 0.12′-F dGCorrectdTTP1.0 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.70.3 ± 0.10N7-CH3 2′-F dGdTTP1.6 ± 0.10.96 ± 0.471.7 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab We introduced a dT:dU mismatch upstream of the site of dNTP addition to utilize uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) to cut the extension products for analysis by LC-MS/MS. Replication of the unmodified oligonucleotide gave only error-free products, as reported elsewhere (38Zhao L. Christov P.P. Kozekov I.D. Pence M.G. Pallan P.S. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P.

Replication across the lesion by Dpo4 also gave only error-free products, in support of the results of steady-state insertion kinetics (Table 4). hpol η replicated through the lesion in both an error-free and an error-prone manner, resulting in three main products (Table 5). The first product corresponded to error-free products (i.e. m/z 934.3: 5′-pTCATGA, m/z 1086.3: 5′-pTCATGAT, and m/z 613.2: 5′-pTCAT) Figs. S11 and S12.

https://openalex.org/W2946179253,"Erinacine A-enriched Hericium erinaceus mycelia is a well-established potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effect of erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus mycelia on promoting longevity remains unclear. This is the first study to investigate the effect of erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus mycelia on lifespan-prolonging activity in Drosophila melanogaster and senescence-accelerated P8 (SAMP8) mice. Two hundred D. melanogaster and 80 SAMP8 mice of both sexes were randomly divided into four groups and were administered with either the standard, low-dose, mid-dose, or high-dose erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus mycelia. After treatment, the lifespan was measured in D. melanogaster, and the lifespan, food intake and oxidative damage were evaluated in SAMP8 mice. Results showed that supplementation with erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus mycelia extended the lifespan in both D. melanogaster and SAMP8 by a maximum of 32% and 23%, respectively, compared to the untreated controls. Moreover, erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus mycelia decreased TBARS levels and induced the anti-oxidative enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Together, these findings suggest that erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus mycelia supplement could promote longevity, mediated partly through the induction of endogenous antioxidants enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2945699874,"Background The Best Possible Self is a Positive Psychology Intervention which asks participants to write down about themselves in their best possible future. Previous studies have shown its efficacy to enhance wellbeing, but the mechanisms that underlie its efficacy are still unknown. Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the content of the essays of the BPS intervention and to examine how this content was related to the efficacy of the intervention to increase positive affect. Method Participants (N = 78) were randomized to either the Best Possible Self condition, or one of two variants of the intervention: one’s best self in the present, and one’s best self in the past. Qualitative analyses of the texts were carried out to explore the main themes and features of the essays. Then, a mixed-methods approach with quantitative and qualitative data was followed, in order to analyze the relationship between the content of the texts and the change in positive affect produced by the interventions. Results Significant differences between conditions were found in the content of the compositions. Regression analyses showed that different variables predicted the change in positive affect depending on the condition. Mediation analyses also found differences among conditions. Conclusions These findings suggest that these interventions respond to different underlying mechanisms which influence their efficacy. This study contributed to a better understanding of how Positive Psychology Interventions work, and how to increment their efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2946732136,"During obesity, diabetes and hypertension inevitably coexist and cause innumerable health disparities. In the obesity, diabetes, and hypertension triad (ODHT), deregulation of glucose and NaCl homeostasis, respectively, causes diabetes and hypertension. In the mammalian intestine, glucose is primarily absorbed by Na-glucose cotransport 1 (SGLT1) and coupled NaCl by the dual operation of Na-H exchange 3 (NHE3) and Cl-HCO3 [down-regulated in adenoma (DRA) or putative anion transporter 1 (PAT1)] exchange in the brush border membrane (BBM) of villus cells. The basolateral membrane (BLM) Na/K-ATPase provides the favorable transcellular Na gradient for BBM SGLT1 and NHE3. How these multiple, distinct transport processes may be affected in ODHT is unclear. Here, we show the novel and broad regulation by Na/K-ATPase of glucose and NaCl absorption in ODHT in multiple species (mice, rats, and humans). In vivo, during obesity inhibition of villus-cell BLM, Na/K-ATPase led to compensatory stimulation of BBM SGLT1 and DRA or PAT1, whereas NHE3 was unaffected. Supporting this new cellular adaptive mechanism, direct silencing of BLM Na/K-ATPase in intestinal epithelial cells resulted in selective stimulation of BBM SGLT1 and DRA or PAT1 but not NHE3. These changes will lead to an increase in glucose absorption, maintenance of traditional coupled NaCl absorption, and a de novo increase in NaCl absorption from the novel coupling of stimulated SGLT1 with DRA or PAT1. Thus, these novel observations provide the pathophysiologic basis for the deregulation of glucose and NaCl homeostasis of diabetes and hypertension, respectively, during obesity. These observations may lead to more efficacious treatment for obesity-associated diabetes and hypertension.-Palaniappan, B., Arthur, S., Sundaram, V. L., Butts, M., Sundaram, S., Mani, K., Singh, S., Nepal, N., Sundaram, U. Inhibition of intestinal villus cell Na/K-ATPase mediates altered glucose and NaCl absorption in obesity-associated diabetes and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2946035089,"On coral reefs, depth and gradients related to depth (e.g. light and wave exposure) influence the composition of fish communities. However, most studies focus only on emergent reefs that break the sea surface in shallow waters (<10 m). On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), submerged reefs (reefs that do not break the sea surface) occupy an area equivalent to all emergent reefs. However, submerged reefs have received comparatively little research attention, and fish communities associated with submerged reefs remain poorly quantified. Here, we quantify fish assemblages at each of three depths (10, 20 and 30 m) on eight submerged reefs (four mid-shelf and four outer-shelf) and two nearby emergent reefs in the central GBR where reef habitat extends from 0-~25 m depth. We examine how total fish abundance, the abundance of 13 functional groups, and the functional composition of fish communities varies among depths, reef types (submerged versus emergent reefs), and shelf position (mid-shelf versus outer-shelf). Overall fish abundance decreased sevenfold with depth, but declined less steeply (twofold) on outer-shelf submerged reefs than on both mid-shelf submerged reefs and emergent reefs. The functional composition of the fish assemblage also varied significantly among depths and reef types. Turnover in the functional composition of the fish community was also steeper on the mid-shelf, suggesting that shallow-affiliated groups extend further in deeper water on the outer-shelf. Ten of the 13 functional groups were more strongly associated with the shallowest depths (the upper reef slope of emergent reefs or the 'crests' of submerged reefs), two groups (soft coral/sponge feeders and mesopredators) were more abundant at the deepest sites. Our results confirm that submerged reefs in the central GBR support a wide range of coral reef fishes, and are an important component of the GBR ecosystem."

Male rats were pretreated with UCN2 or stressin1 for 30 min followed by induction of AP with supraphysiologic doses of caerulein. Serum amylase and lipase activity, pancreatic tissue necrosis, immune cell infiltrate, nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity, trypsin levels, and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were ascertained. UCN2, but not stressin1 attenuated the severity of AP in rats. UCN2, but not stressin1, reduced serum amylase and lipase activity, cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in AP. NF-κB activity in pancreatic nuclear extracts increased in AP and UCN2 treatment reduced caerulein-induced increases in NF-κB activity by 42%. UCN2 treatment prevented caerulein-induced degradation of IκB-α in the cytosolic fraction as well as increased levels of p65 subunit of NF-κB in the cytosolic fraction. Pancreatic UCN2 levels decreased in AP compared with saline. UCN2 evoked [Ca2+]i responses in primary acinar cells and abolished caerulein-evoked [Ca2+]i responses at 0.1nM, and decreased by ~50% at 1.0nM caerulein. UCN2 stimulation resulted in redistribution of a portion of F-actin from the apical to the basolateral pole. UCN2 prevented the massive redistribution of F-actin observed with supraphysiologic doses of caerulein. UCN2, but not stressin1 attenuated severity of an experimental pancreatitis model. The protective effects of UCN2, including anti-inflammatory and anti-necrotic effects involve activation of the CRF2 receptor, [Ca2+]i signaling, and inhibition of NF-κB activity."

https://openalex.org/W2946264165,"Small-molecule inhibitors of histone-modifying enzymes have significant clinical utility for managing diseases such as cancer. These inhibitors are usually identified and monitored through their effects on the gain or loss of specific histone marks. In cells, multiple related enzymes can place or remove a specific mark; therefore, relying on an indirect measure of inhibitor engagement can be misleading. Mascaro et al. describe a luminescence-based ELISA approach that directly monitors binding of inhibitors to the histone lysine demethylase KDM1A."
https://openalex.org/W2946625269,"Researchers and managers are often interested in monitoring the underlying state of a population (e.g., abundance), yet error in the observation process might mask underlying changes due to imperfect detection and availability for sampling. Additional heterogeneity can be introduced into a monitoring program when male-based surveys are used as an index for the total population. Often, male-based surveys are used for avian species, as males are conspicuous and more easily monitored than females. To determine if male-based lek surveys capture changes or trends in population abundance based on female survival and reproduction, we developed a virtual ecologist approach using the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) as an example. Our approach used an individual-based model to simulate lek counts based on female vital rate data, included models where detection and lek attendance probabilities were <1, and was analyzed using both unadjusted counts and an N-mixture model to compare estimates of population abundance and growth rates. Using lek counts to estimate population growth rates without accounting for detection probability or density-based lek attendance consistently biased population growth rates and abundance estimates. Our results therefore suggest that lek-based surveys used without accounting for lek attendance and detection probability may miss important trends in population changes. Rather than population-level inference, lek-based surveys not accounting for lek attendance and detection probability may instead be better for inferring broad-scale range shifts of lesser prairie-chicken populations in a presence/absence framework."
