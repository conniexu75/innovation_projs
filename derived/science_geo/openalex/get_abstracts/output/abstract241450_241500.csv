In the era of post-genomics, a systematic and comprehensive understandingof the complex events of life is a great concern in biology. The first step inthis process is to identify all gene functions and gene-to-gene networks asthe components of the system, the whole events of life. The metabolome is thefinal product of a series of gene actions. Hence, metabolomics has a potentialto elucidate gene functions and networks, especially when integrated withtranscriptomics. A promising approach is pair-wise transcript-metabolitecorrelation analysis, which can reveal unexpected correlations and bring tolight candidate genes for modifying the metabolite content(1Urbanczyk-Wochniak E.

Gene functions involved inthe specific pathway of interest have been identified by the integration oftranscript and targeted metabolic profiling in experimental systems where thepathway was activated(2Aharoni A.

Plant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia wasgrown for 21 days on agar-solidified S-sufficient medium following themethodology of Ref. 10Hirai M.Y. Fujiwara T. Awazuhara M. Kimura T. Noji M. Saito K. Plant J. 2003; 33: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar. Plantswere transferred to S-sufficient or S-deprived medium and grown for up to 1week (168 h). Rosette leaves and roots were harvested at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and168 h after transfer, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at–80 °C until use. Metabolome Analyses—Fourier-transform ion cyclotronresonance mass spectrometry analysis was used to conduct non-targetedmetabolomic profiling (6Tohge T. Nishiyama Y. Hirai M.Y. Yano M. Nakajima J. Awazuhara M. Inoue E. Takahashi H. Goodenowe D.B. Kitayama M. Noji M. Yamazaki M. Saito K. PlantJ. 2005; 42: 218-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar).Targeted metabolic profiling of amino acids,O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS), anions, organic acids, and sugarswas performed by high performance liquid chromatography and capillaryelectrophoresis as described(9Hirai M.Y. Yano M. Goodenowe D.B. Kanaya S. Kimura T. Awazuhara M. Arita M. Fujiwara T. Saito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10205-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Extraction of metaboliteswas conducted in triplicate from each sample. Among 2,123 metabolites detectedby targeted and non-targeted analyses, 84 metabolites whose coefficient ofvariation was greater than 0.9 were eliminated. For each metabolite thelogarithm of the ratio of the average signal intensity of S-starved samples tothat of the control samples was calculated. Transcriptome Analyses—The transcriptomes were analyzedusing the Agilent Arabidopsis 2 microarray (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,CA), which carries 21,500 Arabidopsis genes, according to themanufacturer's specifications. Data were acquired using Agilent FeatureExtraction software. Normalization of log ratio of expression intensitybetween S-starved and control samples was carried out based on MA plot(11Dudoit S. Fridlyand J. Speed T.P. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 2002; 97: 77-87Crossref Scopus (1926) Google Scholar,12Quackenbush J. Nat.Genet. 2002; 32: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Initially, log ratioMi [=log(Ri/Gi)] andaverage of logarithmic intensity Ai[=(logRi + log Gi)/2] were calculatedfor ith gene. Here, Ri and Giare differences between mean signal and mean background intensities for Cy5dye (S-starved sample) and for Cy3 dye (control sample), respectively,obtained by Agilent Feature Extraction software. Normalized log ratioMi″ was estimated as the difference betweenMi and baseline Mi′. Here, usinga relation between Mi and Ai,(Mi = f(Ai) +ϵI, ϵi was thedifference between Mi andf(Ai) for gene i) by MA plot; thebaseline for ith gene was estimated by MI′= f(Ai). The genes whose signal intensity wasregarded as zero were eliminated in the present analysis. BL-SOM Analyses—BL-SOM analyses were conducted according toRef. 9Hirai M.Y. Yano M. Goodenowe D.B. Kanaya S. Kimura T. Awazuhara M. Arita M. Fujiwara T. Saito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10205-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar. The metabolites andtranscripts whose maximum log ratio through time course was <0.1 andminimum log ratio was >–0.1 were eliminated. For ∼1,000metabolites and ∼10,000 transcripts left after the elimination, the sum ofthe square of the 6 log ratio values at 6 time points was set equal to 1 togive relative log ratio values, and all data were combined into a singlematrix to be subjected to BL-SOM. ∼1,000 metabolites and ∼10,000 geneswere classified into 40 × 29 cells in the lattice formed by BL-SOM basedon the time-dependent pattern of accumulation/expression in leaves in responseto –S (Fig. 1A).In the same way, ∼1,000 metabolites and ∼10,000 genes were classifiedinto 40 × 24 cells in the lattice based on the time-dependent pattern ofaccumulation/expression in roots in response to –S(Fig. 1B). Each cellcontained ∼10 metabolites and/or genes on the average. Each cell wascolored according to the relative log ratio values of metabolites/genes in it.When all of the relative log ratio values of metabolites/genes in the cellwere greater or smaller than the average, the cell was colored in pink or paleblue, respectively. Red and blue indicated that at least one of the relativelog ratio values was greater than the average + S.D. or smaller than theaverage–S.D., respectively. DNA Cloning Techniques—The gene encoding sulfotransferase 18(At1g74090) from A. thaliana (AtSOT18) (for nomenclature,see Ref. 13Klein M. Papenbrock J. J.Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) does not containany introns. A 1053-bp cDNA encoding AtSOT18 was amplified from theλEMBL3 genomic library of A. thaliana ecotype Columbia(Clontech) with primer 5′-GGA TCC GAA TCA GAA ACC CTA-3′ extendedby a BamHI restriction site and primer 5′-AAG CTT TTT ACC ATG TTC AAGC-3′ extended by a HindIII restriction site. The PCR contained 0.2mm dNTPs (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 0.4 μm eachprimer (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.75 μlof Red Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma), and 1 μg of template DNA in afinal volume of 50 μl. Before starting the first PCR cycle, the DNA wasdenatured for 180 s at 94 °C followed by 28 PCR cycles conducted for 60 sat 94 °C, 60 s at 48 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C. The process wasfinished with an elongation phase of 420 s at 72 °C. The amplified PCRfragment was ligated into the expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden,Germany), and the vector was introduced into the Escherichia colistrain XL1-blue. Expression and Purification of the AtSOT18 Protein in E.coli—The recombinant protein was expressed according to thefollowing protocol. After growth of the E. coli culture at 37 °Cto an A600 of 0.6 in Luria Bertani medium containingampicillin (100 μg ml–1) (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany),induction was carried out for 2 h at 30 °C with 1 mm (finalconcentration) isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside(AppliChem). Cell lysis was carried out by adding lysozyme (finalconcentration 1 mg ml–1) (Roth) and vigorously homogenizingusing a glass homogenizer and a pestle. The recombinant AtSOT18 protein waspurified under non-denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography with thenickel affinity resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen),dialyzed overnight, and used for enzyme activity measurements. The purity ofthe protein preparation was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisand subsequent Coomassie brilliant blue and silver staining. Substrate Preparation and Enzyme Activity Measurement—Thedesulfo form of the intact allyl GLS, sinigrin (Sigma), was prepared accordingto Graser et al. (14Graser G. Schneider B. Oldham N.J. Gershenzon J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,15Graser G. Oldham N.J. Brown P.D. Temp U. Gershenzon J. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The enzyme assay withrecombinant AtSOT18 protein was set up in the manner of Glendening and Poulton(16Glendening T.M. Poulton J.E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 15 μg of purifiedrecombinant protein was used in each reaction. The 300-μl assays contained:83 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 9.2 mm MgCl2, and 58μm 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS;Calbiochem), and 6.2 mm desulfo-allyl GLS. The reaction was startedby the addition of PAPS, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and stopped byincubation for 20 min at 95 °C. The formation of intact allyl GLS wasanalyzed by high performance liquid chromatography according to Mellon etal. (17Mellon F.A. Bennett R.N. Holst B. Williamson G. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Separation wasachieved with a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile with0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on an RP-C18 column (Supelcosil LC18-DB, 250 ×4.6 mm, 5 μm). The product was identified by its retention time, absorptionspectrum, and mass spectrum as described by Mellon et al.(17Mellon F.A. Bennett R.N. Holst B. Williamson G. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Quantification of theproduct formation was done with a calibration curve prepared using authenticsinigrin. Time-dependent changes in the metabolome and the transcriptome wereanalyzed in a non-targeted way after Arabidopsis plants weresubjected to S deprivation for up to 168 h. ∼2,000 metabolites detected bytargeted and non-targeted analyses and 21,500 transcripts by DNA microarraywere used for calculation, and each was expressed as a vector insix-dimensional space, where six components of the vector were six log ratiovalues of signal intensities under S deficiency compared with those undercontrol condition at six time points. For integrated analysis of metabolome and transcriptome, we used BL-SOM,which classified the metabolites and the transcripts according to theirtime-dependent pattern of changes in accumulation and expression. BL-SOM is asophisticated form of multivariate analyses that can classify metabolites andtranscripts into cells on a two-dimensional lattice; those showing similarpatterns are clustered into the same or the neighboring cells. Afterelimination of the metabolites and the transcripts exhibiting almost no change(see “Experimental Procedures”), the sum of the square of 6 logratio values was set to 1. This procedure made it possible to classify themetabolites and the transcripts by the shape of the time-dependent changingpattern alone and not by the absolute value of the degree of change. Allvectors (corresponding to the metabolites and the transcripts) left afterelimination were combined into a single matrix to be subjected to BL-SOM. Theresults are shown in Fig. 1,A (the changes in leaf) and B (in root). By thisanalysis, sets of metabolites and transcripts with strong correlations wereelucidated. Genes Involved in the Same Metabolic Pathway—Sixglucosinolates (GLSs) and four isothiocyanates, which are the degradationproducts of GLSs, clustered into the cells in the specific regions, suggestingthat GLS metabolism is coordinately regulated(Fig. 2, A andB). GLSs are sulfur- and nitrogen-containing secondarymetabolites found mainly in the Capparales order and are important as defensecompounds to pathogens and herbivores and as S storage sources(18Wittstock U. Gershenzon J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar,19Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). They are synthesized fromamino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine homologs withelongated side chains. The core biosynthetic pathway of GLS has beenelucidated, and the Arabidopsis genes encoding most of the enzymeshave been identified or at least assumed, except for those encoding thesulfotransferases(20Mikkelsen M.D. Petersen B.L. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Amino Acids. 2002; 22: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Mikkelsen M.D. Naur P. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 22Field B. Cardon G. Traka M. Botterman J. Vancanneyt G. Mithen R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 828-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)(Fig. 3).Fig. 3Outline of GLS biosynthesis and degradation. MAM,methylthioalkylmalate synthase; CYP, cytochrome P450; SUR1,a C-S lyase encoded by SUPERROOT1 gene; S-GT,S-glucosyltransferase; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine5′-phosphosulfate. In Arabidopsis, methionine and tryptophanare the major precursors of GLSs, but the side chain of methionine is firstelongated by a cycle involving MAM-1 and MAM-L. Isoforms of CYP79s and CYP83scatalyze the initial reactions of the core biosynthetic pathway, followed bySUR1, S-GT, and sulfotransferase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The genes encoding the GLS biosynthesis enzymes, including those encodingthe MAM, CYP79, and CYP83 families and SUR1 wereclustered into the cells in the same region(Fig. 2, B andC). It is notable that three putative sulfotransferasegenes (At1g74100, At1g18590, and At1g74100 named AtSOT16, AtSOT17,and AtSOT18, respectively, by Klein and Papenbrock(13Klein M. Papenbrock J. J.Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were classified into thesame region where the known GLS biosynthetic genes were clustered(Fig. 2, B andC). This result strongly suggested that these putativesulfotransferase genes are also involved in GLS biosynthesis. To confirm thefunction of these putative sulfotransferase gene products, in vitrosulfotransferase assays were conducted using the respective recombinantproteins. The recombinant AtSOT18 protein could convert desulfo-allyl GLS tointact, sulfonated allyl GLS in the presence of PAPS(Fig. 2E). Theidentity of the product was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown).The activity of the gene products of the two other putative sulfotransferasegenes (AtSOT16 and AtSOT17) has been analyzed in the sameway, giving comparable results with desulfo-allyl GLS (data not shown). Theseresults confirmed that the three sulfotransferase-like genes, which clusteredwith known GLS biosynthesis genes after BL-SOM analysis, actually encode theproteins catalyzing PAPS-dependent sulfation of desulfo-GLSs to GLSs. Duringthe reviewing process of this publication, Piotrowski et al.(23Piotrowski M. Schemenewitz A. Lopukhina A. Muller A. Janowitz T. Weiler E.W. Oecking C. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50717-50725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) reached the sameconclusion by quite different strategy to ours and reported that these threegenes encode desulfo-GLS sulfotransferase. It was also the case withAt1g24100, which was assumed to encode S-glucosyltransferase involved in GLSbiosynthesis (24Petersen B.L. Andreasson E. Bak S. Agerbirk N. Halkier B.A. Planta. 2001; 212: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This gene(Figs. 2 and3, S-GT) was clusteredwith known GLS biosynthesis genes, supporting the assumption by Petersenet al. (24Petersen B.L. Andreasson E. Bak S. Agerbirk N. Halkier B.A. Planta. 2001; 212: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Recently, the function of this gene was confirmed by Douglas Grubb etal. (25Douglas Grubb C. Zipp B.J. Ludwig-Muller J. Masuno M.N. Molinski T.F. Abel S. PlantJ. 2004; 40: 893-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These factsproved that our strategy is effective to elucidate gene functions in the samemetabolic pathway at once. In a similar way, based on the results of BL-SOM the functions of othercandidate genes for GLS biosynthesis enzymes (C-S lyase and glutathioneS-transferase) were also putatively identified. A putative tyrosineaminotransferase gene (At5g36160) and two putative glutathioneS-transferase (GST) genes (At3g03190 and At1g78370) were alsoclustered together with the known GLS biosynthesis genes. The putativetyrosine aminotransferase gene At5g36160 may represent a C-S lyase geneinvolved in GLS biosynthesis. The SUR1 gene(Fig. 3), whose gene product isthe C-S lyase of the core GLS biosynthetic pathway(21Mikkelsen M.D. Naur P. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), had also been originallymisannotated as a tyrosine aminotransferase(26Jones P.R. Manabe T. Awazuhara M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10291-10296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sur1 mutantdoes not accumulate GLS, at least under normal conditions, suggesting noapparent functional redundancy of C-S lyase of GLS biosynthesis(21Mikkelsen M.D. Naur P. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, this mutantoccasionally accumulated a trace level of indol-3-ylmethyl GLS(21Mikkelsen M.D. Naur P. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and so the product ofAt5g36160 might also function as C-S lyase in GLS biosynthesis under differentenvironmental or developmental conditions. As for the putative GST genes clustering with the other GLS biosynthesisgenes, it has been suggested that GST-type enzymes may be involved in anenzyme complex formed by CYP83s and C-S lyase. The S-alkylthiohydroximateformed after CYP83-catalyzed aldoxime oxidation and spontaneous conjugation tocysteine (Fig. 3) is cyclizedin vitro to form a dead-end product. Hence, metabolic channelingaided by GST-type enzymes is postulated in vivo to avoid thisconsequence (21Mikkelsen M.D. Naur P. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The twoputative GST genes (At3g03190 and At1g78370) could be candidates coding forsuch an activity. We are now examining the genes clustered with GLSs andisothiocyanates for identification of new factors regulating GLSmetabolism. Regulatory Metabolite O-Acetylserine and Genes under ItsRegulation—Primary S metabolism is regulated by modulation of geneexpression (see below) and of enzymatic activity(27Saito K. PlantPhysiol. 2004; 136: 2443-2450Google Scholar). For example, theactivities of serine acetyltransferases(Fig. 4A,Serat) are regulated by two mechanisms in an isoform-specific manner:by allosteric feedback inhibition by cysteine and by reversible formation of aprotein complex with OAS-(thiol)-lyase(Fig. 4A,Bsas). The enzymes involved in primary S metabolism are encoded bygene families in Arabidopsis (Fig.4A). These genes were scattered on the map(Fig. 4B), which wasconsistent with the fact that primary S metabolism is regulated not only bymRNA accumulation but also by enzymatic activity(27Saito K. PlantPhysiol. 2004; 136: 2443-2450Google Scholar). Among them, however,several genes were clustered together with OAS(Fig. 4, B andC). Sulfate transporter (Sultr) and adenosinephosphosulfate reductase (APR) genes are known to be induced by Sdeficiency. OAS, whose content increases under –S, is considered apositive regulator of this induction mechanism(Fig. 4A)(27Saito K. PlantPhysiol. 2004; 136: 2443-2450Google Scholar). The induction ofSultr and APR genes enables more sulfate ions to beassimilated into cysteine. By BL-SOM, these genes and OAS were clustered intothe same region (Fig. 4, B andC), confirming the previous findings. Among the isoformsof ATP sulfurylase (APS) and Serat genes, APS3, Serat3;1 and Serat3;2 were clustered with OAS(Fig. 4, B andC and supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting their specificfunctions under S deficiency (see below). Besides S assimilation genes, the 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 1 gene andthe nitrilase 3 gene are known to be induced under S deficiency and by OAS(10Hirai M.Y. Fujiwara T. Awazuhara M. Kimura T. Noji M. Saito K. Plant J. 2003; 33: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar,28Nikiforova V. Freitag J. Kempa S. Adamik M. Hesse H. Hoefgen R. Plant J. 2003; 33: 633-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar,29Kutz A. Muller A. Hennig P. Kaiser W.M. Piotrowski M. Weiler E.W. Plant J. 2002; 30: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). They were also in thesame region where OAS clustered (data not shown). Two putative thioglucosidasegenes, which are known to be induced by S deficiency(30Maruyama-Nakashita A. Inoue E. Watanabe-Takahashi A. Yamaya T. Takahashi H. PlantPhysiol. 2003; 132: 597-605Google Scholar), were also in the sameregion, suggesting that they are coordinately regulated with OAS. Moreover, the specific function of each member of a gene family could beestimated by this analysis. The ATP sulfurylase isoforms APS2 andAPS4 among four members of this gene family were clustered with GLSbiosynthesis genes (Fig.4B and supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that theseisoforms may be specialized for the biosynthesis of PAPS required for GLSbiosynthesis. On the other hand, as mentioned above, APS3, whichclustered with OAS, may be involved in the enhancement of cysteinebiosynthesis under –S. Transcription Factor and Downstream Genes—PAP1 is a Mybtranscription factor that activates phenylpropanoid/flavonoid biosynthesis(31Borevitz J.O. Xia Y. Blount J. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2383-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). In an activation-taggedmutant of the PAP1 gene that overaccumulates red-purple pigmentanthocyanins, the biosynthesis genes of flavonoids such as phenylalanineammonia lyase, chalcone synthase, and dehydroflavonol 4-reductase were induced(31Borevitz J.O. Xia Y. Blount J. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2383-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). We clarified that inthis mutant line anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were specifically inducedamong flavonoid biosynthesis genes, suggesting that PAP1 is a transcriptionfactor of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes(6Tohge T.

In this studyPAP1 and the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were clustered together(Fig. 5, B andC), indicating that transcription factors and thedownstream genes regulated by them can be elucidated by these analyses. Ourplant materials subjected to S deficiency did not turn red, indicatinganthocyanin biosynthesis was not apparently induced. Nevertheless,PAP1 and the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were clustered together.This fact implies that a new regulatory network can be clarified by ourstrategy even when we do not focus on a specific pathway. For GLS biosynthesis, several putative transcription factor genes wereclustered with GLS biosynthesis genes (data not shown). These genes are thecandidate genes controlling GLS biosynthesis. In the present study, we could find gene-to-gene and metabolite-to-genenetworks and could identify a new gene function through integrated analysis ofmetabolomics and transcriptomics. Our strategy may be useful especially incases where the gene of interest is functionally redundant and thus no visiblechanges are observed in knocked-out lines of the gene(32Bino R.J. Hall R.D.

Here we assessed the chromatin environment of the eNOS gene in expressing and nonexpressing cell types. Within endothelial cells, but not a variety of nonendothelial cells, the nucleosomes that encompassed the eNOS core promoter and proximal downstream coding regions were highly enriched in acetylated histones H3 and H4 and methylated lysine 4 of histone H3. This differentially modified chromatin domain was selectively associated with functionally competent RNA polymerase II complexes. Endothelial cells were particularly enriched in acetylated histone H3 lysine 9, histone H4 lysine 12, and di- and tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 at the core promoter. Histone modifications at this region, which we have previously demonstrated to exhibit cell-specific DNA methylation, were functionally relevant to eNOS expression. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by trichostatin A increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the eNOS proximal promoter in nonexpressing cell types and led to increased steady-state eNOS mRNA transcript levels. H3 lysine 4 methylation was also essential for eNOS expression, since treatment of endothelial cells with methylthioadenosine, a known lysine 4 methylation inhibitor, decreased eNOS RNA levels, H3 lysine 4 methylation, and RNA polymerase II loading at the eNOS proximal promoter. Importantly, methylthioadenosine also prevented the trichostatin A-mediated increase in eNOS mRNA transcript levels in nonendothelial cells. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that the endothelial cell-specific expression of eNOS is controlled by cell-specific histone modifications.

NOS3) is constitutively expressed in vascular endothelial cells, especially the endothelial layer of medium to large sized arterial blood vessels, where it is known to play a key role in vascular wall homeostasis and regulation of vasomotor tone. Studying the mechanisms regulating the constitutive transcription of eNOS in endothelial cells is essential to understand how these mechanisms may be perturbed in diseases characterized by a decrease in eNOS mRNA in the vascular endothelium. For example, constitutive expression of eNOS is compromised in the endothelial cells overlying advanced human atherosclerotic plaques (1Wilcox J.N. Subramanian R.R. Sundell C.L. Tracey W.R.

In general, the basis for endothelium-specific gene expression is not known. Whereas models involving DNA-binding transcription factors (e.g. AP-1, Ets family members, GATA-2, octamer proteins, or Sp1) (4Perkins K.J. Davies K.E.

This can be contrasted with the control of muscle-specific or adipocyte-specific genes, which are controlled by “master regulators,” including MyoD/myocardin/MEF-2 or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, respectively (8Fajas L. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Current evidence argues against a prominent role for cell-specific expression of endothelial “master regulators.” This has prompted the search for other paradigms of cell-specific gene expression in endothelial cells. In this regard, the contribution of chromatin-based epigenetic pathways to the regulation of cardiovascular gene expression, especially in vascular endothelial cells, remains poorly understood. We have recently shown that epigenetics may provide a new paradigm for understanding endothelial cell-specific expression (10Chan Y. Fish J.E. D'Abreo C. Lin S. Robb G.B. Teichert A.M. Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Keightley A. Steer B.M. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35087-35100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of eNOS promoter/reporter constructs into endothelial and nonendothelial cell types revealed high levels of transcription regardless of whether the native chromatin-based gene was active. However, expression of reporter genes in insertional transgenic eNOS promoter/reporter mice demonstrated endothelium-specific reporter activity when related promoter sequences were utilized (11Guillot P.V. Liu L. Kuivenhoven J.A. Guan J. Rosenberg R.D. Aird W.C. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Teichert A.M. Miller T.L. Tai S.C. Wang Y. Bei X. Robb G.B. Phillips M.J. Marsden P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1352-H1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These unexpected findings suggested that chromatin-based mechanisms are functionally relevant. By analyzing a large portion of the eNOS/NOS3 locus for cell-specific DNA methylation patterns, we found a differentially methylated region (DMR) that was highly localized to the proximal promoter. Whereas nonendothelial cells were highly methylated at proximal promoter sequences, endothelial cells lacked DNA methylation in this same region. This cell-specific methylation pattern was demonstrated in primary and human transformed cell types as well as in vivo in the vasculature of mice using laser capture microdissection. Methylation of this DMR functionally repressed eNOS transcription. Importantly, although many of these nonendothelial cell types do not basally express appreciable levels of eNOS mRNA transcripts at steady state, we noted that inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity with 5-azacytidine led to increases in eNOS mRNA levels (10Chan Y. Fish J.E. D'Abreo C. Lin S. Robb G.B. Teichert A.M. Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Keightley A. Steer B.M. Marsden P.A. J. Biol.

Shen Y.H. Wang J. Wang X. Utama B. Wang X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16467-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have previously argued that Sp1, Sp3, and Ets-1 trans- factors participate in highly structured nucleoprotein complexes that form on eNOS proximal promoter sequences, termed positive regulatory domains (PRDs) I and II (14Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S.L. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G.K. Miller T.L. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P.A. J. Biol.

Fish J.E. D'Abreo C. Lin S. Robb G.B. Teichert A.M. Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Keightley A. Steer B.M. Marsden P.A. J. Biol.

In the current work, we were unable to demonstrate an effect in electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) of methylation of naked double-stranded DNA on the formation of nucleoprotein complexes. Whereas Sp1, Sp3, and Ets-1 are relatively ubiquitously expressed across cell types, curiously they differentially localize to the eNOS promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays of endothelial versus vascular smooth muscle cell chromatin (10Chan Y. Fish J.E. D'Abreo C. Lin S. Robb G.B. Teichert A.M. Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Keightley A. Steer B.M. Marsden P.A. J. Biol.

Chromatin structure is regulated by a plethora of post-translational covalent modifications at the N termini of the H3 and H4 core histones: acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, deimination, sumoylation, and ubiquitination among others. These modifications are thought to influence the accessibility of DNA to general nuclear factors and serve as target sequences for regulatory proteins and are dynamically regulated (15Agalioti T.

Recently, the specific sites of acetylation and, more importantly, the combination of sites of acetylation and other covalent modifications, such as methylation and phosphorylation, have been shown to dictate whether a particular region of chromatin is in a transcriptionally active or repressed state (20Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar, 21Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The “histone code” model postulates that it is the specific combinations of covalent histone modifications that determine the functional activity of chromatin (20Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

Because the structure of histones in nucleosomal DNA is an important determinant of nucleoprotein complex formation (23Nguyen C.T. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4598-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and DNA methylation of promoters is often accompanied by histone modifications that render the chromatin effectively inaccessible to transcription factors (23Nguyen C.T.

Here we describe a cell-specific histone code for human eNOS, map a discrete region of uniquely modified nucleosomes, and demonstrate the functional importance of these modifications with respect to transcription. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, eNOS(+)) were isolated and maintained as described previously and used at passages 3–4 (27Marsden P.A. Schappert K.T. Chen H.S. Flowers M.

Single donor human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC, eNOS(+)) and human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC, eNOS(-)) were obtained from Clonetics (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and ScienCell (San Diego, CA) and maintained as recommended and used at passages 4–9. HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, eNOS(-)), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell line, eNOS(-)), and JEG-3 (human choriocarcinoma cell line, eNOS(-)) were obtained from ATCC and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Antibodies Used for ChIP Assays—Antibodies used were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Treatment of eNOS Promoter/β-Galactosidase Reporter Transgenic Mice with 5-Azacytidine—A detailed description of the insertional promoter-reporter eNOSpromNLSLacZ transgenic strain has been previously reported (12Teichert A.M.

The -5200/+28 Mu eNOSNLSLacZ transgene contains 5.2 kb of the native murine eNOS promoter and directs expression of the nuclear localized β-galactosidase reporter. Mice with one copy or five copies of the transgene were used in parallel experiments. Adult and neonatal mice containing the eNOS promoter/β-galactosidase transgene were treated with 5-azacytidine (Sigma) at a dose of 2.5 μg/g body weight, a dose known not to cause adverse effects in mice and to result in demethylation of Igf2 (28Hu J.F.

Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-azacytidine or phosphate-buffered saline on days 1 and 4, and organs were harvested on day 16. Neonatal mice were treated on days 12 and 15 of life, and organs were harvested on day 26. Organs (brain, kidney, heart, intestine, liver, lung, and spleen) were harvested, fixed, and stained as described previously (12Teichert A.M. Miller T.L. Tai S.C. Wang Y. Bei X. Robb G.B.

For each EMSA reaction, 1.0 × 105 cpm of labeled probe was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 7 μg of nuclear extract in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). As indicated, 2 μg of antibody was added 20 min after the addition of probe and incubated an additional 15 min at 22 °C. Antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: Sp1 (PEP2; sc-59) and Sp3 (D-20; sc-644). Reactions were analyzed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run at room temperature. The EMSA probes used were CG11, a synthetic 135-bp fragment containing 20 GCGC sites and 7 CCGG sites, and eNOS-(-161/+89), a 253-bp fragment spanning PRD I-(-104/-95) and PRD II-(-144/-115) of the human eNOS promoter, containing seven CpG sites (generated by digestion of the -1193/+109 eNOS promoter/reporter with BstYI and StyI). CG11 is a well studied probe that is known to bind MeCP1 and MeCP2 complexes when methylated (29Yin H. Blanchard K.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 111-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The competitor oligonucleotides corresponded to PRD I-(-110/-89), PRD II-(-151/-110), or both PRD I and II-(-151/-89). The CG11 sequence in PUC 19 (a gift from K. Blanchard) and the eNOS linker-scanner construct, pGL2-1193(-164), were in vitro methylated prior to probe purification using SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) to symmetrically methylate all CG sequences, as described previously (10Chan Y.

Methylation reactions were monitored for completeness with MspI/HpaII isoschizomer restriction enzyme analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed essentially as previously described (10Chan Y. Fish J.E. D'Abreo C. Lin S. Robb G.B. Teichert A.M. Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Keightley A. Steer B.M.

Formaldehyde was added directly to the medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Sonication was performed on ice using a Sonics and Materials Vibra-Cell sonicator with a 3-mm tip set at 30% maximum power using 10-s pulses with a 20-s interval between sonications to completely solubilize chromatin and achieve chromatin fragments ranging between 200 and 400 bp in size. For histone ChIPs, chromatin was precleared using 80 μl of salmon-sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight using 5 μg of antibody or a background control (no antibody or 5 μg of normal rabbit IgG). A 20-μl aliquot (of a 2000-μl total volume) of chromatin was removed prior to immunoprecipitation to serve as an input control. Immune complexes were collected for 1 h with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. After extensive washing, formaldehyde cross-links were reversed, DNA was purified by proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction, and, following ethanol precipitation, samples were resuspended in 25 μl of water. For total RNA Pol II (N terminus) and phosphorylated CTD (serine 2 or 5) Pol II ChIPs and MeCP2, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 ChIPs, the method of Nissen and Yamamoto (31Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was used. Immune complexes were collected using a 1:1 ratio of protein A and protein G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology). Protein A/G beads were precoated with anti-IgM (Serotec, Star86) for phosphorylated RNA Pol II ChIPs. Real Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total cellular RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and random hexamers and diluted to a final volume of 50 μl. The amount of target cDNA was quantified on an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the Taqman® or SYBR green methodology with primers directed to the eNOS transcript (5′-GGC ATC ACC AGG AAG AAC ACC-3′ and 5′-TCA CTC GCT TCG CCA TCA C-3′; probe, 5′-FAM CCA ACG CCG TGA AGA TCT CCG C Blackhole Quencher-3′), the sONE transcript (5′-CTC ACC CCG CTG TTT CTG CTT-3′ and 5′-AAG TCG ATA ATC TCC AGG GCA CG-3′; probe, 5′-VIC TGC CTC TAG CCC CAG ACA ACA GTG G TAMRA-3′), the GAPDH transcript (5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′ and 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′; probe, 5′-VIC-CAA GCT TCC CGT TCT CAG CC Blackhole Quencher-3′), and the cyclophilin A (CYPA) transcript (5′-GAC GGC GAG CCC TTG G-3′ and 5′-TCT GCT TTT GGG ACC TTG T-3′; probe, 5′-FAM CGC GTC TCC TTT GAG CTG TTT GCA Blackhole Quencher-3′). Determinations were performed in triplicate on 2 μl of cDNA in a 10-μl volume using the Taqman® or SYBR green universal master mix. Copy number of transcripts was determined by comparison with a calibration curve of known amounts of amplicon-containing plasmid. Real Time PCR Analysis of ChIP Samples—The following primer sets were used in ChIP experiments to amplify genomic DNA: eNOS enhancer (-4718 to -4596), 5′-CGG GCT GGG CTA TAA AGA GTC AG-3′ and 5′-TTG ACC TTG GAG GGC TGT GCT-3′; eNOS upstream promoter region (-891 to -796), 5′-TGA AGT GCC TGG AGA GTG CTG G-3′ and 5′-GAA GAG CTT GAT GCC CTG GTG G-3′ eNOS proximal promoter (-166 to -26), 5′-GTG GAG CTG AGG CTT TAG AGC-3′ and 5′-TTT CCT TAG GAA GAG GGA GGG-3′ with probe 5′-FAM CCA GCC GGG CTT GTT CCT GTC C TAMRA-3′; eNOS exon 2 (+1463 to +1514), 5′-TTC CCT CGT GTG AAG AAC TGG-3′ and 5′-TGA GGG TGT CAT AGG TGA TGC TC-3′; eNOS exon 14/intron 14 (+12,652 to +12,733), 5′-AGC TGC CCT GAT GGA GAT GTC C-3′ and 5′-CCC AAA CTC TCA CCC AAC TCA CTT G-3′; CYPA promoter (-161 to -19), 5′-CCT CAT GTG TCG TCC CCA TCA-3′ and 5′-CGC CG TTT TAT ACC ACG TTC G-3′. Determinations were performed in triplicate on 2 μl of bound chromatin, 2 μl of a no antibody control or control IgG immunoprecipitation, and 2 μl of a 10-fold dilution of input chromatin in a 10-μl reaction. The number of copies of target sequence was determined by comparison with a standard curve using known amounts of an eNOS promoter-containing plasmid, a bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing the eNOS locus or human genomic DNA. Immunoprecipitated DNA (IP DNA) was determined by subtracting the number of target DNA molecules in the control immunoprecipitation from the number of copies in the immunoprecipitated samples using a specific antibody and dividing by the number in the diluted input sample. Findings were comparable whether a no antibody control or control IgG was used to control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation. Cell Treatments—5-Azacytidine (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were treated every 48 h with 5-azacytidine for 7 days. Trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma) was dissolved in 100% ethanol and was added to a final concentration of 1000 nm for 4 or 24 h. An equivalent amount of ethanol was added to control plates. For combined 5-azacytidine and TSA treatments, cells were treated with 5-azacytidine for 7 days, and TSA was added at a concentration of 1000 nm for the last 24 h. 5′-Deoxy-5′-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO. Confluent plates of HUVEC were treated with MTA at a final concentration of 3 mm for 48 h. Control plates were treated with an equivalent amount of Me2SO. For combined TSA and MTA treatments, confluent plates of VSMC were treated for 2 h with 3 mm of MTA followed by the addition of 1000 nm TSA for 22 h or 20 h of 3 mm MTA followed by the addition of 1000 nm TSA for 4 h. Histone Extraction and Western Blotting—Histones were harvested from confluent plates of HUVEC or VSMC. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Concentrated H2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 15 min at 11,000 × g, 1 ml of cold acetone was added. After incubation at -20 °C overnight, coagulated material was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with cold acetone, dried, and dissolved in 50 μl of water. 20 μg of histones were loaded onto a 12% acrylamide gel using Tricine running buffer. Proteins were transferred onto a 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with milk protein and blotted with anti-acetyl histone H3 (06-599) or anti-acetyl lysine (06-933) (to detect histone H4 acetylation) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology), and the blots were analyzed using SuperSignal West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and the Fluor-S Max MultiImager (model 170–7720; Bio-Rad). Nuclear Run-on Analysis—Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described previously (30Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T. Scherer S.W"

Endogenous SIGIRR transiently interacted with IL-1 receptor and the receptor-proximal signaling components (MyD88, IRAK, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) upon IL-1 stimulation, indicating that SIGIRR interacts with the IL-1 receptor complex in a ligand-dependent manner. Similar interaction was also observed between SIGIRR and Toll-like receptor 4 receptor complex upon LPS stimulation. To identify the domains of SIGIRR required for its interaction with the Toll-like receptor 4 and IL-1 receptor complexes, several SIGIRR deletion mutants were generated, including ΔN (lacking the extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain with deletion of amino acids 1-119), ΔC (lacking the C-terminal domain with deletion of amino acids 313-410), and ΔTIR (lacking the TIR domain with deletion of amino acids 161-313). Whereas both the extracellular Ig domain and the intracellular TIR domains are important for SIGIRR to inhibit IL-1 signaling, only the TIR domain is necessary for SIGIRR to inhibit LPS signaling. The extracellular Ig domain exerts its inhibitory role in IL-1 signaling by interfering with the heterodimerization of IL-1 receptor and IL-1RAcP, whereas the intracellular TIR domain inhibits both IL-1 and LPS signaling by attenuating the recruitment of receptor-proximal signaling components to the receptor.

IL-1 has been demonstrated to be a key player in the immune response and inflammatory response at both local and systemic levels by activating gene expression of such genes as MIP-2, KC, and C-reactive protein. IL-18 plays important roles in promoting Th1 cell differentiation and natural killer cell activation. T1/ST2 (3Brint E.K. Xu D. Liu H. Dunne A. McKenzie A.N. O'Neill L.A. Liew F.Y. Nat.

Due to the similarity in their intracellular domain, the Toll-IL-1 receptors employ related yet distinct signaling components and downstream pathways. Genetic and biochemical studies revealed that IL-1R mediates a very complex pathway involving a cascade of kinases organized by multiple adapter molecules into signaling complexes, leading to activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, ATF, and AP-1 (17Barnes P.J.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of the receptor complex (Complex I). During the formation of Complex I, IRAK and IRAK4 are activated, leading to the hyperphosphorylation of IRAK. Pellino 1·IRAK4·IRAK·TRAF6 complex is then formed, releasing these signaling molecules from the receptor (20Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol.

The translocated Complex III interacts with additional factors in the cytosol, leading to TAK1 activation. It has been implicated that TRAF6 functions as part of a unique E3 complex, mediating TAK1 activation through nonclassical ubiquitination catalyzed by the ubiquitination proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A (30Deng L.

Whereas most of the TLRs share the MyD88-dependent pathway outlined above for IL-1 signaling, several Toll-IL-1 receptors also utilize variations of the above common signaling pathway. For example, TLR3 and TLR4 use MyD88-independent pathways to activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3 (40Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S.

SIGIRR represents a unique subgroup of the Toll-IL-1R superfamily because its extracellular domain consists of a single Ig domain. SIGIRR has been shown not to bind IL-1 or enhance IL-1 signaling, but it does inhibit IL-1-mediated signaling. SIGIRR is expressed at high levels in primary kidney and intestinal epithelial cells and at moderate levels in splenocytes and immature dendritic cells, but it is not expressed in primary macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (4Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation leads to down-regulation of SIGIRR expression in different mouse tissues, suggesting an important regulatory role of SIGIRR in the inflammatory process (4Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Consistent with the expression pattern of SIGIRR, SIGIRR-deficient kidney and intestinal epithelial cells and splenocytes, but not macrophages, exhibit enhanced responsiveness to IL-1 and Toll ligands (4Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SIGIRR-deficient dendritic cells showed increased cytokine production in response to TLR ligands, including LPS and CpG DNA (5Garlanda C. Riva F. Polentarutti N. Buracchi C. Sironi M. De Bortoli M. Muzio M. Bergottini R. Scanziani E. Vecchi A. Hirsch E. Mantovani A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3522-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Moreover, SIGIRR-deficient mice show an enhanced inflammatory response to IL-1, specifically in the lung and colon, and a reduced threshold for lethal endotoxin challenge (4Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been shown that the SIGIRR-deficient mice are more susceptible to inflammatory bowel disease induced by dextran sulfate sodium, as compared with wild-type mice (5Garlanda C. Riva F. Polentarutti N. Buracchi C. Sironi M. De Bortoli M. Muzio M. Bergottini R. Scanziani E. Vecchi A. Hirsch E. Mantovani A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3522-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that SIGIRR functions as an important modulator for the Toll-IL-1R system expressed in epithelial cells and dendritic cells and is crucial for tuning inflammation in gastrointestinal tract. The detailed signaling mechanism for SIGIRR is still unclear. To understand the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of SIGIRR, we recently studied the structure-function relationship of SIGIRR. Here we show that whereas both the extracellular Ig domain and the intracellular TIR domains are important for SIGIRR to inhibit IL-1 signaling, only the TIR domain is necessary for SIGIRR to inhibit LPS signaling. The fact that different domains of SIGIRR are used to inhibit IL-1 versus LPS signaling indicates that SIGIRR probably inhibits these two pathways through differential mechanisms. Biological Reagents and Cell Culture—Recombinant human IL-1 was provided by the National Cancer Institute. Recombinant human IL-18 and mouse TNF were obtained from Peprotech. LPS from Escherichia coli serotype O11:B4 was purchased from Sigma. Poly(I:C), peptidoglycan, and flagellin were purchased from Fluka, Amersham Biosciences, and InvivoGen. The 293, HeLa 229, and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Antibody to FLAG (anti-FLAG) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies SIGIRR (AF990; R&D Systems), MyD88 (Stressgen), TRAF6 (sc-7221; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), IRAK (sc-7883; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), IL-1R (sc-993; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), TLR4 (sc-8693; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), phosphorylated JNK (9251; Cell Signaling Technology) and JNK1 (sc-474; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were used. Anti-IRAK4 polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Holger Wesche (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). Primary kidney cells were prepared by cutting the kidney into small pieces and incubating them in 0.5% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells from each kidney were plated on a 15-cm plate and grown to confluence for 7-10 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then split 24 h prior to treatment and analyzed as described. Constructs and Antibodies—DNA encoding N-terminal FLAG-tagged SIGIRR was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-AAGGAATTCGCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGATGCCAGGTGTCTGTGATAGGGCCCCT-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-ATTAGCGGCCGCCTACATATCATCCTTGGACACCA-3′. The IMAGE Consortium Clone 2821373 was the template; it was digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the vector pCDAN3.1(+) (Invitrogen). N-terminal, C-terminal, and TIR domain deletion mutants of N-FLAG-SIGIRR (ΔN (SIGIRR119-410), ΔC (SIGIRR1-313), and ΔTIR (SIGIRRd161-313)) were generated by PCR. The lacZ plasmid encodes β-galactosidase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter subcloned into the pDC304 vector. Expression vectors encoding human TLR4 and MD2 were provided by Dr. R. Medzhitov (Yale University). Luciferase Reporter Assays—293 (1 × 106), HeLa 229 (1× 106), or HepG2 cells (4 × 105) were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors plus 100 ng of the endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 promoter-derived NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid for normalization, with a 1:3 ratio of DNA:FuGENE 6. Transfection of empty vector was used to ensure all samples received equal amounts of DNA. At 36 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with cytokines for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assessed using Reporter lysis buffer and Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega). All results reported represent duplicate experiments with at least three independent transfections. Transfection and Co-immunoprecipitations—293IL-1RI/TLR4/MD2 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors using the calcium phosphate method. 36 h after transfection, untreated cells and cells treated with IL-1 (100 units/ml), LPS (10 μg/ml), or TNFα (5 μg/ml) were lysed in a lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of antibody or preimmune serum (negative control) for 2 h, followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (pre-washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1:1 ratio). After incubation, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and analyzed by immunoblotting. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested, washed in cold PBS buffer, pelleted, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to supported nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), and blocked in a 5% solution of nonfat dry milk prepared in 1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed three to four times for 10 min each with PBS, detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 in PBS + 5% nonfat milk, and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells plated in 100-mm dishes. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested with a cell scraper, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 1500 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 2 volumes of ice-cold storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1× mixture of protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 25% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatant fraction was frozen in aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—An NF-κB oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm MgCl2. Nuclear extracts (5 or 10 μg of protein) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, and the end-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000 cpm). The samples were loaded onto a pre-run, 16-cm-long, 1.5-mm-thick, 4% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (29:1) gel prepared in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). After electrophoresis for 2 h at 200 V (at 4 °C), the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak films at -80 °C for 3-24 h with intensifying screens. The radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Each gel mobility shift assay was repeated with at least two independently prepared nuclear extracts. SIGIRR Inhibits IL-1 and LPS Signaling—We have previously shown that SIGIRR plays a negative regulatory role in immediate signaling events mediated by members of the Toll-IL-1R family (4Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Several primary cell types from SIGIRR-null mice were examined. The SIGIRR-null cells exhibited increased activation of NF-κB and JNK in response to IL-1, LPS, and CpG DNA (but not peptidoglycan, flagellin, poly(I:C), and TNF), as compared with cells from wild-type littermate control mice (4Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A; data not shown). We recently examined the effects of SIGIRR overexpression on Toll-IL-1R signaling. Specifically, we used 293 cells transfected with IL-1RI, TLR4, and MD2, which were responsive to IL-1 and LPS; HeLa cells, which were responsive to IL-1, flagellin, and poly(I:C); and HepG2 cells, which were responsive to IL-1.

This event was marked by the induction of several protein kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt), p21-activated kinase-2 (PAK-2), and their downstream effector (ERK) as well as an increase in PKB intrinsic activity. PI3K, phospho (p)-PKB, and PAK were co-localized to the site of apical ES in the seminiferous epithelium of the rat testis in immunohistochemistry studies. Furthermore, PI3K also co-localized with p-PKB to the same site in the epithelium as determined by fluorescence microscopy, consistent with their localization at the ES. These kinases were shown to associate with ES-associated proteins such as β1-integrin, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, and c-Src by co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting that the integrin·laminin protein complex at the apical ES likely utilizes these protein kinases as regulatory proteins to modulate Sertoli-germ cell adherens junction dynamics via the ERK signaling pathway. To validate this hypothesis further, an in vivo model using AF-2364 (1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide) to perturb Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junction function, inducing germ cell loss from the epithelium in adult rats, was used in conjunction with specific inhibitors. Interestingly, the event of germ cell loss induced by AF-2364 in vivo was also associated with induction of PI3K, p-PKB, PAK-2, and p-ERK as well as a surge in intrinsic PKB activity. Perhaps the most important of all, pretreatment of rats with wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) or anti-β1-integrin antibody via intratesticular injection indeed delayed AF-2364-induced spermatid loss from the epithelium. In summary, these results illustrate that Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junction dynamics in the testis are regulated, at least in part, via the β1-integrin/PI3K/PKB/ERK signaling pathway. When Sertoli and germ cells were co-cultured in vitro in serum-free chemically defined medium, functional anchoring junctions such as cell-cell intermediate filament-based desmosome-like junctions and cell-cell actin-based adherens junctions (e.g. ectoplasmic specialization (ES)) were formed within 1-2 days.

In summary, these results illustrate that Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junction dynamics in the testis are regulated, at least in part, via the β1-integrin/PI3K/PKB/ERK signaling pathway. In the seminiferous epithelium of the rat testis, Sertoli-germ cell adhesion is maintained by cell-cell actin-based adherens junctions (AJs) 1The abbreviations used are: AJs, adherens junctions; ES, ectoplasmic specialization(s); BTB, blood-testis barrier; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SH2, Src homology 2; PPI, polyphosphoinositide; PI-4,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI-3,4,5-P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PH, pleckstrin homology; PKB, protein kinase B; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1; PAK, p21-activated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FA, focal adhesion; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TJ, tight junction; EGF, epidermal growth factor; p-, phospho-; Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. and intermediate filament-based desmosome-like junctions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 825-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Vogl A.W. Pfeiffer D.C. Mulholland D. Kimel G. Guttman J. Arch. Histol.

The best studied testis-specific AJ type is ectoplasmic specialization (ES). The ES is confined between Sertoli cells (known as the basal ES) at the site of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) as well as between Sertoli cells and spermatids (known as the apical ES) in the adluminal compartment of the epithelium (for reviews, see Refs. 3Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar and 4Vogl A.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 119: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most of the studies on cell adhesion function in the testis in the past 2 decades have focused on the apical ES because the biochemical composition of the desmosome-like junction remains largely unexplored in the testis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 825-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 3Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, and 5Toyama Y. Maekawa M. Yuasa S. Anat. Sci. Int. 2003; 78: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The apical ES is an important anchoring junction device that provides mechanical adhesion of spermatids onto the nourishing Sertoli cells to assist movement of developing spermatids across the epithelium and to ensure proper orientation of spermatids in the epithelium so that fully developed spermatids can be released to the tubule lumen during spermiation. Without this timely event of spermatid movement, spermatogenesis cannot be completed, leading to infertility. Although the morphology of the ES has been characterized for almost 3 decades, its biochemical composition and molecular architecture have not been known until recently. Furthermore, the underlying regulatory mechanism(s) that regulates ES dynamics remains largely unexplored (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 825-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 6de Kretser D.M. Kerr J.B. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. I. Raven Press, New York1988: 837-932Google Scholar, and 7Siu M.K.Y. Cheng C.Y. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 978-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that ES dynamics are regulated by focal adhesion complex-associated proteins such as β1-integrin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and vinculin. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that tyrosine-phosphorylated (activated) FAK is a crucial linker between β1-integrin and other ES components at the apical ES (7Siu M.K.Y. Cheng C.Y. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 978-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Siu M.K.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2141-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As such, a better understanding of the downstream signaling pathway(s) of integrin and FAK is crucial to the study of ES dynamics. This is also important to developmental biologists and reproductive physiologists because it helps unfold the underlying mechanism that regulates junction restructuring events in the seminiferous epithelium pertinent to spermatogenesis. Autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 can recruit a variety of cytosolic proteins to the plasma membrane (for review, see Ref. 9Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). For example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p85α, the adaptor subunit of PI3K, is one of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins that bind to FAK (10Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 11Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon this binding, p85α subsequently recruits the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates polyphosphoinositides (PPIs; predominantly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2)) at position 3 of the inositol ring, producing a second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3) (for reviews, see Refs. 11Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Merlot S. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3471-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Foster F.M. Traer C.J. Abraham S.M. Fry M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3037-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The accumulated PI-3,4,5-P3 acts as membrane anchor that recruits and activates pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins such as protein kinase B (PKB; a Ser/Thr kinase also known as Akt), which is a PI3K effector (for reviews, see Refs. 11Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 12Merlot S. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3471-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The membrane-localized PKB is then activated via phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 by a second phosphoinositide-dependent Ser/Thr kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), and a yet-to-be identified “Ser473 kinase,” respectively. In turn, the activated PKB phosphorylates its downstream effectors at the plasma membrane, in the cytosol, and in the nucleus. Depending on the specific effector that is being activated, diverse biological processes such as glucose metabolism, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, transcription regulation, and cell motility can be modulated by PKB (for reviews, see Refs. 14Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar and 15Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The turnover of PI-3,4,5-P3 is mediated by phosphatases, which dephosphorylate the 3′-end of the lipid, leading to a reduction of the pool of lipids capable of PKB binding, thus negatively regulating the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) is the major lipid phosphatase that antagonizes the reactions catalyzed by PI3K (16Marino M. Acconcia F. Trentalance A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2583-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is accumulating evidence that the PI3K/PKB pathway plays an important role in the formation and stabilization of AJs, linking AJ components to the cytoskeleton in keratinocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, mammary epithelial cells, and Caco-2/15 cells (18Munshi H.G.

In the testis, PI-4,5-P2 and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C have been identified in the ES (20Guttman J.A. Janmey P. Vogl A.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 499-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway has recently been shown to be regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone in 20-day-old Sertoli cells (21Meroni S.B.

Endocrinol. 2002; 174: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the upstream and downstream mediators of the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway in the testis and its contribution to junction dynamics, especially at the apical ES. p21-activated kinases (PAK)-1-3 (Ser/Thr protein kinases) are direct PKB effectors (for reviews, see Refs. 12Merlot S. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3471-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev.

The activation of PAKs by direct binding to the active Rac and Cdc42 GTPases has been well established. In addition, PAKs can be activated through a variety of GTPase-independent mechanisms, including the direct phosphorylation by other kinases such as PKB and PDK1 (24Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 25Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8058-8069Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because of their complicated activation processes and the presence of multiple substrates, PAKs serve as important modulators for a wide range of cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell transformation (for review, see Ref. 24Bokoch G.M.

One interesting feature of PAKs is their ability to phosphorylate Raf-1 in a PI3K-dependent manner, which, along with integrin, mediates the Ras signaling pathway that leads to activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling cascade (for review, see Ref. 25Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Besides PAKs, PKB is another crucial downstream mediator of the PI3K/Raf-1 cross-talk in the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (14Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 27Moelling K. Schad K. Bosse M. Zimmermann S. Schweneker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31099-31106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the testis, activated ERK has been localized at the apical ES at the time of spermiation, implicating its role in ES disassembly (28Chapin R.E. Wine R.N. Harris M.W. Borchers C.H. Haseman J.K. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 1030-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism(s) for ERK-mediated ES dynamics remains largely undefined. Furthermore, PI3K, PKB, PAK, and ERK are imperative regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics, conferring cell migration at the focal adhesion (FA) site. Because cytoskeletal rearrangement is an essential process for ES restructuring (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 825-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Vogl A.W. Pfeiffer D.C. Mulholland D. Kimel G. Guttman J. Arch. Histol.

BioEssays. 2004; 26: 978-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it is possible that the PI3K/PKB/PAK/ERK pathway is the major downstream signaling cascade of integrin and FAK at the apical ES (7Siu M.K.Y. Cheng C.Y. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 978-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Siu M.K.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2141-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that regulates ES restructuring. To elucidate the involvement of these kinases in ES dynamics, the expression and activation of these signal mediators during AJ restructuring and their localization in the testis were examined in both in vitro and in vivo models. These findings further support the hypothesis that FA complex-associated proteins are involved in ES dynamics and that the ES is a hybrid cell-cell and cell-matrix actin-based anchoring junction type. Animals—Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Kingston, MA). The use of animals reported herein was approved by The Rockefeller University Laboratory Animal Use and Care Committee with Protocol Numbers 00111 and 03017. Primary Sertoli Cell Cultures—Sertoli cells were isolated from the testes of 20-day-old rats (29Grima J. Wong C.C.S. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21040-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at high cell density (0.5 × 106 cells/cm2) on 12-well dishes (Corning) coated with Matrigel™ (Collaborative Biochemical Products, Bedford, MA) in 1:1 (v/v) nutrient mixture F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (3 ml/well) supplemented with growth factors as described (29Grima J.

After 48 h of incubation, cultures were hypotonically treated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 2.5 min to lyse residual germ cells (31Galdieri M. Ziparo E. Palombi F. Russo M.A. Stefanini M. J. Androl. 1981; 5: 249-259Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar), followed by two successive washes with F-12/DMEM to remove cell debris. The media were replaced every 24 h. The purity of these Sertoli cell cultures was routinely analyzed by electron and light microscopy (32Mruk D.D. Zhu L.J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lui W.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as well as by reverse transcription-PCR as described (34Lee N.P.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells cultured for 5 days were either lysed in SDS lysis buffer (0.125 m Tris (pH 6.8) at 22 °C containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.6% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1 μm sodium okadate) for immunoblotting experiments or used for Sertoli-germ cell co-cultures. Germ Cell Isolation—Germ cells were isolated from 90-day-old rat testes by a mechanical procedure (35Aravindan G.R. Pineau C.P. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except that elongating/elongated spermatids were not removed by omitting the glass wool filtration step. Isolated germ cells were incubated with 1 μm gelsolin (Sigma) in F-12/DMEM for 15 min to disrupt residual actin cytoskeleton in the ES structure that might remain associated with elongating/elongated spermatids. This concentration was selected based on a previous study (36Strege P.R. Holm A.N. Rich A. Miller S.M. Ou Y. Sarr M.G. Farrugia G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C60-C66Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purity of germ cells was >95% when examined microscopically and assessed by other criteria (34Lee N.P.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Germ cells were either lysed in SDS lysis buffer for immunoblotting or used for Sertoli-germ cell co-cultures within 1 h after isolation. Sertoli-Germ Cell Co-cultures—Germ cells isolated from adult rat testes were added onto the Sertoli cell epithelium on day 6 after Sertoli cells had been cultured alone for 5 days, forming an intact epithelium (32Mruk D.D. Zhu L.J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar), and co-cultured at a Sertoli/germ cell ratio of 1:1 to permit ES assembly. Time 0 represents the time at which germ cells were added onto the Sertoli cell epithelium. Co-cultures were terminated at specific time points by SDS lysis buffer for immunoblotting or by cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for kinase assay. Using this approach, any changes in target proteins or intrinsic kinase activity could be ascribed to the assembly of Sertoli-germ cell anchoring junctions (viz. apical ES and desmosome-like junctions) because basal ES and tight junctions (TJs) had already been established when Sertoli cells were cultured alone for 5 days. Seminiferous Tubule Cultures—Seminiferous tubules were isolated from the testes of adult rats (∼300 g of body weight) with negligible Leydig cell contamination (37Zwain I.H. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lysates were obtained by homogenizing tubules in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.125 m Tris (pH 6.8) at 22 °C containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1 μm sodium okadate). Effects of Chelating Agents (e.g. EGTA and EDTA), Vanadate, and the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) on the levels of Protein Kinases and Intrinsic PKB Activity—Because several studies have reported that EDTA can interact with vanadate via chelation (39Kustin K.

Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the free concentration of vanadate in the sample buffer and thus limiting the inhibitory effect of vanadate on protein-tyrosine phosphatases, we performed some of the experiments either (i) by substituting EDTA (2 mm; note that EDTA is widely used in buffers for studying protein phosphorylation, including those obtained commercially) with EGTA (2 mm) in lysis buffers because this latter chelating agent has been shown to form a much weaker complex with vanadate (43Crans D.C. Bunch R.L. Theisen L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or (ii) by replacing EDTA or EGTA that served as a metalloprotease inhibitor in the buffer with 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (a metalloprotease inhibitor) and compared the results with lysis buffers containing EDTA. This applied to different buffers used in this study, including the cell lysis buffer to be used for intrinsic kinase assay (see below). On this note, we anticipated that endogenous protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors could protect samples from unwanted activities of protein-tyrosine phosphatase; however, a complete blockade of protein-tyrosine phosphatase could shift the base line of the intrinsic kinase activity, but plausibly not the trend of activation. Furthermore, EGF (a well known receptor protein-tyrosine kinase), which was present in the Sertoli cell cultures at 2.5 ng/ml as a growth factor in our experiments as described previously (44Cheng C.Y. Mather J.P. Byer A.L. Bardin C.W. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 45Mather J.P. Zhuang L.Z. Perez-Infante V. Phillips D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 383: 44-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), has recently been shown to stimulate Sertoli cell ERK activity at 100 ng/ml (46Crepieux P. Marion S. Martinat N. Fafeur V. Vern Y.L.

Biophys. 2002; 399: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As such, additional controls were included in Sertoli-germ cell co-cultures in which EGF was omitted in the nutrient mixture F-12/DMEM. We expected that the endogenous ERK and phospho (p)-ERK basal levels in co-cultures containing EGF would be higher than in those without EGF; however, its presence plausibly would not interfere with the trend of p-ERK1/2 activation during AJ assembly. Treatment of Rats with AF-2364 to Induce Germ Cell Loss from the Seminiferous Epithelium—AF-2364 (1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide) was synthesized to a purity of >99.8% as described (48Cheng C.Y. Silvestrini B. Grima J. Mo M.Y. Zhu L.J. Johansson E. Saso L. Leone M.G. Palmery M. Mruk D. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This compound has been shown to perturb Sertoli-germ cell adhesion function to induce premature loss of germ cells from the epithelium, causing reversible infertility in rats (48Cheng C.Y. Silvestrini B. Grima J. Mo M.Y. Zhu L.J. Johansson E. Saso L. Leone M.G. Palmery M. Mruk D. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 49Grima J. Silvestrini B. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of the targets of AF-2364 is the apical ES without affecting the BTB integrity (3Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 747-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Adult rats weighing 250-300 g were fed one dose of AF-2364 at 50 mg/kg of body weight. The time when the rats were fed AF-2364 was designated time 0 (control). Thereafter, rats were housed separately for 15 days. Testes were removed at specified time points from a group of three rats for each time point. For immunoblotting, testes were homogenized for lysate preparation either in SDS lysis buffer (for immunoblotting) or in cell lysis buffer (for PKB intrinsic kinase assay). For immunohistochemistry, testes were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed to examine the functional ES structures found in Sertoli-germ cell co-cultures, which were terminated 48 h after addition of germ cells to the Sertoli cell epithelium, as described previously (50Lee N.P.Y. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3114-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Protein concentration was estimated by Coomassie Blue dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Proteins (∼100 μg from each sample within an experimental group) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 12.5% T) under reducing conditions (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained. All primary antibodies were shown to cross-react with the corresponding target proteins in rats as indicated by the manufacturers (Table I). Depending on the origin of the primary antibody, one of the following horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies was used: bovine anti-rabbit IgG, bovine anti-goat IgG, or goat anti-mouse IgG.

https://openalex.org/W2038672793,"Bcl-xL plays a critical role in maintaining cell survival. However, the relationship between the potential interaction of Bcl-xL with other cytosolic proteins and the regulation of cell survival remains incompletely defined. We have identified translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), a multifunctional protein, as a novel antiapoptotic Bcl-xL-interacting protein. TCTP interacted in vivo and in vitro with Bcl-xL, and their sites have been mapped to an N-terminal region of TCTP and the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 of Bcl-xL. Consistent with a role in maintaining T-cell survival during activation, TCTP was significantly upregulated in murine T cells activated by T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation and CD28 costimulation, which was correlated with the upregulation of Bcl-xL in activated T cells. Moreover, downregulation of TCTP expression by antisense technology in T cells results in the increase of T-cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the N-terminal region of TCTP was required for its ability to inhibit apoptosis. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that an N-terminal region of a cytosolic protein, TCTP, is required for its binding to Bcl-xL and for its antiapoptotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1974770940,"G proteins transmit a variety of extracellular signals into intracellular responses. The Gα and Gβγ subunits are both known to regulate effectors. Interestingly, the Gα subunit also determines subtype specificity of Gβγ effector interactions. However, in light of the common paradigm that Gα and Gβγ subunits dissociate during activation, a plausible mechanism of how this subtype specificity is generated was lacking. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay developed to directly measure mammalian G protein activation in intact cells, we demonstrate that fluorescent Gαi1,2,3, Gαz, and Gβ1γ2 subunits do not dissociate during activation but rather undergo subunit rearrangement as indicated by an activation-induced increase in FRET. In contrast, fluorescent Gαo subunits exhibited an activation-induced decrease in FRET, reflecting subunit dissociation or, alternatively, a distinct subunit rearrangement. The αB/C-region within the α-helical domain, which is much more conserved within Gαi1,2,3 and Gαz as compared with that in Gαo, was found to be required for exhibition of an activation-induced increase in FRET between fluorescent Gα and Gβγ subunits. However, the αB/C-region of Gαil alone was not sufficient to transfer the activation pattern of Gαi to the Gαo subunit. Either residues in the first 91 amino acids or in the C-terminal remainder (amino acids 93–354) of Gαil together with the αB/C-helical region of Gαi1 were needed to transform the Gαo-activation pattern into a Gαi1-type of activation. The discovery of subtype-selective mechanisms of G protein activation illustrates that G protein subfamilies have specific mechanisms of activation that may provide a previously unknown basis for G protein signaling specificity.

The discovery of subtype-selective mechanisms of G protein activation illustrates that G protein subfamilies have specific mechanisms of activation that may provide a previously unknown basis for G protein signaling specificity. Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce and modulate many biological signals such as neurotransmissions, hormone-mediated signals, chemotaxis signals, cell growth signals, and also visual and olfactory signals. Common to all heterotrimeric G proteins is the fact that their activation by G protein-coupled receptors involves binding of GTP in exchange for GDP. Both Gα and Gβγ subunits of activated G proteins can regulate downstream effectors such as enzymes or ion channels. To achieve proper regulation of cellular responses, it is critically important that G proteins interact with effectors in a subtype-specific manner. However, it is unknown how this specificity of G protein subtypes for effectors is achieved. The principle of generating G protein subtype specificity for Gα effector interaction may be based on the existence of a direct contact between Gα and its effectors, allowing discrimination between different Gα subtypes. Much more puzzling is the question of how effectors for Gβγ subunits are able to discriminate between Gβγ subunits derived from different Gα subtypes. The common notion over the past two decades has been that, upon activation, G proteins will dissociate, and each of the subunits can interact independently with and modulate their effectors (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4686) Google Scholar, 2Bourne H.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 504-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This dogma of subunit dissociation has been questioned by different lines of experimental evidence (3Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For instance, Levitzki and co-workers have demonstrated that the fusion of Gα to its cognate Gβγ subunit did not impair G protein function, suggesting that subunit dissociation is not required for proper signaling (4Klein S. Reuveni H. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3219-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Levitzki A. Klein S. Reuveni H. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, binding sites for Gα have been demonstrated to exist on classical Gβγ effectors such as GIRK 1The abbreviations used are: GIRK, G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+; AA, amino acid(s); AR, adrenergic receptor; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NA, noradrenaline; PTX, pertussis toxin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GIRK, G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+; AA, amino acid(s); AR, adrenergic receptor; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NA, noradrenaline; PTX, pertussis toxin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. channels (6Peleg S.

Moreover, we recently developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay using fluorescent G protein subunits to monitor G protein activity in living mammalian cells and found that Gαi1 and Gβ1γ2 subunits did not dissociate during activation but rather underwent a subunit rearrangement that is characterized by a decrease in the distance between the N-terminal region of Gβγ and the α-helical domain of Gαi1 (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In earlier studies using G proteins in Dictyostelium, Devreotes and co-workers developed this FRET-based method to monitor G protein activation in living cells (9Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For these adenylyl cyclase-stimulating G proteins, the FRET studies were in line with a dissociation of the G proteins as reflected by a decrease in FRET between fluorescent Gα and Gβγ subunits. Similarly, yeast Gpa1 proteins appear to dissociate during activation (10Yi T.M. Kitano H. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Based on the opposing results in these FRET studies, it was an obvious necessity to investigate additional mammalian G protein subunits in order to determine the origin of these differences. We therefore adapted the FRET-based assay to study activation of the remaining major subtypes of the Gαi/o family, including Gαi2,3, Gαz, and Gαo. Molecular Biology and Cell Culture—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the cDNAs of rat Gαi2,3 and Gαo1 as well as human Gαz (kindly provided by Dr. Offermanns). The cDNAs encoding the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein F46L (YFP) (11Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat.

Short linkers as described for the cloning of Gαi1-YFP were used (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Constructions were performed by PCR and verified by sequencing of PCR constructs. Generation of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to the N terminus of Gβ1 has been described previously (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). When indicated, a similar construct was used in which the CFP was replaced by cerulean, a CFP variant with improved fluorescent properties (11Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). All cDNAs encoding for fluorescent G protein subunits were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).

Jan). External Buffer—The external buffer contained 124 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3. Internal Buffer (Whole-cell Patch)—The internal buffer contained 100 mm potassium aspartate, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium ATP, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm GTP or 100 μm GTPγS if indicated, pH 7.4 (adjusted with KOH). Fluorescence Measurements—FRET measurements were performed as single cell experiments as described (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) using a Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert 200) with an oil immersion 63× objective and a dual emission photometric system based on highly amplified photodiodes and Polychrome IV as the excitation system (both Till Photonics). The illumination time was set to 5–60 ms applied with a frequency between 1 and 20 Hz to avoid time-dependent loss of FRET due to photobleaching. FRET ratios were calculated as the ratio of the YFP and CFP emission, FYFP/FCFP. FYFP represents the YFP emission (535 nm channel) upon excitation at 436 ± 10 nm corrected for CFP spillover and direct excitation. The YFP emission upon excitation at 490 nm was recorded at the beginning of each experiment to subtract direct excitation of YFP (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). FRET between CFP and YFP was also determined by donor dequenching after acceptor photobleaching (5 min of illumination at 500 nm using dual emission/excitation filter for CFP/YFP (AF Analysetechnik GmbH, Tübingen)). To do so, FCFP was recorded (50 ms excitation at 436 nm) every second followed by excitation of YFP at 500 nm for 920 ms, again applied with a frequency of 1 Hz for 5 min. The increase of FCFP during this photobleaching protocol was measured. Direct bleaching of CFP by this bleaching protocol was measured in cells expressing CFP-containing constructs in the absence of YFP (3.5% decrease in CFP over 5 min), and all data were corrected for this effect. To determine agonist-induced changes in FRET, cells were continuously superfused with external buffer (see above), and agonist was applied using a rapid superfusion device (solution exchange within 5–10 ms) (15Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—GIRK currents activated via fluorescent G protein subunits were measured as described previously (16Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Experimental conditions, including external and internal solutions, were the same as those described previously (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Origin (Microcal) was used for data analysis and statistics (summarized data are expressed as mean ± S.E.). Where indicated, Student's two-population t test was used to determine significant differences between two groups of data. Trimeric Fluorescent Gαoβ1γ2 Proteins May Dissociate, whereas Gαi1β1γ2 Subunits Rearrange during Activation—To analyze G protein activation in living cells within the Gi family, we used a previously employed FRET-based approach in which we made use of fusion proteins between G protein subunits and green fluorescent protein-derived fluorescent proteins. G protein αi2,3, αo, and αz subunits were fluorescence-labeled at the αAB loop within the α-helical domain by insertion of enhanced YFP (F46L) between Leu-91 and AA 92 similarly as described previously for Gαi1 (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Gαi3 and Gαo subunits were mutated to replace the cysteine close to the C terminus, which is known to be the target of ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin (12Bahia D.S. Wise A. Fanelli F. Lee M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11555-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with isoleucine. The functionality of Gα-YFP fusion proteins was indicated by proper membrane targeting (Figs. 2A, 3, A, C, and E, 4C, and Suppl. Fig. 2A) and the ability to associate with CFP-labeled Gβ1γ2 subunits as detected by FRET. In addition, for Gαo-YFP and Gαz-YFP, functional coupling to GIRK channels was verified in PTX-pretreated cells (Supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, available in the on-line version of this article) as shown previously for Gαi1-YFP (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).Fig. 3FRET signals increase during activation of Gαi2,3 and Gαz similarly to Gαi1. Gαi2,3 and Gαz were fused to YFP(F46L) at identical positions as described for Gαi1 and Gαo1, and functional expression was verified by intact membrane targeting to the plasma membrane as illustrated in YFP images of Gαi2 (A), Gαi3 (C), and Gαz, (E) (image width, 35.8 μm). Representative FRET experiments of cells expressing Gαi2-YFP (B), Gαi3-YFP (D), or Gαz-YFP (F), together with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 (or, instead, cerulean-N-Gβ1γ2 (B), where CFP was replaced by the CFP mutant cerulean, which has improved fluorescence properties (13Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar)) and α2A-AR, illustrate that receptor stimulation with NA induced in all cases an increase in FRET between the YFP of Gα and the CFP on the N terminus of Gβ1, suggesting subunit rearrangement instead of dissociation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4The αB-C helical region of Gαi is required for a Gi-type subunit rearrangement. A, to find structural correlates for the opposing FRET responses of Gαo as compared with Gαi1,2,3 or Gαz proteins, primary sequences of these Gα subunits were compared. The strongest deviation of the Gαo sequence from those of the other four Gα subunits was found to be in the α-helical domain between AA 89 and AA 138 (AA 139 for Gαo) (residues that are present in Gαo (row marked o) but not in any of the other four sequences are highlighted in red). B, to illustrate where these different AA residues are localized within the tertiary structure, structural models based on the crystal structure of the complex between Gαi1 and Gβ1γ2 are illustrated either as a space-filled model (left) or as a ribbon diagram depicting secondary structures (right). The color code of the space filled model is as follows: gray, neutral AA; blue, positively charged AA; red, negatively charged AA; and yellow, residues that are different in Gαo1 from the corresponding ones in Gαi1,2,3 and Gαz. C, to determine the relevance of the αB-C region of Gαi regarding the observed differential direction of the agonist-induced FRET changes of Gαo versus Gαi1,2,3 and Gαz proteins, a YFP-tagged chimera (named iYFPoi) based on Gαi1-YFP was generated in which AA 92–138 of Gαi1 was replaced by AA 92–139 of Gαo1 as indicated by boxed sequence of the Gαo1 in panel A. The chimeric construct was expressed at least partially at the cell membrane as seen by YFP fluorescence (image width, 35.8 μm). D, co-expression of iYFPoi with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 resulted in detectable FRET, which decreased upon activation of co-expressed α2A-AR receptors with noradrenaline, as illustrated here by a representative experiment. The upper traces show normalized CFP fluorescence (cyan) and YFP fluorescence because of FRET (yellow), and the lower trace depicts the FRET ratio FYFP/FCFP similarly as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The initial aim of this study was to investigate whether all members of the Gαi family behave like Gαi1 with respect to a subunit rearrangement during activation. This rearrangement is reflected by an increase in FRET between Gα-YFP and co-expressed CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 or Gβ1CFP-N-γ2. First, we compared Gαo-YFP and Gαi1-YFP co-expressed with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 and α2A-ARs. FRET was detected between Gαi1-YFP and CFP-Gβγ using ratiometric FRET measurements of single transfected HEK cells (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Upon activation of α2A-adrenergic receptors by fast superfusion of noradrenaline (NA), a substantial increase in FRET was observed (Fig. 1A). Similarly, an agonist-induced increase in FRET was observed between Gαi1-YFP and Gβ1CFP-N-γ2 (Fig. 1B). In cells expressing Gαo-YFP and either CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 or Gβ1CFP-N-γ2, similar FRET ratios compared with those between Gαi1-YFP and CFP-Gβγ were observed (Table I). In contrast to Gαi1-YFP, Gαo-YFP exhibited a decrease in FRET upon receptor activation when paired either with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 1C and Table I) or with Gb1CFP-N-γ2 (Fig. 1D or Table I).Table IComparison of basal FRET and agonist-induced changes in FRET between fluorescent Gβ γ and Gαo subunits or Gαi1 subunitsGα subunitGβγ subunitBasal FYFP/FCFP (n)NA-induced change of FYFP/FCFP (n)%Gαo-YFPCFP-N-Gβ1γ20.63 ± 0.08 (7)-19.7 ± 1.8 (7)Gαo-YFPGβ1CFP-N-Gγ20.48 ± 0.03 (11)-15.9 ± 1.8 (11)Gαi1-YFPCFP-N-Gβ1γ20.59 ± 0.06 (9)32.3 ± 2.5 (9)Gαi1-YFPGβ1CFP-N-Gγ20.41 ± 0.03 (14)16.5 ± 2.9 (8) Open table in a new tab The agonist-induced decrease in FRET between Gαo-YFP and CFP-Gβγ was observed at all expression levels tested (low to moderate) and reflects either dissociation between Gα and Gβγ subunits during activation or a subunit rearrangement that is distinct from Gαi1 and characterized by an increase in distance between the N-terminal region of Gβ or Gγ relative to the α-helical region of Gαo. However, this short term activation (5–20 s) by saturating concentrations of NA did not result in a complete loss of FRET (Fig. 1, C and D) as determined also by donor dequenching after acceptor photobleaching (25.7 ± 10.6% decrease in FRET, CFP-N-Gγ2, n = 5; not shown). The remaining FRET after stimulation of receptors could be explained either by incomplete activation of G proteins or by incomplete dissociation of activated Go proteins. To test for these possibilities, we applied GTPγS to the patch pipette during whole-cell patch clamp experiments and observed an additional time-dependent loss in FRET as depicted by a representative experiment shown in Fig. 2B. It should be noted that because of the bleed-through subtraction method used, a remaining FRET ratio of 0.15 corresponds to mean FRET ratios obtained in cells expressing CFP without YFP (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and, therefore, does not indicate the existence of FRET. This suggests that short term stimulation of receptors may not be sufficient to fully activate all G proteins in the cell. Alternatively, the results might indicate a requirement for prolonged stimulation times for complete dissociation of Go proteins. In this scenario, temporal scaffolding could prevent complete dissociation of the heterotrimer during activation. Heterotrimeric Fluorescent Gαi2,3 and Gαz Proteins Undergo Subunit Rearrangement Rather than Dissociation upon Activation—To test whether the subunit rearrangement characterized by a decreased distance between the N-terminal region of Gβγ and the α-helical domain of Gα that was found for Gαi1 was specific for Gαi1 or represents a more common feature, we also tested YFP-labeled Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαz together with CFP-labeled Gβ1. All Gα-YFP constructs were functional with respect to a proper membrane targeting (Fig. 3, A, C, and E) as well as association with Gβγ as reflected by exhibiting FRET with co-expressed fluorescent Gβγ subunits (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Similarly to Gαi1, fluorescent G proteins composed of Gαi2 or Gαi3 and Gβ1γ2 exhibited an increase in FRET upon stimulation with an agonist (Fig. 3, B and D). YFP-labeled Gαz, which also belongs to the Gi/o family but exhibits less homology to Gαi1 as compared with Gαi2 and Gαi3, was also co-expressed together with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 and α2A-adrenergic receptors and, again, a NA-induced increase in FRET was detected (Fig. 3F). Similarly to all Gα-YFP constructs described, Gαz-YFP was functional with respect to proper membrane targeting (Fig. 3E) and assembly with CFP-labeled-Gβγ as determined by FRET microscopy (Fig. 3F). In addition, whole-cell patch experiments designed to test for G protein effector coupling similar to those described above for Gαo-YFP and for Gαi1-YFP (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) revealed that Gαz-YFP was able to mediate NA-induced GIRK channel activation in PTX-pretreated cells co-expressing α2A-AR and GIRK1/4 channels (Supplemental Fig. 1B, available in the online version of this article). Furthermore, Gαz-YFP paired with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 exhibited normal coupling to α2A-AR receptors as determined by concentration-response curves in HEK cells stably expressing α2A-AR (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). 2M. Bünemann, M. Frank, L. Thümer, and M. J. Lohse, unpublished observations. Our results to date suggest that receptor-activated Gi1,2,3 and Gz undergo subunit rearrangement rather than subunit dissociation, whereas Go proteins either rearrange with a very distinct pattern or dissociate during activation. The αB/C Region of Gαi Is Required for Agonist-induced Increase in FRET—We reasoned that there must be structural differences between Gαo and the other members of the Gαi family that are responsible for the differential behavior. A comparison of the primary sequences as depicted in Fig. 4A revealed the most pronounced deviation between Gαo and the other members of the Gαi family to be in the α-helical domain between AA 89 and AA 138 with <40% identity within this region starting right after the αA helix and encompassing the αB helix and part of αC helix including the connecting linker. Intriguingly, this αB/C region is located within the cleft between Gαi1 and Gβγ of the inactive heterotrimer facing toward the Gβγ subunit as illustrated by the crystal structure (residues colored yellow in the space-filling structure shown in Fig. 4B) (17Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). To test whether this region is indeed important for the persistent trimeric assembly during activation of Gαi-like proteins, we generated chimeric proteins between Gαi1 and Gαo1 using YFP-labeled variants and tested the resulting constructs using our FRET assay. To do so, we replaced AA 92–138 of Gαi1 with AA 92–139 of Gαo (iYFPoi; Fig. 5) and vice versa (oYFPio, replacement of AA 92–139 of Gαo by AA 92–138 of Gαi1; Fig. 5). Both YFP-labeled chimeric constructs were expressed at least partially at the cell membrane as seen by YFP fluorescence (Fig. 4C and Supplemental Fig. 2A). In addition, both constructs exhibited FRET upon co-expression with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 (FRET ratio of 0.54 ± 0.07, n = 4 for oYFPio and FRET ratio of 0.65 ± 0.08, n = 4 for iYFPoi), suggesting functional interaction with Gβγ subunits and thus indicating functional expression. Functionality measured as coupling to GIRK channels was not abolished by the insertion of AA 92–139 of Gαo into Gαi1 (Supplemental Fig. 1C). Interestingly, when co-expressed with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2, iYFPoi exhibited a robust decrease in FRET upon activation by α2A-AR stimulation (10.7 ± 0.8% decrease of FRET ratio, n = 4; Fig. 4D), resembling the activation pattern of Gαo. Because Gαi1 was able to release the N-terminal region of the Gβγ subunit by just replacing AA 92–139 with the corresponding region from Gαo, it can be concluded that the αB/C-region of Gαi is actually required for activation-induced subunit rearrangement characterized by a decrease in distance between the α-helical domain of the α-subunit and the N-terminal region of Gβ. oYFPio co-expressed with CFP-N-Gβ1γ2 and α2A-AR exhibited a substantial decrease in FRET upon stimulation with an agonist similarly to Gαo-YFP (7.5 ± 0.5% decrease in FRET, n = 4). This result suggested that the αB/C-region of Gαi1 is required but not sufficient for generating the Gi-type subunit rearrangement during activation. To find other regions of Gαi that work in concert with the αB/C-helical domain to scaffold Gβγ during activation, we generated additional chimeras between YFP-labeled Gαi and Gαo subunits and measured agonist-induced FRET changes in cells co-expressing cyan-fluorescent Gβγ subunits and α2A-AR. Gαi1-YFP subunits in which just the N-terminal 91 AA region was replaced by the corresponding sequence of Gαo (oYFPii, Fig. 5) exhibited robust FRET in the context of CFP-β1γ2. Upon stimulation of α2A-AR, an increase in FRET was observed, suggesting that regions C-terminally to AA 139 can work in concert with the αB/C-helical region to scaffold Gβγ during activation. However, a chimeric Gαi1-YFP subunit in which the last 215 AA originated from Gαo (iYFPio, Fig. 5) similarly exhibited an activation-induced increase in FRET if coexpressed with CFP-β1γ2. This observation suggested that parts of the first 91 AA of Gαi1 in the context of the αB/C-helical domain of Gαi1 also participate in inducing the subunit rearrangement exhibited by Gαi1. In contrast, iYFPoo, a Gαo-YFP-based construct that contained the first 91 AA of Gαi1, exhibited an activation-induced decrease in FRET similarly to Gαo-YFP, suggesting that the N-terminal region of Gαi1 itself is not sufficient to tether the N-terminal region of Gβ close to the α-helical domain of Gα. The data collected to date suggested a primary role of the αB/C-helical domain of Gαi proteins in inducing the pattern of subunit rearrangement observed in activated G proteins containing Gαi1,2,3 or Gαz. Either region N- or C-terminal to the αB/C-helical domain contributed to this activation pattern, pointing to additional contact points between Gαi and Gβγ during activation. Both constructs oYFPii and iYFPio were able to mediate GIRK current activation, suggesting functionality (Supplemental. Fig. 1, D and E). To better understand if both the N- and the C-terminal contact points contribute to subunit rearrangement of Gαi1 subunits, we compared basal FRET and agonist-induced FRET changes in cells expressing α2A-AR, cerulean-Gβ1γ2, and either iYFPii, iYFPio, or oYFPii. No significant differences in basal FRET ratios were observed for all three groups, indicating that the fractions of fluorescent partners as well as the distance constraints and orientation of the fluorophores were similar for these constructs. Interestingly, the agonist-induced increase in FRET was significantly less in the context of oYFPii compared with iiYFPi and iiYFPo (10.2% compared with 32.6 and 26.8%; Fig. 6, A and C). No significant differences were found for the amplitude of agonist-induced FRET increases when comparing iiYFPi and iiYFPo (Fig. 6, A and C). These results suggested that the N-terminal region (AA 1–91) together with the αB/C-helical domain of Gαi1 is sufficient to transfer all properties of Gαi1 regarding extent and subunit orientation during activation-induced subunit rearrangement of Gi proteins (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The replacement of AA 1–91 of Gαi1 by the corresponding region of Gαo did not convert the resulting construct to a Gαo-like subunit that exhibited an agonist-induced decrease in FRET, most likely reflecting subunit dissociation. Based on substantial differences in the amplitude of agonist-induced FRET increases, it seems likely that the N-terminal region of Gαi1, in addition to the αB/C-helical domain, is responsible for organizing the orientation of the Gα and Gβγ subunits during activation. G proteins convert many physiological and pharmacological stimuli to cellular responses. Not only the α subunits of G proteins but also the βγ subunits target and modulate effector proteins to regulate cellular functions. It has been generally assumed, based primarily on biochemical experiments, that all G proteins will dissociate upon activation into Gα and Gβγ subunits; however, in recent years this dissociation has been questioned as being required for signaling (4Klein S. Reuveni H. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3219-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Levitzki A. Klein S. Reuveni H. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or shown in some cases not to occur in living cells (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The question of whether G proteins dissociate or not is particularly important in the context of how Gβγ-mediated signals can be selectively activated via G proteins containing certain Gα subtypes. Not much selectivity of Gα subtypes for binding to selective subtype combinations of Gβγ subunits has been found to date; thus, the selective coupling of a given G protein subtype to a Gβγ effector, which has been found under physiological conditions, is not easily explained. Using a FRET approach between genetically encoded YFP- and CFP-fluorescent G protein subunits, we recently found that, upon activation, G proteins composed of Gαi1β1γ2 subunits undergo subunit rearrangement rather than subunit dissociation (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). This subunit reorientation was characterized by an increase in FRET between YFP inserted into the αAB loop of Gαi1 and CFP fused to the N terminus of Gβ1 or the N terminus of Gγ2 subunits (14Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting a decrease in distance between the αA/B loop and the N-terminal region of Gβγ (8Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Previously published FRET studies on adenylyl cyclase stimulating proteins of Dictyostelium demonstrated an agonist-induced decrease of FRET between similarly labeled Gα and Gβγ subunits, supporting but not proving the notion of G protein dissociation during activation (9Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 10Yi T.M. Kitano H. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A likely explanation for the opposing results could be that differences in the G protein subtypes were responsible, because the experimental conditions, especially the insertion sites for CFP and YFP, were very similar. The findings in the present study showing that Gαo proteins exhibited activation-dependent loss of FRET with CFP-N-Gβγ (Fig. 1, C and D and Table I), a result that was also obtained independently very recently (18Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that, depending on the Gα subtype, heterotrimeric G proteins dissociate upon activation or undergo subunit rearrangement as described above. Whether or not the decrease in FRET reflects complete dissociation within physiological stimuli lengths or a subunit rearrangement that leads to an increase in distance between the fluorophores inserted into the G protein subunits remains unclear, because FRET signals were still detectable in the presence of short pulses of maximal receptor stimulation (Figs. 1, C and D and 2A). The fact that all members of the Gi/o/z family except Gαo exhibited agonist-dependent increases in FRET between fluorescent Gα and Gβγ subunits demonstrates that the proposed mechanism of subunit rearrangement during activation is not restricted to just Gαi1, but rather reflects a common feature of Gαi-Gαz proteins. Furthermore, the differential subunit assembly during activation of Gαo versus the rest of the Gαi family enabled us to detect and localize the αB/C region as a structure on Gαi proteins that is required for the Gi-type subunit arrangement during activation. Replacing the αB/C-region of Gαi1 with that of Gαo led to a Gα subunit that behaved indistinguishably from Gαo in FRET studies (Fig. 4D). The crystal structure of Gαi1 bound to Gβγ (17Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) illustrates that this αB/C-region of Gαi1 actually faces the open cleft toward the N-terminal region of Gβγ. These structures encourage speculation that the αB/C region may directly participate in maintaining contact with Gβγ during activation (Fig. 4B). However, the αB/C region is certainly not the only contact site of Gα with Gβγ during activation, because a Gαo subunit carrying the αB/C-region from Gαi1, despite being functional, still exhibited an activity-dependent decrease in FRET with Gβγ. Regions within the first 91 AA of Gαi1 may represent the other required contact site for the observed agonist-induced rearrangement of Gαi1 and Gβγ. This can be concluded from the results obtained with the chimera iYFPio, which behaved indistinguishably from Gαi1-YFP (iYFPii) regarding basal FRET and the amplitude of agonist-induced FRET signals in the context of cyan-fluorescent Gβγ subunits. Even though the αB/C-helical domain together with the first 91 AA is sufficient to transfer all FRET properties of Gαi1 toward Gαo, it cannot be excluded that regions downstream of the αB/C helical domain may contribute to interactions between Gα and Gβγ during activation. This might be reasoned by the finding that oYFPii, containing the first 91 AA from Gαo and the rest of the protein from Gαi1-YFP, also exhibited an agonist-induced increase in FRET in cells expressing cerulean-N-Gβ1γ2. However, the increase in FRET was only one-third as compared with those increases observed with Gαi1-YFP or iYFPio (Fig. 6, A and C) despite similar FRET values in the absence of an agonist (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the orientation of G protein subunits during activation was dependent on regions within the N-terminal 91AA of Gαi1. How does the differential behavior of Gαo and Gαi proteins relate to the function of those proteins? We have shown previously that G proteins composed of Gαi1-YFP and CFP-Gβγ were fully functional with respect to both receptor coupling and GIRK channel activation, demonstrating that G proteins do not need to dissociate to exert their function. Previously, a similar conclusion has been drawn by Levitzki and co-workers, as they were not able to detect physiological consequences of the fusion of Gα with Gβγ subunits in yeast (4Klein S. Reuveni H. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3219-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Levitzki A. Klein S. Reuveni H. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Gα subunits actually bind to certain Gβγ effectors such as GIRK channels, which is in agreement with our findings of subunit rearrangement instead of activation. Of course, it must be expected that effectors care about whether a G protein stays heterotrimeric during activation or dissociates. To date, a number of receptor-mediated signals have been attributed to certain Gα subtypes in native tissue, suggesting that Gα is critically involved in generating subtype-specific effector coupling (7Ivanina T. Varon D. Peleg S. Rishal I. Porozov Y. Dessauer C.W. Keren-Raifman T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17260-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Very obvious is the role of Gα subunits in directing Gβγ signals to Gβγ effectors, because to date the vast majority (if not all) of known Gβγ signals are blocked by pertussis toxin (20Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Sadja R. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2003; 39: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the result indicating that Gαi1,2,3 and Gαz will not dissociate from their Gβγ subunits and exhibit a distinct subunit arrangement during activation will not only impact the understanding of how Gβγ effectors are specifically coupled to certain Gα subunits but, similarly, may be important for the coupling of Gα subunits to their effectors, because a given effector might differentially select Gα subunits dependent on whether they dissociate during activation or stay in a heterotrimeric assembly. Intriguingly, in native tissue only Gαi1,2,3, but not Gαo, regulate adenylyl cyclases (22Rudolph U. Spicher K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3209-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whether the differential pattern of activation for Gαi1,2,3 compared with Gαo described herein just correlates with the subtype specificity of adenylyl cyclases or may actually be mechanistically coupled to it needs to be proven in future studies.

Inhibition of oestrogen signalling may account for the endocrine disorders, menstrual abnormalities, osteoporosis and weight gain that occur in a proportion of women treated with VPA for epilepsy or for bipolar mood disorder. Transcriptome profiling revealed that VPA and TSA also modulate the expression of, among others, key regulatory components of the cell cycle. Meta-analysis of genes directly responsive to oestrogen indicates that VPA and TSA have a generally antioestrogenic profile in ERα positive cells. Concomitant treatment with cycloheximide prevented most of these changes in gene expression, including downregulation of ERα mRNA, indicating that a limited number of genes signal a hyperacetylated state within cells. Three members of the NAD-dependent deacetylases, the sirtuins, are upregulated by VPA and by TSA and sirtuin activity contributes to loss of ERα expression. However, prolonged inhibition of the sirtuins by sirtinol also induces loss of ERα from cells. Mechanistically, we show that VPA invokes reversible promoter shutoff of the ERα, pS2 and cyclin D1 promoters, by inducing recruitment of methyl cytosine binding protein 2 (MeCP2) with concomitant exclusion of the maintenance methylase DNMT1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the presence of VPA, local DNA methylation, deacetylation and demethylation of activated histones and recruitment of inhibitory complexes occurs on the pS2 promoter."

It is currently unknown whether activation of astrocytic Nrf2 might help tocounteract the progressive loss of motor neurons in ALS. Because FGF-1 seemsto be a major mediator contributing to astrocyte activation in ALS and alsomediates neuroprotection in spinal cord injury, we investigated whether itinduced HO-1 in spinal cord astrocytes. In addition we explored the effect ofastrocytic Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression on motor neuron survival andthe levels of these proteins in rats expressing SOD1 G93A ALS-linked mutation.Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of the ARE/Nrf2 pathway inastrocytes could slow motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

The nuclear extract was centrifuged at 11,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant containing nuclear proteins wasremoved carefully. Nuclear extract from rat spinal cord were preparedaccording to Lahiri and Ge(56Lahiri D.K. Ge Y. Brain Res.Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Animals—Sprague-Dawley SOD1 G93A L26H rats were kindlyprovided by Dr. David S. Howland (Wyeth Research, Princeton, NJ)(57Howland D.S. Liu J. She Y. Goad B. Maragakis N.J. Kim B. Erickson J. Kulik J.

Animals were observeddaily for onset of disease symptoms, as well as progression to death. Onset ofmotor neuron disease was scored as the first observation of an abnormal gaitor evidence of hindlimb weakness (typically between 115 and 125 days).End-stage of the disease was scored as complete paralysis of both hindlimbsand the inability of the animals to right themselves after being turned on aside. Three asymptomatic (65 days), four at the age of symptoms onset and fiveend-stage SOD1 G93A animals and the same number of age-matched nontransgenic(NonTG) rats were used. Spinal cords were removed and immediately frozen inliquid nitrogen, part was used for total RNA extraction with TriReagent(Sigma) and part processed in SDS 1% plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture(Roche) for protein extraction. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples (30 μg) wereresolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulosemembrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h inTris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by anovernight incubation with primary antibody diluted in the same buffer. Afterwashing with 0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline the membrane was incubatedwith peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1 h, and thenwashed and developed using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (AmershamBiosciences). Primary antibodies indicated were used at dilutions recommendedby the manufacturers. Densitometric analysis were normalized against thesignal obtained by reprobing the membranes with β-actin orα-tubulin. Relative Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNAwas isolated using TriReagent (Sigma) and 2 μg were randomly reversetranscribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) accordingto the manufacturer's protocol. Specific primer pairs and QuantumRNA Classic18S Internal Standards primers (Ambion) were used together in the reaction toamplify the target cDNA and 489 bp from 18 S rRNA cDNA. PCR primers specificto each gene are as follows: Nrf2, 5′-TTCCTCTGCTGCCATTAGTCAGTC-3′,and 5′-GCTCTTCCATTTCCGAGTCACTG-3′ (242 bp); GSTπ,5′-GGGTCGCTCTTTAGGGCTTTATGG-3′, and5′-ATGGGACGGTTCAAATGGTCAGG-3′ (393 bp); GSTα4,5′-TGACACAGACCAGAGCCATCCTC-3′, and5′-GGAGCACTGACTTCTTCCACCATC-3′ (325 bp); GSTμ1,5′-CGACGCTCCCGACTATGACAGAAG-3′, and5′-CGCTTGCCCAGGAACTCAGAGTAG-3′ (327 bp); NAD(P)H:quinoneoxidoreductase-1, 5′-CTGGAAGGGTGGAAGAAGCGTC-3′, and5′-TCTGGTTGTCGGCTGGAATGG-3′ (196 bp); GPx1,5′-TCAGTTCGGACATCAGGAGAATGG-3′, and5′-AGGAAGGTAAAGAGCGGGTGAGC-3′ (150 bp); glutamate-cysteine ligasemodifier subunit, 5′-AATCTTGCCTCCTGCTGTGTGATG-3′, and5′-GGCTTCAATGTCAGGGATGCTTTC-3′ (153 bp); glutamate-cysteine ligasecatalytic subunit, 5′-ATGAAAGTGGCACAGGAGCGAG-3′, and5′-AAACACGCCTTCCTTCCCATTG-3′ (186 bp); HO-1 primers werepreviously described (58Scapagnini G. D'Agata V. Calabrese V. Pascale A. Colombrita C. Alkon D. Cavallaro S. Brain Res. 2002; 954: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).PCRs were carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 1 μl ofcDNA, 20 pmol of each specific primer, 18 S primers (2:8 ratio), 200μm dNTPs, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 units ofAmpliTaq Gold, and 1 × GeneAmp PCR buffer (Applied Biossytems). Thecycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72°C, 30 s; during 19 cycles for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 and GPx1;21 cycles for HO-1, GSTπ, GSTα4, GSTμ1, glutamate-cysteine ligasemodifier subunit, and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; and 23cycles for Nrf2 where amplification is in the linear range. Minus reversetranscriptase controls were included in each assay. The amplification productswere run in a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYBR GoldNucleic Acid Gel Stain (Molecular Probes). Densitometric analysis wasperformed using the NIH Image program and gene expression levels werenormalized against the 18 S levels. Immunofluorescence—Astrocyte cultures in Lab-Tek (Nunc)slides were fixed on ice with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Briefly, cultureswere permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked for 1h with 10% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit oranti-mouse secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were incubatedfor 1 h at room temperature. The slides were mounted using ProLong anti-fadekit (Molecular Probes). Primary antibodies used were anti-GFAP monoclonalantibody (1:400; Sigma) and anti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibody (1:400; Santa CruzBiotechnology). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goatanti-mouse (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit(1:400; Jackson Immunoresearch). Rats were deeply anesthetized with sodiumpentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and transcardially perfused with 0.1 mPBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Spinal cords wereremoved, post-fixed during 3–4 h in the same fixative, dehydrated, andembedded in Paraplast (Sigma). Serial 5-μm microtome sections were obtainedand mounted onto precleaned and charged SuperFrost Plus slides (Esco). Afterdissolving paraffin and rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed in amicrowave oven in 0.01 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0). Sections werepermeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and unspecific binding was blockedin 10% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBSfor 1 h at room temperature. Then, sections were incubated with primaryantibodies diluted in blocking solution during 24–48 h at 4 °C.Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were incubated for 1 h atroom temperature. Sections were mounted with ProLong anti-fade (MolecularProbes). Controls were performed omitting the primary antibody. Primaryantibodies were monoclonal anti-GFAP (1:400), polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:400),monoclonal anti-HO-1 (1:400), and two polyclonal anti-Nrf2 antibodies fromSanta Cruz Biotechnologies (C-20 and H-300) diluted 1:200. Secondaryantibodies were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (5μg/ml each; from Molecular Probes) or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit(1:400; Jackson Immunoresearch). Statistics—Each experiment was repeated at least three timesand data from rats were obtained from three to five animals. Data are reportedas mean ± S.D. Comparison of the means was performed by one-wayanalysis of variance. Pairwise texts between any two means utilized theStudent-Newman-Keuls test and differences were declared statisticallysignificant if p < 0.05. All statistic computations were performedusing the SigmaStat System (Jandel Scientific). FGF-1 Induces HO-1 Expression in Spinal Cord Astrocytes—Within 2 h after treatment of confluent astrocyte monolayers with FGF-1 (10ng/ml), HO-1 mRNA was increased by 3-fold and remained elevated for at least12 h (Fig. 1A).Increased levels of HO-1 mRNA paralleled a more sustained increase in HO-1protein (Fig. 1B),which was ∼4.5-fold (versus vehicle) 24 h after treatment. FGF-1specifically up-regulated the HO-1 isoform, whereas HO-2 protein levels wereunaffected. Increased HO-1 expression was significantly elevated in cellsincubated with a low concentration of FGF-1 (1 ng/ml) and augmented in adose-dependent manner (Fig.1C). FGF-2 also induced HO-1 at 25 ng/ml, but no responsewas observed with other trophic factors such as NGF or EGF(Fig. 1D). Todetermine whether induction of HO-1 gene expression depended on FGFRphosphorylation and MAPK family activation, HO-1 mRNA levels were measured inastrocytes pre-treated with either PD 166866, a specific inhibitor of FGFreceptor autophosphorylation(59Panek R.L.

HO-1 mRNAexpression was prevented by PD 166866 and SB203580(Fig. 1E), suggestinga pathway involving FGF receptor signaling and downstream activation of p38MAPK. In contrast, UO126 and SP600125 had no statistically significant effect.In addition, the increase in HO-1 mRNA was sensitive to both actinomycin D andcycloheximide, suggesting that messenger accumulation requires both increasedtranscription and de novo protein synthesis(Fig. 1E). Effect of FGF-1 on Nrf2 Expression and Activation—The Nrf2transcription factor has a relative short half-life and is implicated in theregulation of HO-1 gene expression(35Alam J. Cook J.L. Curr.Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2499-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We thereforeinvestigated whether cycloheximide sensitivity of FGF-1-mediated HO-1induction was because of a requirement of Nrf2 protein synthesis. FGF-1 causeda"

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), only limited information is available for the cPLA2 family. Therefore, we started searching for new cPLA2 molecular species. Considering the difficulty of enzymological detection or cDNA library screening for gene products with low levels and/or limited patterns of tissue expression, we adopted a different approach from previous cPLA2 cloning. A comprehensive homology search was carried out against murine genome and EST data bases using conserved exons within cPLA2α, β, and γ as queries. We discovered three cPLA2 genes, termed cPLA2δ (group IVD), cPLA2ϵ (group IVE), and cPLA2ζ (group IVF): the first may correspond to a murine orthologue of human cPLA2δ. We describe herein the structure, tissue distribution, catalytic activity, and intracellular localization of these newly cloned gene products. Materials—Thirteen to fifteen-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were used as RNA sources. [32P]dCTP (∼110 TBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA free) was from Roche Diagnostics. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (1.8 GBq/mmol), 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (2.1 GBq/mmol), 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (1.8 GBq/mmol), and 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine (2.0 GBq/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (2.0 GBq/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Triton X-100 and bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid free) were from Sigma. Ionomycin was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), BODIPY-brefeldin A, LysoTracker Red DND-99, and MitoTracker Red CMXRos were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAF C-16) was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Gene Identification—Candidates for novel members of the cPLA2 family were compiled from BLAST searches on murine genome and murine EST data bases using cPLA2α, β, and γ as queries. PCR primers for cDNA cloning by RT-PCR were designed based on the search results (see below). For preparation of cDNA templates from murine organs, total RNA extracted by an acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (Isogen, Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) was subjected to μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany) and to oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription by Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The organs investigated were whole brain, lung, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, intestine, thyroid, stomach, placenta (15.5-day postcoitum, d.p.c.), and E15 embryo. Fragments of cPLA2 cDNA were amplified with KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) and a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 5′ and 3′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out with SMART-RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Placenta (14.5 d.p.c.) was used for cPLA2δ RACE, heart and brain for cPLA2ϵ, and thyroid for cPLA2ζ. Amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into cloning vectors, pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) or pCR Blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen), and their nucleic acid sequences were determined with a PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Northern Analyses—Murine multiple tissue Northern blots, MTN Blots Mouse (Clontech), MTN Blots Mouse II (Clontech), and Mouse Adult Tissue Blot (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) were hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probe (Rediprime II DNA labeling system, Amersham) for the entire open reading frames (ORFs) of each cPLA2 following the manufacturer's instructions. Radioactive signals were visualized with a BAS-2000 imaging analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Construction of Expression Vectors—Mammalian expression vectors were constructed using pcDNA4/HisMax A (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) plasmid vectors. The PCR-amplified ORF of each cPLA2 was ligated into expression vectors with the minimal flanking regions to fit in-frame with the N-terminal-tagged design with cloning sites on the opposite ends (supplementary data Table II). An expression vector for mRFP (a red fluorescent protein, cDNA provided by R. Y. Tsien (38Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained under 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Roche). A CHO-K1 cell line, W11A, which stably expresses guinea pig platelet-activating factor receptor (39Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in Nutrient Mixture Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 0.3 mg/ml geneticin (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Transient Expression and PLA2 Assay—HEK293 cells were seeded onto 10-cm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. After 24 h, they were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium 3 h after transfection. The cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA 48 h after transfection, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Thawed cells were suspended in the homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture), and then homogenized with a sonicator (OHTAKE WORKS, Yamaguchi, Japan). Centrifugations at 10,000 × g for 10 min and 100,000 × g for 1 h were carried out for fractionation. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford's method (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a calibration standard. PLA2 activity was measured using mixed micelles each containing phospholipid and Triton X-100 in a molar ratio of 1:2 as a substrate; the final concentration of substrate was 2 μm (54,000–63,000 dpm/reaction). The assay buffer contained 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml BSA, 4.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. CaCl2 was replaced with EGTA to examine the Ca2+ requirement for the enzyme activity. Lysophospholipase activity was measured using monomeric lyso-PC (2 μm, 63,000 dpm/reaction) with a concentration of BSA in assay buffer of 0.5 mg/ml. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme sources, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with Dole's reagent, and silica gel powder was used to recover free fatty acid in an n-heptane layer (40Natori Y. Karasawa K. Arai H. Tamori-Natori Y. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Takayama K. Kudo I. Kim D.K. Nagata K. Nozawa Y. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation counter LS6500 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Western Blots—SDS-PAGE separated samples were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and probed with mouse monoclonal IgG anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) that recognize the Xpress™ epitope (DLYD-DDDK), or BD Living Colors™ full-length rabbit polyclonal antibody (Clontech) to detect N-terminal-tagged proteins. Immunoreactive signals were visualized with anti-mouse or rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy—CHO-K1 cells (W11A cells) at a density of 7 × 105 cells/dish were seeded onto 6-cm dishes 1 day before transfection. Two μg each of pEGFP-murine cPLA2α, pEGFP-murine cPLA2δ, pEGFP-murine cPLA2ϵ, or pEGFP-C1 were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium at 4 h. After incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) and seeded onto 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) with Nutrient Mixture Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Then, the cells were incubated for 24 h, and serum-starved with medium containing 0.1% BSA for an additional 24 h. The cells were stained with 1 μm BODIPY-brefeldin A or 50 nm LysoTracker Red in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. For experiments with murine cPLA2ζ, CHO-K1 cells (W11A cells) were seeded onto 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (IWAKI) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/dish 1 day before transfection. One μg of pEGFP-murine cPLA2ζ and 1 μg of pmRFP-human cPLA2α were co-transfected. Transfection medium was replaced with a medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 4 h. Then, cells were incubated for 18 h, and serum-starved with medium containing 0.1% BSA for an additional 6 h. Fluorescence images of green fluorescent protein (GFP), BODIPY-brefeldin A, LysoTracker Red, and mRFP were obtained using an LSM510 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a ×63 water-immersion objective (NA = 1.2) or a ×100 oil-immersion objective (NA = 1.3). GFP fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 488 nm with an argon laser, and by emission with a 505–550-nm band pass filter, or with a 505–530-nm band pass filter when measuring together with BODIPY-brefeldin A to avoid interference. BODIPY-brefeldin A, LysoTracker Red, and mRFP, the excitation was set at 543 nm with a He/Ne laser, and emissions were taken with a 560-nm long path filter for LysoTracker Red, or a 580-nm long path filter for BODIPY-brefeldin A and mRFP. Gene Identification and cDNA Cloning of Novel Murine cPLA2s—Human cPLA2α, β, and γ share a lipase domain structure with considerable homology. Overall identities at the amino acid levels are between 30 and 34%. When aligned according to the RNA-splicing sites, higher conservations were noticed for three exons within the lipase domain (Fig. 1A, exons LA, LB, and LC). Two of these exons include residues of the catalytic dyad, the serine and aspartic acid residues in the GXSGS (exon “LA”) and DXG (exon “LC”) motifs, respectively. The functional significance of the exon “LB” in between has not been clarified yet. An extensive BLAST search against the draft human genome sequence using these exon sequences as queries predicted three novel cPLA2 gene loci. Equivalent loci were identified in the murine genome. Furthermore, the fourth conserved exons containing putative C2 domain were detected for each locus (exon C2, in Fig. 1A). Several EST clones, which are supposed to contain truncated transcripts of these novel genes, were also found using the BLAST search. Based on these DNA sequences, we designed PCR primers; one in the coding region and the other in the putative 3′-untranslated region. We thus obtained truncated cDNA fragments of these novel cPLA2s by RT-PCR from murine tissues (δ from placenta (15.5 d.p.c.), ϵ from whole brain and heart, and ζ from spleen and thyroid). RACE was carried out next to design new sets of PCR primers on 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (supplementary data Table I). DNA fragments covering putative ORF of three novel cPLA2s were amplified and cloned, and the PCR primers are shown in supplementary data Table II. They were named cPLA2δ (GenBank™ accession number AB195276), cPLA2ϵ (GenBank accession number AB195277), and cPLA2ζ (GenBank accession number AB195278). The ORF for each clone was assigned so that the coding region should be the longest. The sizes of cloned ORF for murine cPLA2δ, ϵ, and ζ were 2,748, 2,625, and 2,565-bp long corresponding to 825 (molecular mass 93 kDa), 875 (100 kDa), and 855 (96 kDa) amino acid residues, respectively. Recently, human cPLA2δ was discovered in the psoriatic skin cDNA library (35Chiba H. Michibata H. Wakimoto K. Seishima M. Kawasaki S. Okubo K. Mitsui H. Torii H. Imai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12890-12897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We figured it to be the orthologue of one of the novel murine cPLA2s based on its chromosomal localization and homology of the primary structure. Human cPLA2δ has the highest homology to murine cPLA2δ: 71% identical at the amino acid level as opposed to 29–49% for other murine cPLA2s. Chromosome localizations of these newly identified cPLA2s, i.e. δ, ϵ, and ζ were determined by BLAST search on genome data bases. They were found to form a gene cluster with cPLA2β in murine chromosome 2E5 spanning 0.3 Mb (Fig. 1B), and they correspond to human orthologues in chromosome 15q14. Alignment of murine cPLA2δ, ϵ, and ζ revealed that these gene cluster members have considerable homology throughout the molecule, and they seem to have C2 plus lipase domain structures (Fig. 2A). Percent identities of amino acid sequences among cPLA2β, δ, ϵ, and ζ are calculated to be 33–43%, and 41–50% for the C2 and lipase domains, respectively (Fig. 2B). Lower values were obtained for comparisons with cPLA2α or γ: 25–28% for C2 domain of cPLA2α, and 30–37% for lipase domains of cPLA2α and γ. A dendrogram was drawn by pairwise comparisons of amino acid sequences of murine cPLA2, iPLA2, and PAF-AH (Fig. 2C). Six cPLA2s form a branch separately from iPLA2 and PAF-AH, and the gene cluster members, i.e. cPLA2β, δ, ϵ, and ζ, come closer together than the remaining cPLA2α and γ. Tissue Distribution of cPLA2δ, ϵ, and ζ mRNAs—Expression profiles of cPLA2s were examined at mRNA levels (Fig. 3). The cPLA2δ transcript was not clearly detected in MTN blot filters (Clontech, mouse MTN blot and MTN blot II), but was detected in placenta (17.5 d.p.c.) using the Mouse Adult Tissue Blot (Seegene) at about 4.5 kb in size. A transcript of the cPLA2ϵ gene (about 5.0 kb in size) was seen predominantly in heart, skeletal muscle, testis, and thyroid, and at low expression levels in brain and stomach. Signals for cPLA2ζ were obtained as 2 bands (about 4.0 and 8.0 kb in size). The mRNA was detected strongly in thyroid, moderately in stomach, and very weakly in large intestine and prostate. The combined lengths of RT-PCR and RACE products were 3.3, 4.4, and 3.3 kb (excluding the poly(A) tract) for cPLA2δ, ϵ and ζ, respectively. We assume that the combined DNA sequence of cPLA2ζ corresponds to the shorter Northern signals. PLA2 Activity of Transiently Expressed Murine cPLA2s— Mammalian transient-expression experiments were carried out with HEK293 cells and pcDNA4/HisMax expression vectors. Harvested cells were homogenized in the presence of an excess amount of EGTA by sonication, and fractionated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and at 100,000 × g for 1 h (see “Experimental Procedures”). The enzyme activities were measured with 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PA-PC) as a substrate. We performed a series of assays for multiple transfection batches (n = 5–9) to observe consistently elevated PLA2 activities for both 10,000 × g and 100,000 × g supernatant fractions of all cPLA2 transfectants, as shown in Table I. To be noted here, preparations for cPLA2ϵ were made with homogenizing buffer containing 0.075% (w/v) Triton X-100. When cPLA2ϵ-expressing cells were processed with the homogenizing buffer without Triton X-100, the enzyme activity was undetectable in the supernatant fractions over mock-transfected cells. We found that addition of Triton X-100 up to 0.1% (w/v) in homogenizing buffer did not inhibit the catalytic activity and improved recovery of PLA2 activity in the supernatants (data not shown). These effects appeared specific for cPLA2ϵ and were not observed for cPLA2α, δ, ζ, or for the intrinsic PLA2 activity of HEK293 cells (data not shown).Table IPLA2 activity of transiently expressed murine cPLA2sMockMock (T)aT, 0.075% (w/v) Triton X-100 included in homogenizing buffer.cPLA2αcPLA2δcPLA2ϵ (T)aT, 0.075% (w/v) Triton X-100 included in homogenizing buffer.cPLA2ζ10,000 × g sup2.5 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.2190 ± 356.1 ± 1.27.2 ± 1.926 ± 11100,000 × g sup1.5 ± 0.30.6 ± 0.3291 ± 615.1 ± 1.07.7 ± 1.555 ± 22n955555a T, 0.075% (w/v) Triton X-100 included in homogenizing buffer. Open table in a new tab Expression of each cPLA2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting detected with anti-Xpress antibody against the N-terminal tag (Fig. 4). The apparent molecular sizes of the expressed proteins were around 100 kDa (Fig. 4A), which are comparable with the estimated sizes from their deduced primary structures with tag sequences (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates and centrifugal fractions were prepared in the presence of an excess amount of EGTA in homogenizing buffer (Fig. 4B). The majority of expressed proteins were detected in 10,000 × g and 100,000 × g supernatants for cPLA2α, δ, and ϵ. A portion of expressed signals were detected in the 100,000 × g precipitate for cPLA2ϵ, even in the presence of 0.075% (w/v) Triton X-100. There was no significant difference in the fractionation patterns for cPLA2ϵ either with or without 0.075% (w/v) Triton X-100 in homogenizing buffer (data not shown"
https://openalex.org/W2047785960,"Fas ligand (FasL) mediates both apoptotic and inflammatory responses in the immune system. FasL function critically depends on the different forms of FasL; soluble Fas ligand lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is a poor mediator of apoptosis, whereas full-length, membrane-associated FasL (mFasL) is pro-apoptotic. mFasL can be released from T lymphocytes, via the secretion of mFasL-bearing exosomes. mFasL in exosomes retains its activity in triggering Fas-dependent apoptosis, providing an alternative mechanism of cell death that does not necessarily imply cell-to-cell contact. Diacylglycerol kinase α (DGKα), a diacylglycerol (DAG)-consuming enzyme, is involved in the attenuation of DAG-derived responses initiated at the plasma membrane that lead to T lymphocyte activation. Here we studied the role of DGKα on activation-induced cell death on a T cell line and primary T lymphoblasts. The inhibition of DGKα increases the secretion of lethal exosomes bearing mFas ligand and subsequent apoptosis. On the contrary, the overactivation of the DGKα pathway inhibits exosome secretion and subsequent apoptosis. DGKα was found associated with the trans-Golgi network and late endosomal compartments. Our results support the hypothesis that the DGKα effect on apoptosis occurs via the regulation of the release of lethal exosomes by the exocytic pathway, and point out that the spatial orchestration of the different pools of DAG (plasma membrane and Golgi membranes) by DGKα is crucial for the control of cell activation and also for the regulation of the secretion of lethal exosomes, which in turn controls cell death.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). DAG may induce Ras activation and subsequent ERK cascade stimulation (2.Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium and DAG/Ras pathways control T cell activation, which involves up-regulation of hundreds of genes (3.Feske S. Giltnane J. Dolmetsch R. Staudt L.M. Rao A. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 316-324Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and activation-induced cell death (AICD), which is mediated by up-regulation of proapoptotic genes such as Fas ligand (FasL) (4.Strasser A. Nature. 1995; 373: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). AICD is one of the main mechanisms involved in maintaining the peripheral immune tolerance and T lymphocyte homeostasis. Once a T cell clone has been activated and expanded in response to an antigen, it can be eliminated through AICD to prevent autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative disorders (5.Lenardo M.J. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The fact that the same signaling pathways, calcium and DAG/Ras, contribute to both activation and apoptosis raises the question how these responses are controlled by TCR. This issue may be addressed considering that a strict balance between positive and negative regulators acting on each pathway must determine both the magnitude and the quality of the final response. Supporting this hypothesis, the existence of TCR mutants, which are apoptosis-defective but exhibit normal activation, revealed that a subtle control exerted on the Ras/ERK pathway may constitute the molecular basis to explain how these responses are regulated by TCR (6.Teixeiro E. Fuentes P. Galocha B. Alarcon B. Bragado R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3993-4002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7.Werlen G. Hausmann B. Palmer E. Nature. 2000; 406: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The evidence showing that the Ras/ERK pathway is required for activation signals leading to positive selection of thymocytes but is irrelevant for AICD of thymocytes (8.Alberola-Ila J. Hogquist K.A. Swan K.A. Bevan M.J. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) supports the view that these antithetical responses to TCR stimulation are distinguishable. Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) constitute one of the negative regulators controlling the DAG/Ras/ERK pathway (9.Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10.Zhong X.P. Hainey E.A. Olenchock B.A. Jordan M.S. Maltzman J.S. Nichols K.E. Shen H. Koretzky G.A. Nat.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, the clearance of DAG by DGKs is thought to be crucial to down-regulate abnormally prolonged, receptor-triggered DAG/Ras signaling and subsequent T lymphocyte activation (9.Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10.Zhong X.P. Hainey E.A. Olenchock B.A. Jordan M.S. Maltzman J.S. Nichols K.E. Shen H. Koretzky G.A. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 882-890Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a type I DGK, DGKα, which is highly expressed in T lymphocytes, transiently translocates to the plasma membrane upon TCR triggering (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At this location DGKα acts as a negative modulator of the DAG levels generated during T cell activation (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutively active forms of DGKα located at the plasma membrane attenuate T lymphocyte activation (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of DGKα induces prolonged activation signals (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) via sustained signaling through RasGRP (Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor) (13.Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of DAG accumulation in the plasma membrane appears critical for the correct propagation of DAG/Ras-derived signals leading to activation (10.Zhong X.P. Hainey E.A. Olenchock B.A. Jordan M.S. Maltzman J.S. Nichols K.E. Shen H. Koretzky G.A. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 882-890Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and this occurs through the precise, spatial, and temporal control by DGKα activity (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These facts, together with the evidence showing that the DAG/Ras/ERK pathway may act as a divergence point in the signals leading to activation and AICD, prompted us to hypothesize such a subtle control by DGKα may act also on the DAG-derived signals leading to cell death. To investigate this, we analyzed the role of DGKα on AICD of T lymphocytes. Our results provide insights on a new role of DGKα on the regulation of AICD.

Rabbit polyclonal against Giantin (cis- and medial-Golgi marker, PRB-114C) was from Covance. All horseradish peroxidase-coupled second step Abs were from Dako. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, carbachol, phytohemagglutinin (PHA-M), actinomycin D, 7-amino-actinomycin D, and anti-β-actin (clone AC-15) were obtained from Sigma.

Z-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was from Bachem AG. Expression Vectors and Transfection Assays—The plasmids pEF-GFP, pEF-GFP-DGKα, pEF-GFP-(Δ1–192)-DGKα, and pEF-Myr-GFP-DGKα have been described previously (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Human FasL cDNA was subcloned from pBXhFL-1 plasmid into pEF4/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen). For transfection experiments, cells were transiently transfected with 20–30 μg of the plasmids as described previously (15.Jambrina E. Alonso R. Alcalde M. Rodríguez M.C. Serrano A. Martínez- A.C. García-Sancho J. Izquierdo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14134-14145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Assessment of Apoptosis—Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane was evaluated by staining the cells with annexin V-PE, and late apoptosis was measured by cell permeability to 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD). GFP-DGKα+ and GFP-DGKα- cells were gated by green fluorescence, and annexin V-PE binding and 7-AAD permeability in both populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays—J-HM1-2.2 cells were cotransfected with an inducible vector containing the luciferase reporter gene, a Renilla luciferase vector pRL-TK (Promega), and either (i) pEF-Bos (pEF) control vector or (ii) pEF-GFP-DGKα. As inducible reporter genes, we used pLuc-486FasL (18.Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and CD69 promoter-based reporter pAIM1.4-Luc (19.Lopez-Cabrera M. Munoz E. Blazquez M.V. Ursa M.A. Santis A.G. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21545-21551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated as described, and the dual luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Intracellular Fas Ligand Detection—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, preincubated in 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-human Fas ligand (NOK-1) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were washed three times with the same buffer, incubated for 1 h with goat Fab2 anti-mouse Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.), and analyzed by flow cytometry. Isolation of Microvesicles and Functional Assays—The isolation and purification of exosomes/microvesicles from culture supernatants of T cells have been described previously (20.Blanchard N. Lankar D. Faure F. Regnault A. Dumont C. Raposo G. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3235-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21.Martinez-Lorenzo M.J. Anel A. Gamen S. Monlen I.

By using these standard protocols, culture supernatants of 20 × 106 cells were centrifuged at low speed in sequential steps and then clarified to eliminate cells and cell debris/apoptotic bodies. Then the microvesicles were spun down by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 12 h), as described previously (21.Martinez-Lorenzo M.J. Anel A. Gamen S. Monlen I. Lasierra P. Larrad L. Pineiro A. Alava M.A. Naval J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1274-1281PubMed Google Scholar), and resuspended in 50 μl of RIPA lysis buffer. We usually loaded 25 μl of this lysate per lane for WB analysis (see below). We commonly obtained between 50 and 150 μg of protein in the 100,000 × g pellet from 20 × 106 CCh-stimulated cells. For functional assays, target Jurkat JE6.1 cells were challenged with the microvesicle fraction from the culture supernatants, and after incubation, the extent of apoptosis was determined by annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining. To analyze the involvement of FasL in the toxicity of these supernatants, the bioassays were performed in the presence (500 ng/ml) or the absence of anti-human FasL mAb (NOK-1) or anti-human Fas mAb (DX2). Western Blot Analysis—Cells and microvesicles were lysed for 10 min in RIPA supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cellular and microvesicle proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to Hybond™ ECL™ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For CD63 detection, proteins were separated under non-reducing conditions as described previously (23.Wang R. Dworak L.J. Lacy M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 249: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After the incubation with the appropriate primary antibody, the blots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies by using enhanced chemi-luminescence (ECL) reagents and by following standard protocols. Cell Fractionation and Measurement of DGK Activity—J-HM1-2.2 cells were disrupted in 2 ml of lysis buffer (24.Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and the lysate was fractionated on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (24.Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed for the presence of CD63 and FasL, DGKα, Golgi 58k, Lamp-1, and PKD1 proteins by WB. Density was calibrated by using density marker beads (Amersham Biosciences). DGK assays were performed in some fractions, in the presence of DOG (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol) (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), by using DOG-PA as standard. Isolation of T Cell Subpopulations—T lymphoblasts cultured for 6 days with IL-2 were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with anti-human CD4 or anti-human CD8 mAbs (Pharmingen). After being washed twice with culture medium, cells were incubated with rat anti-mouse IgG1 magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were processed in an auto-MACS machine (Miltenyi Biotec) to isolate CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations and were cultured in the presence of IL-2 (20 ng/ml). Immunofluorescence Analysis—J-HM1-2.2 cells were stained as described previously (15.Jambrina E. Alonso R. Alcalde M. Rodríguez M.C. Serrano A. Martínez- A.C. García-Sancho J. Izquierdo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14134-14145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with primary Abs (anti-CD63, anti-TGN46, and anti-Giantin) and appropriate secondary Cy5-conjugated Abs. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 scan head mounted on a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 2000U microscope and using 60× NA 1.4 Plan Apo objective. Single cells were observed, and 0.4-μm serial optical sections were collected (iris diameter 1.2 mm). No labeling was observed when using the secondary Abs alone. Digital images and colocalization analysis were performed with LaserSharp2000 software (Bio-Rad). Inhibition of DGK Increases FasL-dependent, Activation-induced Cell Death—J-HM1-2.2 Jurkat cells expressing HM1R and TCR have been used to study the signals during T lymphocyte activation (16.Abraham R.T. Weiss A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and AICD (15.Jambrina E. Alonso R. Alcalde M. Rodríguez M.C. Serrano A. Martínez- A.C. García-Sancho J. Izquierdo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14134-14145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25.Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, HM1R stimulation with the agonist CCh induces early up-regulation of FasL expression (25.Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking mAbs against Fas or FasL have been used to analyze the contribution of the Fas/FasL system to AICD (25.Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ruiz-Ruiz C. Robledo G. Font J. Izquierdo M. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4737-4746PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the inhibition of the Fas/FasL interaction by blocking anti-Fas (DX2) or anti-FasL (NOK-1) mAbs inhibited CCh-induced apoptosis. Therefore, binding of FasL to its receptor was necessary for CCh to induce Fas/FasL-dependent apoptosis. Stimulation with CCh induces phospholipase Cβ-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, which leads to DAG elevation and subsequent phosphatidic acid (PA) production (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16.Abraham R.T. Weiss A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). DAG phosphorylation to PA is mediated by DGK activity, and J-HM1-2.2 cells express the type I DGK, DGKα (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, pretreatment with the type I DGK-specific inhibitor R59949 (27.Jiang Y. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Walsh J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) inhibits CCh-induced PA production (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that out of the three type I DGK isozymes (α, β, and γ) inhibited by R59949, DGKα is the only one present in T lymphocytes and Jurkat cells (11.Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, this inhibitor constitutes a valuable tool to analyze the contribution of DGKα to AICD. Pretreatment with the DGK inhibitor increased CCh-induced apoptosis, whereas anti-Fas (Fig. 1B) or actinomycin D (not shown), which evoke death pathways that do not involve DAG metabolism (28.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar), were refractory to DGKα inhibition. In addition, the blockade of Fas/FasL interaction by blocking Abs DX2 (Fig. 1B) and NOK-1 (not shown) reverted the positive effect of the DGK inhibitor on cell death. The DGK inhibitor also enhanced PHA-induced AICD (data not shown), a process that has been shown to depend on Fas/FasL interaction (21.Martinez-Lorenzo M.J. Anel A. Gamen S. Monlen I. Lasierra P. Larrad L. Pineiro A. Alava M.A. Naval J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1274-1281PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of DGKα enhances FasL-dependent AICD. Expression of DGKα Inhibits AICD—HM1R stimulation induces transient translocation of DGKα from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. At this location, DGKα attenuates DAG-derived activation responses (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If the effect of the R59949 inhibitor increasing AICD were exerted via inhibition of DGKα, then the overexpression of DGKα should decrease CCh-induced AICD. To analyze the consequences of DGKα expression, we made use of a GFP-tagged DGKα construction (GFP-DGKα) (Fig. 2, A–C) whose translocation to the plasma membrane is similar to that corresponding to the endogenous enzyme (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CCh induction of early apoptosis (% of annexin V+ cells) and late apoptosis (% of 7-AAD-permeable cells) was analyzed in GFP-DGKα+ and GFP-DGKα- cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Fig. 2, D and E, compares the apoptosis induced by CCh after 15 and 20 h (early and late apoptosis, respectively), in the two populations. As shown in Fig. 2D, the expression of DGKα decreases early AICD (from 46 ± 2% to 27 ± 3% of annexin V+ cells, after 15 h of CCh treatment). When late AICD was measured after 20 h, the inhibition of AICD achieved by DGKα expression was higher (Fig. 2E). The degree of inhibition was dependent on the expression level of DGKα as shown in Fig. 2F; those cells expressing higher levels of DGKα underwent less apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of DGKα was specific for CCh-induced AICD, because no effect of DGKα on apoptosis induced by actinomycin D (data not shown) or direct Fas triggering (Fig. 2D) was observed. DGKα Does Not Affect the Transcriptional Regulation of FasL and the Intracellular Levels of FasL—CCh stimulation in JHM1-2.2 cells triggers Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (29.Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Williams D.H. Marshall C.J. Weiss A. Cantrell D.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2462-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which is involved in the transcriptional control of the FasL gene (30.Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that DGKα attenuates the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14.Jones D.R. Sanjuan M.A. Stone J.C. Merida I. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations may suggest that the effect of DGKα on CCh-induced apoptosis could be due to the inhibition of FasL gene expression. To test this, we analyzed the effect of DGKα expression on FasL promoter regulation in reporter gene assays. Cells were cotransfected with a reporter for the FasL gene and either an expression vector for DGKα (pEF-GFP-DGKα) or a control vector (pEF). As shown in Fig. 3, the reporter driven by the FasL promoter was activated (4–5-fold induction) by CCh, and the overexpression of DGKα did not inhibit FasL reporter induction (Fig. 3, A and B). However, DGKα partially inhibited the activation of the CD69 reporter (Fig. 3C), an activation marker that is regulated by the effect of DGKα on the DAG/Ras pathway (12.Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment with the DGK inhibitor R59949 did not increase the FasL luciferase reporter activity of CCh-stimulated cells (Fig. 3D). These results support that the inhibition by DGKα of FasL-dependent apoptosis was not exerted on the transcriptional regulation of FasL. Consequently, post-transcriptional regulation of FasL may underlie the DGKα effect on AICD. It is remarkable that plasma membrane mFasL is quickly processed by cell matrix metalloproteinases to produce a C-terminal inactive soluble FasL (24 kDa) and an N-terminal membrane form (16 kDa) (31.Kayagaki N. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S. Yoshino K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), leading to down-regulation of its proapoptotic activity. By using NOK-1, a mAb that recognizes the extracellular, C-terminal epitope on FasL, we analyzed by flow cytometry the presence of the unprocessed form of FasL (mFasL) at the cell surface upon stimulation. We were unable to detect any plasma membrane, full-length mFasL, even in the presence of a metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001, which inhibited FasL processing as shown in supplemental Fig. 3, A and B; therefore, we analyzed intracellular FasL. It has been shown that Jurkat cells express pre-formed intracellular FasL protein, and stimulation through TCR and HM1R up-regulates FasL mRNA (maximal induction between 3 and 5 h of stimulation) and protein (21.Martinez-Lorenzo M.J. Anel A. Gamen S. Monlen I. Lasierra P. Larrad L. Pineiro A. Alava M.A. Naval J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1274-1281PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether DGKα might regulate translational events involved in intracellular FasL expression, we measured the levels of FasL protein after CCh stimulation for 6 and 8 h in permeabilized GFP-DGKα+ and GFP-DGKα- cells. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3C, both cell populations expressed comparable levels of pre-formed FasL. CCh induces up-regulation of FasL protein; no significant differences on the levels of FasL were found between DGKα+ and DGKα- cells, independently of the expression levels of the DGKα (data not shown). In addition, the DGK inhibitor R59949 neither affected the levels of pre-formed FasL nor the induction of intracellular FasL protein of CCh as detected by WB analysis (supplemental Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2121238870,"Mechanistic studies of ATP-dependent proteolysis demonstrate that substrate unfolding is a prerequisite for processive peptide bond hydrolysis. We show that mitochondrial Lon also degrades folded proteins and initiates substrate cleavage non-processively. Two mitochondrial substrates with known or homology-derived three-dimensional structures were used: the mitochondrial processing peptidase α-subunit (MPPα) and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Peptides generated during a time course of Lon-mediated proteolysis were identified and mapped within the primary, secondary, and tertiary structure of the substrate. Initiating cleavages occurred preferentially between hydrophobic amino acids located within highly charged environments at the surface of the folded protein. Subsequent cleavages proceeded sequentially along the primary polypeptide sequence. We propose that Lon recognizes specific surface determinants or folds, initiates proteolysis at solvent-accessible sites, and generates unfolded polypeptides that are then processively degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2081588531,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphate signal transduction PHO pathway is involved in regulating several phosphate-responsive genes such as PHO5, which encodes repressible acid phosphatase. In this pathway, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (Pho81p) regulates the kinase activity of the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex Pho80p-Pho85p, which phosphorylates the transcription factor Pho4p in response to intracellular phosphate levels. However, how cells sense phosphate availability and transduce the phosphate signal to Pho81p remains unknown. To identify additional components of the PHO pathway, we have screened a collection of yeast deletion strains. We found that disruptants of PLC1, ARG82, and KCS1, which are involved in the synthesis of inositol polyphosphate, and ADK1, which encodes adenylate kinase, constitutively express PHO5. Each of these factors functions upstream of Pho81p and negatively regulates the PHO pathway independently of intracellular orthophosphate levels. Overexpression of KCS1, but not of the other genes, suppressed PHO5 expression in the wild-type strain under low phosphate conditions. These results raise the possibility that diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate and/or bisdiphosphoinositol triphosphate may be essential for regulation of the PHO pathway. Furthermore, the Δplc1, Δarg82, and Δkcs1 deletion strains, but not the Δipk1 deletion strain, had significantly reduced intracellular polyphosphate levels, suggesting that enzymes involved in inositol pyrophosphate synthesis are also required for polyphosphate accumulation.

Inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient for all organisms, being required for many metabolic processes such as the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and phospholipids, energy metabolism, and signal transduction. Organisms therefore need efficient regulatory mechanisms for the acquisition, storage, and utilization of phosphate (1Torriani-Gorini A. Silver S. Yagil E. Phosphate in Microorganisms: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphate signal transduction PHO pathway regulates the expression of a set of phosphate-responsive genes, including PHO5, which encodes repressible acid phosphatase (rAPase), 1The abbreviations used are: rAPase, repressible acid phosphatase; IP4, inositol tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol pentakisphosphate; PP-IP4, diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate; (PP)2-IP3, bisdiphosphoinositol triphosphate; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PP-IP5, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate; (PP)2-IP4 bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate. in response to changes in intracellular phosphate levels (2Lenburg M.E.

The PHO pathway mediates this response by controlling the activity and localization of the transcription factor Pho4p through phosphorylation by the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex Pho80p-Pho85p. Under conditions of high phosphate, the Pho80p-Pho85p complex phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription factor Pho4p by triggering the association of phosphorylated Pho4p with the nuclear export receptor Msn5p (6Kaffman A.

Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This association leads to the rapid export of Pho4p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and thus to repression of PHO5 expression. By contrast, when yeast cells are starved of phosphate, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81p inactivates Pho80p-Pho85p (8Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K.

Pho81p forms a stable complex with Pho80p-Pho85p under both high and low phosphate conditions, but inhibits the kinase activity of Pho85p only under low phosphate conditions, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of Pho81p is regulated post-translationally (8Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, Pho81p has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated by Pho80p-Pho85p, and phosphorylation of Pho81p itself seems to be required for its stable interaction with the Pho80p-Pho85p complex (11Waters N.C.

A recent study has shown that PHO5 expression is regulated by intracellular phosphate levels, especially intracellular orthophosphate levels, but not by extracellular phosphate levels (5Auesukaree C.

Moreover, both inositol polyphosphates and inositol pyrophosphates have been reported to play a role in controlling PHO5 expression, but in different ways. Inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) are required for modulating the ability of the SWI/SNF and INO80 chromatin-remodeling complexes to induce PHO5 expression under low phosphate conditions (13Steger D.J. Haswell E.S. Miller A.L. Wente S.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), whereas inositol pyrophosphates are necessary to maintain the repression of PHO5 expression under high phosphate conditions (14El Alami M. Messenguy F. Scherens B. Dubois E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the mechanism underlying phosphate sensing and signal transduction upstream of the Pho81p-Pho80p-Pho85p complex, we analyzed the Research Genetics collection of yeast deletion mutants. Here, we report that the additional factors Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p are involved in regulating the PHO pathway upstream of Pho81p. We provide evidence that Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p negatively regulate the PHO pathway independently of the intracellular orthophosphate levels, raising the possibility that diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP-IP4) and/or bisdiphosphoinositol triphosphate ((PP)2-IP3) is important for phosphate regulation. In addition, we show that Plc1p, Arg82p, and Kcs1p are also required for the accumulation of polyphosphate.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids—Plasmids pHB92 (expressing PLC1), pHB93 (ARG82), pHB94 (KCS1), and pHB95 (IPK1) were constructed in the same way using a 5′-HindIII PCR primer and a 3′-HindIII PCR primer with gene-specific sequences that included the entire open reading frame. PCR products were digested with HindIII and inserted into the HindIII gap of pGAD424 (Clontech), which contains the ADH1 promoter. To construct pHB96 (ADK1), the ADK1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides as primers with a HindIII restriction site. PCR products and pGAD424 were digested with HindIII, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment, and ligated together. Screening for Phosphate Signaling-defective Deletion Mutants—Cells were transferred from thawed 96-well microtiter plate stocks to YPD medium plates supplemented with 200 mg/liter Geneticin in 96 place grids using a TK-CP96 96-pin replicator (Tokken Inc.). After incubation at 30 °C for 2 days, strains were stamped onto high and low phosphate medium plates and grown at 30 °C for an additional 2 days. The APase activity of the yeast strains was determined by staining colonies using α-naphthyl phosphate as a phosphatase substrate as described previously (19Toh-e A. Ueda Y. Kakimoto S.I. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acid Phosphatase Assay in Cell Suspension—Cells were precultured to log phase in synthetic high phosphate medium at 30 °C. Log-phase cultures were inoculated into a specified medium to give an A600 of 0.1 and cultivated with shaking at 30 °C until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. The APase activity was measured by determining the amount of p-nitrophenyl phosphate cleaved during a 10-min incubation at 35 °C. Cleavage was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 420 nm, and the APase activity was calculated as described previously (19Toh-e A. Ueda Y. Kakimoto S.I. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Purification and Northern Blot Analysis—Extraction of total RNA and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (17Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Cells were precultivated in synthetic high phosphate medium to log phase at 30 °C. Log-phase cultures were inoculated into a specified medium to give an A600 of 0.1 and shaken at 30 °C until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. Total RNA was extracted, and 15 μg of RNA was loaded per lane. DNA fragments containing the PHO5 open reading frame (+1 to +1404) synthesized by PCR and the 1.0-kb HindIII-XhoI fragment carrying ACT1 prepared from pYA301 (22Gallwitz D. Sures I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2546-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) were labeled using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Version 2, Takara) with [α-32P]dCTP. Prehybridization, hybridization, and detection were carried out by standard methods. 31P NMR Spectroscopy—Yeast strains grown to log phase in synthetic high phosphate medium were inoculated into 100 ml of a specified medium to give an A600 of 0.1 and then cultivated at 30 °C until an A600 of 1.0 was reached. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and excess medium was removed to obtain a cell suspension volume of 0.5 ml. The intracellular phosphate concentration in yeast cells was measured by 31P NMR spectroscopy as described previously (5Auesukaree C. Homma T. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17289-17294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 31P NMR spectra were obtained at 202.496 MHz using a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. The spectral width was 10 kHz. All spectra were generated from a collection of 512 scans, each with a 0.8-s acquisition time and 1-s delay. Methylene diphosphonate was used as an internal reference with no apparent distortion of yeast metabolism. The intracellular phosphate concentration was estimated on the basis of the integrated area of the resonance relative to methylene diphosphate. A haploid cell volume of 70 μm3 (23Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) and a cell density of 1.85 × 107 cells/ml at an A600 of 1 were assumed. Polyphosphate concentration is given in terms of phosphate residues. Genome-wide Screening for Deletion Mutants Defective in Phosphate Signaling—To identify additional factors involved in the PHO pathway, we systematically screened a collection of 4828 haploid yeast deletion mutants of nonessential genes for mutants that showed defects in phosphate signal transduction. The yeast deletion strains were plated onto high and low phosphate media and scored by the APase assay. We expected to observe two different mutant phenotypes for this signaling pathway. For mutants of positive regulators of the PHO pathway, the expression of phosphate-responsive genes, including PHO5, would be repressed, irrespective of the phosphate concentration, resulting in a negative APase phenotype. By contrast, the expression of PHO5 in mutants of negative regulators would be induced constitutively; thus, these mutants should show a constitutive APase phenotype. From the three screens, we identified 12 mutants exhibiting the constitutive APase phenotype and 10 mutants exhibiting the negative APase phenotype (Fig. 1B and Table II). Of the mutants identified, seven were disruptants of genes encoding known components of the PHO pathway, viz. PHO2, PHO4, PHO5, PHO80, PHO81, PHO84, and PHO85, and 11 were disruptants of genes involved in general transcription or translation. Of the remaining four mutants, three were disruptants of genes involved in the synthesis of soluble inositol polyphosphate, viz. PLC1 encoding phospholipase C, ARG82 encoding inositol-polyphosphate kinase, and KCS1 encoding inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) kinase. The fourth mutant was a disruptant of ADK1, which encodes adenylate kinase.Table IIGenes whose deletion affects APase activityGeneORFaORF, open reading frame; pol II, polymerase II.FunctionConstitutive APase mutantsPHO80YOL001wCyclinPHO85YPL031cCyclin-dependent kinasePHO84YML123cPhosphate transporterPLC1YPL268wPhospholipase CARG82YDR173cInositol-polyphosphate kinaseKCS1YDR017cInositol-polyphosphate kinaseADK1YDR226wAdenylate kinaseSPT5YML010wpol II transcription elongation factorSPT10YJL127cpol II transcription regulatorSPT21YMR179wpol II transcription regulatorRPD3YNL330cHistone deacetylaseRPO41YFL036wMitochondrial RNA polymeraseNegative APase mutantsPHO2YDL106cDNA-binding transcriptional activatorPHO4YFR034cDNA-binding transcriptional activatorPHO5YBR093cAcid phosphatasePHO81YGR233cCyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorGCN5YGR252wPart of histone acetyltransferase complexesSPT7YBR081cPart of histone acetyltransferase complexesSNF5YBR289wPart of SWI/SNF global transcription activator complexSNF6YHL025wPart of SWI/SNF global transcription activator complexRPL21AYBR191wRibosomal proteinRPL34BYIL052cRibosomal proteina ORF, open reading frame; pol II, polymerase II. Open table in a new tab In the synthetic pathway for soluble inositol polyphosphate, Plc1p hydrolyzes membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (24Yoko-o T.

Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), whereas Kcs1p is required to convert IP5 to PP-IP4, PP-IP4 to (PP)2-IP3, IP6 to diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5), and PP-IP5 to bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate ((PP)2-IP4) (Fig. 1A) (27Saiardi A.

Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By contrast, Adk1p catalyzes the phosphorylation of AMP by ATP to form two ADP molecules (29Abele U. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The Δplc1, Δarg82, Δkcs1, and Δadk1 strains all exhibited the constitutive APase phenotype. Moreover, it should be noted that the APase activities of the Δplc1, Δarg82, and Δadk1 mutants were higher under the low phosphate conditions than under the high phosphate conditions, whereas the APase activity of the Δkcs1 mutant was almost the same as that in the Δpho80 strain under both high and low phosphate conditions (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, among the genes known to be involved in the synthesis of soluble inositol polyphosphate, deletion of only the IPK1 gene, which encodes IP5 kinase, did not result in the constitutive APase phenotype (Fig. 1, A and B). We therefore focused the following studies on the role of Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p in regulating the PHO pathway. Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p Are Required for the Regulation of PHO5 Expression—In S. cerevisiae, there are two types of APase: one is a constitutive APase encoded by PHO3, and the other is an rAPase encoded by PHO5 and its homologs PHO11 and PHO12 (19Toh-e A. Ueda Y. Kakimoto S.I. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Toh-e A. Kakimoto S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of rAPase is controlled by the PHO pathway in response to intracellular phosphate concentrations (2Lenburg M.E. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Persson B.L.

Shirakawa M. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17289-17294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p function as negative regulators in the PHO pathway, we knocked out the PHO3 gene in the Δplc1, Δarg82, Δkcs1, and Δadk1 strains and examined the resulting double disruptants for rAPase activity. We found that deletion of PHO3 in the Δplc1, Δarg82, Δkcs1, and Δadk1 strains did not affect the increased APase activity in these mutants (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the increased rAPase activity in these disruptants is a consequence of an increase in transcription of the PHO5 gene, we examined PHO5 transcript levels in the Δplc1Δpho3, Δarg82Δpho3, Δkcs1Δpho3, and Δadk1Δpho3 strains by Northern blot analysis. We found that the PHO5 transcript levels in these double disruptants were increased even under the high phosphate conditions compared with the wild-type strain (Δpho3) and correlated with the levels of rAPase activity (Fig. 1C), indicating that Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p are all involved in negative regulation at the level of PHO5 transcription. It should be noted that the PHO5 transcript levels in the Δadk1Δpho3 strain, but not in the other double disruptants, was higher under the low phosphate conditions than under the high phosphate conditions, indicating considerable residual regulation by the phosphate concentration in this strain. These observations suggest that Adk1p is only indirectly involved in regulating the PHO pathway. We also examined PHO5 transcription in the Δipk1Δpho3 strain and found that PHO5 transcription in this strain, which differed from that in the Δplc1Δpho3, Δarg82Δpho3, and Δkcs1Δpho3 strains, was induced only under the low phosphate conditions, as in the wild-type strain (Δpho3) (Fig. 1, B and C). Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p Function Upstream of the Pho81p-Pho80p-Pho85p Complex—Because the signal transduction mechanisms that function upstream of the Pho81p-Pho80p-Pho85p complex are still unknown, we tested whether Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p function upstream or downstream of Pho81p by analyzing the epistasis relationship between pho81 and the deletion mutants of these candidate regulators of the PHO pathway. If the deletion mutants are epistatic to a pho81 mutation, then deletion of PHO81 in the disruptants should result in an uninducible PHO5 expression phenotype. However, if the deletion mutants are hypostatic to a pho81 mutation, then deletion of PHO81 should result in the disruptants still displaying a constitutive PHO5 expression phenotype. We therefore generated triple disruptants of Δpho81 and Δplc1Δpho3, Δarg82Δpho3, Δkcs1Δpho3, and Δadk1Δpho3 and examined them for expression of PHO5 by the rAPase assay. The rAPase activity in each of the triple disruptants was diminished, similar to what was observed in the Δpho81Δpho3 strain (Fig. 2), indicating that pho81 is epistatic to each of the mutants. These results suggest that Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p function as negative regulators of the PHO pathway upstream of Pho81p. Plc1p, Arg82p, Kcs1p, and Adk1p Regulate the PHO Pathway Independently of the Intracellular Orthophosphate Concentration—Previous studies demonstrated that PHO5 expression is closely correlated with intracellular orthophosphate concentrations (5Auesukaree C. Homma T. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17289-17294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Bun-ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To examine whether the induction of PHO5 expression in the Δplc1Δpho3, Δarg82Δpho3, Δkcs1Δpho3, and Δadk1Δpho3 strains under the high phosphate conditions was due to a reduction in intracellular orthophosphate, we measured the intracellular orthophosphate concentration in these double disruptants by in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we found that, under the high phosphate conditions, the Δplc1Δpho3 and Δarg82Δpho3 strains had significantly reduced intracellular polyphosphate levels, viz. 14 and 24%, respectively, of the level in the wild-type strain (Δpho3). Moreover, intracellular polyphosphate was reduced to an undetectable level in the Δkcs1Δpho3 strain. In contrast to the polyphosphate levels, intracellular orthophosphate levels in these double disruptants were ∼1.6-fold higher than that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3A). These observations indicate that, despite the increase in intracellular orthophosphate levels, expression of PHO5 in the Δplc1Δpho3, Δarg82Δpho3, and Δkcs1Δpho3 strains is constitutive; this differs from its expression in the wild-type strain, where it is repressed (Fig. 1B). Therefore, these findings further suggest that Plc1p, Arg82p, and Kcs1p regulate the PHO pathway independently of intracellular orthophosphate levels. On the other hand, the levels of both intracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphate in the Δadk1Δpho3 strain were similar to those in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3B). Previous studies showed that the constitutive expression of PHO5 in the Δpho84 strain, a disruptant for a high affinity phosphate transporter, could be suppressed by increasing intracellular orthophosphate levels through the deletion of PHM3, PHM4, or both PHM1 and PHM2 (5Auesukaree C.

We therefore knocked out PHM3 in the Δadk1Δpho3 strain and found that the resulting triple mutant showed defects in accumulating intracellular polyphosphate and thus contained higher levels of intracellular orthophosphate compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 3B). Under the high pho"
https://openalex.org/W2041803642,"Overexpression of the <i>ERBB2</i> oncogene is observed in about 30% of breast cancers and is generally correlated with a poor prognosis. Previous results from our and other laboratories indicated that elevated transcriptional activity contributes significantly to the overexpression of <i>ERBB2</i> mRNA in mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines. Activator protein 2 (AP-2) transcription factors account for this overexpression through two recognition sequences located 215 and 500 bp upstream from the transcription start site. Furthermore, AP-2 transcription factors are highly expressed in cancer cell lines overexpressing <i>ERBB2</i>. In this report, we examined the cooperative effect of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) on AP-2-induced activation of <i>ERBB2</i> promoter activity. We detected high levels of YY1 transcription factor in mammary cancer cell lines. Notably, we showed that YY1 enhances AP-2α transcriptional activation of the <i>ERBB2</i> promoter through an AP-2 site both in HepG2 and in HCT116 cells, whereas a carboxyl-terminal-truncated form of YY1 cannot. Moreover, we demonstrated the interaction between endogenous AP-2 and YY1 factors in the BT-474 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line. In addition, inhibition of endogenous YY1 protein by an antisense decreased the transcription of an AP-2-responsive <i>ERBB2</i> reporter plasmid in BT-474 breast cancer cells. Finally, we detected <i>in vivo</i> AP-2 and YY1 occupancy of the <i>ERBB2</i> proximal promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our data thus provide evidence that YY1 cooperates with AP-2 to stimulate <i>ERBB2</i> promoter activity through the AP-2 binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2071655323,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other associated metabolic syndromes. Because PTP1B regulates multiple signal pathways and it can both enhance and antagonize a cellular event, it is important to establish the physiological relevance of PTP1B in these processes. In this study, we utilize potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors to delineate the role of PTP1B in integrin signaling. We show that down-regulation of PTP1B activity with small molecule inhibitors suppresses cell spreading and migration to fibronectin, increases Tyr527 phosphorylation in Src, and decreases phosphorylation of FAK, p130Cas, and ERK1/2. In addition, PTP1B “substrate-trapping” mutants bind Tyr527-phosphorylated Src and protect it from dephosphorylation by endogenous PTP1B. These results establish that PTP1B promotes integrin-mediated responses in fibroblasts by dephosphorylating the inhibitory pTyr527 and thereby activating the Src kinase. We also show that PTP1B forms a complex with Src and p130Cas, and that the proline-rich motif PPRPPK (residues 309–314) in PTP1B is essential for the complex formation. We suggest that the specificity of PTP1B for Src pTyr527 is mediated by protein-protein interactions involving the docking protein p130Cas with both Src and PTP1B in addition to the interactions between the PTP1B active site and the pTyr527 motif. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other associated metabolic syndromes.

We also show that PTP1B forms a complex with Src and p130Cas, and that the proline-rich motif PPRPPK (residues 309–314) in PTP1B is essential for the complex formation. We suggest that the specificity of PTP1B for Src pTyr527 is mediated by protein-protein interactions involving the docking protein p130Cas with both Src and PTP1B in addition to the interactions between the PTP1B active site and the pTyr527 motif.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that PTPs are important for many cellular processes and are involved in a number of human diseases (3Zhang Z-Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For example, PTP1B received much attention because mice lacking PTP1B did not develop diabetes nor did they become obese when placed on a calorie-rich diet (4Elchelby M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Lee Loy A. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C-C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

The phenotype of PTP1B knock-out mice suggests that PTP1B inhibitors may address both obesity and insulin resistance, thereby presenting a unique therapeutic opportunity (6Zhang Z-Y. Lee S-Y. Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 12: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Besides a role in insulin and leptin signaling, PTP1B is also implicated in several other signaling pathways such as growth factor- (7Liu F Chernoff J. Biochem.

Because PTP1B may be a regulator of multiple signal pathways and can both enhance and antagonize a cellular event, the physiological relevance of PTP1B in these processes must be established. This is an important prerequisite for the development of PTP1B-based therapeutics for type 2 diabetes and obesity. Previous studies suggested conflicting models for the role of PTP1B in integrin signaling. Integrins are transmembrane receptors used by cells to interact with the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin in order to transmit biochemical signals across the plasma membrane. Integrin-dependent adhesion modulates actin cytoskeleton organization, cell motility, cell growth, tumor metastasis, and the ability of cells to escape from apoptosis (14Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 15Hood J.D. Cheresh D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). In addition, integrin-mediated signaling can also cooperate with growth factor receptors by enhancing signaling pathways in response to insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (16Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Upon integrin engagement, the Src family kinases and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are activated. Together and independently, Src and FAK phosphorylate many other molecules including the adaptor protein p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate), resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 (17Damsky C.H. Ilic D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Giancotti F.G. Tarone G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although PTP1B has been implicated in integrin signaling, its role in this process is poorly understood. Initial studies with PTP1B overexpression in Rat-1 fibroblasts suggested that PTP1B negatively regulates integrin signaling presumably through association and dephosphorylation of p130Cas (10Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate study (12Arregui C.O. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), PTP1B was proposed to positively regulate integrin signaling based on the observation that L fibroblast cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive mutant PTP1B exhibit reduced adhesion and migration on fibronectin, as well as decreased tyrosine phosphorylation in FAK and paxillin. In a more recent study (13Cheng A. Bal G.S. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), PTP1B was also suggested as a positive regulator of integrin-mediated responses, because loss of PTP1B in SV40 large T antigen-transformed embryonic fibroblasts leads to a dramatic reduction in p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, ERK activation, and cell spreading. However, because little effect was observed on fibronectin signaling in PTP1B-deficient primary fibroblasts, the observed dependence on PTP1B in integrin signaling in SV40 large T antigen immortalized cells may reflect alterations in gene expression caused by transformation (19Broome M.A. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2867-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is unclear what is responsible for the apparent discrepancies from previous studies. It is possible that the overexpression and gene knock-out approaches employed may contribute to some of the differences. Given the potential cross-talk between growth factor and integrin-mediated signaling pathways, and the importance of integrin signaling in various physiological processes including cell growth, invasion, and migration, it is crucial to define the role of PTP1B in integrin signaling. In this study we seek to provide a better understanding of the role of PTP1B in integrin-mediated processes by employing potent and selective small molecule PTP1B inhibitors. The use of small molecule inhibitors to study molecular components of signal transduction pathways offers an invaluable means of analysis complementary to genetic techniques (20Cuenda A. Alessi D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar, 21McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The main advantages of the small molecule approach include its simplicity, speed, tunability, and reversibility. In addition, small molecule inhibitors exert their effect on endogenous targets, avoiding the need for overexpression of dominant-negative or constitutively active mutants, which can cause artifacts and lead to erroneous conclusions. Indeed, the availability of agents with specificity for a number of protein kinases has greatly enhanced our ability to identify their substrates and physiological functions (22English J.M. Cobb M.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Together with PTP “substrate-trapping” approach, our study with potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors generates strong evidence that PTP1B positively regulates fibronectin-mediated integrin signaling via activation of the Src kinase by dephosphorylating the inhibitory pTyr527. Materials—Anti-phosphotyrosine (pY20), FAK, p130Cas monoclonal antibodies and fibronectin were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-FAK and p130Cas antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-PTP1B antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Src, anti-Src/pY416, and anti-Src/pY527 antibodies were from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Polyclonal anti-MAPK (ERK1/2) and anti-phospho-MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). 12CA5 monoclonal antibody to hemagglutinin (HA) was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). L cells were purchased from ATCC (ATCC number CRL-2648, Manassas, VA). The synthesis of compounds II and III (Fig. 1) were described previously (23Xie L. Lee S-Y. Andersen J.N. Waters S. Shen K.

Blumenstein M. Yang H. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005; 44 (in press)Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The catalytic domain of PTP1B (residues 1–321) was used for in vitro study. PTP1B mutants D181A, D181A/Q262A, D181A/P309A/P310A, or D181A/Q262A/P309A/P310A were generated by PCR reactions according to the standard procedure of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The recombinant wild-type and mutant PTP1Bs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described (25Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using an absorbance coefficient of 1.24 for 1 mg/ml PTP1B. Purified PTP1B was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 agarose beads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions for the in vitro binding assay. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The HA-tagged full-length human PTP1B in pJ3H expression vector used for transfection was a gift from Dr. Jonathan Chernoff (26Sells M.A. Chernoff J Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged PTP1B mutants D181A, D181A/Q262A, D181A/P309A/P310A, and D181A/Q262A/P309A/P310A were generated by PCR reactions using pJ3H-HA-PTP1B as a template. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. L cells were seeded at 15% confluency in 15-cm culture dishes the day before transfection. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell Spreading Assay—L cells were grown to ∼80% confluency and serum-starved for 16 h in DMEM. Cells were then detached from the culture dishes by trypsinization, and trypsin was neutralized by addition of DMEM containing 125 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and resuspended in this medium at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. 2.5 ml of cells were then applied to 1% bovine serum albumin precoated 6-well plates and incubated for 1 h with or without the presence of different concentrations of PTP1B inhibitors. After incubation, cells were transferred into fibronectin-coated 6-well plates and incubated for 30 min in the cell culture incubator. (The plates were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then rinsed twice with PBS and once with serum-free DMEM before use.) Cells were then photographed under a microscope at ×200 magnification. Three random microscopic fields were counted per well. Spreading cells were defined as cells with extended processes, lacking a rounded morphology, and not phase-bright. The non-spreading cells were rounded and phase-bright under microscope. Cell Migration Assay—L cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight, harvested, and incubated with different concentrations of PTP1B inhibitors as described above. Chambers for haptotaxis assays (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) were prepared by precoating the undersurface of the polycarbonate membrane with fibronectin (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at 37 °C. The chambers were then washed with PBS, and 1 × 105 cells in 0.3 ml of DMEM were added to the upper chamber. The migration was allowed for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells on the upper chamber surface were mechanically removed, and the migratory cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed by methanol and stained with Giemsa stain. The migrated cells were then counted under a microscope at ×200 magnification. Three random microscopic fields were counted per well. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were grown to ∼80% confluency, serum-starved, and applied to fibronectin-coated dishes as described above. 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) were added to each 15-cm dish. Cells were scraped with a rubber policeman and lysed on ice for 30 min. 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the lysate at this step. The cell lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentration of the lysate was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-HA antibody. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with the cell lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 8 m urea. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane, which were then immunoblotted by appropriate antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Binding Assay—100 μg of the catalytic domain of the wild type, D181A, D181A/Q262A, D181A/P309A/P310A, or D181A/Q262A/P309A/P310A PTP1B was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instruction. The protein-linked beads were then mixed with 500 μg of L cell lysate, which was prepared as described above, for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect the presence of Src or p130Cas. The use of small molecule inhibitors that specifically modulate the activity of individual PTPs represents a powerful approach to determine the function and therapeutic potential of PTPs (27Kumar S. Liang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z-Y. Methods. 2005; 35: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the most potent and selective PTP1B inhibitor (Fig. 1, compound I) reported to date, which displays a Ki value of 2.4 nm for PTP1B and exhibits several orders of magnitude of selectivity in favor of PTP1B against a panel of PTPs (28Shen K. Keng Y-F. Wu L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The negatively charged difluoro-phosphonate functional groups participate in key active site and near active site interactions that are responsible for the high potency of compound I and selectivity toward PTP1B (29Guo X-L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Sun J-P. Fedorov A.A. Lee S.-Y. Guo X.-L. Shen K. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12406-12414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the highly charged inhibitor I is not cell-permeable (23Xie L. Lee S-Y. Andersen J.N. Waters S. Shen K. Guo X.-L. Moller N.P.H. Olefsky J.M. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12792-12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To enhance its potential for biological studies, we prepared a cell-permeable derivative of compound I by coupling it to the cell-penetrating peptide (D)Arg8 via a disulfide bridge to generate II (Fig. 1) (24Lee S-Y. Liang F. Guo X.-L. Xie L. Cahill S.M. Blumenstein M. Yang H. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005; 44 (in press)Google Scholar). Like Drosophila antennapedia homeodomain and HIV-1 TAT, polyarginine peptides can enable rapid transport of small molecule, peptides, small proteins, and oligonucleotides across the plasma membrane into living cells (31Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 32Lundberg P. Langel U. J. Mol. Recogn. 2003; 16: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Once inside the cell, the cytosolic reducing environment will cleave the disulfide moiety and thereby release I in a freely diffusible form. We have determined that compound II is indeed cell permeable and enhances insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor β (IRβ) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) by nearly 2-fold at 5 nm concentration (twice its Ki value) (24Lee S-Y. Liang F. Guo X.-L. Xie L. Cahill S.M. Blumenstein M. Yang H. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005; 44 (in press)Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with another cell-permeable PTP1B inhibitor, compound III (Fig. 1), which was derived by attaching a highly lipophilic fatty acid to an analog of compound I (23Xie L. Lee S-Y. Andersen J.N. Waters S. Shen K. Guo X.-L. Moller N.P.H. Olefsky J.M. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12792-12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Treatment of a number of insulin-sensitive cell lines with III markedly enhanced IRβ and IRS-1 phosphorylation, Akt and ERK1/2 activation, Glut4 translocation, glucose uptake, Elk1 transcriptional activation, and cell proliferation in insulin signaling (23Xie L. Lee S-Y. Andersen J.N. Waters S. Shen K. Guo X.-L. Moller N.P.H. Olefsky J.M. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12792-12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the observed cellular effects (e.g. ∼2-fold increase in IRβ and IRS-1 phosphorylation) with compounds II and III are similar in magnitude to those observed with antisense-mediated reduction of PTP1B (33Clampit J.E. Meuth J.L. Smith H.T. Reilly R.M. Jirousek M.R. Trevillyan J.M. Rondinone C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and PTP1B knock-out mice, which are resistant to diabetes and obesity (4Elchelby M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Lee Loy A. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C-C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data demonstrate that II and III have the expected biological effects on insulin signaling and serve as both insulin mimetics and sensitizers, validating the notion that small molecule PTP1B inhibitors can be used in antidiabetes therapeutics. Moreover, the data also establish the utility of potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors in further studies of the roles of PTP1B in other signal pathways. In this study, we have employed both compounds II and III to delineate the role of PTP1B in integrin-mediated processes. Compound II Inhibits L Cell Spreading on Fibronectin— Attachment of integrins to fibronectin induces focal adhesion formation and actin stress fiber assembly, which leads to spreading cell morphology. To assess the effect of PTP1B inhibition on cell spreading, we incubated the suspended cells with or without compound II for 1 h, followed by applying the cells to fibronectin-coated culture dishes. The cells were photographed under the microscope at ×200 magnification. As shown in Fig. 2, after 30 min on fibronectin, the number of spreading cells decreases in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were treated with a range of compound II concentrations. Compared with the control, we observed an 11–35% decrease in cell spreading in the presence of 5–50 nm compound II. These results indicate that efficient cell spreading upon integrin engagement requires the catalytic activity of PTP1B. Compound II Impairs L Cells Migration toward Fibronectin—We next examined the effect of PTP1B inhibition on haptotactic migration of L cells toward fibronectin in a transwell chamber. In this experiment, L cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight, harvested, and incubated with different concentrations (5–50 nm) of compound II for 1 h. The undersurface of the chamber for haptotaxis assays was precoated with fibronectin. Cells were added to the upper chamber, and migration was allowed for 3 h in the CO2 incubator. After removing the cells on the upper surface, the migratory cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed and enumerated. As shown in Fig. 3, cells treated with compound II showed a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of migration, consistent with a defect in fibronectin-stimulated response when PTP1B is inhibited. The maximal inhibition of cell migration was observed when 20 nm of compound II was applied, and the number of the migratory cells was decreased by 24% compared with the control. It is interesting to note that even at saturating concentrations of compound II, the fibronectin-mediated cell spreading and migration was decreased only by 20–30%. This is perhaps not surprising because PTP1B may not be the only PTP involved in integrin-mediated processes, and several other PTPs such as SHP2, PTP-PEST, and PTPα have previously been implicated as either positively or negatively regulating integrin signaling by dephosphorylating key signaling components such as Src, FAK, and p130Cas (34Angers-Loustau A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Effects of Compounds II and III on Integrin Signaling—The effects of PTP1B inhibitor II on cell spreading and migration suggest that PTP1B is required for optimal integrin signaling. It has been shown that when integrin is engaged by the extracellular matrix, Tyr397 in FAK is autophosphorylated, which creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src (39Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 40Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated Src then phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues in the adaptor protein p130Cas and FAK itself (41Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 42Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), leading to full activation of many of the downstream pathways, most notably the activation of the ERK pathway (44Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 45Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). To further define the role of PTP1B in integrin-mediated processes, we examined the effect of PTP1B inhibition with compound II on the phosphorylation status of Src, FAK, p130Cas, and ERK. L cells were exposed to compound II over a selected range of concentrations for 1 h, followed by adhesion onto fibronectin for 30 min. Cell lysates were either subjected directly to immunoblotting (Src and ERK) or immunoprecipitation (FAK and p130Cas). Total cell lysates or immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific antibodies. We first assessed the effect of compound II on Src phosphorylation, as Src activity is regulated by phosphorylation at two distinct tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation of Tyr416 in the kinase domain activates Src, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr527 in the C-terminal tail by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) inactivates Src. The inhibitory effect arises from the fact that Tyr527, when phosphorylated, interacts intramolecularly with the Src SH2 domain, which causes the Src molecule to assume a closed conformation that covers the kinase domain and reduces its potential for substrate interaction (46Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 47Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Consequently, activation of Src requires the removal of the C-terminal phosphate by specific PTPs. As shown in Fig. 4, the phosphorylation levels at Tyr416 and Tyr527 in Src were determined using phosphospecific antibodies directed toward pSrc416 and pSrc527, respectively. It is clear that treatment of the cells with compound II causes a significant increase in Tyr527 phosphorylation witho"

Two G-protein-coupled receptors for LTB4, BLT1 and BLT2, have been cloned from human and shown to be high and low affinity LTB4 receptors, respectively. To reveal the biological roles of BLT2 using mouse disease models, we cloned and characterized mouse BLT2. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mouse BLT2 exhibited specific binding to LTB4, LTB4-induced calcium mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We found that Compound A (4′-{[pentanoyl (phenyl) amino] methyl}-1, 1′-biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid) was a BLT2-selective agonist and induced Ca2+ mobilization and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase through BLT2, whereas it had no effect on BLT1. 12-epi LTB4 exhibited a partial agonistic activity against mBLT1 and mBLT2, whereas 6-trans-12-epi LTB4 did not. Northern blot analysis showed that mouse BLT2 is expressed highly in small intestine and skin in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of human BLT2. By in situ hybridization and the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that mouse BLT2 is expressed in follicular and interfollicular keratinocytes. Compound A, LTB4, and 12-epi LTB4 all induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in primary mouse keratinocytes. Furthermore, Compound A and LTB4 induced chemotaxis in primary mouse keratinocytes. These data suggest the presence of functional BLT2 in primary keratinocytes.

LTB4 is a potent proinflammatory mediator mainly synthesized by phagocytic cells, principally polymorphonuclear leukocyte and macrophage, which responds to infectious and inflammatory stimuli. LTB4 induces granulocyte migration, degranulation, superoxide generation, and adhesion to vascular endothelial cells. It plays an important role in the initial phase of the inflammatory response and is thought to be involved in a number of inflammatory diseases including psoriasis (9Iversen L. Kragballe K.

Recently, LTB4 was shown to act as an immunomodulator by recruiting CD4+ early effector and CD8+ cytotoxic effector T-cells to inflamed tissues (14Goodarzi K. Goodarzi M. Tager A.M.

Thus, many BLT antagonists have been currently under development as novel antiinflammatory and anti-allergic drugs. Two types of LTB4 receptors (BLT1 and BLT2) have been isolated. BLT1 (17Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) and BLT2 (18Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K.

Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) are high and low affinity LTB4 receptors, respectively. These receptors belong to a G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily and share a relatively higher homology with receptors for chemoattractants than those for other eicosanoids (21Brink C. Dahlen S.E. Drazen J. Evans J.F. Hay D.W. Nicosia S. Serhan C.N. Shimizu T. Yokomizo T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 195-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Human BLT1 is expressed predominantly in leukocytes, whereas human BLT2 is expressed relatively ubiquitously (18Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K. J. Biol.

In addition, two LTB4 receptors show different binding profiles to various eicosanoids and BLT antagonists. 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid bind to and activate BLT2 but not BLT1 (22Yokomizo T. Kato K. Hagiya H. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12454-12459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These eicosanoids also induce calcium mobilization and chemotaxis through BLT2 but not through BLT1 (22Yokomizo T. Kato K. Hagiya H. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12454-12459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast to detailed studies on BLT1, information on BLT2 is limited. Thus, we cloned and characterized mouse BLT2 (mBLT2) to reveal the roles of BLT2 in vivo. In addition, we have developed a novel synthetic BLT2 agonist that selectively activates BLT2 in collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Using this compound and a BLT1-specific antagonist, we demonstrated BLT2-dependent phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cell migration of primary mouse keratinocytes. Materials—All of the eicosanoids were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Compound A and its methyl ester derivative are gifts from Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and CP105696 was from Pfizer Inc (Groton, CT). [3H]LTB4 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Isolation of Genomic Clones Containing Mouse BLT1 and BLT2— Mouse genomic libraries were screened by plaque hybridization. 106 independent clones from mouse genomic library (129SV Mouse genomic library; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were lifted to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and screened with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 800 bp of expressed sequence tag clone encoding mouse BLT1 (sequence data available from EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ under accession number AA028322). Hybridization was carried out in a hybridization buffer containing 6× saline-sodium citrate solution (SSC), 10× Dehnhart's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C overnight. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1× SDS followed by washing in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 25 °C. Tertiary screening gave two positive clones, which were analyzed by Southern blotting. The DNA sequence was determined using an automated DNA sequencer (model 373A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and LI-COR 4000LS (Aloka, Meerbusch, Germany). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from C57Bl/6J (Clea, Tokyo, Japan) mice tissues using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Poly (A)+ RNA was isolated from 200 μg of total RNA using a μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). 5 μg of mRNA from mouse tissues and 10 μg of total RNA from macrophages and neutrophils were denatured, electrophoresed on 0.7% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences) as described (23Ogasawara H. Ishii S. Yokomizo T. Kakinuma T. Komine M. Tamaki K. Shimizu T. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18763-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled open reading frame (ORF) of mBLT2 or glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA at 65 °C for 2 h in a RapidHyb hybridization solution (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by washing in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 1 h and then subjected to autoradiography. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—cDNA was synthesized from 50 ng of mRNA from mouse tissues and 50 ng of total RNA from macrophages and neutrophils using Superscript II (Invitrogen). cDNA was diluted in distilled water 100-fold and used as a template for PCR. PCR was carried out using a LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics), and the products were detected by measuring the binding of SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) to double-stranded DNA. The PCR reactions were set up in microcapillary tubes in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction components contained 5 μl of diluted cDNA, 1× FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I, 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm upstream and downstream primers. pcDNA3-mBLT2 (see below) and pcDNA3.1 containing mouse GAPDH cDNA were used as standards. The following primers were used: mBLT1 upstream (1 bp from the first ATG), 5′-ATGGCTGCAAACACTACATCTCCT-3′, downstream (319), 5′-CACTGGCATACATGCTTATTCCAC-3′; mBLT2 upstream (820), 5′-ACAGCCTTGGCTTTCTTCAG-3′, downstream (1013), 5′-TGCCCCATTACTTTCAGCTT-3′; GAPDH upstream (1013), 5′-GTGGACCTCATGGCCTACAT-3′, downstream (1226), 5′-GGGTGCAGCGAACTTTATTG-3′. These primer pairs resulted in PCR products of 319 bp for mBLT1, 193 bp for mBLT2, and 213 bp for GAPDH. The standards and samples were simultaneously amplified using the master mixture. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the polymerase followed by 50 cycles of amplification. Each cycle of PCR consisted of 3 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 3 s of primer annealing at 65 °C, and 12 s of extension at 72 °C. The temperature ramp was set at 20 °C/s. At the end of each extension step, the fluorescent intensity was measured for quantification of cDNAs. After cyclings, melting curves of the PCR products were obtained by a linear increase of the temperature to 95 °C. The levels of mRNA were normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA. Expression of Mouse BLT2 in CHO cells—The ORF of mBLT2 was amplified from isolated genomic clones by PCR using a sense primer (5′-CGGGATCCCGCATGTCTGTCTGCTACCGTC-3′) covering a BamHI site and an antisense primer (5′-CGGAATTCTACCATTCTTGACTGTCTT-3′) at the stop codon covering an EcoRI site. The PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of p cDNA3 (Invitrogen) and designated pcDNA3-mBLT2. Accurate amplification of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. For stable expression, CHO cells on 6-cm plates were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (WAKO, Osaka, Japan) for 2 weeks. 19 resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution, and expression of mBLT2 in these cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis as described above. Several clones were examined for LTB4 binding and LTB4-dependent calcium mobilization, and they showed basically similar results. [3H]LTB4 Binding Assay—Cells were harvested and sonicated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA-Na2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the remaining supernatants were further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were used for binding assays as membrane fractions. The binding mixture (100 μl) contained membrane fractions (20 μg of protein) and 0.5 nm [3H]LTB4 (17,760 dpm for membrane fractions of CHO-mBLT1) or 5 nm [3H]LTB4 (177,600 dpm for membrane fractions of CHO-mBLT2) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.1% BSA). For determination of the nonspecific binding, unlabeled LTB4 was added to the binding mixture to a final concentration of 1 μm. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 60 min by gentle agitation followed by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and extensive washing with 3 ml of binding buffer. The radioactivity of the filters was determined with a Top Count scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Measurements of Calcium and cAMP Concentrations—Calcium and cAMP concentrations were determined according to the previous method (20Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) using CHO (mock-transfected), CHO-mBLT1, and CHO-mBLT2 cells using a CAF-100 system (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) and Bio-Track cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences). To examine the inhibitory effect of CP105696 on LTB4-induced Ca2+ mobilization, CP105696 was applied 1 min before 100 nm LTB4 application. ERK Phosphorylation—CHO cells were seeded on 12-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. After 2 days of culture, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fraction V). The cells were preincubated with Ham F-12 containing 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 10 min and then exposed with various concentrations of ligands for 5 min. Pilot experiments showed that 5 min of stimulation gave maximum phosphorylation of ERK by LTB4 and Compound A. Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated as described (24Yamasaki K. Toriu N. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Sayama K. Takayanagi A. Ohtsubo M. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Fujii M. Miyazono K. Hashimoto K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 1030-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and were seeded on 12-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well. After 1 day of culture, the cells were incubated for 12 h in Defined keratinocyte SFM (serum-free medium) (Invitrogen). The cells were preincubated with Defined keratinocyte SFM (serum-free medium) containing 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min and stimulated as described above. CP105696 was applied 10 min before 100 nm LTB4 application. The medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO3, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40), frozen at -80 °C, thawed, and homogenized by passing through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. The cell lysate was denatured at 100 °C for 10 min and separated in 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL) using semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 350 mA for 20 min. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with the blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) skim milk). They were then incubated for 2 h with a dilution of (1:1000) anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibody (code 9101, Cell signaling, Beverly, MA) in diluting solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) skim milk). For the total ERK, they were incubated for 2 h with a dilution of (1:1000) anti-p44/p42 MAPK antibody (code 9102, Cell Signaling) in diluting solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (w/v) BSA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (code 7074, Cell Signaling) was used in both cases at a dilution of 2000 for 1 h followed by development using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization for mBLT2 was carried out using paraffin sections of skin samples from C57Bl/6J mice fixed in 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline without calcium chloride and magnesium (PBS(-) as described previously (25Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Fujimoto M. Grotendorst G.R. Takehara K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 729-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 4-μm-thick sections, mounted onto silane-coated slides, deparaffinized, and treated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml in PBS(-) for 10 min at room temperature and with 2 mg/ml glycine in PBS(-) for 15 min at room temperature. The sections were acetylated with acetic anhydride (1 ml in 400 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0) for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS(-), the samples were soaked in 2× SSC containing 50% formamide and subjected to hybridization. A fragment of mBLT2 ORF (741–941) was amplified by PCR using an upstream primer with a recognition sequence for HindIII and a downstream primer with a recognition sequence for EcoRI and then directionally subcloned into pSPT18 (Roche Applied Science). The plasmid was linearized using HindIII to prepare the antisense probe and EcoRI for the sense probe. The probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridization was performed in a humidified chamber for 16 h at 42 °C. The slides were washed in 2× SSC containing 50% formamide for 20 min three times at 42 °C. Unhybridized probes were digested with 20 μg/ml RNase A in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were then rinsed for 20 min in 0.1× SSC three times at 42 °C. The bound probes were visualized using a digoxigenin nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The slides were counterstained in 0.1% methyl green for 10 min, washed in running tap water, and mounted. Immunocytochemistry—Primary mouse keratinocytes were cultured on chamber slides and fixed with methanol:acetone (1:1) at 4 °C for 5 min followed by washing with PBS(-) twice and blocking with 10% goat serum/3% BSA/PBS(-) at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml primary antibody to mouse keratin 5 (Covance Research Product, Berkeley, CA) or rabbit control IgG at room temperature for 30 min. After three times of washing with PBS(-), the slides were incubated with 10 μg/ml secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 30 min. The images were taken using a confocal microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Chemotaxis Assay—Primary keratinocytes grown to 80% confluency on collagen I-coated 10-cm dishes were detached by incubation with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated with the same volume of 10% FCS/PBS(-). After centrifugation, the cells were suspended in Defined keratinocyte SFM (serum-free medium) containing 0.1% BSA. The migration of keratinocytes was assayed using a ChemoTX system (Neuro Probe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The frame filter precoated with type I collagen (10 μg/ml) was placed above the wells filled with ligands. Sixty-five μl of the keratinocyte suspension (1.5 × 105 cells/well) was added to each upper side of the well of a 96-well chamber and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. Cells on the upper surface of the filter membrane were removed by scraping. The migrated cells were stained with Diff-Quick (International Reagents, Kobe, Japan) and counted under a microscope. Pharmacological Properties of mBLT2—To clone and analyze mouse BLT2 (mBLT2), we screened mouse genomic library and isolated several clones containing both mBLT2 and mBLT1 genes. Southern blot and DNA sequencing analyses revealed that the gene organization of mBLT1 and mBLT2 was quite similar (data not shown) to that of human (26Kato K. Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). mBLT2 was similar to human BLT2 with identities of 92.2 and 86.0% on the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. Homology between human and mouse BLT2 is much higher than BLT1 (78.6% amino acid identity), suggesting that BLT2 has been conserved during evolution. The membrane fraction of human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells transfected with mBLT2 showed specific [3H]LTB4 binding (data not shown). To examine whether the binding of LTB4 to mBLT2 transduces intracellular signaling, we established several lines of CHO cells stably expressing mBLT2 (CHO-mBLT2) and compared the dose dependence of LTB4-induced signaling in CHO-mBLT2 to that in CHO-mBLT1. LTB4 increased intracellular calcium concentrations in dose-dependent manners for both CHO-mBLT1 and CHO-mBLT2 (Fig. 1A). EC50 values of LTB4 were 20 nm for mBLT1 and 170 nm for mBLT2 (Fig. 1A). 10 μm LTB4 did not cause any calcium increase in CHO cells transfected with an empty vector. We examined the inhibitory effect of a BLT antagonist, CP105696 (11Griffiths R.J. Pettipher E.R. Koch K. Farrell C.A. Breslow R. Conklyn M.J. Smith M.A. Hackman B.C. Wimberly D.J. Milici A.J.

A. 1995; 92: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), on LTB4-induced calcium mobilization in CHO-mBLT1 and CHO-mBLT2. CP105696 inhibited LTB4-induced calcium mobilization in CHO-mBLT1 in a dose-dependent manner but did not in CHO-mBLT2 (Fig. 1B), showing that this compound is a BLT1-specific antagonist. We next examined the inhibitory effects of LTB4 on adenylyl cyclase activity through mBLT1 and mBLT2. LTB4 dose-dependently inhibited 25 μm forskolin-activated adenylyl cyclase in both CHO-mBLT1 and CHO-mBLT2 (Fig. 2A). The IC50 value of LTB4 in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO-mBLT2 (80 nm; Fig. 2A) was higher than that of CHO-mBLT1 (1 nm; Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 12 h abolished LTB4-dependent adenylyl cyclase inhibition in CHO-mBLT2 cells (Fig. 2B), showing that mBLT2 couples with the Gi/o class of G-protein in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. All these data show that mouse BLT2 is a functional and low affinity receptor for LTB4. Selective BLT2 Agonist, Compound A—Compound A, 4′-{[pentanoyl (phenyl) amino] methyl}-1, 1′-biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 3A), was identified as a BLT2 agonist in the chemical library of Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. To test the specificity of this compound on BLT1 and BLT2, we examined the competitive effects of Compound A on [3H]LTB4 binding to membrane fractions of CHO-mBLT1 or CHO-mBLT2. Fig. 3B shows the competition of 0.5 nm [3H]LTB4 binding to mBLT1 by various concentrations of unlabeled LTB4 and Compound A. LTB4 binding to BLT1 was inhibited by unlabeled LTB4 in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 3 nm) but not by compound A (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C shows the competition of 5 nm [3H]LTB4 binding to mBLT2 by various concentrations of unlabeled LTB4 and Compound A. In contrast to BLT1, LTB4 binding to BLT2 was inhibited by both unlabeled LTB4 and Compound A. IC50 values of LTB4 and Compound A were around 50 and 20 nm, respectively. 1 μm Compound A inhibited 77% of [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT2 (Fig. 3C). The carboxyl methyl ester derivative of Compound A did not inhibit [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT1 or BLT2 (Fig. 3, B and C). We also examined the agonistic activity of this compound using CHO-mBLT1 and CHO-mBLT2. Compound A increased the intracellular calcium concentration in CHO-mBLT2 in a dose-dependent manner but not in CHO-mBLT1 or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). The carboxyl methyl ester derivative of Compound A did not increase intracellular calcium concentration in either CHO-mBLT1 or CHO-mBLT2 (Fig. 3D). The maximum response evoked by Compound A was similar to that of LTB4, suggesting that Compound A is a full agonist for mBLT2. The EC50 value of Compound A for mBLT2 is 20 nm, which is lower than that of LTB4 (170 nm), as determined by calcium mobilization assay. The potency and selectivity of Compound A on human BLT2 were similar for that on mouse BLT2, and Compound A did not induce calcium mobilization through human BLT1 (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that Compound A is a selective and full BLT2 agonist and activates BLT2 at lower concentrations than LTB4. Next, we examined LTB4- and Compound A-dependent phosphorylation of ERK. LTB4 dose-dependently induced ERK phosphorylation both in CHO-mBLT1 and in CHO-mBLT2 (Fig. 3, E and F, left). Minimum concentrations of LTB4 required for ERK phosphorylation were 1 nm in CHO-mBLT1 (Fig. 3F, left) and 10 nm in CHO-mBLT2 (Fig. 3E, left). Compound A induced ERK phosphorylation only in CHO-mBLT2 but not in CHO-mBLT1 (Fig. 3, E and F, right). The minimum concentration of Compound A required for ERK phosphorylation in CHO-mBLT2 was 1 nm. Agonistic Activity of 12-epi LTB4 against BLTs—We next examined whether dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids could activate mBLT1 and mBLT2. [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT1 was inhibited by 12-epi LTB4 but not by 6-trans-12-epi LTB4 (Fig. 4A). The IC50 value of 12-epi LTB4 (70 nm) was higher than that of LTB4 (3 nm). [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT2 was inhibited by 12-epi LTB4 but not by 6-trans-12-epi LTB4 (Fig."

https://openalex.org/W2096411149,"Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity has been proposed to mediate the death of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. The metabolic dependence of glutamatergic neurons upon glia via the glutamate/glutamine cycle to provide the precursor for neurotransmitter glutamate is well established. Thus, the aim of the present work was to study the retinal glutamate/glutamine activity in eyes with hypertension induced by intracameral injections of hyaluronic acid (HA). For this purpose, weekly injections of HA were performed unilaterally in the rat anterior chamber, whereas the contralateral eye was injected with saline solution. At 3 or 10 weeks of treatment, glutamate and glutamine uptake and release were assessed using [3H]-glutamate and [3H]-glutamine as radioligands, respectively. In addition, glutamine synthetase activity was assessed by a spectrophotometric assay, whereas glutaminase activity was measured through the conversion of [3H]-glutamine to [3H]-glutamate. At 3 weeks of treatment with HA, a significant decrease (P<0.01) in glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity was observed. Glutamine uptake and release, as well as glutaminase activity, were significantly increased (P<0.01) in eyes injected with HA for 3 weeks compared with vehicle-injected eyes, whereas [3H]-glutamate release did not change in hypertensive eyes. Only the changes in glutamine synthetase activity persisted at 10 weeks of treatment with HA. These results indicate a significant alteration in the retinal glutamate/glutamine cycle activity in hypertensive eyes. Since these changes preceded both functional and histological alterations induced by ocular hypertension, these results support the involvement of glutamate in glaucomatous neuropathy."

They are found in theextracellular matrix associated with the plasma membrane and cell wall(1Knox J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,2Du H. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although their precisefunctions are unknown, AGPs have been implicated in diverse developmentalroles, including differentiation, cell-cell recognition, and embryogenesis(3Smallwood M. Knox J.P. Bowles D.J. Membranes: Specialized Function in Plants. BiosScientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1996Google Scholar, 4Schultz C.J. Gilson P. Oxley D. Youl J.J. Bacic A.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).AGPs are characterized by large amounts of carbohydrate components rich ingalactose (sugars in the present study are d series unlessotherwise designated) and l-arabinose, and protein components richin hydroxyproline, serine, threonine, alanine, and glycine(1Knox J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate moietiesof AGPs have a common structure consisting of a β-1,3-galactosyl backboneto which side chains of β-1,6-galactosyl residues are attached throughO-6. l-Arabinose and lesser amounts of other auxiliary sugars, suchas glucuronic acid, l-rhamnose, and l-fucose, areattached to the side chains, usually at nonreducing termini(1Knox J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because of the largenumber of putative protein cores and the complex structure of the carbohydratemoieties, it is difficult to separate particular AGP molecules from other AGPspecies in plant tissues, and consequently it is difficult to elucidate theprecise characteristics of individual AGPs. Galactanases that hydrolyze β-1,3- or β-1,6-galactosyl linkageswould be useful tools to analyze the structure and function of thecarbohydrate moieties of AGPs, but little research has been done in this area.However, we recently succeeded in the molecular cloning ofendo-β-1,6-galactanase from Trichoderma viride, and weclarified in detail the substrate specificity of the recombinant enzyme(6Kotake T. Kaneko S. Kubomoto A. Haque M.A. Kobayashi H. Tsumuraya Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 749-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, wefocused on exo-β-1,3-galactanases (EC 3.2.1.145) that cleave the mainchain β-1,3-linkage of the carbohydrate moiety of AGPs. So far,β-1,3-galactanase has been purified from only two organisms, Irpexlacteus (Il1,3Gal) (7Tsumuraya Y. Mochizuki N. Hashimoto Y. Kováč P. J.

In the present study, we succeeded incloning an exo-β-1,3-galactanase gene from Phanerochaetechrysosporium (Pc1,3Gal43A) and found that the enzyme contains domainsresembling glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 43 and carbohydrate-binding module(CBM) family 6. As far as we know, this is the first report of the cloning ofan exo-β-1,3-galactanase and of a CBM that binds β-1,3-galactan.

PurifiedIl1,3Gal was separated by SDS-PAGE(11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electro-blotted ontoa polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The N-terminal aminoacid sequence was analyzed on an HP G105A protein sequencer (Hewlett Packard,Palo Alto, CA) and the sequence up to 24 amino acids was determined: peptide1, ETQFVSGAAWTDTSGNVFQAHGGG. To determine internal sequences, peptidefragments were prepared. In-gel protease digestion(12Hirano H. Analysis of ProteinStructure for Gene Cloning. Tokyo Kagaku Dohjin, Tokyo1993Google Scholar) was carried out byincubating 3 μg of purified exo-β-1,3-galactanase and 0.6 μg of V8protease (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) for 15 min at room temperatureat the bottom of the stacking gel of SDS-PAGE. The resulting peptide fragmentswere separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gel), electro-blotted ontopolyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and sequenced as described above. Thefollowing amino acid sequence was obtained: peptide 2,GLFQDDDSAGTAYLLYASDNNQQFKKSRLD. The P. chrysosporium genome data basewas searched for a gene corresponding to the determined amino acid sequencesof Il1,3Gal using the tblastn algorithm (BLOSUM 62 matrix, e-value = 10) onthe DOE Joint Genome Institute website(genome.jgi-psf.org/whiterot1/whiterot1.home.html),and a sequence, designated pc.71.18.1, was identified. Based on the obtainednucleotide sequence, primers were designed as follows: F1 (5′-CAA AACCAG ATC GTC TCT GG-3′), R1 (5′-GAG GCG CGA GAT CTT GAA-3′),F2 (5′-CGT TTG CCC GAG GGT CA-3′), R2 (5′-CCG ACA GAA TTGTCG AGG ATC-3′), and F3 (5′-AAC GTC CAG GCA GGG A-3′). Total RNA was extracted from P. chrysosporium grown in Kremer andWood medium (13Kremer S.M. Wood P.M. Eur.J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) containing 2%cellulose powder, Whatman CF11 (Whatman, Inc.), at 37 °C for 3 days. Thefirst-strand cDNA from the total RNA was synthesized using aReady-To-Go™ You-Prime First-strand Beads kit (Amersham Biosciences)with a 3′-RACE primer (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with the followingprimer pairs: F1 and R1 for first PCR, F2 and R2 for second PCR, and F3 andthe oligonucleotide (complementing 3′-RACE primer; 5′-GGC CAC GCGTCG ACT AGT AC-3′) for 3′-RACE. All PCR products were subclonedinto the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequenceswere determined with an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and assembledfor completion of the open reading frame encoding theexo-β-1,3-galactanase. Expression of Pc1,3Gal43A and PcCBM6 Genes—PCR was carriedout using two oligonucleotide primers based on the nucleotide sequence of themature protein (5′-primer, 5′-GAA TTC CAAAAT CAG ATC GTC TCT GG-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGCC GCT CAG TAC ACA ATG ATC TTG T-3′). The product wasdigested with EcoRI and NotI (underlined) and then ligated into thecorresponding site of the Pichia expression vector pPICZαA(Invitrogen). To express family 6 CBM from Pc1,3Gal43A (PcCBM6), the followingprimers were designed: 5′-primer (5′-CCA TGG CAG GGA CGT ACT CGGTCG CC-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-AAG CTT TCA GTA CAC AAT GAT CTTGTC-3′). PCR was carried out using the primers, and the product wassubcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. The vector was digested with EcoRI, andthe fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of the pPICZαA.Approximately 10 μg of the recombinant plasmid (pPICZαA/Pc1,3Gal43Aor pPICZαA/PcCBM6) was linearized with Bpu1102I (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu,Japan) prior to transformation of Pichia pastoris strain KM71H(MutS) cells. Electroporation and selection of transformants werecarried out according to the instruction manual of the EasySelect™Pichia expression kit (version G; Invitrogen). The selected clone(KM71H/Pc1,3Gal43A or KM71H/PcCBM6) was cultured in YPG medium consisting of1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 1% (v/v) glycerol at 30 °Cfor 3 days. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 5 min, then suspended in YPM medium containing 1% (w/v) yeastextract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 1% (v/v) methanol as an inducer, and cultivatedat 30 °C for 2 days with constant shaking. Methanol was supplemented at a1% concentration every 24 h during the period of induction. Purification of Recombinant Pc1,3Gal43A and PcCBM6 —Therecombinant enzyme was purified from the culture supernatant of the P.pastoris transformant carrying the Pc1,3Gal43A gene. The crude enzymepreparation was dialyzed against 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, andapplied to a CM-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column (5 ×50 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with the same bufferto remove unbound materials, then the bound proteins were eluted with a lineargradient of sodium chloride (0–1 m). The eluate wasfractionated into 1-ml portions. The fractions with exo-β-1,3-galactanaseactivity (fraction tubes 5–9) were combined and dialyzed againstdeionized water. The final preparation thus obtained was used as purifiedenzyme. The purification procedure was performed in triplicate. PcCBM6 was purified from the culture supernatant of P. pastoristransformant KM71H/PcCBM6 using a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (AmershamBiosciences) column (5 × 50 mm). The supernatant was dialyzed against 20mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and applied to the column at a flowrate of 1 ml/min, and the eluate was fractionated into 1-ml portions. PcCBM6was eluted in the unadsorbed fractions. The purity of PcCBM6 was determined bySDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing pure PcCBM6 were combined and dialyzedagainst deionized water. The final preparation thus obtained was used aspurified PcCBM6. Enzyme Assay and Measurement of Protein—Activity ofexo-β-1,3-galactanase was determined by the Somogyi-Nelson method(14Somogyi N. J. Biol.Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtureconsists of 20 μl of McIlvaine buffer (0.2 mNa2HPO4, 0.1 m citric acid), pH 4.5, and 25μl of 1% (w/v) β-1,3-galactan. After 5 min of preincubation at 37°C, 5 μl of enzyme was added to the solution, and the mixture wasincubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by heating at100 °C for 5 min (standard condition). One unit of enzyme activity isdefined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol of galactose/min.Protein amounts of the enzyme were measured using the BCA protein assayreagent kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Enzymic Properties—The effects of pH on the activity andstability of Pc1,3Gal43A were investigated with a series of glycine HClbuffers from pH 2.0 to 2.6, McIlvaine buffers from pH 2.6 to 7.6, andAtkins-Pantin buffers (0.2 m boric acid, 0.2 m KCl, 0.2m Na2CO3) from pH 7.6 to 11.0. The activityof the exo-β-1,3-galactanase was assayed under the standard conditionsdescribed above. For determination of the pH stability of Pc1,3Gal43A, theenzyme was preincubated at various pH values with 0.1% (w/v) BSA in theabsence of substrate at 30 °C for 1 h, and the residual activity wasassayed under the standard conditions. The effect of temperature on theactivity of Pc1,3Gal43A was determined by incubation at differenttemperatures. With the exception of temperature, the assay conditions were thesame as described for the standard method. For the temperature stabilitymeasurement of Pc1,3Gal43A, the enzyme was preincubated at varioustemperatures at pH 4.5 with 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h, and the residual activitywas determined under the standard conditions. Substrate Specificity—The substrate specificity ofPc1,3Gal43A toward various pNP-glycosides was determined. Each assay mixturecontained 25 μl of a 2 mm pNP-glycoside solution, 20 μl ofMcIlvaine buffer, pH 4.5, and 5 μl of enzyme solution. The reactions wereperformed at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by adding 100 μl of 0.2m Na2CO3. The amount of pNP released wascalculated from the absorbance at 400 nm. The substrate specificity of Pc1,3Gal43A toward polysaccharides wasdetermined using β-1,3-galactan, gum arabic, larch arabinogalactan,debranched arabinan, arabinan, soluble oat spelt xylan, soluble birchwoodxylan, pectic galactan, lupin galactan, CM-curdlan, laminarin,β-1,3-β-1,6-galactan, and native andα-l-arabinofuranosidase-treated AGPs from radish assubstrates. The reactions were performed in McIlvaine buffer, pH 4.5,containing 0.5% (w/v) substrate and 6.9 nm enzyme. The substrate specificity of Pc1,3Gal43A toward oligosaccharides wasdetermined using β-1,3-, β-1,4-, and β-1,6-linked galactosyloligosaccharides, β-1,3-galactosyl galactosaminide, β-1,3-galactosylglucosaminide, and β-1,3-galactosyl l-arabinofuranoside as thesubstrate. The reactions were performed in the same buffer, containing 5mm substrate and 23 nm enzyme. After incubation at 37°C for the appropriate reaction time, the activity was determined by theSomogyi-Nelson method(14Somogyi N. J. Biol.Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of Pc1,3Gal43A toward β-1,3-galactan weredetermined. The reactions were performed in McIlvaine buffer, pH 4.5,containing 0.1–0.8% (w/v) substrates and 6.9 nm enzyme at 37°C. The reducing power of released galactose was determined by theSomogyi-Nelson method (14Somogyi N. J. Biol.Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The molecular weight of β-1,3-galactan was estimated as follows.Trifluoroacetic acid (2 m) was added to β-1,3-galactan andheated at 121 °C for 1 h. The 2 m trifluoroacetic acid wasevaporated under a stream of air. Then isopropyl alcohol was added andevaporated to remove the trifluoroacetic acid completely. The reducing powerwas compared between untreated and trifluoroacetic acid-treatedβ-1,3-galactans, and the degree of polymerization (dp) of galactose wascalculated. The value (dp 50) was used to determine kcatfor β-1,3-galactan. To evaluate the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme towardβ-1,3-galacto-oligosaccharides such as β-1,3-galactobiose,β-1,3-galactotriose, methyl β-1,3-galactotetraoside, and methylβ-1,3-galactopentaoside, 1.6–1.8 nm enzyme was incubatedwith 10 μm substrate in McIlvaine buffer, pH 4.5, for up to 120min at 37 °C. At regular intervals, a 100-μl aliquot of the reactionmixture was taken, and the reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °Cfor 5 min. The samples were quantified by high performance anion-exchangechromatography with a pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) system usingl-fucose as an internal standard. The samples were analyzed using aCarboPac™ PA1 column (4 × 250 mm, Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA)eluted with 0.1 m NaOH (0–5 min), followed by a lineargradient (5–20 min) of sodium acetate (0–0.1 m) at aflow rate of 1 ml/min. The reaction curves of galacto-oligosaccharides wereused to determine the kcat/Km of thereaction by applying the following equation as described by Matsui etal. (15Matsui I. Ishikawa K. Matsui E. Miyairi S. Fukui S. Honda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar),k·t=ln([S0]/[St])(Eq. 1) where k = (kcat/Km)[E], t represents time, and [S0] and[St] represent substrate concentrations at time 0 andt, respectively. This relationship is only valid when [E]<< [S] << Km. For the hydrolysis of β-1,3-galactotriose and methylβ-1,3-galactopentaoside, the reactions were performed in McIlvainebuffer, pH 4.5, containing 5 mm substrate and 6.9 nmenzyme. For the hydrolysis of β-1,3-galactan, gum arabic after twicerepeated Smith degradation, andα-l-arabinofuranosidase-treated radish root AGP byPc1,3Gal43A, the reactions were performed in same buffer, containing 0.5%(w/v) substrate, and 6.9 nm enzyme, for up to 3 h at 37 °C. Atregular intervals, a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken, andthe reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The sampleswere analyzed by HPAEC-PAD as described above. Affinity Gel Electrophoresis and Frontal Affinity Chromatography(FAC)—The affinity of PcCBM6 for a range of soluble polysaccharideswas determined by affinity gel electrophoresis. The method was essentially asdescribed by Tomme et al.(16Tomme P. Boraston A. Kormos J.M. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 27: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), using polysaccharideligands. Affinity electrophoresis was carried out for 1 h using native 7%(w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.3% (w/v) various polysaccharides. BSAwas used as the nonbinding negative control. The affinity of PcCBM6 for a range of oligosaccharides was determined byFAC. The method was essentially as described by Hirabayashi et al.(17Hirabayashi J. Arata Y. Kasai K. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,18Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E. Yagi F.

PA-lactose(Gal-β-1,4-Glc), PA-Gb3 (Gal-α-1,4-Gal-β-1,4-Glc), PA-GA1(Gal-β-1,3-GalNAc-β-1,4-Gal-β-1,4-Glc), PA-LNT(Gal-β-1,3-GlcNAc-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Glc), PA-LNnT(Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Glc), PA-Galilipentasaccharide(Gal-α-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Glc), andPA-rhamnose were purchased from TaKaRa (Kyoto, Japan). Nonlabeled βGalLac(Gal-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Glc) and βGal2Lac(Gal-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Glc) were gifts from Dr. T.Urashima (Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine) and werelabeled with PA using GlycoTAG (TaKaRa). The total amount of immobilized PcCBM6 in the column,Bt was first determined with β1,3Gal3-ABEE(Gal-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,3-Gal-p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester)using the equation described previously,[A]0·(Vf−V0)=Bt−Kd·(Vf−V0)(Eq. 2) where Kd is the dissociation constant between interactingbiomolecules, Bt is the total amount of immobilizedligand, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the PA-oligosaccharideof interest (A), Vf is the elution volume of A, andV0 is the elution volume of PA-rhamnose, which has noaffinity for PcCBM6. In the assays employed in this study, [A]0,the initial concentration of the PA-oligosaccharides, was 10 nm,which is negligibly small compared with Kd. Thus,Vf approached the maximum value, Vf,which is independent of [A]0, and so we used the following equationto obtain the values of Kd of PcCBM6 toward terminalgalactose-containing oligosaccharide derivatives.Kd=Bt/(Vf−V0)(Eq. 3) Nucleotide Sequence of theExo-β-1,3-galactanase—Although exo-β-1,3-galactanase hasbeen purified from I. lacteus and A. niger, no informationis available about the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. Therefore,exo-β-1,3-galactanase was purified from I. lacteus, andN-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were determined. Based on thesepartial amino acid sequences of Il1,3Gal(Fig. 1A,underlined), full-length cDNA for Pc1,3Gal43A was isolated by reversetranscription PCR. The sequence, with the deduced amino acid sequence, isshown in Fig. 1A. ThecDNA sequence contained an open reading frame (1,344 bp) encoding a 448-aminoacid protein (Fig.1A). The sequence contained a putative signal sequence(20 amino acid residues) preceding the putative mature enzyme (428 aminoacids, molecular mass of 45.632 kDa). Three putative N-glycosylationsites were found in the deduced protein sequence(Fig. 1A, doubleunderlined). The deduced amino acid sequence of Pc1,3Gal43A was comparedwith sequences in the protein and nucleic acid data base BLAST (NationalCenter for Biotechnology Information,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).Pc1,3Gal43A resembled the following hypothetical proteins, in order ofdecreasing similarity: hypothetical protein FG11366.1 from Gibberellazeae PH-1 (GenBank accession number XP_391542.1), hypothetical proteinMG03844 from Magnaporthe grisea 70–15 (accession numberXP_361370.1), hypothetical protein from Neurospora crassa (accessionnumber XP_327147.1), hypothetical protein AN7313.2 from Aspergillusnidulans FGSC A4 (accession number XP_411450.1). Pc1,3Gal43A also sharedlow similarity with the following GH family 43 enzymes: β-xylosidase fromClostridium stercorarium (21.3%, accession number BAC87941.1),α-l-arabinofuranosidase from Streptomyceschartreusis (19.4%, accession number BAA90772), endo-β-1,4-xylanasefrom Paenibacillus polymyxa (19.3%, accession number CAA40378), andendo-α-l-1,5-arabinanase from Cellvibrio japonicus(17.6%, accession number CAA71485), suggesting that Pc1,3Gal43A is a distantlyrelated to GH43. The BLAST search of Pc1,3Gal43A also revealed that the enzymehas a C-terminal region (from 289 to 448) with similarity to CBM6(Fig. 1C). Three putative GH43 enzymes, gx.41.43.1, pc.158.1.1, and pc.71.18.1, wereidentified in the P. chrysosporium genome(19Martinez D. Larrondo L.F. Putnam N. Gelpke M.D. Huang K. Chapman J. Helfenbein K.G. Ramaiya P. Detter J.C. Larimer F. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Berka R. Cullen D. Rokhsar D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The sequence ofPc1,3Gal43A corresponded to that of pc.71.18.1, and the deduced amino acidsequence of Pc1,3Gal43A shared 43.5% similarity with gx.41.43.1 and 66.7% withpc.158.1.1. BLAST searches of gx.41.43.1 and pc.158.1.1 suggested that thesesequences probably encode putative β-xylosidase and endoarabinanase,respectively. Expression of Recombinant Exo-β-1,3-galactanase—ThecDNA fragment encoding the mature enzyme of Pc1,3Gal43A was amplified by PCRand then subcloned into the expression vector pPICZαA to obtainpPICZαA/Pc1,3Gal43A. The recombinant protein was expressed in P.pastoris strain KM71H as a secreted form with the aid of α-factor,which is a secretion signal of yeast. The crude enzyme showed activity towardβ-1,3-galactan, and the recombinant enzyme was purified from culturesupernatant of P. pastoris. The purification of recombinantPc1,3Gal43A is summarized in TableI. Approximately 300 mg/liter recombinant enzyme was expressed.The purified Pc1,3Gal43A gave a single band on SDS-PAGE when visualized bystaining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250(Fig. 2A). Themolecular mass of Pc1,3Gal43A was estimated to be 55 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Thespecific activity of the recombinant enzyme was 99.8 units/mg, which issomewhat higher than that of purified Il1,3Gal (87.8 units/mg)(7Tsumuraya Y. Mochizuki N. Hashimoto Y. Kováč P. J.

Thus far, there has been no information about the critical amino acids of the CRHs or the role of the D1 domains of IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 in binding to IL-13. In this study, we first built the homology modeling of the IL-13·hIL-13 receptor complexes and then predicted the amino acids involved in binding to IL-13. By incorporating mutations into these amino acids, we identified Tyr-207, Asp-271, Tyr-315, and Asp-318 in the CRH of human IL-13Rα2, and Leu-319 and Tyr-321 in the CRH of human IL-13Rα1, as critical residues for binding to IL-13. Tyr-315 in IL-13Rα2 and Leu-319 in IL-13Rα1 are positionally conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues. Furthermore, by using D1 domain-deleted mutants, we found that the D1 domain is needed for the expression of IL-13Rα2, but not IL-13Rα1, and that the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 is important for binding to IL-13, but not to IL-4.

It is known that IL-13 plays a pivotal role in host defense against parasite infection and in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases (1Izuhara K. Arima K.

IL-13 binds to IL-13Rα1 first with low affinity (Kd = 2-10 nm) and then recruits IL-4Rα to the complex, generating a high affinity receptor (Kd = 0.03-0.4 nm) (4Aman M.J. Tayebi N. Obiri N.I.

IL-13Rα2 is thought to act as a nonsignaling “decoy” receptor because its cytoplasmic tail is short and does not contain any obvious signaling motif (10Bernard J. Treton D. Vermot-Desroches C.

Thus, the two IL-13-binding molecules, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2, have different affinities with IL-13 and opposite roles in signal transduction, which would cooperate with each other in tuning the IL-13 signals in the body. The extracellular domains of all members of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily, including IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2, contain the cytokine receptor homology module (CRH), composed of two fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains (14Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Each domain consists of ∼100 amino acid residues, generating a β-sandwich structure where seven β-strands are arranged in the Greek key topology analogous to an immunoglobulin-constant domain. Four positionally conserved cysteine residues in the first FnIII domain form two disulfide bonds, and a WSXWS sequence locates in the F′-G′ loop in the second FnIII domain, both of which are critical for the receptors to position correctly and bind to ligands (14Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Crystal structural analyses of the ligand-receptor complexes of growth hormone (GH), erythropoietin, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have demonstrated that several loops of the CRHs of these receptors provide binding interfaces composed of hydrophobic and polar amino acids (15Somers W.

The extracellular domains of a subgroup of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily (gp130, G-CSFR, the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α chain, the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), IL-3Rα, and IL-5Rα) possess an extra FnIII domain in addition to the CRH. Although even in these receptors, it has been thought that ligand binding is driven principally by the CRH structure, several lines of evidence have shown that the extra FnIII domains of these receptors are also important for the ligand binding. Involvement of the extra FnIII domains of gp130, G-CSFR, LIFR, and IL-5Rα in binding to the ligands has been verified by biochemical analyses (21Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K.

Furthermore, the x-ray structure of the IL-6·IL-6Rα·gp130 complex shows that the extra FnIII domain of gp130 has a bridging function, interacting with the binding epitope on IL-6 in the opposite trimer, generating the hexametric receptor complex (18Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of human IL-13Rα1 (hIL-13Rα1) and hIL-13Rα2 have ∼33% homology and ∼21% identity (Fig. 1A). Both are composed of three FnIII domains, D1, D2, and D3 (numbering from the N terminus), of which D2 and D3 comprise the CRHs. The most homologous receptor molecules of hIL-13Rα1 and hIL-13Rα2 in their extracellular domains are hIL-5Rα (44% for hIL-13Rα1 and 45% for hIL-13Rα2, respectively). Mutagenesis analyses of IL-13 have been performed extensively, identifying the amino acid residues important for binding to IL-13 receptors (29Thompson J.P. Debinski W. J. Biol.

However, there has been no information about the critical amino acids of the CRHs of IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 for binding to IL-13, and the role of the D1 domain in IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 has been unknown. In this study, we first built the homology modeling of the IL-13·hIL-13 receptor complexes and then identified critical residues in the CRHs of hIL-13Rα1 or hIL-13Rα2 by mutagenesis analyses, based on these models. Furthermore, we analyzed the roles of the D1 domains in IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 in their expression and binding to IL-13 and IL-4. Reagents and Cells—Recombinant human IL-13 was expressed in Escherichia coli transformant-harboring pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) in which the DNA encoding human IL-13 was inserted. The expressed IL-13 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) followed by refolding in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 3 m urea, 30% glycerol, 5 mm cysteine, and 5 mm cystamine for 4 days at 4 °C. IL-13 was further purified by SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and then TSKgel SP5-PW column chromatography (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Detailed expression results of human IL-13 will be published elsewhere. 2E. Honjo, unpublished data. Recombinant human IL-4 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). A human Burkitt's B-lymphoma cell line, DND-39, and DND-39 cells transfected with the germ line ϵ promoter-luciferase gene (DND-39/Gϵ cells) were prepared and cultured, as described before (32Umeshita-Suyama R.

HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin G. Plasmids and Transfection—Plasmids encoding wild types of hIL-13Rα1 (pIRES1hyg-FLAG-hIL-13Rα1) and hIL-13Rα2 (pIRESneo2-HA-hIL-13Rα2) were prepared as described previously (32Umeshita-Suyama R.

The FLAG and HA sequences were attached to the N termini of the D1 regions of hIL-13Rα1 and hIL-13Rα2 cDNA, respectively. The mutated types of IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 were generated by the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or the modified inverse PCR method using mutation-incorporated oligonucleotides as the primers and pIRES1hyg-FLAG-hIL-13Rα1 and pIRESneo2-HA-hIL-13Rα2 as the templates. The plasmids were transfected into DND-39 cells by electroporation. Stable transfected cells were maintained with the culture medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for the hIL-13Rα1 mutants or 1.25 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) for the hIL-13Rα2 mutants, respectively. Expression of the receptors was confirmed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibre, BD Biosciences) using anti-FLAG anti-bodies (Abs, Sigma) for the IL-13Rα1 mutants and anti-HA Abs (Sigma) for the IL-13Rα2 mutants. Transient transfection of the plasmids into HEK 293T cells was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence Alignment and Homology Model Building—Alignment of the amino acid sequences of hIL-13Rα2 and hIL-13Rα1 without signal peptides (1 to 26, and 1 to 22, respectively) and prediction of FnIII domains (D1, D2, and D3), the transmembrane regions, and several β-strand sequences of the D2 and D3 domains of both receptors were executed through the MyHits data base (34Pagni M. Ioannidis V. Cerutti L. Zahn-Zabal M. Jongeneel C.V. Falquet L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The sequence alignments of extracellular portions of human prolactin (PRL) receptor-hIL-13Rα2 and human gp130-hIL-13Rα1 were performed by FUGUE (35Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) with slight manual modification based on experimental results. The complex structure of IL-13 and the D2 and D3 domains of hIL-13Rα2 was modeled based on the crystal structure of the GH·PRLR complex (PDB code 1BP3). The hIL-13Rα1 was modeled from the crystal structure of the viral IL-6·gp130 complex (PDB code 1I1R), and the resulting structure was overlaid onto the IL-13·hIL-13Rα2 complex structure model. Homology modelings of hIL-13Rα2 and hIL-13Rα1 were generated with MODELLER6v2 (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10514) Google Scholar) followed by energy minimization and simulated annealing with Amber. The figures were drawn with DS Viewer Pro 5.0 (Accerlys, CA). 125I-IL-13 Binding Assay—Iodination of IL-13 and the binding assay were performed as described previously (33Arima K. Umeshita-Suyama R. Sakata Y. Akaiwa M. Mao X.Q. Enomoto T. Dake Y. Shimazu S. Yamashita T. Sugawara N. Brodeur S. Geha R. Puri R.K. Sayegh M.H. Adra C.N. Hamasaki N. Hopkin J.M. Shirakawa T. Izuhara K. J. Allergy Clin.

In brief, 1 μg of IL-13 and 1 mCi of Na125I in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were incubated in a microcentrifuge tube coated with 2 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce) at 4 °C for 10 min. Radiolabeled IL-13 was purified by a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. The concentration of 125I-IL-13 was quantified by self-displacement of IL-13Rα2-expressing DND-39 cells. After cells were incubated with various concentrations of 125I-IL-13 at 4 °C for 2 h, bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation through an oil gradient, and their radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined by counts in the presence of 100-fold unlabeled IL-13. The dissociation constants (Kd) were determined from specific binding data by using the program GraphPad Prism Version 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). Luciferase Assay—The luciferase assay was performed as described previously (33Arima K. Umeshita-Suyama R. Sakata Y. Akaiwa M. Mao X.Q. Enomoto T. Dake Y. Shimazu S. Yamashita T. Sugawara N. Brodeur S. Geha R. Puri R.K. Sayegh M.H. Adra C.N. Hamasaki N. Hopkin J.M. Shirakawa T. Izuhara K. J. Allergy Clin.

DND-39/Gϵ cells transfected with the mutated hIL-13Rα1 were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and then total cell lysates were applied to the Picagene Dual Luciferase assay kit (Toyo, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with various types of pIRES1hyg-FLAG-hIL-13Rα1, pME18S-STAT6, and pGL3-N4x8 (kind gifts of Dr. T. Sugahara, Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp., Fuji, Japan). pGL3-N4x8 has the eight tandem-lined STAT6-responsible element (TTCNNNNGAA), as a promoter sequence of the firefly luciferase gene. The Renilla luciferase reporter gene (phRL-Tk; Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control. 24 h after transfection, HEK 293T cells were detached by phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and reseeded. Adhered HEK 293T cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13 for 16 h, followed by washing once by phosphate-buffered saline, and total cell lysates were applied to the Picagene Dual Luciferase assay kit. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—The procedures of Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (37Izuhara K. Heike T. Otsuka T. Yamaoka K. Mayumi M. Imamura T. Niho Y. Harada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 619-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DND-39 cells stably transfected with various kinds of IL-13Rα1 were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-4 or IL-13 at 37 °C for 10 min. The solubilized lysates or the immunoprecipitates from the lysates with anti-TYK2 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with either anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma), anti-HA Ab (Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosyl STAT6 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-STAT6 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-TYK2 Ab, followed by incubation with secondary Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The signals were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and LAS-1000PLUS (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Homology Modeling of the IL-13·hIL-13Rα2 Complex—In IL-13R, IL-13 binds to IL-13Rα1 primarily, and this complex is further stabilized by recruiting IL-4Rα, forming at least a trimer structure of ligand-receptor complex (4Aman M.J.

In contrast, IL-13Rα2 is likely to form a 1:1 complex with IL-13, which is easy to be modeled (11Yasunaga S. Yuyama N. Arima K. Tanaka H. Toda S. Maeda M. Matsui K. Goda C. Yang Q. Sugita Y. Nagai H. Izuhara K. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Feng N. Lugli S.M. Schnyder B. Gauchat J. Graber P. Schlagenhauf E. Schnarr B. Wiederkehr-Adam M. Duschl A. Heim M.H. Lutz R.A. Moser R. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 591-602PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we first built the homology modeling of the IL-13·hIL-13Rα2 complex. Because no structural information was available for the IL-13 receptors, the model was built based on the x-ray structure of the GH·PRLR 1:1 complex (PDB code 1BP3) as a template. Because PRLR does not contain an extra FnIII domain, we built the model as for the D2 and D3 domains of hIL-13Rα2, predicting that amino acids within the CRH of hIL-13Rα2 would interact with IL-13 (Fig. 2A). In this model, it was assumed that the E-F loop, the B′-C′ loop, and the F′-G′ loop of hIL-13Rα2 are composed of Leu-202 to Lys-208, Ser-259 to Arg-268, Asn-313 to Lys-328 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, it was predicted that Tyr-207 in the E-F loop and Tyr-315 and Asp-318 in the F′-G′ loop of hIL-13Rα2 would be exposed to the binding interface (Figs. 1A and 2A). It is of note that Tyr-207 in the E-F loop of hIL-13Rα2 corresponds to Trp-72 of PRLR, Trp-104 of GHR, Phe-169 of gp130, and Phe-93 of the erythropoietin receptor, known as a “hot spot” of the ligand binding (Refs. 15Somers W.

Identification of Critical Residues of the D2 and D3 Domains of hIL-13Rα2 for Binding to IL-13—To address the importance of the amino acids in the D2 and D3 domains of hIL-13Rα2, predicted based on the homology modeling for binding of IL-13, we generated several kinds of hIL-13Rα2 mutated in these amino acids and analyzed their binding affinity for IL-13. We first analyzed the mutated hIL-13Rα2 in which Tyr-207, Asp-271, Tyr-315, and Asp-318 were replaced with Ala (4A-mut, Fig. 3A). In the modeling, Asp-271 on the strand C′ was assumed to locate close to Asp-318 (Fig. 2A). When 4A-mut was transfected into DND-39 cells, although the expression level of the receptor on the cell surface was invariable with that of the wild type of hIL-13Rα2 (Fig. 3B), no binding activity was detected (Fig. 3, A and C), demonstrating the critical roles of these four amino acids in binding to IL-13. To delineate the contribution of each of these four residues in binding to IL-13, we next analyzed the mutants in which Tyr-207, Asp-271, Tyr-315, or Asp-318 was replaced with Ala (Fig. 3A). When any of these four amino acids was mutated with Ala, the affinity of the mutated hIL-13Rα2 was significantly decreased. Expression of these four single mutated hIL-13Rα2 on the cell surface was invariable with the wild type (Fig. 3B). When Asp-318 was replaced with Ala together with Asp-271, the affinity was lowered more than in the single exchange of Asp-271 or Asp-318 (Fig. 3A). The replacement of amino acids that were either adjacent or close to these four critical amino acids (Asp-206, Ala-267, Arg-268, Ser-317, and Asp-319) affected the affinity with IL-13 (Fig. 3A). Double mutations of Glu-289 and Glu-291 with Ala, but not with Gln, slightly decreased the affinity, indicating that a hydrogen bond may be formed between Glu-289 and/or Glu-291 and IL-13. These results coincided with the molecular model in that the E-F loop and the F′-G′ loop of hIL-13Rα2 generates the main binding surface to IL-13 and that the critical amino acids in these loops (Tyr-207, Asp-271, Tyr-315, and Asp-318) are involved in comprising the binding interface at focal contacts. Particularly, it turned out that Tyr-207 is a hot spot for the ligand binding as well as Trp-72 of PRLR, Trp-104 of GHR, Phe-169 of gp130, and Phe-93 of the erythropoietin receptor. Although Asp-271 in the B′-C′ loop is not exposed to the main binding interface, this amino acid would act cooperatively with Asp-318 for the binding. Critical Role of the D1 Domain of hIL-13Rα2 in Its Expression—We next analyzed the functional role of the D1 domains of hIL-13Rα2, which could not be modeled because of a lack of information about homologous structure. For this purpose, we generated a truncated type of hIL-13Rα2 lacking its D1 domain (hIL-13Rα2ΔD1, Fig. 4A). When hIL-13Rα2ΔD1 was transfected in HEK 293T cells, its expression was not detected by either Western blotting or flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4, B and C). These results showed that the D1 domain of hIL-13Rα2 is critical for its expression. Homology Modeling of the IL-13·hIL-13Rα1 Complex—Because the extracellular portions of IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 are homologous (Fig. 1A; ∼33%) and several common amino acids in α-helix D of IL-13 are important for binding to both receptors (30Madhankumar A.B. Mintz A. Debinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43194-43205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is reasoned that amino acid residues involved in IL-13 binding are topologically conserved between these two receptors. We built a homology model of the IL-13·hIL-13Rα1 complex using the x-ray structures of the viral IL-6·gp130 complex (PDB code 1I1R) and the IL-13·hIL-13Rα2 modeling as templates (Fig. 2B). In this model, it was assumed that the E-F loop, the B′-C′ loop, and the F′-G′ loop are composed of Thr-190 to Glu-198, Glu-248 to Arg-256, and Asn-317 to Glu-333 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, it was predicted that Phe-197 in the E-F loop would correspond to Tyr-207 of hIL-13Rα2 and that Leu-319 and Asp-323 in the F′-G′ loop would correspond to Tyr-315 and Asp-318 of hIL-13Rα2, respectively (Fig. 1A). The E-F loop of hIL-13Rα1 was two residues longer than that of hIL-13Rα2, and Ser-195 to Ser-196 was assumed to be the unique sequence to hIL-13Rα1 because no amino acid in hIL-13Rα2 correspond"

SERT was readily detected in derived B cell lines with origins as diverse as B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Concentration and timecourse kinetics for the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of the amphetamine derivatives fenfluramine (an appetite suppressant) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy"") revealed them as being similar to the endogenous indoleamine. A tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine, instead mirrored the behavior of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, both being effective in the low micromolar range. A majority of neoplastic clones were sensitive to one or more of the serotonergic compounds. Dysregulated bcl-2 expression, either by t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation or its introduction as a constitutively active transgene, provided protection from proapoptotic but not antiproliferative outcomes. These data indicate a potential for SERT as a novel anti-tumor target for amphetamine analogs, while evidence is presented that the seemingly more promising antidepressants are likely impacting malignant B cells independently of the transporter itself."
https://openalex.org/W1995884875,"To acquire information on signal alteration corresponding to the changes in metastatic potential, we analysed protein tyrosine phosphorylation of low- and high-metastatic human osteosarcoma HuO9 sublines, which were recently established as the first metastatic model of human osteosarcoma. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins around 60, 70, and 120–130 kDa was enhanced in high-metastatic sublines. Among these proteins, the protein around 70 kDa, which was most remarkably phosphorylated, was identified as paxillin, a scaffold protein in integrin signaling. Activity of Src family kinase correlated well with metastatic potential, and a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, not only abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin but also impaired the motility of high-metastatic sublines. The expression of paxillin was also elevated in high-metastatic sublines, and knocking down of paxillin expression by RNAi method resulted in attenuated motility of high-metastatic cells. We also demonstrated that the phosphorylated form of paxillin is essential for the migration-promoting effect in human osteosarcoma. These findings suggest that enhanced activity of Src family kinases and overexpression of paxillin synergistically contribute to the high metastatic potential of human osteosarcoma through the hyperphosphorylation of paxillin."

In Vitro Transcription and Expression in XenopusOocytes—hCNT3 plasmid DNA was linearized with NheI and transcribedwith T7 polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ (Ambion, Austin, TX)transcription system. The remaining template was removed by digestion withRNase-free DNase1. Stages V–VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis weretreated with collagenase (2 mg/ml) for 2 h, and remaining follicular layerswere removed by phosphate treatment (100 mmK2PO4) and manual defolliculation(11Huang Q.Q.

Twenty-four hours afterdefolliculation, oocytes were injected with either 10 nl of water containing10 ng of RNA transcript encoding hCNT3 or 10 nl of water alone. Injectedoocytes were then incubated for either 4 days (radioisotope flux studies) or4–7 days (electrophysiology) at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution(changed daily) (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate,0.05 mg/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.5). Transport Media—Unless otherwise stated,electrophysiological and radioisotope flux studies usedNa+-containing transport medium composed of 100 mm NaCl,2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mmMgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes (for pH values ≤ 6.5) or 10mm MES (for pH values ≤ 6.5). In experiments examining theNa+ dependence of transport (i.e. where the indicatedNa+ concentration is <100 mm), Na+ in thetransport medium was replaced by equimolar choline chloride (ChCl) to maintainisomolarity. Proton dependence was tested in Na+-freecholine-containing transport medium (100 mm ChCl) at pH valuesranging from 4.5 to 8.5. Experiments testing Li+ coupling oftransport were performed in medium at pH 8.5 containing Li+ (100mm LiCl) in place of Na+. Electrophysiological Studies—Nucleoside-evoked membranecurrents were measured in hCNT3-producing oocytes at room temperature (20°C) using a GeneClamp 500B oocyte clamp (Axon Instruments Inc., FosterCity, CA) in the two-electrode, voltage clamp mode. The GeneClamp 500B wasinterfaced to an IBM-compatible PC via a Digidata 1200A/D converter andcontrolled by pCLAMP software (version 8.0, Axon Instruments Inc.). Themicroelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances thatranged from 0.5 to 2.5 megohms. Oocytes were penetrated with themicroelectrodes, and their membrane potentials were monitored for periods of10–15 min. Oocytes were discarded when membrane potentials wereunstable, or more positive than –30 mV. Unless otherwise indicated, theoocyte membrane potential was clamped at a holding potential(Vh) of –50 mV, and nucleoside was added in theappropriate transport medium at a concentration of 100 μm.Current signals were filtered at 20 Hz (four-pole Bessel filter) and sampledat a sampling interval of 20 ms. For data presentation, the signals werefurther filtered at 0.5 Hz by the pCLAMP program suite. In protonophore studies, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone(CCCP) (100 μm) was preincubated with oocytes for 15 min priorto measuring uridine-evoked currents (100 μm) inNa+-free medium (100 mm ChCl, pH 5.5). Stock solutionsof CCCP were dissolved in Me2SO. Control experiments confirmed thatoocytes were unaffected by Me2SO at its final concentration of 0.5%(w/v). Current-voltage (I-V) curves were determined from differences insteady-state currents generated in the presence and absence of substrateduring 300-ms voltage pulses to potentials between +60 and –110 mV(10-mV steps). For I-V relations, currents were filtered at 2 kHz (four-poleBessel filter) and sampled at a rate of 200 μs/point (corresponding to asampling frequency of 5 kHz). Data from individual electrophysiology experiments are presented asnucleoside-evoked currents from single representative cells or as mean values(±S.E.) from four or more oocytes from the same batch of oocytes usedon the same day. Each experiment was repeated at least twice on oocytes fromdifferent frogs. No nucleoside-evoked currents were detected in oocytesinjected with water alone, demonstrating that currents in hCNT3-producingoocytes were transporter-specific. Radioisotope Flux Studies—Radioisotope transport assays wereperformed as described previously(11Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J.

Unless otherwise stated,nucleoside uptake was determined at a concentration of 20 μm.Following incubation, seven rapid washes in ice-cold choline chloridetransport medium (pH 7.5) removed extracellular label, and individual oocyteswere dissolved in 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of cell-associatedradioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6000 IC, Beckman,Fullerton, CA). Uptake values represent initial rates of transport (1-minflux) and are presented as means ± S.E. of 10–12 oocytes fromrepresentative experiments. Individual experiments were performed on cellsfrom single batches of oocytes used on the same day. Transporter-mediatedfluxes were calculated as uptake in RNA transcript-injected oocytesminus uptake in control water-injected oocytes. Each experiment wasrepeated at least twice using oocytes from different frogs. Kinetic Parameters—Kinetic parameters calculated fromelectrophysiological and radioisotope flux experiments were determined byleast squares fits to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using Sigmaplot2000 software (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Those fromelectrophysiological experiments were determined from fits to data fromindividual oocytes normalized to the Imax value obtainedfor that oocyte, and are presented as values (±S.E.) for singlerepresentative oocytes, or as means (±S.E.) of four or more cells.Those from radioisotope experiments were derived from curve fits to averagedmediated data from 10–12 oocytes, and are presented as means(±S.E.). Charge-to-Nucleoside Stoichiometry—Na+/nucleosideand H+/nucleoside coupling ratios for hCNT3 were determined bysimultaneously measuring Na+ or H+ currents and[14C]uridine (200 μm, 1 μCi/ml) uptake undervoltage clamp conditions. Individual hCNT3-producing oocytes were placed in aperfusion chamber and voltage clamped at Vh of –30,–50, or –90 mV in the appropriate nucleoside-free medium for a10-min period to monitor baseline currents. When the baseline was stable, thenucleoside-free medium was exchanged with medium of the same compositioncontaining radiolabeled uridine. Current was measured for 3 min, and uptake ofuridine was terminated by washing the oocyte with nucleoside-free medium untilthe current returned to baseline. The oocyte was then transferred to ascintillation vial and solubilized with 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation ofoocyte-associated radioactivity. Nucleoside-induced current was obtained asthe difference between baseline current and the inward uridine current. Thetotal charge translocated into the oocyte during the uptake period wascalculated from the current-time integral and correlated with the measuredradiolabeled flux for each oocyte to determine the charge/uptake ratio. Basal[14C]uridine uptake was determined in control water-injectedoocytes (from the same donor frog) under equivalent conditions and used tocorrect for endogenous non-mediated uridine uptake over the same incubationperiod. Coupling ratios (±S.E.) were calculated from slopes ofleast-squares fits of uridine-dependent charge versus uridineaccumulation for eight or more oocytes. Charge-to-Na+Stoichiometry—hCNT3-mediated uptake of22Na+ was optimized for specific activity and transportrate by using a saturating concentration of uridine (200 μm) anda 22Na+ concentration of 1 mm, a value closeto the K50 for Na+. Individual hCNT3-producingoocytes were voltage clamped at –90 mV and perfused withNa+-free medium (100 mm ChCl, pH 8.5). A stable baselinecurrent was recorded, and the bath solution was changed for 3 min to onecontaining 200 μm uridine, 1 mm22Na+ (1 μCi/ml), and 99 mm ChCl (pH 8.5).The solution was changed back to uridine- and Na+-free medium untilthe current returned to baseline. The oocyte was then transferred to ascintillation vial and solubilized with 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation ofoocyteassociated radioactivity. Testing of each individual hCNT3-producingoocyte prior to addition of uridine and 22Na+ showed noshift in the baseline current when the composition of the bath solution waschanged from 100 mm ChCl to 1 mm NaCl plus 99mm ChCl, indicating an absence of detectable hCNT3 Na+slippage under the experimental conditions used. Similarly, basal22Na+ uptake in control water-injected oocytes (from thesame donor frog) was determined under equivalent conditions over the sameincubation period and used to correct for endogenous non-mediatedNa+ uptake. For each hCNT3-producing oocyte, the total chargetranslocated during the uptake period was calculated from the current-timeintegral and correlated with the measured 22Na+ flux todetermine charge/uptake ratio. The charge-to-Na+ stoichiometry(±S.E.) was calculated from the slope of a least-squares fit ofuridine-dependent charge versus 22Na+accumulation for five oocytes.

Cation Dependence of hCNT3—We have previously usedheterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes in combination withradioisotope flux assays and the two-microelectrode voltage clamp todemonstrate that recombinant hCNT3 functions as a broad specificitycib-type electrogenic Na+/nucleoside symporter(18Ritzel M.W.L.

The experiment ofFig. 1 extended these findingsand demonstrated the effect of an imposed H+ gradient on theinitial rate of hCNT3-mediated uptake (influx) of [14C]uridine (20μm) measured at extracellular pH values ranging from 5.5 to 8.5under Na+-free conditions. Choline (Ch+) was substitutedfor Na+, and values were corrected for basal non-mediated uptake incontrol water-injected oocytes (<0.03pmol/oocyte·min–1 under all conditions tested). Amarked pH dependence of uridine influx was apparent. In 100 mm ChClat pH 5.5, for example, hCNT3-mediated uridine influx was 26- fold higher thanat pH 8.5, and was ∼60% of that obtained in the presence of 100mm NaCl at pH 7.5. In the absence of either H+ orNa+, hCNT3 also exhibited Li+-dependent uridine influx(100 mm LiCl, pH 8.5, versus 100 mm ChCl, pH8.5). In marked contrast, hCNT1 and hCNT2, the two other human CNT isoforms,showed no pH-dependent uridine uptake and exhibited very smallLi+-mediated uridine influx (≤2% of the correspondingNa+-mediated uridine flux; data not shown). As illustrated inFig. 2, the novel H+and Li+ dependence of hCNT3 were further investigated byelectrophysiology. External application of 100 μm uridine to arepresentative hCNT3-producing oocyte clamped at –50 mV underNa+-free conditions elicited inward H+ andLi+ currents that returned to baseline upon removal of substrate(Fig. 2A).

Although JMJ has been suggested to play a role in cell growth, the molecular mechanisms have not been resolved. The present data demonstrate that JMJ interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), one of the master regulatory genes of cell cycle. JMJ potentiates the repression function of Rb on E2F activities, leading to reduced cell cycle progression. The transcriptional repression domain of JMJ is critical for the interaction with Rb as well as repression of cell cycle. The physiological relevance of the association between Rb and JMJ was assessed in cardiomyocytes. Primary cardiomyocytes cultured from homozygous jmj knock-out mouse embryos (jmj mutants) show increased cell mitosis in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner. Reporter gene analyses demonstrate that promoter activities of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and Cdc2 are up-regulated in jmj mutant cardiomyocytes. These data suggest that JMJ down-regulates the cell growth via interaction with Rb, which would provide important insights into the cardiac defects observed in jmj mutant mice.

Homozygous jmj knock-out mice (hereafter referred to as jmj mutants) displayed severe cardiac morphological defects and altered heart-specific gene expression (for review, see Ref. 3Jung J. Mysliwiec M.R. Lee Y. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The jumonji protein (JMJ) is a member of the JMJ transcription factor family and belongs to an AT-rich interaction domain transcriptional factor family (4Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W.

Sci. 2000; 25: 294-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In vitro analyses on structural and functional relationships revealed that JMJ contains distinct functional domains for transcriptional repression, DNA binding, and nuclear localization (7Kim T.G. Kraus J.C. Chen J. Lee Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42247-42255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that JMJ represses the expression of cardiac-specific genes such as the atrial natriuretic factor gene through inhibiting Nkx2.5 and GATA4 activities that are important cardiac-restricted transcription factors (8Kim T.G. Chen J. Sadoshima J. Lee Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10151-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that JMJ employs multiple regulatory mechanisms to regulate the target gene expression. Although the molecular basis of JMJ for transcriptional regulation in the heart is now emerging, the evidence underlying the causes of the cardiac defects observed in jmj mutants is still lacking. JMJ contains the AT-rich interaction domain and jmj-like domain (jmjN/jmjC) that constitutes a jmj family of transcription factors (9Balciunas D. Ronne H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 274-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these domains are also conserved in retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-binding protein 1 (RBP1) and RBP2, which were originally identified as Rb pocket domain-binding proteins (11Defeo-Jones D. Huang P.S. Jones R.E. Haskell K.M. Vuocolo G.A. Hanobik M.G. Huber H.E. Oliff A. Nature. 1991; 352: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Fattaey A.R. Helin K. Dembski M.S. Dyson N.

Rb is known as a key regulator on cell cycle progression and differentiation partly via suppressing E2F activity (13Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 14Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J.

A. 1996; 93: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), suggesting the role of JMJ in the regulation of cell proliferation. The inhibition of E2F activity leads to failure of activation of numerous genes required for S-phase entry or DNA synthesis including c-myc, N-myc, dihydrofolate reductase, and thymidine kinase (16Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell.

In growth-arrested cells, E2F activity is repressed by association with hypophosphorylated Rb. In response to mitogenic stimuli, Rb is phosphorylated at multiple sites by cyclins/cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which releases E2F from Rb, allowing cell cycle progression into late G1- and S-phase. Rb and its relatives, such as p107 and p130, are known to interact with other binding partners through the conserved pocket domain such as E1A (19Dyson N. Guida P. McCall C. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4606-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and HDAC2 (20Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Despite variable phenotypes observed in jmj mutants, partly due to different genetic backgrounds (3Jung J. Mysliwiec M.R. Lee Y. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the role of JMJ in cell proliferation has been also suggested by phenotype analyses. jmj mutant mice with a C57BL/6J × 129SVJ (mixed) genetic background died upon birth and showed cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects, double-outlet right ventricle, and thin ventricular wall at later embryonic stages (2Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These cardiovascular defects mimic human congenital cardiovascular diseases (22Volcik K.A. Zhu H. Finnell R.H. Shaw G.M. Canfield M. Lammer E.J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 126A: 215-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Srivastava D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition to the thin ventricular wall (2Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), jmj mutant embryos with a pure BALB/c background showed deficient cell growth in the liver, thymus, and spleen (24Motoyama J. Kitajima K. Kojima M. Kondo S. Takeuchi T. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting the role of JMJ in facilitating cell proliferation. In contrast, jmj mutant mice with a C3H/He genetic background died at embryonic day (E)11.5, which exhibited hyperplasia and increased cyclin D1 expression in the trabecular layer of the ventricle at E10.5 (25Takeuchi T. Kojima M. Nakajima K. Kondo S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Toyoda M. Shirato H. Nakajima K. Kojima M. Takahashi M. Kubota M. Susuki-Migishima R. Mogegi Y. Yokoyama M. Takeuchi T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which JMJ represses the cyclin D1 promoter activity in the trabeculae remains largely unknown. Formation of the mature four-chambered heart depends on the precise control of cell proliferation, cell migration, differentiation, programmed cell death, and coronary vasculature formation. As heart formation proceeds, cardiomyocyte proliferation is temporally and spatially regulated. In normal mouse embryos at around E9.5, myocardium begins to proliferate and is subdivided into an inner and outer side of the ventricular chamber called the trabecular and compact layer, respectively. Cardiomyocytes at the compact zone proliferate and ingress to form a ventricular septum. From E11.5 to 14.5, cardiomyocytes rapidly proliferate, leading to the expansion of the ventricular wall. Therefore, the compact zone is composed of replicating cardiomyocytes, whereas the forming trabeculae consist of less proliferating cardiomyocytes. During later stages, the proliferation rate gradually declines followed by irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle shortly after birth. In addition to cell cycle regulators, numerous transcription factors have been suggested to play a role in cardiomyocyte proliferation, given that various knock-out mice showed a thin ventricular wall including retinoic acid receptor α, retinoid X receptor α, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, Pax-3, and Fog-2 (27Kastner P.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that JMJ binds to Rb to modulate the Rb function, which may lead to altered cell proliferation as a consequence. Here we demonstrate that JMJ enhances the suppressive function of Rb on E2F activities, which is mediated by interaction between the transcriptional repression (TR) domain of JMJ and the pocket domain of Rb. The lack of JMJ results in up-regulated cell proliferation of cardiomyocytes derived from jmj mutants, probably due to up-regulated promoter activities of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cdc2, which may lead to hyperphosphorylation of Rb. These results suggest that JMJ mediates suppression of the cardiomyocyte proliferation via interaction with Rb, which contribute to a trabecular hyperplasia phenotype of jmj mutant hearts. Plasmids—For expression in mammalian cells, the wild type JMJ and its mutants were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-hisB vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (7Kim T.G. Kraus J.C. Chen J. Lee Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42247-42255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For glutathione S-transferase (GST)-JMJ fusion protein, the bacterial expression vectors encoding JMJ and its mutants were constructed using the pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) and the recombinant proteins were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 or JM109 as described previously (7Kim T.G. Kraus J.C. Chen J. Lee Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42247-42255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged JMJ wild type and the GFP-JMJ mutant encoding amino acids (aa) 1–528 were constructed using the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech). The mammalian expression vector for Rb (pcDNA3-9E10-Rb) was kindly provided by R. Watson (Imperial College School of Medicine) (32Catchpole S. Tavner F. Le Cam L. Sardet C. Watson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39015-39024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and mouse Rb (pRb) (33Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was used for in vitro translation. The bacterial expression vectors for Rb mutants (aa 379–928 and 379–792 fused to GST) were obtained from D. Bader (Vanderbilt University). pCMV-E2F and E2F-dependent reporter plasmid (pAAlucA-Cdc2-luciferase) were from P. Farnham (University of California-Davis) (34Hannink M. Temin H.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1843-1850PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse cyclin D1 (-981 to +35 bp) and cyclin D2 (-880 to +10 bp) promoter regions were cloned into the luciferase plasmid (pGL3). The p21-luciferase reporter plasmid contains the -2327-bp p21 promoter region (35Yu J. Liu X.W. Kim H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49582-49588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Primary Culture of Embryonic Cardiomyocytes—The primary culture of mouse embryonic hearts was prepared as described previously with slight modifications (8Kim T.G. Chen J. Sadoshima J. Lee Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10151-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Chen T.H. Chang T.C. Kang J.O. Choudhary B. Makita T. Tran C.M. Burch J.B. Eid H. Sucov H.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The dissected hearts were digested in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution containing 0.1% collagenase, 0.002% trypsin, and 0.01% chick serum for 10 min at 37 °C and inactivated by the addition of horse serum. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended and plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The next day, the medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% FBS and assayed after 24 h in culture. Approximately 40–50% cultured cells were estimated to be a cardiomyocyte population by cardiac troponin I immunostaining. Heterozygous jmj knock-out mice in a C57BL/6J × 129SVJ (mixed) genetic background were mated to obtain homozygous jmj knock-out embryos, which were genotyped by tail-genomic DNA as described previously (2Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For LacZ staining, cells were fixed by 0.5% glutaraldehyde and then incubated with X-gal containing solution (1 mg/ml X-gal, 4 mm K4Fe(CN)6-3H2O, 4 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) followed by conventional immunostaining procedure. For immunoblot analyses, cardiomyocyte extracts (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using antibodies to Rb, cyclins A, D1, D2, and E, and p27 (Upstate Biotechnology). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (10T1/2) and human kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cell Mitosis Assay—To assay BrdUrd incorporation by immunofluorescence, cardiomyocytes or 10T1/2 cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 1–24 h as indicated. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 5 min. Cells were denatured with 2 n HCl for 1 h, neutralized with 0.1 m Na2B4O7, washed with PBST, and blocked by 10% goat serum in PBST. Cells were then incubated with rat anti-BrdUrd antibody (Serotec, 1:200) and cardiac troponin I antibody (Advanced ImmunoChemical Inc., 1:300) in blocking solution for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBST followed by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-rat IgG-Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) and goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) in 5% goat serum/PBST. After washing, cells were incubated with Hoechst dye 33342 (Molecular Probes, 1 μg/ml) and mounted. For each sample, an average of 600 cells was counted, and mitotic indices were calculated by dividing the number of BrdUrd-positive nuclei by cardiac troponin I- and Hoechst dye 33342-positive cells. Slides were examined with a Zeiss AxioCam HR microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped for fluorescence microscopy. For phosphohistone staining, embryonic hearts were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 h and incubated in 30% sucrose/PBS. Hearts were frozen in tissue-freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences), and cryosectioned at 6 μm. The sections were permeabilized with PBST and incubated with anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:200) and MF20 antibody that recognizes sarcomeric myosin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red (Amersham Biosciences, 1:100) and anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 488 (1:200) and counterstained by Hoechst dye 33342. To examine the apoptotic rate of the embryonic hearts, in situ apoptosis assays were performed on paraffin-embedded transverse sections of embryos using ApopTag™ Plus Kit (Oncor) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Reporter Gene Assay—To examine the promoter activities in the absence or presence of JMJ, cardiomyocytes seeded on 24-well plates were transfected with 0.2 μg of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, Cdc2, p21, or SV40 promoter (pGL2, Promega) luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 10T1/2 cells grown on 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well were transfected with 0.2 μg of each reporter gene with 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase and compared with cells cotransfected with 0.05 μg of JMJ. To examine the effect of JMJ on the repression activity of Rb on E2F, 10T1/2 cells grown on 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well were cotransfected with various combinations of 5 ng of E2F, 60 ng of Rb, and 30 ng of JMJ mutants by Lipofectamine Plus reagent. All of the transfectant was cotransfected with 50 ng of the E2F-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid and 50 ng of the pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. After a 24-h incubation, luciferase activities were measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activities. The expression levels of cotransfected proteins were determined by Western blot using antibodies to E2F (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), Rb, and JMJ. Coimmunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells cotransfected with Rb (Myc-tagged, or nontagged) and JMJ (FLAG-tagged or nontagged) were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysates (800 μg) were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-Myc antibodies or anti-FLAG antibodies. After a 2-h incubation, protein A/G-agarose was added and incubated for 1 h. After washing three times with the lysis buffer, immunoprecipitates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with various antibodies as indicated in the figure: anti-JMJ antibodies (2Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma); and anti-Rb antibody (Pharmingen). GST-pull-down Assay—35S-labeled JMJ wild type and its mutants were prepared in vitro by the T7 promoter according to manufacturer's instruction (TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega). [35S]Rb deletion mutants were prepared by digestion of mouse pRb with HindIII (aa 1–928), MfeI (aa 1–827), SspI (aa 1–760), and DraIII (aa 1–658) followed by in vitro translation driven by the SP6 promoter. Recombinant GST-Rb or GST-JMJ proteins coupled to Sepharose beads were incubated with [35S] JMJ, [35S]Rb or cardiomyocyte extracts (0.8–1 mg) in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h and washed four times with NETN. Precipitates were subjected to 6–8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blot with anti-JMJ or anti-Rb antibodies. Statistics—Student's two-tailed t test was used for data comparison with a significant level of p < 0.05. In Vivo Interaction of Rb with JMJ—An amino acid sequence alignment reveals that the C-terminal JMJ contains three domains that are conserved in various transcription factors: the jmjN; jmjC; and AT-rich interaction domains (see diagram in Fig. 3D) (6Kortschak R.D.

Interestingly, this region of JMJ is homologous to RBP1 and RBP2 that interact with Rb, a master regulator of cell cycle (11Defeo-Jones D. Huang P.S. Jones R.E. Haskell K.M. Vuocolo G.A. Hanobik M.G.

After FLAG-tagged JMJ was cotransfected with Rb or Myc-tagged Rb into HEK293 cells, their expressions were confirmed by direct Western blot analyses using various antibodies as indicated (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by Western blot analyses using various antibodies (lanes 3 and 4). The JMJ band was detected when cells transfected with Myc-Rb and FLAG-JMJ were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG or JMJ antibodies (lane 3), whereas no band was detected when cells were transfected with nontagged Rb and FLAG-JMJ (lane 4). To further confirm the protein interaction in vivo, reciprocal experiments were performed (Fig. 1B). The Rb or JMJ band was detected when cell lysates transfected with JMJ or FLAG-JMJ with Myc-Rb were subjected to direct Western blot analyses using various antibodies as indicated (lanes 1 and 2). The Rb band was detected when cell lysates expressing FLAG-JMJ and Myc-Rb were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by Western blot using anti-Rb or Myc antibodies as indicated (lane 4). However, the Rb band was not detected when cell lysates expressing JMJ and Myc-Rb were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by Western blot using anti-Rb or Myc antibodies (lane 3), indicating specific interaction of JMJ with Rb. These data clearly demonstrate that JMJ physically interacts with Rb in vivo when they are coexpressed.Fig. 1JMJ physically interacts with Rb in vivo. A, coimmunoprecipitation (coip) was performed using HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged JMJ and Myc-tagged Rb or nontagged Rb. Expression of JMJ or Rb was confirmed by direct Western blot analysis (lanes 1 and 2). The amount of input was 5% cell lysates. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc antibodies followed by immunoblotting (IB) using various antibodies as indicated (lanes 3 and 4). B, the reciprocal experiments were performed using cell lysates expressing Myc-Rb and FLAG-JMJ (lane 2) or nontagged JMJ (lane 1).

To examine whether the Rb activity on E2F is affected in the presence of JMJ, we performed cotransfection assays using the reporter gene containing the E2F-dependent promoter linked to a luciferase gene (Fig. 2). E2F activated the reporter gene and cotransfection of Rb with E2F repressed E2F-dependent activation by 50.1% as expected. When the wild type JMJ (J-Wt) was cotransfected with Rb and E2F, JMJ repressed E2F-dependent reporter activity by 71.7%, suggesting that JMJ potentiates the repression activity of Rb on E2F-dependent activation. To determine the JMJ domain that mediates this repression function, several JMJ mutants were cotransfected with E2F and Rb. The N-terminal JMJ (J-Nt, aa 1–528) containing the TR domain (aa 131–220) showed similar repression to J-Wt (78.2% reduction), whereas C-terminal JMJ (aa 529–1234) completely lost its repression activity. The mutant lacking the TR domain (ΔTR) also lost its repression activity, whereas the DNA-binding domain (aa 529–792) deletion mutant (ΔDBD) retained its repression activity (73.4% reduction). The cotransfected proteins were expressed at similar levels under our transfection condition including E2F, Rb (Fig. 2, bottom), and JMJ (data not shown). These data indicate that the TR domain of JMJ is necessary and sufficient to mediate the repression function of JMJ. The repression function of JMJ on the E2F-dependent activation was dependent on Rb, because all of the JMJ constructs failed to repress E2F activity in the absence of Rb. These observations strongly suggest that JMJ further suppresses E2F-dependent activation via potentiating the repression function of Rb. The Interaction between the TR Domain of JMJ and the Pocket Domain of Rb—Our cotransfection assays indicate that the TR domain of JMJ is critical for potentiating the repression function of Rb on E2F activities. We next investigated whether the protein interaction between the TR domain of JMJ and Rb mediated the function of JMJ on Rb activities. For protein-protein interaction of Rb with various cellular proteins and viral proteins, Rb utilizes either one pocket domain of Rb or both of them (A/B pocket, aa 379–792, and C pocket, aa 792–928) (37Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To map the protein interaction region of Rb that associates with the TR domain of JMJ, we performed GST-pull-down assays using several [35S]Rb mutants and GST-JMJ-(1–222) (Fig. 3A). Serial deletion mutants of [35S]Rb were shown in input lanes (lane 1, aa 1–928; lane 2, aa 1–827; lane 3, aa 1–760; lane 4, aa 1–658). GST-JMJ interacted with full-length Rb (lane 5) and Rb-(1–827) (lane 6) lacking the C pocket, suggesting that the C pocket domain is not required for binding to JMJ. Rb-(1–760) showed weak interaction with GST-JMJ (lane 7). In contrast, Rb-(1–658) in which the C-terminal A/B pocket domain was deleted lost its binding activity to GST-JMJ (lane 8), suggesting that the C-terminal A/B pocket domain is necessary for interaction with JMJ. The results are summarized in Fig. 3B. The GST-JMJ wild type interacted with [35S]Rb wild type and mutants in a pattern similar to GST-JMJ-(1–222) (data not shown). Reciprocal experiments were performed by GST-pull-down assays using in vitro translated [35S]JMJ and GST-Rb fusion"

Using a novel oocyte-based screening system, we identified natural compounds that inhibit cytokinesis. Among these, pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2), which was first identified as a cytotoxic entity in marine sponges, which depolymerizes actin filaments, was found to be highly effective and more potent to activate an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in p53-deficient tumor cells compared to those with functional p53 both in vitro and in vivo. Other agents that depolymerize or knot actin filaments were also found to be toxic to p53-deficient tumors. In p53-deficient cells, PTX-2 triggers apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction, and this is followed by the release of proapoptotic factors and caspase activation. Furthermore, we observed Bax activation and Bim induction only in p53-deficient cells after PTX-2 treatment. RNA interference of either Bim or Bax resulted in the inhibition of caspases and apoptosis induced by PTX-2. However, the small interfering RNAs (SiRNA) of Bim blocked a conformational change of Bax, but Bax SiRNA did not affect Bim expression. Therefore, these results suggest that Bim triggers apoptosis by activating Bax in p53-deficient tumors upon actin damage, and that actin inhibitors may be potent chemotherapeutic agents against p53-deficient tumors."

Despite the fact that pre-invasive lesions are challenging to isolate, and often yield insufficient DNA for the analysis of multiple loci, genomic profiling of such lesions will lead to the discovery of causal genetic alterations, which may be otherwise masked by the gross instability associated with tumors. In this study, we report the identification of multiple early genetic events on chromosome 5p in lung cancer progression. Using a high-resolution 5p-specific genomic array, which contains a tiling path of DNA segments for comparative genomic hybridization, nine novel minimal regions of loss and gain were discovered in bronchial carcinoma in situ (CIS) specimens. Within these regions we identified two candidate genes novel to lung cancer. The 0.27 Mbp region at 5p15.2 contains a single gene, Triple Functional Domain, which we determined to be differentially expressed in tumors. The 0.34 Mbp region at 5p13.2 contains Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF), which is a ligand for the RET oncogene product and is normally expressed during lung development (but absent in adult lung tissue). Our data showed not only that GDNF is overexpressed at the transcript level in squamous non-small-cell lung carcinoma, but also that the GDNF protein is present in early-stage lesions. Reactivation of the fetal lung expressed GDNF in early lesions and its amplification in CIS suggests an early role in tumorigenesis. These results highlight the value of examining the genomes of pre-invasive stages of cancer at tiling resolution."

The enzyme substrate complex corresponded to the postulated Schiff base intermediate and has reaction geometry consistent with incipient C3-C4 bond cleavage catalyzed Glu-187, which is adjacent by to the Schiff base forming Lys-229. Atom arrangement about the cleaved bond in the reaction intermediate mimics a pericyclic transition state occurring in nonenzymatic aldol condensations. Lys-146 hydrogen-bonds the substrate C4 hydroxyl and assists substrate cleavage by stabilizing the developing negative charge on the C4 hydroxyl during proton abstraction. Mannitol-1,6-bis(phosphate) forms a noncovalent complex in the active site whose binding geometry mimics the covalent carbinolamine precursor. Glu-187 hydrogen-bonds the C2 hydroxyl of the inhibitor in the enzyme complex, substantiating a proton transfer role by Glu-187 in catalyzing the conversion of the carbinolamine intermediate to Schiff base. Modeling of the acyclic substrate configuration into the active site shows Glu-187, in acid form, hydrogen-bonding both substrate C2 carbonyl and C4 hydroxyl, thereby aligning the substrate ketose for nucleophilic attack by Lys-229. The multifunctional role of Glu-187 epitomizes a canonical mechanistic feature conserved in Schiff base-forming aldolases catalyzing carbohydrate metabolism. Trapping of tagatose-1,6-bis(phosphate), a diastereoisomer of fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate), displayed stereospecific discrimination and reduced ketohexose binding specificity. Each ligand induces homologous conformational changes in two adjacent alpha-helical regions that promote phosphate binding in the active site."

Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45 min lobar ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion. L-arginine or Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was administered to stimulate or block NO synthesis. Study groups (n=6) had 1) sham laparotomy, 2) ischemia reperfusion (IR), 3) IPC with 5 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion before IR, 4) L-arginine before IR, or 5) L-NAME + IPC before IR. Liver function tests, nitrite + nitrate (NOx) and plasma amino acids were analyzed. The endothelial cell and inducible isoforms of NOS (eNOS and iNOS) were identified using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Both IPC and L-arginine treatment increased NOx (P<0.05) and improved serum liver enzymes (P<0.05) when compared with IR. These effects were prevented by L-NAME. Hepatic vein NOx was significantly higher than circulating NOx. iNOS expression was absent within the groups. The preconditioned livers were associated with up-regulation of eNOS expression and also increased L-arginine levels. The effects of L-arginine administration were similar to those evident following IPC. Thus, cytoprotective NO generation during IPC of the liver was a result of increased eNOS expression and increased L-arginine substrate availability."

Based on the crystal structure, it appears that the three vertices of GRK2 (amino-terminal RH domain, central catalytic domain, and carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain) are ordered such that they may interact simultaneously with the receptor, Gαq/11, and Gβγ to attenuate receptor activity (16Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J.G. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, GRK2 mutants impaired in Gαq/11 binding (R106A, D110A, and M114A) interact with mGluR1 but do not mediate mGluR1 desensitization (24Dhami G.K. Dale L.B. Anborgh P.H.

Previously, we identified a GRK2-D527A mutant that is impaired in mGluR1 binding and did not attenuate mGluR1 signaling but retained the ability to interact with Gαq/11 (24Dhami G.K. Dale L.B. Anborgh P.H. O'Connor-Halligan K.E. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16614-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism underlying GRK2 phosphorylation-independent attenuation of mGluR1a signaling appears to be RH domain-dependent, requiring the binding of GRK2 to both Gαq/11 and mGluR1.Because GRK2 binding to mGluR1 appears to be essential to allow the phosphorylation-independent antagonism of mGluR1 signaling, we tested the hypothesis that GRK2 might bind to overlapping regions of intracellular mGluR1 domains that are essential for G protein coupling. We found that GRK2 binding to mGluR1a and mGluR1b is primarily mediated by residues localized within intracellular loop 2 and that the mutation of either Lys691 or Lys692 to alanine results in a loss of GRK2 binding to both receptors. Mutation of either Lys691 or Lys692 prevented GRK2-mediated attenuation of mGluR1b signaling, whereas mutation of only Lys692 prevented GRK2-mediated inhibition of mGluR1a signaling. Thus, our studies revealed that the second intracellular loop is the primary GRK2 binding site and indicated that GRK2 binding to an additional site on the mGluR1a carboxyl-terminal tail reveals subtle differences in the regulation of mGluR1a and mGluR1b signaling by GRK2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials— HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and gentamicin were from Invitrogen. The anti-GRK2 antibody was raised against the peptide sequence DREARKKAKNKQLGH, corresponding to rat GRK2. Anti-GST antibodies, donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, ECL Western blotting detection reagents, and the protein G-Sepharose beads were from GE Healthcare (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Quisqualate was purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO). myo-[3H]Inositol was acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) resin with 200–400 mesh was purchased from Bio-Rad. All other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma.Plasmid Construction—The FLAG-mGluR1a and GRK2 constructs have been described previously (7Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B.

Point mutations were introduced into the second intracellular loop domain of both mGluR1a and mGluR1b using the using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For GST fusion proteins, mGluR1a PCR-generated sequences were cloned as GST-tagged EcoRI-XhoI products into the GST-prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T (GE Healthcare). The PCR-generated sequences contain mGluR1a intracellular loop (IL) 1 (GST-IL1, amino acids 593–650), loop 2 (GST-IL2, amino acids 657–727), loop 3 (GST-IL3, amino acids 751–807), the membrane-proximal portion of the carboxyl tail (amino acids 816–860), and the rest of the carboxyl tail (amino acids 861–1199) (Fig. 1A). The IL2 (amino acids 673–710) alanine scanning mutants were generated by PCR and cloned as GST-tagged EcoRI-XhoI products into the GST-prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T. pGEX-4T-based constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. The sequence integrity of each of the mutants was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/μl gentamicin. Cells were transfected with plasmid cDNAs using a modified calcium phosphate method (25Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfection (18 h), the cells were incubated with fresh medium, allowed to recover for 6–8 h, and re-seeded into either 6- or 24-well dishes and then grown for an additional 18 h prior to experimentation.Inositol Phosphate Formation—Inositol lipids were radiolabeled by incubating the cells overnight with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Unincorporated myo-[3H]inositol was removed by washing the cells with Hanks' balanced salt solution (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cells were pre-incubated for 1 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution 37 °C and then pre-incubated in 500 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mm LiCl for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in either the absence or presence of increasing concentrations (0–30 μm) of quisqualate for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice by the addition of 500 μl of perchloric acid and then neutralized with 400 μl of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3. The total [3H]inositol incorporated into the cells was determined by counting the radioactivity present in 50 μl of the cell lysate. Total inositol phosphate was purified from the cell extracts by anion exchange chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) 200–400 mesh anion exchange resin. [3H]Inositol phosphate formation was determined by liquid scintillation using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system.GST-mGluR1a Fusion Protein Purification and Pull-down Assays— GST-mGluR1a peptides were generated by growing recombinant BL21 bacteria at 21 °C to an A600 of 0.6–1.0. Cultures were induced for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors (described under “Co-immunoprecipitation”), and lysed by mild sonication. The bacterial lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation and then applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. GST-mGluR1a peptides bound to the matrix were washed extensively in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. 1 μg of mGluR1a GST peptide was used in each pull-down assay. HEK293 cell lysates overexpressing GRK2 were prepared and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation; 500 μg of total protein was used in each pull-down assay. Matrix-bound mGluR1a peptides and HEK293 cell lysates were incubated together and mixed overnight at 4 °C. The matrix-bound protein complexes were washed extensively in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and then eluted off the matrix in SDS loading buffer by boiling for 3–5 min at 100 °C. Eluted samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-GRK2 and anti-GST antibodies.Co-immunoprecipitation—The cells from 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 400 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The particulate fraction was removed by centrifugation, and 500 μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 5 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and 100 μl of 20% protein G-Sepharose beads or 40 μl of FLAG affinity gel for 12–16 h at 4 °C in a 1-ml volume. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted in 3× SDS sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry electroblotting. The membranes were blocked with 10% milk in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with rabbit GRK2-specific and FLAG-specific (Sigma) antibodies diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer containing 3% skim milk. The membranes were rinsed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2500 in wash buffer containing 3% skim milk. Membranes were rinsed twice with wash buffer and twice with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents.Receptor Expression—Cells expressing FLAG-tagged mGluR1a were labeled on ice with an anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) for 45 min. The cells were washed with cold PBS and subsequently labeled with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1: 500) for 45 min on ice. The cells were harvested, and cell surface immunofluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (15Dhami G.K. Anborgh P.H. Dale L.B. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Data Analysis—The means ± S.D. or S.E. are shown for the number of independent experiments indicated in the figure legends. GraphPad Prism software was used to analyze data for statistical significance and to analyze data and fit curves for quisqualate dose-response. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test.RESULTSIdentification of IL2 as a mGluR1 GRK2 Binding Domain— To determine the intracellular domain of mGluR1a that binds GRK2, we constructed GST peptides corresponding to the mGluR1 intracellular loops and their adjacent transmembrane domains (IL1, IL2, and IL3) as well as the mGluR1a carboxyl-terminal tail GST-Ct841–860 and GST-Ct861–1199 (Fig. 1A). These GST peptides were tested for their capacity to co-precipitate GRK2 from HEK293 cell lysates transfected to express GRK2. GST-IL2 and GST-Ct861–1199 were found to effectively co-precipitate GRK2, whereas GST-IL1, GST-IL3, and GST-Ct841–860 did not bind to GRK2 (Fig. 1B). Because GRK2 retains the capacity to attenuate the signaling of a carboxyl-terminal tail-truncated mGluR1a mutant (mGluR1a-1–866) and receptor/G protein interactions have been localized to the second intracellular loop (15Dhami G.K.

Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the mGluR1 s intracellular loop revealed that GRK2 binding was lost when amino acid residues 688–692 (GSKKK) were mutated to alanine residues (Fig. 1D).Because we had previously identified amino acid residue D527 in the GRK2 RH domain as critical for mediating GRK2 interactions with mGluR1b (24Dhami G.K. Dale L.B. Anborgh P.H. O'Connor-Halligan K.E. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16614-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this acidic amino acid residue might associate with the three basic lysine residues localized within the second intracellular GSKKK motif. Therefore, we mutated lysine residues 690, 691, and 692 to alanine residues in mGluR1b, either individually or in combination (K691/692A), and examined whether the resulting mGluR1b mutants were impaired in their capacity to co-precipitate GRK2. When tested, we found that all of the mGluR1b lysine mutants were impaired in their capacity to co-precipitate GRK2 from HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). However, only mGluR1b-K690A exhibited residual GRK2 binding (58 ± 16% of control) (Fig. 2B). The inability of any of the mGluR1b lysine mutants to co-precipitate GRK2 was not the consequence of differences in cell surface expression (Fig. 2C). Consequently, lysine residues 691 and 692 appeared to be the primary sites of interaction within the second intracellular loop of mGluR1b.Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation of GRK2 with mGluR1b IL2 lysine residue mutants. A, representative blots showing the co-immunoprecipitation of GRK2 with FLAG-mGluR1b, FLAG-mGluR1b-K690A, FLAG-mGluR1b-K691A, FLAG-mGluR1b-K692A, and FLAG-mGluR1b-K691/K692A from 500 μg of HEK293 cell lysates. HEK293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid cDNA for GRK2 and 10 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid cDNA for each of the mGluR1b constructs.

Therefore, we examined the relative ability of mGluR1b and the intracellular loop 2 mutants mGluR1b-K690A, mGluR1b-K691A, mGluR1b-K692A, and mGluR1b-K691/692A to stimulate inositol phosphate (IP) formation when expressed in HEK293 cells in response to increasing concentrations of quisqualate. We found that the maximum relative response for IP formation was impaired for mGluR1b-K690A, mGluR1b-K691A, mGluR1b-K692A, and mGluR1b-K691/692A when compared with the wild-type mGluR1b (Fig. 3A and Table I). In contrast, the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were variably affected by individual mutation of lysine residues 690, 691, and 692 (Table I). The maximum relative response for IP formation was reduced 40–47% for mGluR1b-K690A, mGluR1b-K691A, and mGluR1b-K692A, whereas mGluR1b-K691/692A was completely uncoupled (Fig. 3A and Table I). Thus, mGluR1b-K691/692A could not be used to evaluate the effects of GRK2 expression on the attenuation of mGluR1b mutant signaling. Nevertheless, the coupling efficiency of mGluR1b-K690A, mGluR1b-K691A, and mGluR1b-K692A was sufficient to examine whether GRK2 expression might attenuate the basal and agonist-stimulated signaling of these mGluR1b mutants.Fig. 3Comparison of mGluR1b mutant-stimulated IP formation and GRK2 regulation of basal activity with wild-type mGluR1b.

J.Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23McCarter L.L. J.Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No homologues have beenreported in E. coli or Salmonella. Recently, MotY homologueswere reported in the lateral flagellar system of Vibrio sp., in whichthe coupling ions are protons, and in the flagellum of Pseudomonasaeruginosa (24Doyle T.B. Hawkins A.C. McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,25Stewart B.J. McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4508-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MotY has apeptidoglycan-binding motif in the C-terminal region, which is also found inMotB and PomB (20Okunishi I. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MotX andMotY seem to interact with each other, although direct evidence for thisinteraction has not yet been obtained(19Okabe M. Yakushi T. Asai Y. Homma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,23McCarter L.L. J.Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have shownthat the N-terminal segments of MotX and MotY are cleaved, and the matureproteins are fractionated with the outer membrane, suggesting that they areouter membrane proteins(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region of MotA is postulated to interact with the rotorcomponent FliG. Electrostatic interactions between conserved charges on FliGand those on MotA are important for the rotation of the proton-driven motor ofE. coli (27Zhou J.D. Lloyd S.A. Blair D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6436-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It isbelieved that both proton- and sodium ion-driven motors rotate by a similarmechanism because several chimeric motors composed of both types of componentsare functional(28Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Sockett E. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6322-6338Google Scholar, 29Asai Y. Sockett R.E. Kawagishi I. Homma M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3639-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Asai Y. Yakushi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).However, amino acid substitutions in the conserved charged residues of PomA orFliG in the sodium ion-driven motor of V. alginolyticus do notabolish motility (31Yorimitsu T. Sowa Y. Ishijima A. Yakushi T. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,32Yorimitsu T. Mimaki A. Yakushi T. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These discrepanciesbetween the proton- and sodium ion-driven motors suggest that other chargedresidues are required for the flagellar rotation in the sodium ion-drivenmotor or that MotX and MotY compensate for the effects of the amino acidsubstitutions in PomA and FliG. If the latter is true, there may be someinteractions among the motor proteins, although there is no evidence forinteractions between MotX and/or MotY and the PomA/PomB complex. In this study, we have shown that MotX interacts with MotY and affectsmembrane localization of the PomA/PomB complex when MotY is absent. This isthe first direct evidence for interaction of the inner membrane ion channelcomplex with the outer membrane component in the flagellar motor. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The E. colistrain JM109 was used for DNA manipulations(33Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). The V.alginolyticus strains used in this study are listed inTable I. V.alginolyticus cells were cultured at 30 °C in VC medium (0.5%Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.4% K2HPO4, 3% NaCl, 0.2%glucose) or in VPG medium (1% Tryptone, 0.4% K2HPO4, 3%NaCl, 0.5% glycerol). The E. coli strains used for DNA manipulationsand membrane localization experiments were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium(1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). When necessary, kanamycin wasadded to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml (for V. alginolyticus)or 50 μg/ml (for E. coli).Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidGenotype or descriptionReferenceV. alginolyticus strainsVIO542Rifr Laf– motY54220NMB94Laf– motX9419NMB191Rifr Laf– ΔpomAB34PlasmidspSU41kan (Kmr) Plac lacZα36pIO6pSU38, 1.0-kb HindIII-XbaI fragment (motY+)20pKJ401pSU41, 700-bp XbaI-BamHI fragment (motX+)26pKJ502pSU41, 1.0-kb SalI-XbaI fragment (motY+)26pKJ503pSU41, 1.0-kb SalI-XbaI fragment (motY-his6+)26pKJ601pKJ502 (motY+), 700-bp XbaI-BamHI fragment(motX+)26pKJ602pKJ502 (motY+), 700-bp XbaI-BamHI fragment(motX-his6+)This workpKJ701pKJ601 (motY+ motX+), 1.9-kbBamHI-SacI fragment (pomAB+)26pMO401pSU41, 700-bp ClaI-BamHI fragment (motX+)19pMO402pSU41, 700-bp ClaI-BamHI fragment (motX-his6+)This workpMO711pKJ401 (motX+), 1.9-kb BamHI-SacI fragment(pomAB+)This workpMO712pKJ502 (motY+), 1.9-kb BamHI-SacI fragment(pomAB+)This workpMO721pKJ401 (motX+), 800-bp BamHI fragment(pomA+)This workpMO722pKJ401 (motX+), 1.1-kb BamHI-SacI fragment(pomB+)This workpSK603pSU41, 1.1-kb BamHI-SacI fragment (pomB+)37pYA301pSU41, 800-bp BamHI fragment (pomA+)37pYA303pSU41, 1.9-kb BamHI-SacI fragment (pomAB+)37 Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction—DNA manipulations were carried outaccording to standard procedures(35Sambrook J.

Plasmids used in thisstudy are listed in Table I.Plasmid pKJ402, which was constructed by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotideprimers, encodes the C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged MotX(MotX-His6). The nucleotide sequence of5′-CATCACCATCACCATCACTAAGGATCC-3′ (the BamHI site isunderlined) was inserted between the 3′ end of the motX openreading frame and the BamHI site of plasmid pKJ401. Because this plasmidcomplemented a motX mutant of V. alginolyticus, theC-terminal His6 tag does not appear to perturb MotX function (datanot shown). The 700-bp XbaI-BamHI fragment (containingmotX-his6) of pKJ402 was inserted into pKJ502 (carryingmotY) to construct a plasmid, pKJ602, that carries an artificialmotY-motX-his6 operon. The 1.9-kb BamHI-SacIfragment (containing pomAB) of pYA303 was inserted into pKJ401(carrying motX), constructing a plasmid, pMO711, that carries anartificial motX-pomAB operon. This BamHI-SacI fragment was insertedinto pKJ502 (carrying motY) to construct a plasmid, pMO712, whichcarries an artificial motY-pomAB operon. The 0.8-bp BamHI fragment(containing pomA) of pYA301 was inserted into pKJ401 to construct aplasmid, pMO721, which carries an artificial motX-pomA operon. The1.1-kb BamHI-SacI fragment (containing pomB) of pSK603 was insertedinto pKJ401; the resultant plasmid, pMO722, carries an artificialmotX-pomB operon. The motor genes of the plasmids constructed here donot have their native promoters and are under the control of the lacpromoter operator. Transformation of Vibrio cells by electroporationwas carried out as described previously(38Kawagishi I. Okunishi I. Homma M. Imae Y. Microbiology (Read). 1994; 140: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—Vibrio cells harboring plasmids werecultured at 30 °C in VPG medium. Cells were harvested, washed twice withV-buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 300 mm NaCl), and stored at –80 °Cuntil use. The frozen cells were thawed and resuspended (0.2 g, wet weight/ml)in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml DNase I. Membranevesicles were prepared by subjecting the suspension to a single passagethrough a French press (5501-M Ohtake Works) at 500 kg/cm2 at 4°C. Undisrupted cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (10,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the membrane fraction wasrecovered from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 2 h. The membrane pellet was suspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% (w/v)glycerol and then homogenized and stored at –80 °C until use. Detection of Proteins—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting wereperformed as described previously(34Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies againstMotX peptide and MotY peptide, which are referred to as MotX192 and MotY264,respectively, were prepared as described previously(19Okabe M. Yakushi T. Asai Y. Homma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein concentrationswere determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Membrane Solubilization by Detergents—Membrane preparationswere suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0 or 450mm NaCl to yield final concentrations of 10 mg of protein/ml. After72 different kinds of detergents from Detergent Screens 1, 2, and 3 (HamptonResearch) were added at 2-fold the critical micelle concentration, eachsuspension was mixed gently overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 minat 200,000 × g to separate the solubilized supernatant and theinsoluble precipitate. For solubilization of MotX or MotY, five detergentswere selected: n-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside,n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, n-decylsulfobetaine(ZWITTERGENT 3-10), octanoyl-N-methylglucamide (MEGA-8), andnonanoyl-N-methylglucamide (MEGA-9). Pull-down Assay—Membranes from NMB94 harboring pKJ602 orpKJ601 were suspended in 20TPG (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (w/v) glycerol) containing 5mm imidazole and 1.5% (w/v)n-octyl-β-d-glucoside to yield final concentrationsof 10 mg of protein/ml. The suspension was stirred overnight at 4 °C andcentrifuged for 10 min at 200,000 × g. The clarifiedsupernatant was passed through aNi2+-NTA-agarose 1The abbreviation used is: Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriaceticacid.column (Qiagen), and then the column was washed with the same buffer. Elutionwas conducted three times with 20TPG containing 800 mm imidazoleand 1.5% (w/v) n-octyl-β-d-glucoside. Gel-filtration Chromatography—The membrane fractions fromNMB94 harboring pKJ601 were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,1.5% (w/v) n-octyl-β-d-glucoside to yield finalconcentrations of 10 mg of protein/ml. The suspension was stirred overnight at4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 200,000 × g. Theclarified supernatant (200 μl) was separated on a Superdex™ 200HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer at aflow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluates were collected in 500-μl fractionsstarting 14 min after sample injection. Membrane Localization of Motor Proteins—E. coli strain JM109harboring plasmid pYA303, pMO711, pMO712, pSK603, pMO721, or pMO722 was grownon LB medium at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase, and expression of motorproteins was induced for 1 h by the addition of 1 mm isopropylβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside prior to harvest. The cells wereharvested and converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplast suspension wassonicated, and the total membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation(200,000 × g, 10 min) after the removal of unbrokenspheroplasts. The total membranes were resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and then applied to a35–55% (w/w) stepwise sucrose gradient containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 80,000× g for 12 h at 4 °C, the gradient was divided into20–25 fractions from the bottom to the top. OmpA, SecG, MotX, MotY,PomA, and PomB proteins in each fraction were detected by SDS-PAGE followed byimmunoblotting with the respective antibodies(19Okabe M. Yakushi T. Asai Y. Homma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,34Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,39Yamada H.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Solubilization of MotX and MotY—Some detergents such asTriton X-100 solubilized MotY. However, MotX was not solubilized by anydetergents used so far (26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).To carry out biochemical characterization of these proteins in more detail, weexamined 72 different kinds of detergents to determine whether they solubilizeMotX and MotY. Because we have examined solubilization in the presence of 150mm NaCl in a previous study(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in this study weexamined detergents in the presence or absence of 450 mm NaCl. Wefound that eight detergents, six nonionic(n-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside,n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, CYMAL-3, MEGA-8,n-hexyl-β-d-glucoside, and MEGA-9) and twozwitterionic (ZWITTERGENT 3-10 and FOS-choline-8), solubilized MotX and MotYwhen co-expressed from a plasmid (Fig.1 for the second and seventh detergents in the above list). MotXand MotY were solubilized by these detergents only in the absence, but not inthe presence, of salt. From the detergents listed above, we usedn-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside,n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, MEGA-8, MEGA-9, andZWITTERGENT 3-10 to assess the solubility properties of MotX when it wasexpressed alone. None of the detergents solubilized MotX alone(Fig. 1 for the second andfifth detergents in the above list), suggesting that the solubility of MotXchanged in the presence of co-expressed MotY, probably because of interactionsbetween MotX and MotY. Interaction between MotX and MotY—To investigate whetherMotX actually interacts with MotY, we performed a pull-down assay withMotX-His6. The binding efficiency of MotX-His6 to aNi2+-NTA resin was very poor, and almost the same amount ofMotX-His6 was recovered in the flow-through fraction as was in theapplied materials (Fig.2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). This may bebecause of sequestration of the C-terminal His6 tag byoligomerization of MotX (see below). However, a small but significant amountof MotX-His6 appeared in the elution fractions. Untagged MotY wasalso found in the elution fractions (Fig.2A). On the other hand, neither MotX nor MotY wasdetected when untagged MotX and MotY were used, confirming that no nonspecificbinding to the column occurred. Therefore, we conclude that MotX binds toMotY. Analytical Gel-filtration Chromatography of MotX and MotY—Toestimate the molecular size of the MotX/MotY complex, the proteins solubilizedby n-octyl-β-d-glucoside were analyzed by aSuperdex™ 200 gel-filtration column. Both MotX and MotY eluted in thevoid volume (Fig. 3). Thus, itis likely that MotX and MotY form an oligomer(s) too large to analyze. Inagreement with this result, such large oligomers were also detected in thehigh molecular weight fractions of a sucrose density gradient centrifugationexperiment (data not shown). To rule out the possibility of artifactualoligomerization because of their overexpression, MotX solubilized fromwild-type cells expressing only chromosomal levels of motX was alsoshown to elute in the void volume (data not shown). The biochemical properties of MotY seemed to be drastically influenced bysalt. Because most of MotY was present in the periplasmic space in solubleform in the absence of MotX(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), both membrane-bound(Fig. 4A) and soluble(Fig. 4B) MotY wereanalyzed by gel-filtration chromatography. Both forms eluted in the voidvolume in the absence of NaCl (Fig.4, upper panels). On the other hand, in the presence of300 mm NaCl, both membrane-bound and soluble MotY appeared in thefractions between albumin (67 kDa) and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), whichcorresponds to the monomeric size of MotY(Fig. 4, lowerpanels). Similarly, the monomeric form of MotY was observed at the sameconcentration of KCl (data not shown). Alteration in Membrane Localization of PomA and PomB by Co-expressionwith MotX—When co-expressed, MotX and MotY are detected in theouter membrane fraction after sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Incontrast, in the absence of MotY, MotX is detected in intermediate fractionsbetween the inner and outer membrane fractions(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When PomA, PomB, MotX,and MotY are expressed, MotX and MotY are mainly found in the outer membranefractions, whereas PomA and PomB are present in the inner membrane fractions(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test whether MotX and/or MotY affect membrane localization of thePomA/PomB complex, we carried out sucrose density gradient centrifugationexperiments. The model organism E. coli was used because methods forthe separation of the inner and outer membranes of V. alginolyticusare not as well established. OmpA and SecG were used as the diagnostic markerproteins for the outer and inner membranes, respectively. PomA and PomB weredetected in the inner membrane fractions in the absence of both MotX and MotY(Fig. 5A). Next, E. coli cells expressing PomA, PomB, and either MotX or MotYwere fractionated (Fig. 5, B andC). When PomA, PomB, and MotX were co-expressed, theywere all detected in intermediate fractions between the inner and outermembrane fractions. On the other hand, when PomA, PomB, and MotY wereco-expressed, MotY was found in the outer membrane, whereas PomA and PomB weredetected in the inner membrane fractions. These results suggest that MotX, butnot MotY, affects membrane localization of PomA and PomB. PomB was detected inthe inner membrane fractions when it was expressed by itself(Fig. 6A). When PomBwas co-expressed with MotX, PomB was detected in the same intermediatefractions as MotX, even in the absence of PomA(Fig. 6B).Co-expressed MotX did not affect membrane localization of PomA in the absenceof PomB (data not shown), suggesting that in the absence of MotY, MotX bindsto PomB but not to PomA. Several observations have suggested that MotX interacts with MotY, althoughno direct evidence for such an interaction has been obtained(19Okabe M. Yakushi T. Asai Y. Homma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,23McCarter L.L. J.Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, weattempted to characterize the biochemical properties of MotX and MotY in moredetail. We searched for conditions under which detergents can solubilize theseproteins. We tried 72 different kinds of detergents and found thatco-expressed MotX and MotY were solubilized by eight different detergents inthe absence of salt. In contrast, MotX alone was not solubilized by thesedetergents at all, indicating that MotY strongly affects the solubility ofMotX. Pull-down assay showed that untagged MotY co-eluted withMotX-His6, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins.Because overexpression of MotX can suppress a series of motYmutations (19Okabe M. Yakushi T. Asai Y. Homma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it issuggested that MotY is involved in the proper targeting of MotX to theflagellar motor rather than in torque generation. In fact, MotX fails tolocalize to the outer membrane in the absence of MotY(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analytical gel-filtration chromatography showed that MotX and MotY, eitherexpressed from a plasmid or from the chromosome, eluted in the void volume,suggesting that MotX and MotY together form a large oligomeric structure(s).At the moment, it is not clear whether the MotX/MotY oligomer(s) correspond toa homogeneous complex or just an aggregate(s). However, it is interesting tonote that the stator protein complex also exists as a large oligomerconsisting of at least four PomA (MotA) and two PomB (MotB) proteins(21Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 5718-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,41Braun T.F. Al-Mawsawi L.Q. Kojima S. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,42Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Microbiology (Read). 2004; 150: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has been reported that overproduction of MotX is lethal to E.coli cells and that cell death caused by overproduction of MotX wasdependent on the external NaCl or KCl concentration(23McCarter L.L. J.Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric state ofMotY is also strongly influenced by salt concentration; it is monomeric in thepresence of 300 mm NaCl or KCl, but it forms a large oligomericstructure(s) in the absence of salt and elutes in the void volume bygel-filtration chromatography (Fig.4). Detergents that were able to solubilize the MotX/MotY complexworked only in the absence of salt (Fig.1). Thus, salt concentration appears to be a key factor for theconformation and/or the oligomeric state of MotX, MotY, and the MotX/MotYcomplex. We have shown previously that when expressed alone, MotX is notfractionated with the inner or the outer membrane(26Okabe M. Yakushi T. Kojima M. Homma M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, MotX exhibitsdifferent cellular locations depending on whether or not MotY is present. Inthis study, we found that in the absence of MotY, MotX altered the membranelocalization of the PomA/PomB complex and PomB, but not PomA, to fractionsbetween the inner and outer membrane in sucrose density gradientcentrifugation (Figs.5B and6B). This resultsuggests strongly that MotX binds to PomB. It is not clear whether thePomA/PomB complex and PomB are detached from the membrane vesicles or whethermembrane vesicles containing PomA/PomB and PomB are isolated from thosecontaining SecG (used as an inner membrane marker protein) and thosecontaining OmpA (used as an outer membrane marker protein). It is possible,however, that MotX binds tightly to PomA/PomB or PomB, thereby pulling themtoward the intermediate fraction when they are separated by sucrose densitygradient centrifugation. In our previous studies of the chimeric flagellarmotor, MotX and MotY have been shown to be required for the motor function ifthe periplasmic region of the chimeric B subunits derive from PomB(28Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Sockett E. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6322-6338Google Scholar, 29Asai Y. Sockett R.E. Kawagishi I. Homma M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3639-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Asai Y. Yakushi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Therefore, we suggest that MotX probably binds to the periplasmic region ofPomB to make a functional stator. Thus, the interaction between PomB and MotXis physiologically relevant to the torque generation process, and therefore,MotX probably forms a part of the stator of the sodium ion-driven flagellarmotor in Vibrio sp. Based on the available information, we propose a mechanism of assembly anda functional state of the stator complex of sodium ion-driven motor(Fig. 7). (i) MotX forms acomplex with MotY, which is then targeted to the outer membrane. (ii) MotXassociated with the outer membrane interacts with the PomA/PomB complex in theinner membrane through the periplasmic region of PomB to produce torque. Atthe moment, we cannot rule out the possibility that MotY is dissociated fromthe complex because even in the absence of MotY, a less functional stator isformed by overproduction of MotX(19Okabe M. Yakushi T. Asai Y. Homma M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is likely, however,that MotY remains with MotX in the complex because MotX and MotY arefractionated together with the outer membrane when all of the four componentsare expressed (26Okabe M.

https://openalex.org/W2072420743,"The complete catabolic pathway involved in the assimilation of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-OH-PhAc) in Pseudomonas putida U has been established. This pathway is integrated by the following: (i) a specific route (upper pathway), which catalyzes the conversion of 3-OH-PhAc into 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (2,5-diOH-PhAc) (homogentisic acid, Hmg), and (ii) a central route (convergent route), which catalyzes the transformation of the Hmg generated from 3-OH-PhAc, l-Phe, and l-Tyr into fumarate and acetoacetate (HmgABC). Thus, in a first step the degradation of 3-OH-PhAc requires the uptake of 3-OH-PhAc by means of an active transport system that involves the participation of a permease (MhaC) together with phosphoenolpyruvate as the energy source. Once incorporated, 3-OH-PhAc is hydroxylated to 2,5-diOH-PhAc through an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by a novel two-component flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase (MhaAB). The large component (MhaA, 62,719 Da) is a flavoprotein, and the small component (MhaB, 6,348 Da) is a coupling protein that is essential for the hydroxylation of 3-OH-PhAc to 2,5-diOH-PhAc. Sequence analyses and molecular biology studies revealed that homogentisic acid synthase (MhaAB) is different from the aromatic hydroxylases reported to date, accounting for its specific involvement in the catabolism of 3-OH-PhAc. Additionally, an ABC transport system (HmgDEFGHI) involved in the uptake of homogentisic acid and two regulatory elements (mhaSR and hmgR) have been identified. Furthermore, the cloning and the expression of some of the catabolic genes in different microbes presented them with the ability to synthesize Hmg (mhaAB) or allowed them to grow in chemically defined media containing 3-OH-PhAc as the sole carbon source (mhaAB and hmgABC).

Bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas are able to assimilate a very large number of organic compounds that may be dangerous or toxic for many other living organisms (animals, plants, and microbes) (1Dagley S.

Although many benzene-derived aromatic compounds (see above) must be hydroxylated as an initial catabolic event, we have observed that there are some important exceptions. Thus, the degradation of phenylacetic acid (PhAc) 1The abbreviations used are: PhAc, phenylacetic acid; Hmg, homogentisic acid; 3-OH-PhAc, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; 3,4-diOH-PhAc, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; 2,5-diOH-PhAc, 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame. in Pseudomonas putida U is carried out through a new catabolic pathway that involves the activation of this acid to phenylacetyl-CoA prior to hydroxylation (2Martínez-Blanco H.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, hydroxylated derivatives of phenylacetic acid (3-OH-PhAc, 4-OH-PhAc, or dihydroxylated compounds -3,4-diOH-PhAc and 2,5-diOH-PhAc-) are not degraded by any of these pathways, suggesting that they would require other catabolic routes involving the participation of hydroxylases, as indicated above (37Blakley E.R.

Indeed, the degradative pathway of 4-OH-PhAc seems to be fairly similar to the one that catalyzes the assimilation of this compound in Escherichia coli through the homoprotocatechuate pathway (3,4-diOH-PhAc) (46Olivera E.R. Reglero A. Martínez-Blanco H. Fernández-Medarde A. Moreno M.A. Luengo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in E. coli, 4-OH-PhAc and 3-OH-PhAc are degraded through the same pathway (42Prieto M.A. García J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22823-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Xun L. Sándwich E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44Galán B. Díaz E. Prieto M.A. García J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), but in P. putida the assimilation of 3-OH-PhAc requires a different route, which has only been partially clarified. In previous work (32Arias-Barrau E. Olivera E.R. Luengo J.M. Fernández C. Galán B. García J.L. Díaz E. Miñambres B. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5062-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) we showed that 3-OH-PhAc is oxidized to Hmg through an unknown mechanism and that this intermediate is further catabolized through the homogentisate pathway, a central route involved in the degradation of l-Phe and l-Tyr. Here we approached the study of the enzymatic steps involved in the conversion of 3-OH-PhAc into Hmg in P. putida U, reporting for the first time that the 3-OH-PhAc upper catabolic pathway requires the participation of the following: (i) a permease; (ii) a novel two-component hydroxylating enzyme (3-hydroxyphenylacetate 6-hydroxylase, homogentisate synthase); (iii) an ABC transport system; and (iv) several regulatory elements.

Incubations were carried out in a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 30 °C for the time required in each set of experiments. The carbon sources used for culture were phenylacetic acid (10 mm), 3-OH-PhAc (10 mm), 4-OH-PhAc (10 mm), l-tyrosine (5 mm), succinic acid (42 mm), or combinations thereof. In some experiments different antibiotics were also supplied. E. coli strains were maintained on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates and cultured in the required medium at 37 °C overnight or for the time indicated in each experiment (34Olivera E.R. Miñambres B.

Isolation of Mutants Handicapped in the Degradation of 3-OH-PhAc—The isolation of mutants unable to catabolize 3-OH-PhAc was carried out by mutagenesis with the transposon Tn5, following the mating procedure (48Selvaraj J. Iyer V.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Bacteria grown on the mating filters were resuspended in 3 ml of LB medium and seeded on LB plates containing rifampicin (20 μgml-1) and kanamycin (25 μgml-1) and incubated 48 h at 30 °C. Colonies were seeded by replica plating in two different media (containing either 0.5 g liter-1 fructose or 10 mm 3-OH-PhAc as the sole carbon source). Mutants were those strains able to grow on plates containing fructose but unable to grow on those containing 3-OH-PhAc as the sole carbon source. Following this procedure, several mutants were isolated (see “Results”). For gene disruption through single homologous recombination, an internal fragment (usually 99-300 bp) of the gene to be disrupted was cloned in the polylinker of pK18::mob or pJQ200KS (two mobilizable plasmids that do not replicate in Pseudomonas) (53Shäfer A. Tauch A. Jäger W. Kalinowski J. Tierbach G. Pühler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 54Quant J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 127: 15-21Google Scholar), and the resulting construct was introduced into P. putida U by triparental filter mating (50Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Exconjugants harboring the disrupted gene were isolated on LB medium containing rifampicin and kanamycin after 48 h of incubation at 30 °C. Deletion of a specific gene (or a set of genes) was accomplished by using the methodology described by others (54Quant J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 127: 15-21Google Scholar, 59Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Infect. Inmun. 1991; 59: 4310-4317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which involves a double-recombination event and the selection of the required mutant by expression of the lethal sacB gene. All mutants were analyzed by PCR to define the insertional position of the disrupting element or to confirm the position and extent of the deletion. Throughout the text, deletions are indicated as Δ followed by the name of the gene that has been eliminated. Genetic disruptions, caused by the insertion of the transposon Tn5 or of the plasmids pK18::mob and pJQ200KS in a particular gene, are summarized as Δgene::Tn5 Δgene::pK18::mob and Δgene::pJQ200KS, respectively. HPLC Equipment and Chromatographic Procedure—The intermediates accumulated by the different mutants were analyzed by HPLC. Samples taken at different times from the culture broths of the mutants studied were centrifuged (31,000 × g, 20 min) to eliminate the bacteria and were filtered through a Millipore filter (0.45-μm pore size). Aliquots of 50 μl were taken and analyzed by using a high performance liquid chromatograph (Spectra Physics SP8800) equipped with a variable wavelength UV-visible detector (SP8450), a computing integrator (SP4290), and a microparticulate (10 μm particle size, 1 μm pore size) reverse-phase column (Nucleosil C18, 250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter; Phenomenex Laboratories). The mobile phase was 0.05 m K2HPO4 (pH 4) and acetonitrile (99:1 by volume)). The flow rate was 2.5 ml·min-1, and the eluate was monitored at 254 nm. Under these conditions the retention times for l-Tyr, homogentisic acid (2,5-diOH-PhAc), 3,4-diOH-PhAc, 4-OH-PhAc, and 3-OH-PhAc were 3, 7, 11, 20, and 23 min, respectively.

However, P. putida U, a strain able to grow in minimal media containing 3-OH-PhAc as the sole carbon source (Fig. 1), assimilates this compound through a different catabolic pathway that, in a first step, catalyzes the introduction of a second hydroxyl group in ortho position of the aromatic ring to generate 2,5-diOH-PhAc (so-called homogentisic acid) (62Sariaslani F.S. Harper D.B. Higgins I.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 63Anderson J.J. Dagley S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 534-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This compound is then catabolized through the homogentisate pathway as has been reported for the catabolism of l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine (Fig. 2). Very recently, we have described the genetic organization, enzymatic activities, and molecular regulation of the route involved in the degradation of l-Tyr to homogentisic acid (upper pathway) as well as that required for the catabolism of Hmg to fumarate and acetoacetate (central pathway) (32Arias-Barrau E. Olivera E.R. Luengo J.M. Fernández C. Galán B. García J.L. Díaz E. Miñambres B. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5062-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, although this pathway has been characterized in detail, nothing is known about the enzymatic step(s) involved in the uptake or in the conversion of 3-OH-PhAc into Hmg. Accordingly, here we approached the identification of the gene(s) and protein(s) required for the uptake of 3-OH-PhAc and for the synthesis of Hmg from 3-OH-PhAc (mha, meta-hydroxyphenylacetic acid catabolic genes). The enzyme or enzymatic system responsible for the hydroxylation of 3-OH-PhAc to 2,5-diOH-PhAc will henceforth be designated homogentisate acid synthase (HmgS).Fig. 2Schematic representation of the different catabolic pathways involved in the degradation of l-Tyr, 3-OH-PhAc, and 4-OH-PhAc in P. putida U (solid arrow), P. putida KT2440 (dotted arrow), and E. coli W (dashed arrow). 1, tyrosine aminotransferase; 2, 4-OH-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase; 3, homogentisate dioxygenase; 4, maleylacetoacetate isomerase; 5, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase; 6, homogentisate synthase; 7 and 8, 4-OH-phenylacetate 3-monooxygenase; 9, homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase; 10, 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; 11, 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase; 12 and 13, 5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase; 14, 2-oxohept-3-ene-1,7-dioate hydratase; 15, 2,4-dihydroxy-hept-2-ene-1,7-dioate aldolase; 16, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The characterization of the genes involved in the catabolic pathway required for the specific degradation of 3-OH-PhAc (Mha upper pathway) was performed by mutagenesis with the transposon Tn5 (48Selvaraj J.

Following this procedure, several mutants (seven) were isolated. It was a priori expected that all of them would belong to one of the two following groups: (i) mutants unable to catabolize l-Tyr and 3-OH-PhAc (group I), and (ii) mutants unable to catabolize 3-OH-PhAc to 2,5-PhAc (Hmg) (group II). Analysis of the different exconjugants revealed that all them belonged to the first group (mutants in which the transposon was inserted in some of the genes encoding the enzymes of the Hmg pathway, the central pathway) (see Fig. 2). However, none of these mutants was specifically affected in the degradation of 3-OH-PhAc (group II). To identify this specific gene (or genes), we used a different strategy. We had observed previously that all the P. putida U mutants lacking a functional gene encoding homogentisate dioxygenase (hmgA), accumulated Hmg in the broth when they were cultured in any media containing 3-OH-PhAc, l-Tyr, peptides, or proteins containing this amino acid (32Arias-Barrau E.

This accumulation was easily visualized because, when oxidized to quinoid derivatives, Hmg became a dark-brown pigment that stained the culture broths (Fig. 3). Because"

Pex5p is a multidomain protein involved in a complex network of transient protein-protein interactions. Besides interacting directly with most peroxisomal proteins en route to the organelle, Pex5p has also binding domains for several components of the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery. However, our knowledge of how binding of a cargo protein to Pex5p influences its properties is still rather limited. Here, we describe a protease assay particularly useful for identifying and characterizing protein-protein interactions involving human Pex5p. Binding of a PTS1-containing peptide/protein to Pex5p as well as the interaction of this peroxin with the Src homology domain 3 of Pex13p could be easily demonstrated using this assay. To address the possible effects of these Pex5p-interacting peptides/proteins on the assumed quaternary structure of Pex5p, we have analyzed the hydrodynamic properties of human Pex5p using size exclusion chromatography, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation.

Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes and posttranslationally imported into the organelle. Specific targeting of these proteins to the peroxisome is promoted by one of two receptors, Pex5p or Pex7p (reviewed in Refs. 1Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

The recognition of this cytosolic Pex5p-cargo protein complex by the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery is the next step in the protein transport pathway mediated by Pex5p. Pex13p and Pex14p as well as the RING finger peroxins Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p are components of this docking/translocation machinery (14Agne B. Meindl N.M. Niederhoff K. Einwachter H. Rehling P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29935-29942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The third step in this pathway has been the subject of much controversy. According to some researchers, Pex5p is translocated completely across the peroxisomal membrane together with the cargo it transports (17Szilard R.K. Titorenko V.I. Veenhuis M. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1453-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Dammai V. Subramani S.

Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17229-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The other perspective is that the Pex5p protein is inserted into the peroxisomal membrane without crossing it completely. In this model, the cargo protein-binding domain of Pex5p reaches the lumen of the organelle where it releases the cargo protein (reviewed in Refs. 20Azevedo J.E. Costa-Rodrigues J. Guimaraes C.P. Oliveira M.E. Sa-Miranda C. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 41: 451-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 21Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Regardless of the true mechanism by which matrix proteins are translocated across the peroxisomal membrane, it is consensually accepted that Pex5p returns to the cytosol to catalyze further rounds of transportation. This last step (the recycling event) is probably the only one requiring energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis (22Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M. Pinto R.A. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39483-39488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The data supporting this general mechanism, the so-called cycling receptor model, are now numerous (18Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Gouveia A.M. Guimaraes C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

However, it is evident that our knowledge on many of the “details” of this pathway is still quite poor, leaving room for controversies between researchers in the field. These controversies are not restricted to the translocation step as already stated above. Another point of discussion regards the nature of the Pex5p molecule(s) that interact(s) with the docking/translocation machinery. In principle, formation of a heterodimeric complex involving a Pex5p molecule on one side and one cargo protein on the other should suffice to ensure specific targeting of proteins to the peroxisomal compartment. However, this simple idea has been challenged by a more complex model in which Pex5p is seen as a homotetramer and thus capable of binding up to four PTS1-containing cargo proteins (21Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because many peroxisomal matrix proteins are oligomers, it was proposed that multivalent interactions would be established between Pex5p and the proteins en route to the peroxisomal matrix, leading to the generation of huge protein complexes. Presumably, these large protein complexes would be formed at the surface of the organelle, resulting in an increase in local concentration of the cargo proteins that would facilitate their translocation across the peroxisomal membrane. More recently, a refined version of this “pre-implex model” has been proposed (25Wang D. Visser N.V. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43340-43345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was suggested that in Hansenula polymorpha cargo proteins are actually translocated across the peroxisomal membrane by tetrameric Pex5p. After releasing the cargo proteins in the matrix of the peroxisome, Pex5p would monomerize and return to the cytosol. Interestingly, a model in which Pex5p also oscillates between a tetrameric and a monomeric/dimeric form has been described recently in Leishmania donovani (26Madrid K.P. De Crescenzo G. Wang S. Jardim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7331-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this case, however, it was proposed that L. donovani Pex5p mono- or dimerizes upon binding PTS1-containing proteins and tetramerizes when leaving the peroxisomal compartment. In this work, we have studied the properties of human Pex5p when bound to a PTS1-containing peptide/protein. Data suggesting the existence of PTS1-induced conformational alterations on human Pex5p were obtained when in vitro synthesized and recombinant Pex5p were subjected to partial proteolysis. To determine whether binding of a PTS1-containing peptide/protein modulates in some way the assumed oligomeric state of human Pex5p, we have characterized the hydrodynamic properties of this peroxin. In agreement with previous data, human Pex5p was found to behave as a 270-kDa globular protein upon size exclusion chromatography (27Harper C.C. Berg J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7897-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, this species represents monomeric Pex5p and not homotetramers, as assumed previously. The abnormal behavior of Pex5p on size exclusion chromatography is just the result of a high frictional ratio, a property that seems to derive from its N-terminal half. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane are discussed.

The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The recombinant plasmid was digested with SphI and SalI, and the insert was cloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen), resulting in the pQE-Pex5 plasmid. Expression was performed in the M15 strain of Escherichia coli. 100-ml cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Pelleted cells were cooled on ice and lysed by sonication in 1.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:500 (v/v) mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min at 10,000 × g), and the clarified supernatant was incubated with 100 μl (bed volume) of HIS-Select™ nickel affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was washed three times with 1.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and the His6-PEX5p was eluted by washing the beads three times with 600 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was concentrated to ∼50 μl using a Vivaspin 10,000 MWCO PES concentrator (Vivascience), diluted to 600 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and concentrated again. This procedure was repeated two more times. Aliquots of the His6-PEX5p recombinant protein were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. To test whether the introduction of this purification tag at the N terminus of human Pex5p interferes with its function, the plasmid pQE-Pex5 was subjected to an expression PCR protocol (32Kain K.C. Orlandi P.A. Lanar D.E. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 366-374PubMed Google Scholar). In the first PCR the upper primer 5′-gggagagccaccatgagaggatcgcatcac-3′ and the lower primer 5′-gcgtaattaagcttggctgcaggtc-3′ were used. In the second PCR the same lower primer was used together with the primer 5′-gaattctaatacgactcactatagggagagccaccatg-3′. The amplified fragment was subjected to in vitro transcription/translation as described above, and the 35S-labeled His6-tagged Pex5p was used in in vitro import experiments exactly as described before (23Gouveia A.M.

These experiments revealed that His6-tagged Pex5p is inserted into the peroxisomal membrane originating Stage 2 Pex5p (when ATP was included in the import reactions) or Stage 2 plus Stage 3 Pex5p (when ATPγS was used). Furthermore, addition of a GST fusion protein containing the TPR domains of Pex5p to the import medium blocked the insertion of this His6-tagged protein into the organelle membrane (data not shown), as described previously for the untagged human Pex5p (see Refs. 23Gouveia A.M.

These data suggest that the modified N terminus does not inactivate Pex5p. The synthesis and purification of GST-LKS (GST ending with a nonfunctional PTS1-like sequence), GST-SKL (GST containing a PTS1 signal at the C terminus), and the histidine-tagged SH3 domain of human Pex13p (amino acid residues 236–403; Pex13p-SH3) were described before (30Gouveia A.M.

Protease Assay—Protease treatment of Pex5p was performed in buffer A (50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). One μl of the reticulocyte lysates containing the 35S-labeled Pex5p proteins or 5 μg of His6-PEX5p recombinant protein were used per reaction. Peptides (see below) and GST-LKS or GST-SKL were added to 2 μm final concentration. Pex13p-SH3 was used at a final concentration of 1.5 μm. After 10 min at 37 °C, the samples were placed on ice and treated for 15 min with 0.5 μg/ml (for radioactive proteins) or 1 μg/ml (for recombinant Pex5p) of proteinase K. The protease was inactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mg/ml), and the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% (w/v)), washed with acetone, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—20 μg of recombinant Pex5p or 3 μl of the reticulocyte lysates containing radioactive Pex5p or ΔC1-Pex5p were incubated in 200 μl of buffer A in the presence of 2 μm GST-LKS or GST-SKL for 10 min at 37 °C. Trace amounts (∼2 μg) of bovine IgGs (6.9 s), bovine serum albumin (4.3 s), soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.3 s), and cytochrome c (1.9 s) were added to the samples as internal standards (numbers in parenthesis represent the sedimentation coefficients). These mixtures were then applied onto the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (2.0 ml of 4%, 1.8 ml of 8%, 1.7 ml of 12%, 1.5 ml of 16%, 1.2 ml of 20%, 1 ml of 25%, and 1 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose in buffer A supplemented with 2 μm GST-LKS or GST-SKL. After centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C in a TST41.14 swing-out rotor (Sorvall), 13 fractions of 0.8 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The sedimentation coefficients of the Pex5p proteins were estimated by interpolation from the linear plots of the s values of the standard proteins versus their gradient fractionation volume. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Human Pex5p recombinant protein (20 μg of protein) or in vitro synthesized proteins (1 μl of the corresponding reticulocyte lysates) were incubated in 200 μl of buffer A containing 40 μm peptides (see below) or 10 μm GST-SKL or GST-LKS for 10 min at 37 °C. Protein samples were injected into a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) running with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.5, at 0.5 ml/min. The inclusion of 1 mm DTT in this running buffer did not change the elution profile of the Pex5p proteins (see Ref. 28Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; data not shown). The column was calibrated with the following standards (numbers in parenthesis represent the Stokes radii): thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), ferritin (6.1 nm), aldolase (4.8 nm), bovine serum albumin (3.6 nm), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.3 nm). Fractions of 500 μl covering the relevant Stokes radius range were always collected, subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments with the recombinant protein the A280 profile of the chromatography revealed the existence of one or two extra protein peaks (corresponding to globular proteins with molecular masses of 130 and 60 kDa) in addition to the “270 kDa” species. Analysis of the corresponding SDS gels showed that only the “270 kDa” peak correlated with His-tagged Pex5p; the other peaks were due to the presence of Pex5p proteolytic fragments (data not shown). These Pex5p preparations were discarded. The Stokes radii of the Pex5p proteins were determined as described (34Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 217-230Crossref Google Scholar). Sedimentation Equilibrium Centrifugation—Recombinant Pex5p (200 μg) was subjected to size exclusion chromatography as described above. Fractions containing the “270-kDa” protein peak were pooled and concentrated to 1 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 10,000 MWCO PES concentrator (Vivascience). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed at the National Centre for Macromolecular Hydrodynamics at the University of Nottingham (UK) using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with scanning absorption optics. The same analysis was performed using a different version of human Pex5p recombinant protein purified as described before (28Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this protein there is a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site between the N-terminal His tag and the Pex5p sequence. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of this recombinant protein (0.4 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) was performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany. Miscellaneous—Molecular masses of native proteins (M) and frictional ratios (f/fo) were calculated from their Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients as described in Ref. 35Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar using Equations 1 and 2 M=6πηNas/(1−υρ)(Eq. 1) and f/fo=a/(3υM/4πN)1/3(Eq. 2) where η is the viscosity of the medium, N is the Avogadro's number, a is the Stokes radius, s is the sedimentation coefficient, v is the partial specific volume of the protein, and ρ is the density of the medium. Partial specific volumes for Pex5p proteins and GST-SKL were calculated using the program SEDNTERP v1.08 (www.jphilo.mailway.com/default.htm). Edman degradation of Pex5p proteolytic fragments was performed by HHMI/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT). The peptides CRYHLKPLQSKL (Pep-SKL) and CRYHLKPLQLKS (Pep-LKS) were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. The peptide YQSKL was a kind gift from Dr. W. Nastainczyk, University of Saarland, Germany. Controlled digestion of a protein using proteases may reveal important insights on its structure. In many cases, such assays can even be used to characterize ligand-induced conformational alterations on the protein being studied (e.g. Ref. 36Manciu L. Chang X.B. Buyse F. Hou Y.X. Gustot A. Riordan J.R. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3347-3356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Naturally, such strategy can also be applied to the identification of putative ligands of a given protein even if the ligands being tested are proteins themselves. In this case, however, positive results may only be obtained if the protein under study is much more sensitive to the protease than the ligands added to the assay, something that can be easily determined empirically. Using this rationale we have developed a simple procedure to identify and characterize protein-protein interactions involving human Pex5p. As shown below, because of its high sensitivity to proteases (see also Ref. 37Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) Pex5p is a suitable protein to use in this kind of assay. The procedure consists of incubating human Pex5p (obtained either from in vitro transcription/translation reactions or from heterologous expression in E. coli) with the test proteins/peptides, followed by limited proteolysis with proteinase K (see “Materials and Methods” for details). Binding of a PTS1-containing Peptide/Protein to Human Pex5p Changes the Accessibility of Proteinase K to a Region of the Pex5p Protein That Precedes Its PTS1-binding Domain—We started our analysis by characterizing the interaction of Pex5p with PTS1-containing proteins/peptides. In vitro synthesized 35S-Pex5p was incubated with either a PTS1-containing peptide (pep-SKL) or with a negative control peptide (pep-LKS; see “Materials and Methods”) and subjected to treatment with a very low concentration (0.5 μg/ml) of proteinase K. After inactivation of the protease the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2, different proteolytic patterns are observed suggesting that Pex5p bound to pep-SKL displays a different susceptibility to proteinase K. The most evident differences regard the appearance of a 40-kDa doublet protein band when pep-SKL is used in these experiments and a 35-kDa protein band that is particularly abundant when the control peptide is used. The 40-kDa doublet band was also observed when a shorter PTS1-containg peptide (YQSKL) was used in these experiments (data not shown). Exactly the same results were obtained when GST-SKL and GST-LKS were substituted for pep-SKL and pep-LKS, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). To characterize the Pex5p-derived fragments described above, we repeated the protease assay but this time using chemical amounts of recombinant human Pex5p. The results presented in Fig. 1B demonstrate that recombinant Pex5p displays the behavior of the in vitro synthesized peroxin. N-terminal sequencing of the 40-kDa doublet protein band generated a mixture of two peptide sequences, as expected (for practical reasons, no efforts were made to resolve the two protein bands in order to obtain independent sequences). The sequences were easily ascribed to amino acid residues 291–296 and 295–300 of human Pex5p. Edman degradation of the 35-kDa protein band also resulted in a mixture of two peptide sequences, indicating the presence in this band of two Pex5p fragments that probably also differ at their C termini. One of these fragments starts with the sequence WLSDYD (residues 308–313) and the other with TYDKDG (residues 319–324) of human Pex5p. Taken together these data indicate that binding of a PTS1-containing peptide/protein to Pex5p changes the accessibility of proteinase K to peptide bonds linking amino acid resides 307–308 and 318–319 of human Pex5p. These amino acid residues precede the first TPR domain of human Pex5p (11Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) by 30 and 19 amino acid residues, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2019898235,"The requirement for receptor components and the signalling effector, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5A/5B, was assessed genetically in a lymphoma development model induced by interleukin-7 (IL-7). This growth factor for T- and B-cell progenitors and mature lymphocytes activates survival and proliferative pathways including Bcl-2, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and STAT5. Overexpression of IL-7 in vivo causes early mortality from lymphoma development. Mice overexpressing IL-7 that were heterozygous for the IL-7Rα subunit showed improved survival compared to wild-type mice. In addition, STAT5A/5B+/− compound heterozygous mice with one targeted allele each of STAT5A and STAT5B showed striking amelioration of IL-7-induced mortality and disease development. STAT5A/5B+/− compound heterozygous mice were otherwise normal in stem cell and lymphocyte development and cellularity. Lower STAT5 protein levels accompanied the reduction in STAT5A/5B copy number, which suggests that STAT5 haploinsufficiency is a modifier of IL-7 signal strength."
https://openalex.org/W2084413946,"The conformational changes that convert G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activated by diffusible ligands from their resting into their active states are not well understood at present. To address this issue, we used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical class A GPCR, as a model system, employing a recently developed disulfide cross-linking strategy that allows the formation of disulfide bonds using Cys-substituted mutant M3 muscarinic receptors present in their native membrane environment. In the present study, we generated and analyzed 30 double Cys mutant M3 receptors, all of which contained one Cys substitution within the C-terminal portion of transmembrane domain (TM) VII (Val-541 to Ser-546) and another one within the C-terminal segment of TM I (Val-88 to Phe-92). Following their transient expression in COS-7 cells, all mutant receptors were initially characterized in radioligand binding and second messenger assays (carbachol-induced stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis). This analysis showed that all 30 double Cys mutant M3 receptors were able to bind muscarinic ligands with high affinity and retained the ability to stimulate G proteins with high efficacy. In situ disulfide cross-linking experiments revealed that the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, promoted the formation of cross-links between specific Cys pairs. The observed pattern of disulfide cross-links, together with receptor modeling studies, strongly suggested that M3 receptor activation induces a major rotational movement of the C-terminal portion of TM VII and increases the proximity of the cytoplasmic ends of TM I and VII.

A structural hallmark of all GPCRs is the presence of a bundle of seven transmembrane helices (TM I–VII) that are connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops (4Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 6Gether U. Endocr.

The structural elements determining ligand binding and G protein recognition have been studied in considerable detail, at least for some members of the GPCR superfamily (5Bockaert J. Pin J.P.

In contrast, the conformational changes that activating ligands induce in their target receptors are still not well understood at present. The currently available evidence suggests that GPCR activation opens a cleft on the intracellular side of the receptor that promotes the recognition and activation of specific G protein heterotrimers (4Wess J.

At present, bovine rhodopsin (in its inactive state) is the only GPCR for which high resolution structural information is currently available (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Most GPCRs share a considerable degree of structural homology with bovine rhodopsin (12Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and are therefore also referred to as rhodopsin-like or family A GPCRs. However, whereas the endogenous ligand of rhodopsin, 11-cis-retinal, is covalently bound to the receptor protein, all other family A GPCRs known to date are activated by diffusible ligands. The possibility therefore exists that the precise structural mechanisms involved in receptor activation may not be identical between rhodopsin and other class A GPCRs. During the past decade, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the light-induced conformational changes in bovine rhodopsin (9Meng E.C. Bourne H.R. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv.

Struct. 2002; 31: 443-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that rhodopsin activation triggers a reorientation of the cytoplasmic end of TM VI and changes in the relative disposition of TM VI and III, along with smaller movements involving several other TM helices (10Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 14Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P.

Considerable evidence indicates that a similar movement (reorientation of the cytoplasmic end of TM VI versus that of TM III) occurs in other GPCRs, including the β2-adrenergic receptor (17Gether U.

Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) suggested that rhodopsin activation involves a rigid body movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM VI (away from the C terminus of TM III) that is accompanied by a rotational movement of ∼30° (clockwise as viewed from the cytoplasm). The pioneering biophysical and biochemical studies carried out with bovine rhodopsin have led to important new insights into the structural mechanisms involved in rhodopsin activation. However, the vast majority of these studies were carried out with mutant versions of rhodopsin in the solution state (receptor proteins were solubilized in dodecyl maltoside micelles), and some data suggest that the structural and dynamic properties of rhodopsin present in solution may not be identical with those found in native disk membranes (10Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thus, the development of techniques that would allow the monitoring of agonist-induced conformational changes in GPCRs present in their native membrane environment would be highly desirable. To address this issue, we recently described a novel in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy that allows the formation of disulfide bonds using Cys-substituted mutant M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors present in their native membrane environment (22Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Hamdan F.F. Ward S.D. Siddiqui N.A. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7647-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The M3 muscarinic receptor is a prototypical class A GPCR that preferentially interacts with G proteins of the Gq family (24Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to the M3 muscarinic receptor and most other class A GPCRs involves, among other sites of contact, several key residues present within the exofacial portion of TM VII (24Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 25Lu Z.L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, the endofacial segment of TM VII contains the highly conserved NPXXY motif (corresponding to Asn-539 to Tyr-543 in the rat M3 receptor sequence) (Fig. 1), which may provide a point of flexibility for agonist-induced structural changes. We therefore tested the hypothesis that diffusible ligands may induce conformational changes within the cytoplasmic segment of TM VII (the region located C-terminal of the NPXXY motif), using our previously developed in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy (22Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Hamdan F.F. Ward S.D. Siddiqui N.A. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7647-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal segment of TM VII is predicted to be located in the vicinity of the C-terminal portion of TM I (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar), we generated 30 double Cys mutant M3 muscarinic receptors, all of which contained one Cys substitution within the C-terminal portion of TM VII (Val-5417.51–Ser-5467.56) and another Cys substitution within the C-terminal segment of TM I (Val-881.53–Phe-921.57) (the superscripts indicate amino acid positions according to the nomenclature proposed by Ballesteros and Weinstein (36Ballesteros J.A.

Disulfide cross-linking experiments, carried out in the absence or the presence of a muscarinic agonist (carbachol), led to the identification of three double Cys mutant M3 muscarinic receptors (V88C1.53/Y543C7.53, A91C1.56/L545C7.55, and A91C1.56/S546C7.56) that showed agonist-promoted disulfide bond formation. The observed cross-linking pattern, in combination with a newly established three-dimensional model of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor, strongly suggested that receptor activation leads to a major rotational movement of the C-terminal portion of TM VII and increases the proximity of the C-terminal ends of TM I and VII. Given the high degree of structural homology found among all class A GPCRs, our findings should be of broad general relevance. Materials—Copper sulfate (CuSO4), 1,10-phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), atropine sulfate, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS; 79–83 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Factor Xa protease and digitonin were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Precast Novex Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and SeeBlue Plus 2 prestained molecular mass standards were from Invitrogen. Hybond™ ECL™ nitrocellulose membranes, anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, ECL™ detection reagents, and Hyperfilm™ ECL™ chemiluminescence film were from Amersham Biosciences. Laemmli loading buffer was from Bio-Rad. All other reagents used were of the highest grade commercially available. Generation of Cys-substituted Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptor Constructs—All Cys substitutions were introduced into a pCD-based expression plasmid coding for a modified version of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor, previously referred to as M3′(3C)-Xa receptor (Fig. 1). The generation of the M3′(3C)-Xa expression plasmid has been described previously (26Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The M3′(3C)-Xa receptor contains an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag and lacks all five potential N-terminal N-glycosylation sites and most endogenous Cys residues, except for Cys140, Cys220, and Cys532. Importantly, the central portion of the i3 loop (Ala274–Lys469) was replaced by two factor Xa cleavage sites. Cys residues were reintroduced into the M3′(3C)-Xa construct at positions Val-881.53–Phe-921.57 and Val-5417.51–Ser-5467.56, by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double Cys mutant receptors were obtained by subcloning a 1.7-kb BglII-NdeI fragment derived from the mutant M3′(3C)-Xa constructs containing single Cys substitutions at positions Val-541 to Val-546 into the M3′(3C)-Xa constructs containing single Cys substitutions at positions Val-88 to Phe-92. The identity of all mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression of Receptor Constructs in Mammalian Cells—All mutant M3 muscarinic receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Approximately 24 h prior to transfections, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of receptor plasmid DNA/dish using the Lipofectamine™ Plus kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In order to increase muscarinic receptor expression levels, 1 μm atropine was routinely added to the incubation medium for the last 24 h of culture. Preparations of Membranes from Transfected COS-7 Cells—Transfected cells were harvested ∼48 h after transfections. To ensure complete removal of atropine that was present in the incubation medium during the last 24 h of culture, cells were washed twice (10 min each wash) with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Subsequently, 2 ml of ice-cold buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) was added to each 100-mm dish, followed by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C. Cells were then scraped off of the plates and homogenized using a Polytron tissue homogenizer (setting 5; 20 s), followed by a 15-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were then resuspended in buffer A (1 ml/100-mm dish), rehomogenized, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -70 °C until needed. Protein concentrations were measured using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Radioligand Binding Studies—Radioligand binding assays were carried out using membrane homogenates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells essentially as described previously (22Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, all incubations were carried out in 1 ml of buffer A (∼10–20 μg of membrane protein/tube) for 2 h at room temperature (22 °C). In saturation binding assays, six different concentrations (ranging from 20 to 3,000 pm) of [3H]NMS were used. In competition binding assays, a fixed concentration of [3H]NMS (500 pm) was employed in the presence of 10 different concentrations (13 pm to 10 μm) of the cold competitor, carbachol, a muscarinic agonist. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/C Brandel filters followed by three washes (∼4 ml each) with ice-cold distilled water. In all assays, nonspecific binding was defined as the binding remaining in the presence of 1 μm atropine. The amount of bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 3.0 (GraphPad). Agonist-induced Stimulation of Phosphatidylinositol Hydrolysis— The ability of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, to stimulate increases in intracellular inositol monophosphate (IP1) levels was determined using transfected COS-7 cells grown in 6-well plates, as described previously (26Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After labeling of cells for 20–24 h with myo-[3H]inositol (3 μCi/ml), cells were incubated in the presence of 10 mm LiCl for 1 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of carbachol. The IP1 fraction was isolated and quantitated as described (26Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Carbachol concentration-response curves were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 3.0 (GraphPad). Oxidation, Solubilization, and Factor Xa Treatment of Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors—Membrane preparations obtained from transfected COS-7 cells were thawed at room temperature and rehomogenized as described under “Preparations of Membranes from Transfected COS-7 Cells.” Membranes from one 100-mm dish (∼1 mg of protein present in a 1-ml volume) were incubated in microcentrifuge tubes with end-over-end rotation (30 rpm; 10 min at room temperature) with the oxidizing agent, Cu(II)-phenanthroline (2.5 μm), either in the absence or the presence of different concentrations of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, or the antagonist, atropine. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm each), followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. To obtain membrane lysates (22Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), samples were then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellets were incubated with 250 μl of 0.2% digitonin in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 20 min on ice (to remove peripheral membrane proteins). Following another centrifugation step (8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), membrane pellets were incubated with 1.2% digitonin in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2) for 90–120 min at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation (30 rpm). After another centrifugation step (same conditions as above), the supernatants (membrane lysates containing solubilized mutant M3 muscarinic receptors) were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes. Membrane lysates (∼15 μg of protein) were then incubated with factor Xa protease (final concentration, 0.1 μg/μl) at room temperature for 16–20 h (final volume, 50 μl). The reactions were then terminated by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with a mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (1:25 dilution; Sigma). Samples were then used directly for SDS-PAGE or stored at -70 °C until use. Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (22Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Laemmli loading buffer (nonreducing conditions) and then loaded onto 10–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, which were run at 125 V in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Western blotting studies were carried out essentially as described by Ward et al. (22Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), using the anti-M3 antibody directed against the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the M3 receptor protein (27Zeng F.Y. Soldner A. Schöneberg T. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2404-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Receptor proteins were visualized by using ECL detection reagents and autoradiography. The intensities of immunoreactive bands were quantitated by scanning densitometry using the program ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences). A Three-dimensional Model of the Rat M3 Muscarinic Receptor—A three-dimensional model of the TM core of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor (including the various loop regions and helix 8) was built using homology modeling based on the high resolution (2.8 Å) x-ray structure of the inactive state of bovine rhodopsin (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). All calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station (300-MHz MIPS R12000 (IP30) processor) using the SYBYL 6.9 program (Sybyl Molecular Modeling System, version 6.9; Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). For the conformational refinement of the initial M3 muscarinic receptor model, the optimized structures were used as the starting point for subsequent molecular dynamics studies. Overall, the M3 receptor model showed high structural similarity with that of the rhodopsin template, especially within the regions endowed with secondary structure (for details, see Supplemental Data). Generation of 30 Double Cys Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors—This study was designed to monitor agonist-induced conformational changes in the M3 muscarinic receptor with the receptor being present in its native membrane environment. Our major goal was to detect potential activity-dependent structural changes occurring at the cytoplasmic end of TM VII. Toward this aim, we used an in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy to monitor the positions of six consecutive amino acids located at the C terminus of TM VII, relative to a string of residues located at the C terminus of TM I. Altogether, we generated 30 double Cys mutant receptors, all of which contained one Cys substitution within the C-terminal segment of TM I (Val-881.53–Phe-921.57) and another Cys substitution within the C-terminal portion of TM VII (Val-5417.51–Ser-5467.56) (Fig. 1). All Cys mutations were introduced into a modified version of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor (M3′(3C)-Xa) (26Zeng F.Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that lacked most native Cys residues and contained a factor Xa cleavage site within the i3 loop (Fig. 1). Transient Expression of Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors and Radioligand Binding Studies—All 30 double Cys mutant M3 receptor constructs, along with the M3′(3C)-Xa “background” receptor, were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and initially examined for their ability to bind the muscarinic radioligand, [3H]NMS. To increase receptor expression levels, transfected cells were incubated with atropine (1 μm) for the last 24 h of culture. We previously demonstrated that this strategy leads to a pronounced increase in the density of the M3′(3C)-Xa receptor and all Cys-substituted mutant receptors derived from this construct (22Ward S.D.

Wess J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7647-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Saturation binding studies with the muscarinic antagonist, [3H]NMS, showed that the M3′(3C)-Xa receptor was expressed at a density of 3.54 ± 0.01 pmol/mg protein (Bmax). The expression levels of the majority of the 30 double Cys mutant receptors differed from this value by less than 2-fold (Table I). Interestingly, several mutant receptors yielded Bmax values that were significantly higher than that observed with the M3′(3C)-Xa construct (Table I). The mutant receptors displaying the highest receptor densities were V90C1.55/V541C7.51 and F92C1.57/L545C7.55, which exhibited Bmax values of 19.06 ± 0.53 and 16.42 ± 0.26 pmol/mg, respectively. All 30 double Cys mutant receptors were able to bind [3H]NMS with high affinity (Table I). The [3H]NMS KD values displayed by these receptors differed from the KD value determined for the M3′(3C)-Xa “base mutant” (KD = 240 ± 45 pm) by less than 2-fold.Table ILigand binding properties of double Cys mutant M3 muscarinic receptors The indicated mutant M3 muscarinic receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. All double Cys mutant receptors were derived from the M3′(3C)-Xa construct. Bmax and KD values for [3H]NMS were determined from saturation binding experiments using membrane homogenates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells. Carbachol binding affinities (Ki) were determined in [3H]NMS competition binding assays (nH = Hill coefficient). Carbachol binding data were corrected for the Cheng-Prusoff shift. Binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 3.0 (GraphPad).

Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Hepatocyte Receptors and Genetic Diseases. Academic Press, New York2001: 309-361Google Scholar). It is expressed in liver, intestine, pancreas, and kidney and is required for tissue-specific expression of many of their respective traits (2Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development. 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, reviewed in 4Duncan S.A. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In analogy with other nuclear receptors of the superfamily, HNF-4α1 consists of an N-terminal A/B domain (aa 1–51), including a ligand-independent transactivation function (AF-1), C-domain (aa 51–106) consisting of the DNA binding domain, hinge D-domain (aa 106–185), ligand-binding domain (LBD) consisting of a ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) within an E-domain (aa 185–368), and a C-terminal inhibitory F-domain (aa 368–455). Transcriptional activation by HNF-4α is mediated by its binding as homodimer to DR-1 promoter sequences of target genes. Genes activated by HNF-4α encode some transcription factors (e.g. HNF-1, PXR, and SHP), enzymes and proteins involved in lipoprotein and lipid metabolism (e.g. apoA-I, -A-II, -B, -C-II, and -C-III and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein), carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. insulin, glut2, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), hematopoiesis (e.g. erythropoietin and transferrin), blood coagulation (e.g. Factors VII, IX, X, and XI and fibrinogen), and others. The importance of HNF-4α is reflected by its extensive in vivo association with RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes in liver and pancreas (5Odom D.T. Zizlsperger N. Gordon D.B. Bell G.W. Rinaldi N.J. Murray H.L. Volkert T.L. Schreiber J. Rolfe P.A. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Bell G.I. Young R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1378-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Its functional importance in regulating lipid and carbohydrate metabolism is reflected by the central role played by HNF-4α-responsive genes in controlling lipoprotein production and their plasma clearance, hepatic glucose production and utilization, and also pancreatic insulin production and secretion (1Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Hepatocyte Receptors and Genetic Diseases. Academic Press, New York2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in HNF-4α result in maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-1 (6Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), and single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the HNF-4α promoter have recently been reported to show the strongest association with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in sibling pair families (7Silander K.

Various fatty acyl-CoA thioesters longer than C12 as well as xenobiotic acyl-CoA thioesters of hypolipidemic amphipathic carboxylates (e.g. Medica analogues) have now been reported by us to specifically bind to the full-length HNF-4α1, or its LBD (aa 132–455), with Kd values in the 1.0 nm range as compared with 10- to 100-fold lower binding affinities of the respective free acids (9Hertz R.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Binding of acyl-CoAs results in conformational changes of HNF-4α and in activation or suppression of its transcriptional activity in transfected cells as function of chain length, degree of unsaturation and extent of substitution of respective acyl-CoA ligands (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 10Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

Activation of HNF-4α transcriptional activity by fatty acyl agonist ligands (e.g. C14:0, C16:0, and C16:1) is best exemplified by missense mutants of the ligand binding domain of HNF-4α (e.g. MODY-1 mutants), that fail to transactivate transcription due to their reduced binding affinities for fatty acyl agonist ligands of HNF-4α (12Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N. Schroeder F. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22578-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These mutants may, however, be rescued in transfection assays by added C14:0, C16:0, or C16:1 fatty acids, yielding transcriptional activities in the wild type range (12Hertz R. Ben-Haim N.

In contrast to activation by C14–C16 fatty acids, the transcriptional activity of HNF-4α is robustly suppressed by long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. C20: 5(n-3), C22:6(n-3)) or by xenobiotic hypolipidemic amphipathic carboxylates (e.g. Medica analogues) (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 11Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Modulation of HNF-4α activity in transfection assays by amphipathic carboxylates is limited by their intracellular conversion to their respective acyl-CoAs, and amphipathic carboxylates that, due to structural constraints, do not serve as substrates for the acyl-CoA synthase fail to modulate HNF-4α transcriptional activity (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 11Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Activation/inhibition of HNF-4α transcriptional activity by acyl-CoAs results from modulation of the binding affinity of HNF-4α to its DNA cognate enhancers, and/or shifting the equilibrium between active HNF-4α dimers and inactive monomers/oligomers, and/or modulating its transactivation capacity (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 11Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem.

In apparent contrast to the above, the truncated rat and human HNF-4α(aa133–382) recombinants that lack the F-domain have recently been shown by x-ray crystallography combined with mass spectrometry analysis to consist of tightly bound nonexchangeable fatty acids, in a molar ratio of 1.0 per HNF-4α monomer, within a narrow pocket estimated at 370 Å3 (14Dhe-Paganon S.

Similarly, a fatty acid pocket, estimated at 626 Å3 and containing bound fatty acids in a molar ratio of 1.0 per monomer, has been reported for the HNF-4γ(aa103–408) subtype, solved with its intact F-domain being unstructured in the electron density map (16Wisely G.B. Miller A.B. Davis R.G. Thornquest Jr., A.D. Johnson R. Spitzer T. Sefler A. Shearer B. Moore J.T. Miller A.B. Willson T.M. Williams S.P. Structure (Camb). 2002; 10: 1225-12234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The rHNF-4α(aa133–382) dimer has been further reported to consist of an “open” and “closed” monomers having their H12 helices in the extended and clamped configurations, respectively, independently of their respective pockets being both occupied by fatty acids (14Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The clamped configuration of the dimer was only enforced upon crystallizing the truncated hHNF-4α(aa133–382) protein in the presence of SRC1-derived coactivator peptide (15Duda K. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23311-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data taken together with the acyl-CoA binding and transfection data leave unanswered the following questions: (a) The entrapped fatty acids, claimed to be nonexchangeable with added fatty acids, the independence of HNF-4α active/clamped configuration on its fatty acid occupancy, and the lack of physical contact between the fatty acid pocket and the clamped H12 helix may all imply that the entrapped fatty acids may play the role of a fortuitous (17Potier N. Billas I.M. Steinmetz A. Schaeffer C. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or authentic (18Hamilton J.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) stabilizing cofactor rather than a ligand that may regulate the transcriptional activity of its nuclear receptor by on/off-induced conformational changes. (b) Nonexchangeability of the entrapped fatty acids does not conform to modulation of the transcriptional activity of HNF-4α by added fatty acids or xenobiotic amphipathic carboxylates in transfection assays (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 11Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22578-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). (c) Because both the entrapped fatty acids and the agonist ligands of HNF-4α consist of C14-C16 fatty acids (12Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N. Schroeder F. Bar-Tana J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), transcriptional activation of HNF-4α by its agonist ligands does not conform with replacement of the entrapped fatty acids with the same fatty acids added in the medium. (d) The entrapped-fatty acid content remains essentially unaffected by MODY-1 missense mutations or in HNF-4α variants mutated in amino acids aligning the fatty acid pocket, despite robust differences in transcriptional activity between wild type HNF-4α and its respective mutants (12Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N. Schroeder F. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22578-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The above discrepancies could perhaps be compromised by assuming that modulation of HNF-4α transcriptional activity by added free acids in transfection assays was accounted for by their endogenous conversion to respective acyl-CoAs of high binding affinity (nanomolar range) (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 10Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), followed by replacing the entrapped fatty acids with the respective acyl-CoAs. However, the fatty acid pocket of HNF-4α estimated at 370 Å3 is on the verge of accommodating long chain free fatty acids (estimated at 400–500 Å3 (19Small D.M. Hanahan D. The Physical Chemistry of Lipids: from Alkanes to Phospholipids. Plenum Press, New York1986: 233-340Crossref Google Scholar)) and is apparently too limited in volume to accommodate respective acyl-CoAs. One is therefore left with the unsolved riddle of a fatty acid pocket of questionable relevance together with acyl-CoA effects mediated by yet unproved acyl-CoA site. The present report defines a distinctive acyl-CoA thioesterase site of HNF-4α and characterizes its functional relationship with the free fatty acid pocket of HNF-4α. Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—Full-length rat HNF-4α1 cDNA cloned into 6His-pET11d plasmid was from S. Malik (20Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rat C-terminal His-tagged HNF-4α1(aa132–455) recombinant was prepared by PCR using the sense 5′-CCGGCTCGAGGATGGCTTCCTGCTT and antisense 5′-GCGCCATATGAGGTCAAGCTACGAG primers, followed by cloning the PCR product into the NdeI/XhoI site of pET21b plasmid (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). Rat N-terminal His-tagged HNF-4α1(aa132–410) recombinant was prepared by PCR using the sense 5′-CATGCCATGGGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCACAGGTCAAGCTACGAG and antisense 5′-GAAGATCTCTAGGTGGACATCTGTCC primers, followed by cloning the PCR product into pET11d plasmid. Rat N-terminal His-tagged HNF-4α1(aa132–370) recombinant was prepared by PCR using the sense 5′-CATGCCATGGGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCACAGGTCAAGCTACGAG and antisense 5′-GAAGATCTCTAGGCAGACCCTCCAAG primers, followed by cloning the PCR product into pET11d plasmid. Murine HNF-4γ cDNA was from G. Schutz (Heidelberg, Germany). The His-tagged HNF-4γ recombinant was prepared by PCR using the sense 5′-CATATGGACAGTTCTGCCCCA and antisense 5′-CTCGAGTCACAGCTGCTTTTGCTT primers, followed by cloning the PCR product into pET11d plasmid. Recombinant plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLyS strain, and the His-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel nitrilotriacetic resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and stored at –70 °C. Recombinant mPPARα and hRXRα proteins were prepared as previously described (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Purity of recombinants proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and amounted to 70–90%. Thioesterase Activity—Unless otherwise indicated, the thioesterase activity of HNF-4 recombinants was measured using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (21Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20862) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.05 mm DTNB, 15–30 μg of the indicated HNF-4 recombinant, and the respective acyl-CoA as indicated in a final volume of 3.0 ml. The reaction was started with the addition of the acyl-CoA substrate and was followed spectrophotometrically (E412 = 13,600 m–1cm–1) (21Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20862) Google Scholar). The thioesterase activity of HNF-4 recombinants was also measured radioactively by following the hydrolysis of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 0.2–1.0 μm 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), and 0.1–1.0 μg of recombinant HNF-4 in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA. Following 5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.0 ml of Dole reagent (22Bar-Tana J. Rose G. Shapiro B. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thioesterase activity represents initial rates under conditions of linearity with protein concentrations. Analysis of Free Fatty Acids and Fatty Acyl Esters Content of HNF-4α—350 μg of HNF-4α1 protein samples were mixed with 5.0 nmol of C17:0 serving as internal standard and were extracted with 10 volumes of chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v). Free fatty acid content and composition were analyzed by reacting the N2-dried organic extract at room temperature in the dark for 30 min with a mixture containing 50 μl of methanol, 50 μl of 0.08 m trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD) in heptane and 60 μl of ether. Following derivatization, the mixture was dried under N2, dissolved in chloroform and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Alternatively, total fatty acid content and composition were analyzed by reacting the N2-dried organic extract for 90 min with 350 μl of 0.3 n H2SO4 in methanol at 95 °C, followed by adding 350 μlofH2O and 1 ml of heptane. The mixture was well mixed and centrifuged, and the upper phase was evaporated, dissolved in chloroform, and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out using a Quatro II Micromass quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a DB-5MS gas chromatograph (capillary column 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm (J&W Scientific)), programmed for a 130 °C to 220 °C temperature increase at 8.4 °C/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode at ionization energy of 70 eV and source temperature of 190 °C, using total ion current scanning mode and a scan range of 150–450 m/z. Methyl esters were identified by their respective retention time, molecular ion, and fragmentation pattern based on known standards. Fatty Acids Displacement and Profiling—350 μg of HNF-4α1 protein samples were incubated for 30 min with fatty acid or fatty acyl-CoA as indicated in 1.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, followed by adding 70 μl of charcoal-coated dextran solution (3% charcoal and 0.3% dextran in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was well mixed and centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with 2–4 nmol of C17:0 serving as internal standard, lyophilized to dryness, derivatized by H2SO4-methanol, and subjected to fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described above. Hexadecyl-CoA Binding—Recombinant HNF-4α1 was desalted by Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm mercaptoethanol. Protein samples of 200 μg and 10 μm hexadecyl-CoA were incubated for 25 min at room temperature in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm mercaptoethanol in a final volume of 1 ml, followed by adding 70 μl of charcoal-coated dextran solution. The mixture was well mixed and centrifuged, and the supernatant was divided into 15-μg protein samples and lyophilized. For hexadecyl-CoA spiking, 0.25 nmol of hexadecyl-CoA was added to every other sample prior to lyophilization. Lyophilized samples were dissolved in acetonitrile:100 mm KH2PO4 (60:40) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried, dissolved in isopropanol:1 mm acetic acid (80: 20), kept for 30 min at –70 °C, and centrifuged, and then the second supernatant was dried and dissolved in 30 μl of acetonitrile:H2O (60: 40), containing 0.05% triethylamine and 0.3 nmol of C17:0-CoA as internal standard. Hexadecyl-CoA content was analyzed by negative ESI using Micromass Quatro II tandem mass spectrometer at cone voltage of 35 V and electrospray source temperature of 85 °C. The sample was pumped into the ESI source at 30 μl/min through a 10-μl injector loop connected to the ESI source via a fused silica capillary tube. The inflowing material was scanned within the range of 400–600 m/z at a scan duration of 1.3 s using Continuum Scan mode. Hexadecyl-CoA was identified by its m/z 495, corresponding to the (M-2H)/2 doubly charged molecular ion. C17:0-CoA (m/z 509) served as internal standard. Data processing was carried out using the Masslynx program. C12-Bodipy Binding and Displacement—Binding of C12-Bodipy (4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid, Molecular Probes) to HNF-4α1 was measured by incubating C12-Bodipy and HNF-4α1 as indicated in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 80 μl in Cellstar 96-well black polystyrene Tissue Culture-treated plates (Greiner, Utah). Following 10–60 min of equilibration, fluorescence polarization was measured with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 530 nm for 0.1 s at medium attenuation, using an Analyst HT assay detection system with a dichroic mirror of 500 nm and 495/505 nm filters. Competition by added free acids, acyl-CoA esters, or hexadecyl-CoA ether was measured by adding the respective ligand as indicated to a reaction mixture containing 0.1 μm C12-Bodipy and 3.0 μm HNF-4α1. Reaction mixtures lacking HNF-4α1 served as negative controls. Transient Transfection—COS7 cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, were transfected for 6 h by the calcium phosphate method. Following transfection the medium was changed and the cells were incubated for 40 h with additions as indicated. Carnitine acetyl transferase activity in cell extracts was normalized to β-galactosidase and used as internal control for transfection. Statistics—When two groups were compared, Student's t test was used. When more than two groups were compared, analysis of variance was used. Differences between means were analyzed by using the Bonferroni test. Materials—Fatty acids were from Sigma. 13C16:1 (99%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. C12-Bodipy was from Molecular Probes. M16 was synthesized as previously described (23Bar-Tana J. Rose-Kahn G. Srebnik M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8404-8410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acyl-CoAs were synthesized and purified as described previously (24Kawaguchi A. Yoshimura T. Okuda S. J. Biochem. (Japan). 1981; 89: 2337-2339Google Scholar). Hexadecyl-CoA was synthesized and purified as described before (25Rosendal J. Ertbjerg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA Biding Site and the Thioesterase Activity of HNF-4α—The acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of HNF-4α was evaluated by the generation of free CoA using DTNB, or by following the hydrolysis of radioactively labeled 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA. C14:0-CoA (Fig. 1A) and C20:5-CoA (not shown), representing an agonist and antagonist fatty acyl-CoA ligands of HNF-4α, respectively (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), were both hydrolyzed by the full-length rHNF-4α1 recombinant, yielding Km values of 3.0–5.0 μm and Vm values of 0.6–1.0 and 1.0–1.5 nmol of acyl-CoA/nmol rHNF-4α1·min for C14:0-CoA and C20:5-CoA, respectively. Acyl-CoA hydrolysis by HNF-4α1 was catalyzed by HNF-4α1-LBD(aa132–455) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the Km and Vm values for C14:0-CoA hydrolysis by rHNF-4α1(aa132–455), consisting of the E-F domains but lacking the N-terminal AF-1 domain as well as the DNA-binding domain, amounted to 1.5 ± 0.2 μm and 1.7 ± 0.4 nmol of acyl-CoA/nmol HNF-4α1·min, respectively, exceeding the activity of the full-length rHNF-4α1. Recombinant rHNF-4α1(aa132–455), further purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography, catalyzed similar rates of acyl-CoA hydrolysis. Furthermore, truncated rHNF-4α1-LBD recombinants lacking the F-domain (e.g. HNF-4α(aa132–370) or HNF-4α(aa132–410)) were defective in hydrolyzing acyl-CoA, as verified by the DTNB method (Fig. 1B) or by the more sensitive 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis (not shown), indicating that the F-domain was required for the acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of HNF-4α1-LBD. The substrate specificity of HNF-4α1 thioesterase conformed to the binding specificity of HNF-4α fatty acyl ligands (9Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Thus, nonsubstituted fatty acyl-CoAs higher than C8, including saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and dioic (e.g. C16: 0DICA) fatty acyl-CoAs, served as substrates for HNF-4α1 thioesterase (Fig. 1C). CoA thioesters of substituted dioic acids of the Medica series, previously reported to bind to HNF-4α and in"

These findings suggestthat swelling-induced Src regulates cytoskeletal dynamics, through Vav, andfluid efflux, through PLCγ, and thus can coordinate structuralreorganization with fluid balance to maintain cellular integrity. Cells swell in response to a variety of stimuli and must restore theirvolume in the continued presence of osmotic challenge to survive. Such stimuliexert mechanical strain on the structural components of the cell throughincreased fluid pressure, which must be diminished to maintain cellularintegrity. In many cell types, restoration of volume is achieved byintracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which triggers fluid andelectrolyte efflux through plasma membrane ion channels(1McCarty N.A. O'Neil R.G.

In addition to the restoration of fluid balance, a swollen cell mustreorganize its disrupted cytoskeleton. Recent observations suggest that thisis achieved by signaling through integrins(4Carton I.

In response to swelling,the Rho family GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, are activated to form membraneprotrusions identical to those seen following integrin engagement(4Carton I. Hermans D. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C935-C944Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Src tyrosine kinases havealso been shown to be activated upon cell swelling via a mechanism consistentwith integrin dependence, and kinase activity appears to be required forvolume recovery (5vom Dahl S.

Takentogether, these findings suggest that integrins are involved in transducingosmotic signals to initiate cell volume recovery through the activation of Src(5vom Dahl S. Schliess F. Reissmann R.

Hermans D. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C935-C944Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Integrins transduce signals from many types of mechanical stimuli distinctfrom osmotic stress, and these can lead to activation of Src family kinases.Integrins also function as mechanosensors during cell migration, and similardownstream effectors, including Src and Rho GTPases, are often activated bymechanotransduction and cell motility(6Katsumi A. Orr A.W. Tzima E. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12001-12004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In mechanotransduction,integrins activate Src independently of whether the force initiates fromoutside or from within the cell(7Galbraith C.G. Yamada K.M. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). If integrin activation ofSrc during volume control is similar to integrin activation of Src throughmechanotransduction and migration, the regulation of downstream pathways mayshare similarities. In cell migration, Rho GTPases regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics throughdiverse activators and effectors(8Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The functions of the RhoGTPases, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, must be spatially and temporally balanced forproductive motility to occur(9Cox E.A. Sastry S.K. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and Rac1 help toinitiate cell migration via mediators that trigger the formation of an actinpolymerization complex at the leading edge, where localized actinpolymerization provides the force necessary to form a membrane protrusion(10Adams J.C. J. CellSci. 2002; 115: 257-265Google Scholar, 11Pantaloni D. Le Clainche C. Carlier M.F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 12Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G.

Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) to form stress fibers tomediate contractile forces requisite for cell motility(16Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), and it then recruits Src(17Fincham V.J. Unlu M. Brunton V.G. Pitts J.D. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1551-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) to regulate the formationof focal adhesions (18Volberg T. Romer L. Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Atthe rear of the cell, RhoA mediates disassembly of focal adhesions in aSrc-dependent fashion (19Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat.Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar).Thus, through the coordinate activation and inhibition of Rho GTPases, Srcacts to control the spatial and temporal action of cytoskeletal regulatorsrequired for optimal cell migration(20Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar). A variety of activators for Rho family members, guanine nucleotide exchangefactors, can interact with Cdc42 and/or Rac1(21Schmidt A. Hall A. GenesDev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), and a number of theseguanine nucleotide exchange factors have been implicated in cell spreading andmigration (13Servitja J.M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).One of these, Vav, is known to be activated by Src(26Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and such activation hasbeen shown to be dependent on integrin engagement during cell spreading(27Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, aSrc-Vav2 complex has been shown to regulate Rac activation and Rhoinactivation during growth factor-stimulated cell migration(28Meng W. Numazaki M. Takeuchi K. Uchibori Y. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tominaga M. Tominaga T. EMBOJ. 2004; 23: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to theguanine nucleotide exchange factors DOCK180 and Tiam1, Vav can activate Cdc42,in addition to Rac1 (29Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), andVav2 is ubiquitously expressed(30Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore sought todetermine whether Vav was linked to swelling-mediated protrusion formation,and if so, whether it was activated by Src. Cell volume regulation is critical to maintenance of normal organ levelfunction in liver, which is subjected to osmotic stresses that result from theuptake and metabolism of nutrients absorbed from the gut after each meal(31Dunkelberg J.C. Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,32Haussinger D. Prog. LiverDis. 1996; 14: 29-53PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery fromhepatocellular swelling requires fluid and electrolyte efflux through specificactivation of K+ and Cl– channels(33Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol.Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). We have found that thisprocess is triggered by stimulation of PLCγ, generation of inositol1,4,5-trisphosphate, and release of Ca2+ from internal stores viaactivation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors(2Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,3Moore A.L. Roe M.W. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34030-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, PLCγactivity has been shown to be essential for cell migration(34Katterle Y. Brandt B.H. Dowdy S.F. Niggemann B. Zanker K.S. Dittmar T. Br. J.Cancer. 2004; 90: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and PLCγ has beenshown to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to mechanicalstrain (35Liu M. Qin Y. Liu J. Tanswell A.K. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, wesought to determine whether volume-sensitive activation of PLCγ, and byextension, activation of volume-sensitive ion channels were dependent on Srcactivity. In this work, we investigated whether in response to cell swelling, Srccould function to coordinate dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and theopening of volume-sensitive ion channels by activation of different effectorswithin the cell. Our findings suggest that through the recruitment andactivation of Vav and PLCγ, Src coordinates the reorganization of theactin cytoskeleton with activation of ion channels to promote cell volumerecovery. Reagents and Antibodies—The acetoxymethyl ester of calceinand fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Alexa 488-, Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbitand anti-mouse antibodies, and Alexa 647-conjugated phalloidin were purchasedfrom Molecular Probes. Activated phosphotyrosine-specific PLCγ1(Tyr-783) and phosphotyrosine-specific Src family (Tyr-416) rabbit antibodieswere obtained from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (clone4G10) as well as its agarose conjugate, monoclonal phosphotyrosine-specificSrc family (Tyr-416) antibody (clone 9A6), and monoclonal pp60Src antibody(clone GD11), as well as the GD11-agarose conjugate, were purchased fromUpstate Biotechnology. Monoclonal mouse anti-FAK antibody was fromTransduction Laboratories. Activated phosphotyrosine-specific FAK (Tyr-397)rabbit antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE International. Vav-2 goatantibody, activated phosphotyrosine-specific Vav-2 (Tyr-172) rabbit antibody,actin goat antibody, and donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase secondaryantibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. (We assume that thephosphotyrosine-specific Vav2 antibody may cross-react withtyrosine-phosphorylated Vav1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav3 based on theproperties of a similarly produced antibody(36Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and after consultationwith Santa Cruz Biotechnology about the antibody purification.) Horseradishperoxidase-, Cy3-, and Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondaryantibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory. PP2(4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine),PP3 (4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine), and phosphataseinhibitor mixture Set II were from Calbiochem. Complete protease inhibitormixture was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cells and Cell Culture—HTC rat hepatoma cells were culturedas previously described (37Lidofsky S.D. Roman R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G849-G853PubMed Google Scholar).Except where noted, cells were placed in an isotonic (∼300 mOsm) standardextracellular solution (SES). SES contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1 KH2PO4,10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Cell swelling was produced by exposure to ahypotonic solution. Unless specified, the hypotonic solution (∼240 mOsm)was identical to SES, except that the concentration of NaCl was 84mm. All experiments were performed at room temperature except wherenoted. For some experiments, cells were transfected with a pcDNA plasmidencoding mouse c-Src (a generous gift of Dr. Anthony Morielli) using Superfect(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Live Cell Imaging and Cell Volume Analysis—Three-dimensionalreconstruction of real time high-resolution images of cells undergoinghypotonic challenge were performed as follows. Cells plated on coverslips wereincubated with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (5 μm) in SES. Cellswere then placed in a perfusion chamber housed on the stage of a DeltaVisionRestoration Olympus IX70 microscope and imaged at 19 °C, with a ×40oil lens, NA 1.35, and a Coolsnap camera (HQ Photometrics). The fluorescenceexcitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 530 nm, respectively. Timelapse data were collected using 20 1-μm steps (with each fullz-series acquired at 1-min intervals). In the fifth minute, thecontinuous SES perfusion was changed to hypotonic extracellular solution andthe experiments continued for a total of 30 min. Data collection,deconvolution, and mathematical analysis of cell volume were made usingDeltaVision software softWoRx version 3.2 (Applied Precision). Deconvolutionproceeded by the standard algorithm, and the three-dimensional visualizationby the quick projection option. The mathematical analysis proceeded by carefulthresholding of the signal such that two-dimensional polygons of each cellslice were defined in each z section. The validity was confirmed byvisual inspection of each z-section. The volume calculations builtthree-dimensional polygons from these thresholded images. Images wereminimally processed using Adobe Photoshop V7 software. Alterations in cell size were also determined by measurement ofcross-sectional area, which has been shown to reflect changes in liver cellvolume following osmotic challenge(38Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips wereincubated with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester, and placed in a perfusion chamber(Warner Instruments RC-26G) on the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200fluorescence microscope. Cell area was determined from fluorescent imagestaken, using a ×40 oil objective, NA 1.3, by a Hamamatsu Orca-ERC4742–95 digital camera and quantified using MetaMorph Version 4.6r4integrated morphometry analysis software (Universal Imaging). The fluorescenceexcitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 530 nm, respectively. Imageswere acquired at 30-s intervals and relative cell area (A) was calculated bydividing the measured area at a given time by the mean area measured underisotonic conditions during the 5-min period prior to hypotonic exposure. Theextent of cell volume recovery after swelling (%RVD) was calculated from theequation below, where Amax is the relative maximum cellarea after swelling, and A15 is the relative cell area 15min after hypotonic exposure.%RVD=(Amax−A15Amax−1)×100(Eq. 1) Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Extraction ofwhole cell lysates and immunoprecipitations were performed as previouslydescribed (3Moore A.L. Roe M.W. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34030-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In selectedexperiments, crude membrane and cytosolic fractions were obtained as follows.Ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF,1 mm Na orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, with complete protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor)was added to the cells, and the plates were left on ice for 10 min. Cells werethen scraped off and homogenized (Duall 20 with Teflon pestle) and thencentrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. Equal volumes of homogenateswere then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The cytosolicsupernatant was carefully removed, and the crude membrane pellet wassolubilized in the same volume buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1%sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) withvortexing. Proteins were resolved by SDS electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels,transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with appropriateprimary antibodies, as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were detectedby exposure to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit,anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal,Pierce). Densitometric analysis was performed using an Alpha Imager 2000(Alpha Innotech). Immunofluorescence and Colocalization Analysis—Cells seededonto glass coverslips were grown overnight, and the culture medium replacedwith L15 medium with 10% calf serum at room temperature. To start theexperiment, medium was then replaced with either SES (isotonic) or hypotonicextracellular solution (hypotonic). At designated times, cells were fixed with4% formaldehyde in PHEM buffer (pH 6.1) and permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100, 300 mm sucrose in PBS, as previously described(3Moore A.L. Roe M.W. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34030-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or with 0.2% SDS as notedin the figure legends. Coverslips were washed, blocked, and incubated withprimary antibody and then with fluorescent label conjugated secondary antibodyand fluorescent-labeled phalloidin. Samples were mounted onto slides withAquamount (Polysciences) and viewed on the DeltaVision Restoration microscopesystem described above with a ×60 oil lens, NA 1.4. Data were collectedusing either a Coolsnap camera (HQ Photometrics) or a CH350 CCD camera (Kodak)with different z steps as noted, and deconvolved using theDeltaVision software softWoRx version 3.2 (Applied Precision). Images wereprocessed using Adobe Photoshop V7 software without γ adjustment ofbrightness and contrast, except in Fig.4A, as noted in the figure legend. Quantification ofcolocalization was performed on a set of experiments in which there wasminimal previewing (to reduce photobleaching). Percent protrusive cells wereanalyzed by three-dimensional analysis of deconvolved z-series, andpositive cells were scored as those with protrusions detected no lower than 1μm above the base of the cell (to exclude lamellipodia). Overlap ofactivated Src and activated Vav was calculated using Volocity3 software(Improvision) on deconvolved DeltaVision files. Measurement of Membrane Currents—Whole cell currents weremeasured using patch clamp recording techniques as described previously(2Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The extracellular solutionwas SES, and the hypotonic solution was identical to SES, except that theconcentration of NaCl was 98 mm. The pipette solution contained (inmm) 10 NaCl, 130 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.30). Under these conditions, measurements at aholding potential of 0 mV reflect K+ currents, and measurements ata holding potential of –80 mV reflect Cl– currents(2Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Statistics—All results are presented as mean ± S.E.,where n represents either the number of cells, experiments, or fieldsof cells. Comparisons were made with the use of unpaired Student's ttest, or Dunnett's multiple comparison test (analysis of variance) asappropriate, and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.Correlation coefficients were determined by nonparametric statistical analysis(Spearman), and significance determined with two-tailed analysis at the 95%confidence level. The Dunnett's and Spearman analyses were determined usingPrism version 3.0cx (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Transient Membrane Protrusions Form in Response to CellSwelling—Osmotic stress induces dramatic cell shape changes in anumber of cell types (39Pfaller W. Willinger C. Stoll B. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Haussinger D. J. Cell.Physiol. 1993; 154: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar),including rapid formation of membrane protrusions in fibroblasts uponhypotonic challenge (4Carton I. Hermans D. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C935-C944Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Because we previously had observed irregular cell morphologies in connectionwith swelling-induced plasma membrane PLCγ localization in HTC hepatomacells (3Moore A.L. Roe M.W. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34030-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we investigatedwhether hypotonic exposure of these cells would elicit plasma membraneprotrusions analogous to those in fibroblasts, and how the formation ofswelling-induced membrane protrusions temporally correlated with volumerecovery. To test this, we recorded the response of live HTC cells to hypotonicexposure over time (in a room that was temperature-controlled to 19 °C).Fig. 1A depictsthree-dimensional volume projections of cells initially under isotonicconditions (300 mOsm) and then perfused with hypotonic solution (240 mOsm).Following hypotonic exposure, membrane protrusions transiently formed alongthe sides of the cells. (A video of this experiment is available in supplemental materials.) The protrusions expanded and contracted over a 3-minperiod (thin arrows), and subsequently could not be detected.Intriguingly, protrusions appeared to occur at different parts of the samecell, often adjacent to previous protrusions (such a protrusion is marked witha thick arrow.) After 4 min, few membrane protrusions were visible.Quantitative analysis of cell volume revealed that the onset of visiblemembrane protrusions occurred at the start of cell swelling(Fig. 1B). Whenprotrusion formation ceased, cell volume recovery was already well underway,but not completed. Thus, HTC cells exposed to hypotonic conditions formtransient membrane protrusions coincident with the increase in cell volume,but these cease before volume recovery is final. Activated PLCγ Associates with Src upon CellSwelling— Because Src tyrosine kinases can be activated byintegrins and subsequently can induce the activation of PLCγ, andPLCγ is activated by cell swelling(3Moore A.L. Roe M.W. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34030-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we sought to determinewhether Src may play a role in volume-sensitive PLCγ activation. Firstwe tested whether Src was activated upon cell swelling. Following hypotonicexposure, the amount of activated Src kinase in cell lysates, as determined byimmunoblot analysis, rapidly peaked and fell to basal values (data not shown).To assess whether Src associated in a complex with PLCγ in response tohypotonic stimulus, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Src with a pp60Srcantibody and then probed an immunoblot with activated Src and activatedPLCγ antibodies. In response to hypotonic challenge, activatedPLCγ co-immunoprecipitated with pp60Src. Both activated Src andactivated PLCγ in the immunoprecipitate rapidly increased within 30 s,and peak activation occurred at ∼1–2 min(Fig. 2A). (The timecourse of activation was more rapid than the appearance of membraneprotrusions from the live cell work (done at 19 °C), but similar toimmunofluorescence findings, which were also performed at room temperature,cf. Fig. 3). Of note,the kinetics of swelling-induced Src and PLCγ activation were similar.As shown in Fig. 2B,there was a significant correlation between tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcand of PLCγ in Src immunoprecipitates within the first 4 min followinghypotonic exposure. To confirm that Src activation correlated with itsmembrane association, we examined the amount of activated Src from crudemembrane fractions and from cytosolic fractions of lysates(Fig. 2C). In responseto hypotonic exposure, a time-dependent increase in activated Src was seen inmembrane but not cytosolic fractions, with kinetics similar to those describedabove. Together, these observations suggest that cell swelling elicitstransient increases in Src association with the membrane, in Src activation bytyrosine phosphorylation, and in Src association with PLCγ.Fig. 3Localization of Src in response to hypotonic exposure. A,endogenous Src is found in membrane protrusions upon swelling. Cells grown oncoverslips were treated with hypotonic media for different times at roomtemperature, fixed, and stained for endogenous Src (red, CY3) and forF-actin (green, fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin). Twentyz-steps of 1 μm were taken and deconvolved. The images shown areof the 1-μm section that is 4 μm above the base of the cell. The 0.25-and 0.5-min split panels indicate that boxed cells were moved from the samefield to fit the depiction at this magnification: 30 μmtothe left and 7μm up, respectively. The scale bar is 15 μm. B,activated Src is found in swelling-induced protrusions on the sides of cells.c-Src-transfected cells were exposed to hypotonic solution for differentamounts of time prior to fixation and staining for activated Src (pY-Src,red, CY3), using the rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine-Src antibody and F-actin(green, fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin). Protrusions withelevated activated Src signal are marked with arrows. The imagesshown correspond to 0.2-μm z-sections 3.6–4 μm above thebase of the cells. The scale bar is 15 μm.

Cells were transiently transfected withc-Src, and treated as in A, except that an antibody aga"
https://openalex.org/W1987828713,"A selective switch from expression of Shc1 gene to Shc3 occurs with maturation of neuronal precursors into postmitotic neurons. Previous studies showed that in the embryo, Shc1 is maximally expressed in dividing CNS stem cells while it is silenced in mature neurons, where it is replaced by Shc3. Under normal conditions Shc3 is never expressed by glial cells. We now show that in human astrocytomas and glioblastomas, the normal pattern of expression of Shc1/Shc3 is totally subverted, both proteins being present at the same time and in the same cells. Our data indicate that Shc3 is maximally expressed, together with Shc1, in glioblastoma, a highly proliferative tumor with little, if any, indication of neuronal differentiation. In primary cultures of glioblastoma, tumor cells maintain Shc1 expression but downregulate Shc3. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of Shc3 in human glioblastoma tumor samples in vivo indicates that it is tyrosine phosphorylated. Finally, we found that the expression of truncated variants of Shc3 with dominant-negative effects in human high-grade glioma cells that maintain Shc3 expression in vitro leads to a decreased Akt posphorylation and increased apoptosis, thus resulting in impaired survival of the transfected cells. These data suggest that Shc molecules play an important role in glioblastoma cell growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2072488631,"Nerve growth factor and its high-affinity receptor TrkA are thought to be involved in the progression of various cancers. This study investigated the mechanism that regulates aberrant or increased TrkA expression in various cancer cell lines and in the course of pancreatic cancer progression. We found that the negative cis-acting AP-1-like sequence TGAGCGA was located in the 5′-untranslated region of the TrkA gene. Sodium bisulfite mapping revealed that steady-state TrkA expression correlated positively with the accumulation of methylated CpG around the AP-1-like site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the AP-1-like site was bound mainly by c-Jun homodimers; the binding was directly blocked by Sss I methylase-induced methylation or by an excess of oligonucleotides containing consensus AP-1 sequences. Consequently, activation of TrkA gene expression by methylation was considered to be caused by the direct interference of c-Jun binding to the negatively regulating AP-1-like site. Furthermore, the accumulation of methylated CpG around the AP-1-like site was also observed with increased TrkA immunohistochemical staining in cases of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with extensive perineural invasion. Unlike global methylation at CpG islands that leads to gene silencing, specific methylation at non-CpG islands would play a crucial epigenetic role in the versatility and plasticity of TrkA expression during cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2151100956,"Regulatory proteins often communicate with each other to manage various cellular processes. Such interactions mostly rely on the recognition of small peptide motifs. The activity of other regulatory proteins depends on small molecular weight effectors and allostery. We demonstrate the in vivo regulation of the tetracycline-dependent Tet repressor by an oligopeptide fused to the N or C terminus of thioredoxin A. The binding site of the peptide overlaps but is not identical with the tetracycline binding site. Several TetR mutants that are non-inducible by tetracycline also respond to the peptide. This demonstrates for the first time the conversion of a small molecular weight effector-dependent regulator to a protein-protein contact-dependent potential member of designed signaling chains.

Biological signaling involves allosteric proteins triggered by either small effector molecules or by other proteins. The importance of protein-protein interaction networks is highlighted by the efforts to unravel so-called interactomes (1Li S. et al.Science. 2004; 303: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 2Lu H. Zhu X. Liu H. Skogerbo G. Zhang J. Zhang Y. Cai L. Zhao Y. Sun S. Xu J. Bu D. Chen R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4804-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) describing all possible interactions of proteins encoded by a respective genome. Because many interactions take place between small domains that recognize short linear peptide motifs (3Pawson T. Cell. 2004; 116: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 4Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), as opposed to discontinuous motifs requiring a correctly folded structure, there is also the expectation of determining generally valid rules governing such interactions. Hence, the primary structures of many different protein recognition modules and their matching partners have been identified (5Castagnoli L. Costantini A. Dall'Armi C. Gonfloni S.

Such continuous peptide motifs usually consist of only a few residues resembling low molecular weight effectors in their size. Tet repressor (TetR) 1The abbreviations used are: TetR, Tet repressor; tc, tetracycline; TrxA, thioredoxin A; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; sc, single chain; lacZ, β-galactosidase. is one of the most intensely studied transcriptional regulators. It responds to tetracycline (tc) and some of its derivatives (8Berens C. Hillen W. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering. 26. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2004: 255-277Google Scholar). Here, we ask the question if TetR may also be controlled by a peptide either isolated or fused to a larger protein. This would establish the first example of converting a small molecular weight effector-dependent protein into a potential member of a signaling chain depending on protein-protein recognition. TetR is a very suitable candidate for this approach; it is structurally, biochemically, and genetically well characterized and belongs to the Tet/Cam family of regulators (9Aramaki H. Yagi N. Suzuki M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Members of that family, like QacR (10Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), EthR (11Dover L.G. Corsino P.E. Daniels I.R. Cocklin S.L. Tatituri V. Besra G.S. Fütterer K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and CprB (12Natsume R. Ohnishi Y. Senda T. Horinouchi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), share the same overall peptide fold with TetR and yet exhibit remarkable divergence concerning primary structure, DNA sequence recognition, and effector binding. The structural changes leading to induction in QacR and TetR are somewhat similar. Nevertheless, their respective inducers bind with different stoichiometries to different parts of that fold. Ligand binding to TetR is very specific and occurs in a binding pocket located within the protein core formed by both subunits. In contrast, inducer binding to QacR takes place in a spacious and hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the protein, where structurally diverse cationic lipophilic compounds, e.g. malachite green, rhodamine 6G, or ethidium (13Grkovic S. Hardie K.M. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15226-15236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are recognized. Even simultaneous binding of two different drugs is productive for induction (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Taken together, allostery can clearly be triggered from different sites in the QacR/TetR protein fold. We describe here the isolation of an oligopeptide fused to thioredoxin A (TrxA) that is able to induce TetR-controlled transcription in Escherichia coli. Mutational analyses highlight that residues within the tetracycline binding pocket and solvent-exposed residues of α8 and α9 contribute to peptide recognition. That non-tc-inducible TetR mutants also respond to the peptide establishes a new mode of triggering allostery and offers the possibility of specific induction by any protein tagged with this peptide. Phage Display—The selection of TetR-binding peptides was performed using the Ph.D.-12™ Phage Display peptide library (New England Biolabs). Biopanning experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, NUNC Maxisorb tubes were coated with TetR(B) derived from Tn10 (15Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with bovine serum albumin for 2 h. After incubation with Ph.D.-12™, bound phages were eluted in the first round with a glycine buffer at pH 2.2. From round 2 on, the eluate from round 1 was split into two pools that were eluted either specifically with TetR (100 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, equivalent to 4 μm) or non-specifically by low pH. The recovered phages were amplified in E. coli JM101 (16Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar), and the phage titer was determined on X-gal/IPTG plates as plaque-forming units per milliliter. After the third round of selection, single phage clones were prepared, and double-stranded M13 DNA was isolated (NucleoSpin, Macherey and Nagel) and characterized by dideoxy sequencing. Binding of single phages to TetR was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Wells were coated with TetR, whereas bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated wells were used as a negative control. After the addition of phage clones, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody was used to detect M13 binding according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tested candidates yielded absorption ratios (ATetR/ABSA) of 4 up to 34 (peptide Bs1) for 1010 plaque-forming units/well. Purification of TetR—E. coli RB791 was transformed with the overexpression plasmid pWH610 (17Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 742: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) encoding for TetR(B) or TetR(BD) wild type or with the overexpression plasmid pWH1950 (18Kintrup M. Schubert P. Kunz M. Chabbert M. Alberti P. Bombarda E. Schneider S. Hillen W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) encoding for a tryptophan-free mutant TetR(B)W43Y,W75F. Cells were grown at 28 °C for TetR(B) and TetR(BD) and at 20 °C for the Trp-free variant. Purification was done as described previously (17Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 742: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy; their activities were determined by fluorescence titration with tetracycline. In Vivo System—The phage λtet50 was isolated from the E. coli strain NK5031(λtet50) (19Smith L.D. Bertrand K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by induction with mitomycin C (5 μg/ml). The phage was integrated into the genome of E. coli DH5α by lysogenic transfer, and positive clones were screened on X-gal plates. The gene encoding for TrxA was amplified by standard colony PCR using the oligonucleotides trxA(5′), 5′-CTCGAGAAGCTTAACAAAAATTAGGAATTAATGATGAGCGATAAAATTATTCACCTGACT-3′, and trxA(3′), 5′-ATAATACCATGGCTGCAGATATGCAATGAGCTCCACCCGACGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAGGAACTC-3′, which introduce the restriction sites for HindIII and NcoI, allowing cloning into the plasmid pWH610, and restriction sites for PstI and BsrDI for cloning of the in vitro selected peptides. After removing 2 BsrDI and 2 PstI sites via oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis, the plasmid was termed pWH2100. Peptides encoded by selected phages were amplified from isolated M13 DNA using the oligonucleotide bank(5′), 5′-CCTTTAGTGTGCAGTTTCTATTCTCACTCT-3′, and bank(3′), 5′-ATAATACTGCAGACTTTCAACAGTTTCTTACGAACCTCCACC-3′, introducing restriction sites for PstI and BsgI for cloning into pWH2100. The construct encoding for TrxA(C)-Bs1 was termed pWH2101. The lacIq-encoding fragment was cut out of pWH844 (20Schirmer F. Ehrt S. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into pWH510 (21Altschmied L. Baumeister R. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or pWH1411 (22Baumeister R. Müller G. Hecht B. Hillen W. Proteins. 1992; 14: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to obtain pWH527 and pWH1413, respectively. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-TetR(B) antibody revealed an ∼8-fold higher expression of TetR in pWH1413 compared with pWH527. XbaI and NcoI cut fragments encoding for sc TetR(B) or TetR(BD) were cloned into likewise digested pWH527 to obtain pWH528 and pWH529, respectively. Cloning of N-terminal trxA Fusions and trxA Insertions—trxA was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′trxA-NT, 5′-ATCGTCTAGAAGCGATAAAATTATTCACC-3′ and 3′trxA-NT 5′-ATGCATCCATGGTTACGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAGG-3′, introducing restriction sites for XbaI and NcoI to allow cloning into pWH610. The resulting plasmid was named pWH2200. The sequence encoding the peptide Bs1 was amplified using the phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-pep, 5′-GGACTTGGAATGCTTATGCG-3′ and 3′-pep 5′-GAACCTCCACCACTAGGAGC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pWH2200/XbaI in which blunt ends had been generated with mung bean nuclease. The resulting plasmid was termed pWH2201. To construct the trxA-loop insertion mutant, the peptide was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′loopI, 5′-ATATCGGTCCGTCGGGTGGAGGTTGGACTTGG-3′, and 3′loopI, 5′-ATATCGGACCCGAACCTCCACCACTAGG-3′, introducing flanking AvaII restriction sites. The restricted PCR fragment was cloned into the RsrII-restricted plasmid pWH2200 to obtain pWH2203. The construction of the insertion mutant with extended linker was done using the phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′loopII, 5′-GTTCGGGTGGAGGTTCGGGTGGAGGTTGGACTTGG-3′, and 3′loopII, 5′-GACCCGAACCTCCACCCGAACCTCCACCACTAGGAGC-3′. The resulting product was cloned into the plasmid pWH2200, which was restricted with RsrII and in which blunt ends had been created using mung bean nuclease. The resulting plasmid was named pWH2204. Cloning of tetR Mutants—N82A, F86A, T103A, P105A, E147A, and E175A were constructed via oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and cloned into pWH527. The tetR mutants H64Y, H100Y, G102R, E128R**, I174T*, L176S, M177S, and D178G were cut out of pWH510 derivatives, pWH1919 derivatives (*) (23Müller G. Hecht B. Helbl V. Hinrichs W. Saenger W. Hillen W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or pWH519 derivatives (**) (24Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Berens C. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6405-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SphI- and XbaI-digested fragments were cloned into likewise digested pWH527. All constructs were sequenced before in vivo characterization. Cloning of tetR(BD) Chimeras—tetR(BD)153–167 and tetR(BD)51–141 were constructed via multiple-step PCR and cloned into pWH527. The verification chimeras tetR(BD)51–127,183–208 and tetR(BD)51–127,185–208 were constructed via multiple-step PCR and cloned into pWH1413 to obtain pWH1414-VC1 and pWH1414-VC2, respectively. The remaining chimeras were cut out of pWH610 or pWH853 derivatives (25Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) via NcoI and XbaI digestion and cloned into pWH527. All constructs were sequenced before in vivo characterization. β-Galactosidase Assays—Repression and inducibility of TetR was assayed in E. coli DH5α(λtet50). This strain was transformed with pWH527 or pWH1413 derivatives encoding for different amounts of TetR and the pWH2100/2200 plasmid series encoding for TrxA or the fusion and insertion proteins. Overnight cultures and log phase cultures were grown at 28 °C in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics, and additionally 0.2 μg/ml tc for the positive control. The fusion proteins were induced in log phase cultures using 60 μm IPTG for standard measurements. β-Galactosidase activities were determined as described by Miller (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Three independent clones for each construct combination were assayed, and experiments were repeated at least twice. Western Blot Analysis—E. coli DH5α(λtet50) was transformed with the derivatives listed in the respective β-galactosidase assays and grown under the same conditions as stated there. At an A600 of 0.4, cells were harvested, and crude lysates were prepared by sonication and centrifugation. 7.5–15 μg of crude lysate of each construct was loaded on a 14% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred (120 mA, overnight at 4 °C) to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in a Mini V8.10 blotting apparatus (Invitrogen) using a transfer buffer consisting of 10 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm Na2CO3, and 20% (v/v) methanol. After blocking with 0.2% I-Block™ (TROPIX) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, membranes were treated with a monoclonal TrxA antibody (Anti-Thio™ antibody, Invitrogen). The detection was carried out using an anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and the ECL+ kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's manual. Fluorescence Measurement—All fluorescence measurements were performed using a Spex Fluorolog 3 (Jobin Yvon). Measurements were carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.5. The temperature was set to 28 °C. In fluorescence titrations with tc to determine the activity of TetR, the excitation wavelength was set to 370 nm, and emission was detected at 515 nm. For characterization of the TetR-peptide interaction, the excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm. The spectra were integrated from 320 to 380 nm to obtain the data for TetR-peptide complexes at various TetR concentrations. The KD value was calculated by a nonlinear regression fit using the program SigmaPlot 8.0. For the competition experiment, the interacting species were incubated at a concentration of 4 μm each, and fluorescence was excited with 295 nm. The different emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 620 nm. For the competition experiment and the determination of KD, the Trp-free variant TetR(B)W43Y,W75F was used. To determine the affinities of peptide Bs1 to the wild type proteins TetR(B) and TetR(BD), additional titrations were carried out. First, a solution of 2 μm peptide was titrated with increasing amounts of TetR to determine the overall fluorescence. Second, the fluorescence spectra of TetR without peptide were measured for every titration point to determine the contribution of the Trp residues to the overall fluorescence. The respective fluorescence signals were subtracted to obtain the fluorescence originating from the binding reaction. These data were then used to calculate KD. Screening in Vitro Selected TetR-binding Peptides for Induction in Vivo—We used a two-step approach to identify novel peptide-based effectors capable of inducing the transcriptional regulator TetR. First, peptides that bind to Tn10 derived TetR (15Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) were isolated by phage display. For that purpose, an M13 bacteriophage library containing about 109 different dodecapeptides fused via a Gly3-Ser-linker to the N terminus of the coat protein pIII was used in a biopanning experiment with purified TetR (17Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 742: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2500- and 400-fold increases in phage titer were achieved after three successive rounds of elution with a glycine buffer or a buffer containing 4 μm TetR, respectively, indicating enrichment of TetR binding phages (data not shown). Sequence analysis of individual clones yielded 10 different sequences containing no consensus motif. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments revealed specific binding of these M13 phages to TetR (see “Material and Methods” for details). We then constructed the E. coli strain shown in Fig. 1 to screen for peptide induction of TetR. The TetR binding peptides were expressed as fusions to the C terminus of E. coli TrxA, a small, highly soluble cytoplasmic protein (28Park S.H. Raines R.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding the peptide and the linker used for the M13 coat protein fusion was amplified by PCR from the TetR binding phages and ligated to a Ser-Gly-Gly-Ala-encoding sequence serving as a spacer at the C terminus of TrxA. In the resulting plasmids the modified trxA genes are under Ptac control. The constitutively expressed Lac and Tet repressors are encoded on a compatible low-copy plasmid. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli DH5α(λtet50) carrying a single copy tetA-lacZ transcriptional fusion under Tet-control (19Smith L.D. Bertrand K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression of the TrxA fusion proteins is induced by IPTG and would only lead to β-galactosidase expression if they, in turn, induce TetR. Identifying a TetR-inducing Fusion Protein—Screening of about 2100 peptides, obtained from panning, as C-terminal fusions to TrxA yielded one candidate called Bs1 which originates from a phage specifically eluted with TetR. Although binding of other peptides to TetR was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, no additional inducer was found. At 60 μm IPTG peptide Bs1 showed a 14-fold induction of TetR (Fig. 2). TrxA expression alone had no effect on β-galactosidase expression. Induction is specific for the class B sequence variant called TetR(B). When the protein core (residues 51–208) containing the inducer binding and dimerization domains of TetR(B) is replaced by the same region from TetR(D), another natural sequence variant, the resulting chimeric repressor protein TetR(BD) (25Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), is not induced. The sequence identity between these two TetR variants is 63% (15Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and their protein fold is identical (29Hinrichs W. Kisker C. Düvel M. Müller A. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. Science. 1994; 264: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism of peptide induction could be interference with TetR dimerization. A single-chain TetR(B) (scTetR(B)) in which the C terminus of one monomer is connected to the N terminus of the other monomer by a flexible, 29-amino acid linker is insensitive to inhibitors of dimerization (30Krueger C. Berens C. Schmidt A. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we replaced tetR(B) in the in vivo system by sc tetR(B). The results shown in Fig. 2 clearly indicate that the TrxA-Bs1 fusion protein induces sc TetR(B) to the same extent as TetR(B). We, therefore, conclude that the TrxA-Bs1 fusion does not exert its effect by interfering with TetR dimerization. Activities of Bs1 Fusions to Different Sites of TrxA—We asked if the Bs1 peptide would also be active when fused to the N terminus or inserted into the active site loop of TrxA (31Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For the latter, Bs1 was flanked by SG3 or (SG3)2 linkers. The N-terminal fusion (TrxA(N)-Bs1) is more effective, yielding about a 40-fold induction as compared with the C-terminal fusion TrxA(C)-Bs1, with about a 14-fold induction (see Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis revealed no difference in the expression levels of TrxA(C)-Bs1 and TrxA(N)-Bs1, indicating that the increased efficiency of induction is a property of the N-terminal fusion protein. None of the constructs with the peptide inserted into the active site loop of TrxA induces TetR (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis of the SG3 single spacer insertion revealed less protein compared with the C- and N-terminal fusions, even at 500 μm IPTG (Fig. 3B), but there is enough expression for induction. Thus, fusions of Bs1 to either terminus of TrxA yielded inducing proteins, whereas insertions into the active site loop of TrxA do not. This may be due to reduced conformational flexibility of Bs1 in the loop insertions. The Induction Efficiency Depends on the Concentrations of the Bs1 Peptide and TetR—We performed titration experiments varying the IPTG concentrations between 1 and 125 μm to express increasing amounts of the TrxA-Bs1 fusion proteins. The efficiencies of TrxA(C)-Bs1 and TrxA(N)-Bs1 are compared in Fig. 4A. The results clearly show that induction of TetR by both peptide fusions correlates linearly to their amounts until maximal expression is reached. Whereas induction of TetR by the C-terminal fusion increases moderately with increasing IPTG concentrations, induction of TetR by the N-terminal fusion is steeply ascending, and maximal induction is already obtained at 15 μm IPTG. This higher efficiency encouraged us to characterize this fusion protein in a system in which TetR is expressed to an ∼8-fold higher level (plasmid pWH1413). We expect a higher level of TetR to reduce the efficiency of induction. Accordingly, we obtained only a 2-fold induction with the C-terminal fusion (data not shown), whereas β-galactosidase expression is still fully induced by the N-terminal fusion, albeit at higher IPTG concentrations (Fig. 4B). The maximal β-galactosidase activity is obtained at 60 μm IPTG. Western blots carried out simultaneously clearly demonstrate a direct correlation between the expression level of the fusion protein and the degree of β-galactosidase induction. The higher induction factor of 55 compared with the factor of 40 obtained with the low TetR expression system results from a lower repressed state. Thus, the window of peptide concentrations leading to induction can be shifted by altering the steady-state level of TetR. Quantification of TetR-Peptide Interaction—Effector recognition in TetR belongs to one of the strongest interactions known for bacterial regulators and varies from a KD in the low nanomolar range for tc (32Takahashi M. Degenkolb J. Hillen W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to a picomolar range for atc (33Degenkolb J. Takahashi M. Ellestad G.A. Hillen W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Bs1 peptide with the M13 linker sequence was synthesized as an N-terminally acetylated 16-mer for binding studies. The tryptophan residues served as fluorescent probes of binding to the Trp-free TetR(B)W43Y,W75F mutant (18Kintrup M. Schubert P. Kunz M. Chabbert M. Alberti P. Bombarda E. Schneider S. Hillen W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We had previously verified that this mutant is inducible by the peptide (data not shown). The purified TetR mutant was added in increasing amounts to a solution containing 2 μm Bs1 peptide. This led to a shift in the fluorescence emission maximum from 363 nm for the free peptide to 347 nm for the complex and a 5-fold increase in quantum yield (Fig. 5A). Purified Bacillus subtilis HPr as a protein control did not yield any alterations of fluorescence (data not shown). The KD for the reaction TetR + Bs1 TetR·Bs1 is 0.64 ± 0.1 μm, as calculated from non-linear regression (Table I). Scatchard analysis confirmed this value and resulted in a linear graph indicating the absence of cooperativity (Fig. 5B). A stoichiometric titration revealed one bound peptide per TetR monomer (data not shown). The affinities of peptide Bs1 to TetR(B) and TetR(BD) were determined in a similar way, taking into account the fluorescence originating from the two Trp residues present in the respective wild type proteins by subtracting it from the total fluorescence obtained from TetRwt-peptide complexes (see “Materials and Methods” for details). This yielded a KD of 0.16 ± 0.06 μm for TetR(B), whereas TetR(BD) showed no binding of Bs1.Table IBinding affinity of TetR variants to pepBs1-AcTetR variantActivityaActivities of the proteins were determined by tc titration.KD TetR·pepBs1-AcbDissociation constants KD were determined by fluorescence titration (compare Fig. 5).%μmTetR(B)W43Y,W75F950.64 ± 0.1TetR(B)1000.16 ± 0.06TetR(BD)100NDcND, not detectable.a Activities of the proteins were determined by tc titration.b Dissociation constants KD were determined by fluorescence titration (compare Fig. 5).c ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Identification of the Peptide Binding Site on TetR—No peptide fusion, not even the highly active TrxA(N)-Bs1, is capable of inducing TetR(BD) (see Fig. 2 and Table II), indicating the importance of the protein core in TetR-peptide interaction and excluding binding of the peptide to the DNA-reading head. We exploited a set of 18 mixed sequence TetR(BD) chimeras (25Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to delineate the specificity determinant using the sensitive, low-level expression system for TetR and the C-terminal fusion as inducer. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate a specificity determinant between the N terminus of α8 to the N terminus of α10 (residues 128–187), since exchanges between these residues resulted in the loss of peptide inducibility. The introduction of the TetR(B) sequence from residues 128–182 into TetR(BD) yields a peptide-inducible variant and, thus, positively identifies this specificity determinant. Residue 183 and the residues 185–187 are identical in both sequences and, thus, cannot contribute to specificity. The contribution of residue 184 to specificity was determined by the chimeras harboring amino acids 128–184 or 128–182 of the class B sequence. Due to reduced DNA binding activity (compare Table II; no repression was observed in the low-level expression system) these had to be characterized in the medium-level TetR expression system where they are fully induced by TrxA(N)-Bs1 (Table II). These residues are, therefore, necessary and sufficient for induction by the Bs1 peptide, narrowing the specificity determinant to amino acids 128–182.Table IIInducibility of TetR variants by tc or the N-terminal TrxA-peptide fusionTetR variantsLocalization of the B sequenceβ-Galactosidase activityaβ-Galactosidase activities are given in percent of the value obtained for tc-based induction (TetR(B)), which was set to 100% (≈4500 units).tc-based inductionPeptide-based inducti"
https://openalex.org/W2142963329,"Phytol is a branched-chain fatty alcohol that is a naturally occurring precursor of phytanic acid, a fatty acid involved in the pathogenesis of Refsum disease. The conversion of phytol into phytanic acid is generally believed to take place via three enzymatic steps that involve 1) oxidation to its aldehyde, 2) further oxidation to phytenic acid, and 3) reduction of the double bond at the 2,3 position, yielding phytanic acid. Our recent investigations of this mechanism have elucidated the enzymatic steps leading to phytenic acid production, but the final step of the pathway has not been investigated so far. In this study, we describe the characterization of phytenic acid reduction in rat liver. NADPH-dependent conversion of phytenic acid into phytanic acid was detected, although at a slow rate. However, it was shown that phytenic acid can be activated to its CoA ester and that reduction of phytenoyl-CoA is much more efficient than that of phytenic acid. Furthermore, in rat hepatocytes cultured in the presence of phytol, phytenoyl-CoA could be detected, showing that it is a bona fide intermediate of phytol degradation. Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that phytenoyl-CoA reductase activity is present in peroxisomes and mitochondria. With these findings, we have accomplished the full elucidation of the mechanism by which phytol is converted into phytanic acid.

With these findings, we have accomplished the full elucidation of the mechanism by which phytol is converted into phytanic acid. The branched-chain fatty alcohol phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-en-1-ol) is abundantly present in nature as part of the chlorophyll molecule (Fig. 1). After its release from chlorophyll, phytol is converted into phytanic acid, a fatty acid that accumulates in a number of metabolic disorders. Phytanic acid has toxic effects when present at high levels in the body and therefore needs to be broken down (1Monnig G. Wiekowski J. Kirchhof P. Stypmann J. Plenz G. Fabritz L. Bruns H.J.

Because of the presence of a methyl group at the 3 position, phytanic acid cannot be degraded by β-oxidation but instead undergoes α-oxidation. In this process the carbon chain is shortened by one carbon unit to produce the 2-methyl branched-chain fatty acid, pristanic acid, which can be β-oxidized normally (4Verhoeven N.M. Jakobs C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A deficiency of α-oxidation, such as in Refsum disease, leads to markedly elevated levels of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues of patients and is thought to be the direct cause of symptoms observed in the patients, which include retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar ataxia (6Wierzbicki A.S.

Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3303-3321Google Scholar). Remarkably, very few studies have been performed on the contribution of phytol to the total intake of phytanic acid. This is most likely due to the finding that in humans only a small percentage of phytol is released from chlorophyll; this process only occurs effectively in the digestive system of ruminant animals (8Baxter J.H. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 636-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, free phytol is present in some dairy products (9Brown P.J. Mei G. Gibberd F.B. Burston D. Mayne P.D. McClinchy J.E. Sidey M. J. Hum. Nutr. Diet. 1993; 6: 295-305Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Resolution of the metabolic pathway by which phytol is converted into phytanic acid is also important because phytol is often used in in vitro as well as in in vivo studies as a precursor of phytanic acid. Results from such studies have already led to a proposed model for phytol degradation (outlined in Fig. 1). This model is based on the finding that phytol administration to rats leads to increased levels of phytenic acid. According to this model, phytol is first converted to phytenic acid via the action of an alcohol dehydrogenase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase, after which phytenic acid undergoes reduction to phytanic acid. Support for this model came from measurements in isolated rat livers (10Muralidharan F.N. Muralidharan V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and, more recently, from our own studies in cultured human fibroblasts that provided evidence for the involvement of the microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing the conversion of E-phytenal into E-phytenic acid (11Van den Brink D.M. Van Miert J.N. Dacremont G. Rontani J.F. Jansen G.A. Wanders R.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 82: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the last step of the phytol degradation pathway, in which phytenic acid is converted into phytanic acid. Interestingly, our studies show that in contrast to the proposed pathway, phytenic acid is first activated to its CoA ester before the double bond is reduced. In addition, we show that NADPH-dependent reductase activity is located in mitochondria and peroxisomes. Differential and Density Gradient Centrifugation—All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of the University of Amsterdam. For subcellular fractionation studies, male Wistar rats were fed ad libitum with a standard laboratory diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) diethylhexylphthalate for 9 days, after which livers were isolated, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (final pH 7.4). A post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, which was subsequently subjected to differential centrifugation essentially as described previously (12Jansen G.A. Verhoeven N.M. Denis S. Romeijn G. Jakobs C. ten Brink H.J. Wanders R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Glutamate dehydrogenase (mitochondria), esterase (microsomes), catalase (peroxisomes), and phospho-glucose isomerase (cytosol) were used as marker enzymes for the different subcellular compartments indicated in parentheses and measured as described elsewhere (12Jansen G.A.

Schutgens R.B. Berden J.A. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Amounts of protein were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Subsequently, the light mitochondrial fraction was subjected to equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in a linear Nycodenz gradient as described previously (13Wolvetang E.J. Wanders R.J. Schutgens R.B. Berden J.A. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Phytenic Acid Reductase Assay—A mixture of Z- and E-phytenic acids was synthesized as described previously (14Rontani J.F. Bonin P.C. Volkman J.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5484-5492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat livers were derived from male Wistar rats fed ad libitum with a diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) diethylhexylphthalate. After sacrifice, livers were isolated, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Homogenates were made by cutting off a piece of the liver, which was homogenized on ice in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently sonicated on ice (3 cycles of 10 s at 70 W). Reduction of phytenic acid to phytanic acid was determined in an assay mixture consisting of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 1 mm NADPH, 1 mg/ml methyl-β-cyclodextrin, 100 μm phytenic acid (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, 1% final concentration in the assay), and 0.2 mg/ml rat liver homogenate in a total volume of 500 μl. The reactions were started by addition of homogenate and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C, after which they were terminated by addition of 2 m HCl. For analysis of the reaction products by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, first 49.3 pmol of [2H3]phytanic acid dissolved in toluene (purchased from Dr. H. J. ten Brink, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was added as internal standard. Then 2 ml of hexane was added, after which the organic layer was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at 40 °C. The sample was then derivatized with N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide (Aldrich) and pyridine (50 μl each) at 80 °C for 30 min, dried under nitrogen, and taken up in hexane. Analysis of the sample was performed on an Agilent Technologies model 5890/5973 gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system equipped with a CPsil 19CB capillary column (internal diameter, 25 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.2 μm; Varian) as described previously (15Vreken P. van Lint A.E.

Wanders R.J. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 240-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry acquisition was performed in the single ion monitoring mode, specifically the [M-57]+ ions of the various compounds (corresponding to 369.3 and 372.3 for phytanic acid and the internal standard, respectively). Calibration curves were generated in a concentration range of 0–100 μm, and concentrations of phytanic acid were calculated using a linear fit. Phytenoyl-CoA Reductase Assay—Reduction of phytenoyl-CoA to phytanoyl-CoA was determined in an assay mixture containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mm NADPH, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm phytenoyl-CoA, and 0.025 mg/ml rat liver homogenate in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were started by addition of substrate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, after which they were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of acetonitrile and placed on ice. Samples were spun for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, supernatants were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; tMS, tandem mass spectrometry; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. and CoA esters were quantified using UV detection. To this end, 100-μl samples were injected on a C18 reverse-phase column (Supelcosil LC-18-D8; internal diameter, 25 cm × 4.6 mm; particle size, 5 μm; Supelco) and eluted with a linear gradient from 16.9 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.9) dissolved in 46–64% acetonitrile over 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance of the eluate was monitored on a Shimadzu UV-visible detector (SPD-10Avp) at a wavelength of 260 nm. To determine HPLC retention times, standards of phytanoyl-CoA and phytenoyl-CoA were produced from the corresponding free acids using the acid anhydride method (17Rasmussen J.T. Borchers T. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA Synthetase Assay—Enzymatic activation of phytenic acid to its acyl-CoA ester was investigated essentially as described for phytanic acid (18Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Mihalik S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 mg/ml rat liver homogenate was incubated in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm CoA, 10 mm ATP, 100 μm phytenic acid, and 1 mg/ml methyl-β-cyclodextrin in a total volume of 100 μl for 30 min at 37 °C, after which the reaction was terminated, and amounts of phytenoyl-CoA were determined as described for the phytenoyl-CoA reductase assay. Detection of Phytenoyl-CoA in Cultured Rat Hepatocytes—Cultured rat hepatocytes (CRL-1601 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2, in the presence or absence of 50 μm phytol (mixture of Z- and E-isomers; Merck). After 4 days, the cells were harvested using trypsin and lysed on ice by the addition of 1 mg/ml digitonin. Analysis of CoA esters was performed using tandem mass spectrometry (tMS) as described elsewhere. 2C. W. van Roermund, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, lysates were subjected to Dole's extraction (19Dole V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3121-3124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereby the aqueous phase containing the CoA esters was dried under a flow of N2 and taken up in water. Samples were injected on a HPLC tMS system (Finnigan Surveyor TSQuantum AM; Thermofinnigan) and analyzed for HPLC retention time and mass determinations. Detection by tMS was performed by selecting for double-charged parent ions (508.5, 528.5, and 529.5 for heptadecanoyl-CoA, phytenoyl-CoA, and phytanoyl-CoA, respectively). Characterization of the Enzymatic Reduction of Phytenic Acid—To study the conversion of phytenic acid into phytanic acid, rat liver homogenates were incubated with phytenic acid in the presence of a variety of cofactors. Production of phytanic acid was observed only with NADPH present (Fig. 2A). The Km for NADPH was calculated to be ∼25 μm (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, a pH optimum was found at pH 7.7. Titration of the substrate phytenic acid resulted in a sharp decrease in activity at concentrations higher than 150 μm (Fig. 2D), which prevented calculation of the Km and Vmax. Based on these results, we selected a substrate concentration of 100 μm phytenic acid for all subsequent assays. The standard reaction medium also contained 1 mg/ml methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which increased activity 3-fold. Under these incubation conditions, formation of phytanic acid was linear with protein up to 0.2 mg/ml and time up to at least 30 min (data not shown). Subcellular Localization of the Reduction of Phytenic Acid— Next, we studied in which subcellular compartment reduction of phytenic acid to phytanic acid takes place. To this end, a rat liver homogenate was subjected to differential centrifugation to obtain fractions enriched in different cell organelles. The activity profile of the reduction of phytenic acid approximately mimicked that of glutamate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial marker, whereas reductase activity was also present in the microsome-enriched fraction (Fig. 3). To establish the subcellular localization more precisely, density gradient centrifugation was performed, using a rat liver light mitochondrial fraction as starting material. However, substantial phytanic acid production could not be measured in any of the fractions (data not shown). Because we had observed earlier that the enzyme activity measured after differential centrifugation was substantially lower than that in non-fractionated rat liver homogenates, it was speculated that the centrifugation procedures might be detrimental to enzyme activity. To address this question, we investigated the stability of the enzymatic activity. Studies in a rat liver homogenate revealed that there was minimal deterioration of reductase activity over time. Even after storage for 7 days at room temperature, more than 50% of the initial activity remained (data not shown). The addition of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol or protease inhibitors did not prevent deterioration of activity. Activation of Phytenic Acid to Its CoA Ester—Because of the extremely low phytenic acid reductase activity, we investigated whether phytenic acid might be converted into phytanic acid via some alternative mechanism. Because phytanic acid is a known substrate for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (20Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Gould S.J. Avigan J. Mihalik S.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and needs to be activated to its CoA ester before it can be α-oxidized, we explored whether phytenic acid might also be a substrate for a synthetase. To test this, the rate of activation of phytenic acid to its CoA ester was determined by incubating rat liver homogenate with phytenic acid in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and CoA. Synthetase activity with phytanic acid as substrate was measured for comparison. In Fig. 4B, it is shown that phytenic acid can indeed be activated to phytenoyl-CoA, and the rates of activation were found to be only slightly lower compared with those observed for phytanic acid. Interestingly, predominantly one isomer was produced, presumably corresponding to E-phytenoyl-CoA based on the elution profile and response ratio of Z- and E-phytenoyl-CoA (14Rontani J.F. Bonin P.C. Volkman J.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5484-5492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we tested whether phytenoyl-CoA could also be a substrate for the reductase reaction. Rat liver homogenates were incubated with either phytenic acid or phytenoyl-CoA, and after termination of the reactions, samples were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to release the CoA so that all reaction products could be analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the same way. Remarkably, these experiments revealed that the reductase activity was 15 times higher using phytenoyl-CoA as a substrate instead of phytenic acid (Fig. 4C). To establish that phytenoyl-CoA is a true intermediate of phytol degradation, acyl-CoA esters were analyzed in cultured cells after incubation with phytol. To this end, cultured rat hepatocytes were grown for 4 days in medium supplemented with 50 μm phytol. The cells were then homogenized, and CoA esters were extracted and analyzed by HPLC tMS. In addition to phytanoyl-CoA, E-phytenoyl-CoA was also detected (Fig. 5), suggesting that E-phytenoyl-CoA is indeed a true intermediate of the phytol degradation pathway. Next, we assessed whether phytenic acid reductase activity could be restored in the fractions obtained by differential centrifugation by addition of cofactors CoA, ATP, and Mg2+, which are required for the activation of phytenic acid to phytenoyl-CoA. Activity was measured as described in Fig. 4C to allow a direct comparison between incubations with or without the cofactors. An increased reductase activity in the presence of these cofactors was observed (data not shown), indicating that phytenoyl-CoA rather than phytenic acid might indeed be the true substrate for the reductase. However, because formation of phytanoyl-CoA from phytenic acid requires the action of an acyl-CoA synthetase, which might not be present in some of the fractions or might be limiting, the activity measured in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and CoA is likely to be an underestimation. For this reason (and because phytenoyl-CoA appears to be the bona fide intermediate of phytol, as concluded from the previous experiments), we used phytenoyl-CoA as substrate for subsequent reductase measurement. Characterization of the Reduction of Phytenoyl-CoA—Optimal reaction conditions were determined, this time using phytenoyl-CoA as substrate, and samples were analyzed by HPLC. The reaction was dependent on NADPH as cofactor, and the Km for NADPH was 9 μm (Fig. 6A). Maximum activity was found at a pH of 7.0 (Fig. 6B). As had been observed for phytenic acid, titration of phytenoyl-CoA revealed decreasing activities with substrate concentrations exceeding 100 μm, making calculation of Km and Vmax impossible (Fig. 6C). Based on these results, we selected a phytenoyl-CoA concentration of 100 μm in all subsequent reductase measurements. Addition of bovine serum albumin or methyl-β-cyclodextrin to the incubation mixture had no influence on reductase activity (data not shown). Phytanoyl-CoA production was linear with protein up to at least 0.5 mg/ml and linear over time up to at least 60 min (data not shown). Subcellular Localization of Phytenoyl-CoA Reductase Activity—Reductase activity using phytenoyl-CoA as substrate was measured in the same fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of a rat liver homogenate as used in the experiment shown in Fig. 3. In contrast to the incubations with phytenic acid as substrate, good recovery was found with phytenoyl-CoA as substrate (85%). The relative specific phytenoyl-CoA reductase activity was >1 in both the mitochondria-enriched and lysosome-enriched fractions (Fig. 3B). To establish the subcellular localization of phytenoyl-CoA reductase more precisely, we measured activity in the different fractions of the density gradient. A bimodal activity profile was found, with peaks corresponding to the peroxisomal marker and the mitochondrial marker (Fig. 7). In addition, we measured synthetase activity in the same density gradient fractions with phytenic acid as substrate. Phytenoyl-CoA production was found in the peroxisomes and microsomes (Fig. 7F). To elucidate the breakdown pathway of phytol to phytanic acid, we previously studied the conversion of phytol to phytenic acid (11Van den Brink D.M. Van Miert J.N. Dacremont G. Rontani J.F. Jansen G.A. Wanders R.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 82: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We observed that phytol was converted to its aldehyde, which was then converted into phytenic acid, as had been postulated by Muralidharan and Muralidharan (10Muralidharan F.N. Muralidharan V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Muralidharan F.N. Muralidharan V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We also found that the production of phytenic acid from phytol was mediated by the enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase. In this study, we focused on the last step of this pathway, the conversion of phytenic acid into phytanic acid. Enzymatic production of phytanic acid from phytenic acid was indeed observed in rat liver homogenates. However, doubts about the relevance of this reaction arose when hardly any activity was recovered in fractions prepared from rat liver homogenates by means of differential and density gradient centrifugation. As an alternative, activation of phytenic acid to its CoA ester prior to the reduction of the double bond was investigated. We showed that phytenic acid was indeed a substrate for an acyl-CoA synthetase and, moreover, that phytenoyl-CoA was a better substrate for the reductase reaction than phytenic acid. Proof that phytenoyl-CoA is a bona fide intermediate of phytol degradation came from the fact that it could be detected in rat hepatocytes cultured in the presence of phytol. Fig. 8 shows the new, fully elucidated pathway of the conversion of phytol into phytanic acid. Subsequent characterization of the phytenoyl-CoA synthetase reaction showed that this activity is localized both in microsomes and peroxisomes. Because production of phytenic acid takes place on the outside of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase is localized, activation of phytenic acid to phytenoyl-CoA could occur either directly at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or at the peroxisomes. The same finding has been observed for phytanic acid, which was shown to be activated by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (20Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Gould S.J. Avigan J. Mihalik S.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pahan K. Singh I. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 986-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phytenoyl-CoA reductase activity was detected both in mitochondria and in peroxisomes. Because α-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA is a peroxisomal process (5Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim.

Commun. 1996; 229: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that reduction of phytenoyl-CoA also takes place inside the peroxisome (Fig. 8). Interestingly, in a study by Das et al. (24Das A.K. Uhler M.D. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24333-24340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the cloning of a peroxisomal 2-enoyl-CoA reductase, an enzyme that is speculated to play a role in the chain elongation pathway, was described. This reductase has affinity for enoyl-CoA esters with chain lengths up to C16 and appears to be ubiquitously expressed with high levels present in liver and kidney. Future work will have to demonstrate whether this enzyme indeed catalyzes the reduction of phytenoyl-CoA. In summary, the results described in this study show that phytenic acid is first activated to its CoA ester before being reduced to phytanoyl-CoA, which is in contrast to the mechanism that was proposed earlier (10Muralidharan F.N. Muralidharan V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Muralidharan F.N. Muralidharan V.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Phytenoyl-CoA reductase activity was found to be present in mitochondria and peroxisomes, and we hypothesize that under in vivo conditions, phytenoyl-CoA reduction takes place in peroxisomes, where its product, phytanoyl-CoA, can subsequently be α-oxidized. With these findings, we have achieved full understanding of the phytol degradation pathway. We thank Dr. Sacha Ferdinandusse for many helpful comments about the results and preparation of this article. We are also grateful to Rob Ofman for work on the centrifugation experiments and to Dr. Carlo van Roermund, Albert Bootsma, and Dr. Wim Kulik for technical assistance with the detection of acyl-CoA esters."

We identify a seven-residue sequence, Ala275-Val281, in the third intracellular loop of the M3 muscarinic receptor that mediates dominant, position-independent basolateral targeting in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Mutational analyses identify Glu276, Phe280, and Val281 as critical residues within this sorting motif. Phe280 and Val281 comprise a novel dihydrophobic sorting signal as mutations of either residue singly or together with leucine do not disrupt basolateral targeting. Conversely, Glu276 is required and cannot be substituted with alanine or aspartic acid. A 19-amino acid peptide representing the M3 sorting signal and surrounding sequence was analyzed via two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Solution structures show that Glu276 resides in a type IV β-turn and the dihydrophobic sequence Phe280Val281 adopts either a type I or IV β-turn.

Targeting of proteins to their proper subcellular domains is critical to the functioning of polarized cells. Targeting of proteins and lipids to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells allows for differentiation of the membrane into functionally and biochemically distinct domains. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for this highly organized cellular process is a fundamental question in cell biology. Many membrane proteins contain sorting signals that direct them to a particular membrane domain. Some signals can be recognized by cellular machinery within the biosynthetic or recycling pathways and then directed to the proper domain. Other types of signals function by partitioning the membrane protein into a particular microenvironment. Apical sorting signals can consist of N- or O-glycans, a glycosylphophatidylinositol anchor or protein sequences in extracellular, transmembrane, or cytoplasmic domains (1Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The apical sorting of membrane proteins can also be mediated by lipid rafts (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8050) Google Scholar, 3Hoekstra D. Maier O. van der Wouden J.M. Slimane T.A. van Ijzendoorn S.C. J.

Basolateral sorting signals reside in the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins, and they can consist of tyrosine-based motifs, dihydrophobic motifs, acidic residues, or other, atypical motifs (4Matter K.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Little is known about the three-dimensional structure of basolateral targeting signals. The atypical basolateral sorting signal of the polyimmunoglobulin receptor exists as a β-turn and a nascent helix, with a critical valine residue in the nascent helix (8Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The two dihydrophobic sorting motifs of the major histocompatibility complex-associated invariant chain reside in a nascent helix and a turn with leucine-isoleucine in the nascent helix and methionine-leucine part of a turn (9Motta A.

Some basolateral sorting signals have functional overlap with tyrosine-based endocytosis signals, and the sequence of a number of basolateral sorting signals closely resembles some endocytosis signals (10Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-based endocytosis signals of both the low density lipoprotein receptor and lysosomal acid phosphatase were shown to adopt a β-turn conformation (11Bansal A. Gierasch L.M.

Our laboratory has previously identified a novel 21-residue basolateral sorting signal (BLSS) in the membrane proximal region of the third intracellular (i3) loop of the M3 mAChR. When appended to the apically targeted receptors M2 and interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (IL-2Rα) the M3 BLSS was able to redirect both proteins to the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells (23Nadler L.S. Kumar G. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10539-10547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this report we have further characterized the M3 BLSS using alanine mutagenesis, conservative residue substitution, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We have determined the individual amino acid residues required for the functioning of this signal as well as its tertiary structure. The M3 BLSS signal consists of seven amino acids including a single glutamic acid upstream of a novel phenylalaninevaline (FV) dihydrophobic motif. The novel sorting signal is sufficient for basolateral targeting, as it can be appended to either M2 or IL-2Rα and redirect these apical proteins to the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells. Phe280 and Val281 can be mutated either individually or in combination to leucine and maintain basolateral sorting function, constituting a novel dihydrophobic motif. Glu276 is essential for the M3 BLSS, as a receptor chimera with a mutation of Glu276 either to alanine or to aspartic acid displayed apical sorting. The structure of this novel sorting signal was determined by two-dimensional NMR. Glu276 resides in a type IV β-turn, and the dihydrophobic motif, Phe280 and Val281, exists in either a type I or IV β-turn. Construction of Chimeric mAChRs—N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged pFM3 and pFM2 mAChRs in the expression vector pCD-PS were described previously (23Nadler L.S. Kumar G. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10539-10547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). pFM2 and pFM3 were used as templates in sequential PCR (24Goldman P.S. Schlador M.L. Shapiro R.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to generate the M2/M3 receptor chimera, M2+M3 [C-term. 271–291] (23Nadler L.S. Kumar G. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10539-10547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This fusion protein consists of nucleotides 811–873 of the M3 sequence coding for amino acids 271–291, appended to the C terminus of M2. M2+M3 [C-term. 271–291] was used as the template in sequential PCR to generate five chimeric receptors, M2+M3 5Ala[271–275], M2+M3 [5Ala-275–279], M2+M3 5[Ala-279–283], M2+M3 [5Ala-283–287], and M2+M3 5Ala-[287–291] (Table I). All PCR-amplified constructs were engineered with MscI and EcoRI sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and cloned into the MscI and EcoRI sites of the parental pFM2 construct.Table ITitles and descriptions of engineered cDNA constructs used in MDCK cell transfectionsConstruct nameDescriptionM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]M2 (full length); with aa 271-291 of M3 appended at the C terminusM2+M3 5Ala-271-275M2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 271-275 of M3 changed to AlaM2+M3 5Ala-275-279M2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 275-279 of M3 changed to AlaM2+M3 5Ala-279-283M2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 279-283 of M3 changed to AlaM2+M3 5Ala-283-287M2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 283-287 of M3 changed to AlaM2+M3 5Ala-287-291M2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 287-291 of M3 changed to AlaA275MM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 275 of M3 changed to MetE276AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 276 of M3 changed to AlaT277AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 277 of M3 changed to AlaE278AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 278 of M3 changed to AlaN279AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 279 of M3 changed to AlaF280AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 280 of M3 changed to AlaV281AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 281 of M3 changed to AlaH282AM2+M3 [C term. 271-291]; with aa 282 of M3 changed to AlaM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]M2; with aa 275-281 of M3 appended at the C terminusM2+M3 [C term. 275-281] F280AM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 280 of M3 changed to AlaIL-2Rα + M3 [C term. 275-281]IL-2Rα; aa 275-281 of M3 appended at the C terminusIL-2Rα + M3 [C term. 275-281] F280AIL-2Rα + M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 280 of M3 changed to AlaM2+M3 E276DM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 276 of M3 changed to AspM2+M3 FV-LLM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 280-281 of M3 changed to LeuM2+M3 F280LM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 280 of M3 changed to LeuM2+M3 V281LM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 281 of M3 changed to Leu,M2+M3 EFV-DLLM2+M3 [C term. 275-281]; with aa 276 of M3 changed to Asp and 280-281 changed to Leu Open table in a new tab A unique BspEI restriction site was created in M2+M3-[C-term. 271–291] at nucleotides 811–816 of the M3 sequence by mutating two sequential wobble bases, nucleotides 813 and 816 from T to C and G to A, respectively. These mutations did not alter the sequence of the protein product. This BspE1 site and an EcoRI site were then digested and used as insertion sites for eight sets of annealed complimentary oligonucleotide pairs containing the M3 sequence with each amino acid mutated singly to alanine. The M3 sequences of the oligo pairs were flanked by a 5′ BspE1 and 3′ EcoR1 site. Two oligo pairs that changed alanine 275 either to methionine or glycine were also made (Table I). For annealing of oligo pairs, equimolar amounts of complementary oligos were mixed together on ice and were then placed in a 72 °C heat block for 2 min. The heat block was then turned off and allowed to cool to room temperature, at which time the annealed oligos were removed and used in a ligation reaction with appropriately digested vector. Chimeric receptors were generated in which the M3 sequence, Ala275-Val281, or M3 sequence containing a point mutation, F280A, was added to the C terminus of M2 by PCR using pFM2 as template. Primers for the M2/M3 fusion protein had MscI and EcoRI sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and the PCR products were cloned into the MscI and EcoRI sites of the parental pFM2 plasmid. IL-2Rα receptor/M3 fusion proteins were generated by PCR using IL-2Rα/pCD as template (23Nadler L.S. Kumar G. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10539-10547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PCR products were engineered to contain a 5′ BglII and a 3′ EcoRI site and were cloned back into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the parental pCD plasmid. PCR was used to generate a set of receptor chimeras with mutated M3 sequence appended at the C terminus of wild-type (WT) M2. PCR products were engineered with MscI and EcoRI sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and were cloned into to the MscI and EcoRI sites of the pFM2 plasmid. Cell Culture—MDCK cells (strain II) were provided by Dr. Keith Mostov (University of California at San Francisco). MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 environment. Transfection and Immunocytochemical Analysis—MDCK cells were seeded on 2-well glass chamber slides (4.2 cm2/well; Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Cells were plated at subconfluency (3.5 × 105 cells/well) before transfection via calcium phosphate or at 1.0 × 106 cells/well before transfection via the Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) method. Cells were transiently transfected the following day with 2–4 μg of cDNA/well. For transfections with Lipofectamine reagent, 4 μg of cDNA plus 8 μl of reagent was used. Twenty-four hours after achieving confluency and 48 h after transfection the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized, blocked, and then incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (1.2 μg/ml) (Sigma) or anti-IL2Rα (1:100, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or ALEXA 548-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, respectively (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC and Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescent images were collected in both the x-y and x-z planes on a Leica TCS SP1/NT confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Exton, PA) using 100×, 1.4 N.A. oil immersion lens. Images of the x-y plane are a projected z-series generated from ∼16–25 optical sections taken at ∼0.5-μm steps from the apical to basolateral borders of the cells. Peptide Synthesis—A 19-amino acid peptide representing the N-terminal portion of the i3 loop of M3 (residues Ser271-Ser289) (modified with N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation) was synthesized (Invitrogen). The peptide purity was >95% as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. NMR Data Collection—Lyophilized M3 peptide was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.4 containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 10% D2O. For NMR spectra collected in D2O, the lyophilized peptide was dissolved in the same buffer with 99.9% D2O. Sample concentrations were between 1 and 2 mm, as determined by weight. NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DMX 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance, triple-axis gradient probe. Two-dimensional spectra collected include 1) total correlation spectroscopy collected in H2O and D2O (25Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar), 2) nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY) (26Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4826) Google Scholar), and 3) double-quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy (COSY) (27Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). Total correlation spectroscopy spectra were used to assign intra-residue protons by observation of the intra-residue through-bond connections. The NOESY spectrum was used to observe inter-residue through-space connections. Sequential NH and CαH assignments were obtained by analysis of cross-peaks in the NH-CαH region in the NOESY spectrum. NH Chemical Shift Temperature Gradients—A series of NOESY spectra was obtained at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 °C. NH chemical shift values were determined from the NOESY spectra for each residue (except Pro283) at the respective temperatures. The measured values were subtracted from previously published NH random coil chemical shift values and plotted as the difference in chemical shift (expressed in ppb) versus temperature (expressed in °C) (28Andersen N.H. Liu Z. Prickett K.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Andersen N.H. Neidigh J.W. Harris S.M. Lee G.M. Liu Z. Tong H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8547-8561Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Linear regression was applied to each residue across all temperatures, and the resulting slope is reported as the temperature gradient. His282 and Arg288 were not included in the final analysis because fewer than three of the five possible temperature data points were observed. Calculation of Structures—58 inter-residue NOE distance restraints derived from a NOESY spectrum collected at 12 °C with a mixing time of 300 ms and 5 dihedral angle restraints derived from a double-quantum-filtered-COSY spectrum were used as input for CNSsolve-based simulated-annealing distance geometry structure calculations (30Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). Integrated cross-peak volumes and intensities were evaluated and used to separate NOEs into bins with overlapping distance restraints: strong 2.0–3.5 Å, medium 2.0–4.5 Å, and weak 2.0–5.5 Å. 200 structures were calculated and ranked by total energy. The top 10 structures were evaluated by VMD-XPLOR and PROCHECK_NMR (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

The electrostatic surface potential image was generated using PyMOL (34DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The M3 Basolateral Sorting Signal Resides between Residues Ala275 and His282—Previous work demonstrated that mAChRs are asymmetrically distributed in MDCK cells. M3 was localized to the basolateral domain, whereas M2 was localized to the apical domain. The reciprocal polarity of these two related receptors was utilized to generate receptor chimeras of M2 and M3. M3 was found to contain a 21-residue BLSS in the N-terminal portion of the i3 loop that, when substituted into or appended onto M2, could redirect M2 from the apical domain to the basolateral domain of MDCK cells (23Nadler L.S. Kumar G. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10539-10547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We used the full-length M2 receptor with this 21-amino acid region appended to its C terminus to further define the M3 BLSS. We generated mutations within the receptor chimera, M2+M3 [C-term 271–291], mutating sections of the 21-amino acid M3 basolateral signal to alanines (Table I). Five receptors were generated by mutating groups of five adjacent and overlapping amino acids within the M3 sequence of M2+M3 [C-term. 271–291] to alanine residues (Fig. 1A, schematic). Each cDNA was transiently transfected in MDCK cells, and the steady state localization of the protein product was determined via immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. As shown previously, M2+M3 [C-term. 271–291] displays a basolateral distribution (Fig. 1D) virtually identical to WT M3 (Fig. 1C) and in contrast to the apical distribution of M2 (Fig. 1B). The five M2+M3 fusion proteins displayed differential targeting in MDCK cells (Fig. 1, E–I). The N-terminal mutant M2+M3 [5Ala-271–275] and the two C-terminal mutants, M2+M3 [5Ala-283–287] and M2+M3 [5Ala-287–291], were targeted to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1, E, H, and I) similar to M2+M3 [C-term. 271–291] and WT M3. These data suggest that residues 271–275 and 283–291 do not contain basolateral sorting information. The two remaining mutant receptor chimeras M2+M3 [5Ala-275–279] and M2+M3 [5Ala-279–283] (Fig. 1, F and G) were targeted to the apical domain. Therefore, these residues of M3, Ala275-Pro283 contain basolateral sorting information. Overlap in the mutated sequences of the receptor constructs allowed us to eliminate Pro283 as a critical residue in the BLSS because the M2+M3 [5Ala-283–287] construct contains the P283A mutation and maintains basolateral sorting. These data suggest that residues 271–275 and 283–291 are not required for basolateral sorting information, whereas residues 276–282 are essential for basolateral sorting. Glu276, Phe280, and Val281 Are the Critical Amino Acids of the M3 BLSS—To identify the specific residues critical to the M3 basolateral sorting signal, amino acids Ala275-His282 were individually mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2). Ala275 was changed to methionine, since in the previous experiment this WT alanine had not been altered by mutagenesis. The point mutations were made within the context of the same parent receptor construct described above, M2+M3 [C-term 271–291], and the WT M3 sequence Ser271-Glu274 and Pro283-Ser291 remained unchanged. Each of the eight cDNAs was transiently transfected in MDCK cells, and the localization of the protein product was determined as described previously. Five of the eight mutant proteins, A275M, T277A, E278A, N279A, and H282A, were localized to the basolateral membrane ((Fig. 2, A, C, D, E, and H), indicating that these residues are not critical to the function of the BLSS. The remaining three mutant proteins, E276A, F280A, and V281A, (Fig. 2, B, F, and G) were detected at the apical membrane of MDCK cells along with a dramatic loss of targeting of these proteins to the basolateral membrane. Non-conservative amino acid changes at either Glu276, Phe280, or Val281 abrogates the BLSS function, and thus, these residues are critical to the function of the M3 BLSS. The Seven-amino Acid BLSS of M3 Confers Basolateral Targeting to Both M2 and IL-2Rα—In the experiment above three residues were identified as critically important to the function of the M3 BLSS. Experiments involving chimeric receptors harboring the five sequential and overlapping alanine mutations showed that amino acids N-terminal to Ala275 and C-terminal to His282 are not necessary for the function of the BLSS. We next asked if just seven amino acids, Ala275-Val281, when appended to the C terminus of M2, would still function as a minimal BLSS and be able to redirect M2 from its WT apical distribution to the basolateral membrane. This cDNA, M2+M3[C-term 275–281], was transiently transfected in MDCK cells, and the steady state localization of the protein was determined. As seen in Fig. 3B, the chimeric receptor, M2+M3[C-term 275–281], had a predominantly basolateral distribution opposite of the apically distributed WT M2 (Fig. 3A). Another chimera, M2+M3 [C-term 275–281] F280A, harboring an alanine point mutation at Phe280, was also generated, and its membrane localization was determined. As expected from the results seen with mutations of the 21-amino acid sequence, this receptor chimera was mistargeted to the apical domain when expressed in MDCK cells (Fig. 3C), its distribution strongly resembling that of both M2+M3 [C-term 271–291]F280A (Fig. 2F) and WT M2 (Fig. 3A). To test whether this minimal M3 BLSS can act on a completely unrelated protein, we added M3 275–281 to the C terminus of IL-2Rα, a heterologous, single-pass transmembrane protein with an apical distribution in MDCK cells (35Simmen T. Nobile M. Bonifacino J.S. Hunziker W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3136-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Crabtree G.R. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Robb R.J. Kronke M. Svetlik P.B. Peffer N.J. Waldmann T.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). IL-2Rα and IL-2Rα+M3 [C-term 275–281] were transfected in MDCK cells, and their localization was imaged. As expected, IL-2Rα was targeted to the apical membrane (Fig. 3D), similar to WT M2. In contrast, the majority of IL-2Rα + M3 [C-term 275–281] protein was localized at the basolateral membrane with some intracellular staining also evident (Fig. 3E). This same receptor chimera, with a single alanine mutation at Phe280, IL-2Rα + M3 [C-term 275–281] F280A, was clearly targeted to the apical membrane (Fig. 3F). These data demonstrate that a seven-residue sequence, Ala275-Val281, from the i3 loop of M3 contains basolateral sorting information that can redirect both M2 and the heterologous IL-2Rα from the apical to basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The signal is dominant over apical targeting information present in either M2 or IL-2Rα. These data also show that Phe280 is a critical residue within the signal as the 7-mer fails to redirect either M2 or IL-2Rα when it harbors a non-conservative mutation at this position. The M3 BLSS Consists of an Acidic Residue, Glu276, and a Dihydrophobic Motif, Phe280-Val281—The importance of dihydrophobic motifs in basolateral sorting is well documented. To date dihydrophobic motifs have been shown to be composed of LL, LI, LV, FI, and ML (7Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Motta A.

It is also known that some basolateral sorting signals consist of a dihydrophobic motif in conjunction with a nearby, usually N-terminal, acidic cluster or acidic residue (9Motta A. Bremnes B.

Our data suggest FV may be a previously unidentified dihydrophobic basolateral sorting signal that may work in conjunction with the upstream glutamic acid residue at position 276. To determine whether FV represents a novel dihydrophobic motif and if glutamic acid at position 276 is critical, we generated chimeric M2/M3 receptors harboring various combinations of conservative amino acid mutations at residues Glu276, Phe280, and Val281. For these experiments, aspartic acid was substituted for Glu276, and le"
https://openalex.org/W2015263089,"Oncogenic Ras proteins transform cells via multiple downstream signaling cascades that are important for cell proliferation and survival. Gadd153, also known as CHOP, is a growth inhibitory and proapoptotic protein and its expression is upregulated by many agents that induce apoptosis. Here, we report our novel findings that oncogenic Ras downregulates Gadd153 expression at both protein and mRNA levels and that such downregulation occurs, at least in part, via decreases in GADD153 mRNA stability. Gadd153 downregulation is specific to oncogenic Ras since another oncogenic family member R-Ras2/TC21 does not downregulate Gadd153. We further demonstrate that the expression of exogenous Gadd153 interferes with Ras-induced oncogenic transformation, which suggests that downregulation of Gadd153 appears to be an important mechanism by which oncogenic Ras promotes cellular transformation. Thus, oncogenic Ras-mediated cellular transformation also involves downmodulation of important molecules such as Gadd153 that negatively regulate cell growth and survival."

It is of interest to determine which amino acid pairs can be substituted for the S–S bonds without disrupting their native structures under physiological conditions. Many S–S-bonded proteins are often regarded as targets for industrial and pharmaceutical uses. For practical applications, efficient production of these proteins with recombinant technology is essential, and the in vitro formation of correct S–S bonds is one of the most challenging problems for the preparation of functional recombinant proteins. Eliminating even one S–S bond critically decreases the possible S–S-bonding combinations, which results in higher yields of active proteins. In this study, we focused on the replacement of intradomain S–S bonds in Ig fold domains. Four typical Ig fold domains were used, and amino acid pairs substituted for S–S bonds were selected by cellular quality control screening. Then, the selected mutants were examined for their ability to form the native structures using CD and functional assay. Two of the four Ig fold domains tested here were variable fragments, i.e. the variable region of the heavy chain of camelid heavy chain antibody (VHH) and an engineered mouse VL domain (λ graft). The other two were β2-micro-globulin (β2-m) and the constant domains of the human κ light chain (CL fragment). The VHH used here recognizes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as an antigen (9Spinelli S. Frenken L. Bourgeois D. de Ron L. Bos W. Verrips T. Anguille C. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The λ graft is based on the sequence of the humanized 4D5-derived VL domain artificially designed to change the antigen specificity and interdomain interactions (10Kelley R.F. O'Connell M.P.

Our screening method, which utilizes a cellular quality control system for the secretory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is referred to as “cellular quality control screening,” was developed to screen for sequences that can fold into the native structures under physiological conditions. This method is based on the efficiency of secretion of target sequences detected by an antibody directed against a generic tag (13Hagihara Y. Shiraki K. Nakamura T. Uegaki K. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51043-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the secretory quality control system, native or correctly folded proteins are secreted, whereas misfolded proteins are retained and degraded within the cells; the efficiencies of secretion of proteins correlate with their structural statuses (14Hagihara Y.

Thus, cellular quality control screening does not require any prior knowledge of the target protein, such as its enzymatic activity. Taking advantage of this unique feature, we applied an identical screening system to the selection of amino acid pairs able to replace S–S bonds of four different Ig fold domains that do not share any functional properties. Construction of Libraries of Mutant Ig Fold Domains—DNA fragments encoding a signal sequence, a pro-sequence, a multicloning site, and a FLAG tag sequence were all inserted sequentially into p415GALS (19Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) to create p415GSSE (14Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Synthetic genes of VHH, CL fragment, and λ graft were designed to optimize the codon frequencies for yeast using the peptide sequences of the Protein Data Bank accession number 1G9E (from 1 to 117), the sequence published in Ref. 12Wörn A.

The plasmid containing the cDNA of human β2-m was a gift from Y. Goto (Osaka University) and H. Naiki (Fukui Medical University). Mutant Ig fold domains varying in the random mutations at the Cys positions were prepared by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and oligo DNAs with random sequences at the Cys positions. In the case of β2-m, we used three different oligos to introduce the random mutations and to avoid the appearance of Cys at the mutated positions. In these oligos, the DNA sequences at Cys positions were VNN, NHN, and NNR, where V, N, H and R indicate the mixed base pairs of A/C/G, A/C/G/T, A/C/T, and A/G, respectively. The prepared plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). The VHH, β2-m, CL fragment, and λ graft libraries consisted of 13,000, 47,000, 26,000, and 480,000 colonies, respectively. About 90% of the colonies contained successfully ligated plasmids. In the sequences of randomly picked clones, no clear preference for specific amino acids was observed. Screening of the Random Mutant Libraries—S. cerevisiae strain RY810556-2B (MATα ura3–1 leu2–3, 112 his3–11, 15 can1–100) was a gift from G. Fink of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (Cambridge, MA). The expression and detection of secreted proteins were carried out as described previously (13Hagihara Y. Shiraki K. Nakamura T. Uegaki K. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Yumoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51043-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After the transformation of libraries into yeast by electroporation, we obtained 22,000 colonies from the VHH library, 4,000 from the β2-m library, 9,000 from the CL fragment library, and 79,000 from the λ graft library. As a positive control, the transformants bearing the wild-type sequences were placed on separate areas of the plates for comparison. The secreted proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then detected with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). On the initial on-plate screening, we selected 179, 32, 48, and 144 clones from transformants from the VHH, β2-m, CL fragment, and λ graft libraries, respectively. The candidate clones were cultured for 1 day in natural liquid medium containing 10 g/liter of yeast extract and 20 g/liter of peptone (YEP) with 2% galactose as the carbon source (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.12Google Scholar). Each culture medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The M2 antibody was used to detect proteins after blotting. Biophysical Measurements of the Selected Mutants—Isolated DNAs encoding the candidate mutants and the original Ig fold domains were cloned into an E. coli expression vector, pAED4 (21Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, several control mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. They were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene), and the expressed proteins were accumulated in inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies were dissolved with 6 m guanidine HCl or 8 m urea. Crude β2-m and CL fragments in the denaturant were dialyzed against 1% acetic acid and then purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For VHHs and λ grafts, proteins in the denaturant were refolded by a 1/50 dilution with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3). A Resource S cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3) was used to purify crude VHHs and λ grafts. For the preparation of reduced proteins, the oxidized proteins were incubated with >20 mm dithiothreitol and 6 m guanidine HCl at pH 8.5. After overnight reaction, the completion of reduction was confirmed by either Ellman's method (VHH and λ graft) (22Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) or HPLC (β2-m and CL fragment) (23Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE STR-D1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the molecular weights of the purified proteins were confirmed to be identical to the expected values calculated from their amino acid sequences (with an error of ±0.025%). The concentration of protein in the stock solution was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm with a UV-2500PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) (24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). Thermal unfolding was monitored as the change in ellipticity at either 230 or 235 nm for VHH and λ graft, 210 nm for β2-m, and 232 nm for CL fragment at a protein concentration of 4 μm using a J-720 or J-820 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) and a 1-cm cell. For all measurements, the heating rate was 1 °C min-1. The buffers used for the experiments on VHH, β2-m, and CL fragment contained 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.9). Because the heat-denatured λ grafts tended to form aggregates at neutral pH, thermal unfolding experiments were carried out at pH 5.3 with a 10 mm sodium acetate buffer. The midpoint temperatures of thermal unfolding (Tm) and enthalpy values of unfolding (ΔHu) were estimated on the basis of the two-state transition mechanism by curve fitting using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) (25Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). We assumed that the change in heat capacity between the folded and unfolded states (ΔCp) was 0, as all analyzed transitions were steep, and the influence of ΔCp on Tm was negligible. In most cases (>80% of all measurements), >70% of the CD signals were retained at 10 °C after heat denaturation. Even in another 20% of the experiments with relatively low reversibility, at least 40% of the CD signals were retained after cooling down. Binding Assay of VHH with Antigen hCG—VHH mutants were immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using the standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Aliquots of Sepharose beads (20 μl), to which about 10 μg of VHHs had been immobilized, were incubated with 10 μg of hCG (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl at room temperature for 90 min. After washing the beads three times with the same buffer, samples were boiled for 15 min at 95 °C with standard SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and then applied to the 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Model Building of Mutant Structures and Calculation of the Contact Surface Area—Model structures of the mutants were obtained by simulations using dead-end elimination (26Tanimura R. Kidera A. Nakamura H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) from the structures of wild-type VHH (Protein Data Bank accession number 1HCV), β2-m (Protein Data Bank accession number 1HHG), and CL fragment (Protein Data Bank accession number 1CLY). Two-step energy minimization involving the conjugate gradient method was applied for each generated structure using the software PRESTO, version 3 (27Morikami K. Nakai T. Kidera A. Saito M. Nakamura H. Comput. Chem. 1992; 16: 243-248Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 28Nakajima N. Higo J. Kidera A. Nakamura H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the first step, only the mutated residues were allowed to move freely, the other residues being fixed. In the next step, restricted movement was permitted for other residues using position-dependent restraints. The area of contact surface between the mutated and surrounding residues was calculated for each model structure using the following procedure. We defined ASApaired as the water-accessible surface area (ASA) calculated for the two residues simultaneously extracted from all of the structural coordinates. Notation ASApaired(α,β) contains only the ASA from residue α and does not include the ASA from residue β of ASApaired, which is calculated for the residue α and β pair. ASAsingle(α) is defined as ASA for only the residue α extracted from the structural coordinates. The contact surface area for residue i, ΔASAmut(i), was calculated for each mutated residue using the equation below. ΔASAmut(i)=∑k(k≠i)(ASAsingle(i)−ASApaired(i,k))(Eq. 1) ΔASAmut(i) + ΔASAmut(j) is calculated for the mutated residue pair i and j as the external contact. The internal contact between mutated residue pair i and j (ΔASAmutpair(i,j)) is defined in the following equation. ΔASAmutpair(i,j)=ASAsingle(i)+ASAsingle(j)−(ASApaired(i,j)+ASApaired(j,i))(Eq. 2) Screening of Stable Ig Fold Mutants without the S–S Bond—In the first on-plate screening step, we selected 179, 32, 48, and 144 clones from the VHH, β2-m, CL fragment, and λ graft libraries based on the secretion levels of target sequences. As a positive control, we placed the transformants with the wild-type sequences on separate areas of the plates. To prevent the false positives on screening, we introduced multi-step selection, in which the first on-plate screening is followed by secondary liquid culture secretion screening (13Hagihara Y.

In the subsequent liquid culture secretion screening, the supernatants of cultures of the candidates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. We selected 64 (VHH), 24 (β2-m), 24 (CL fragment), and 38 (λ graft) clones that produced bands of substantial intensity (Fig. 1). DNA sequencing of the candidates revealed 18 (VHH), 3 (β2-m), 8 (CL fragment), and 11 (λ graft) different amino acid sequences (Fig. 1 and Table I). Those of VHH, CL fragment, and λ graft included revertants, which had Cys:Cys at the positions of S–S bonds, found in 1, 1, and 11 clones, respectively. In screening of the CL fragment library, the Cys:Val mutation was found in seven clones. As Cys:Val contains cysteine, we did not carry out further analysis of this mutant. In the case of β2-m, we used three different oligo DNAs to introduce random mutations and to avoid the appearance of Cys at the mutated positions.Table IComparison of the thermal stabilities of the obtained mutants and control proteinsIg fold domainAmino acid pair for replacing S–S bondaWe have represented the amino acid pairs replacing the S–S bonds as one-letter amino acid code combinations, such as A/V.

W/P without the third mutation showed a higher Tm (44 °C) than W/P G10D Open table in a new tab It should be noted that the levels of secretion of the λ graft mutants on plates and in liquid medium were very low compared with the case of the wild-type Cys pair. Thus, for the first screening, we selected the clones with relatively weak signals, along with those with intense signals, which were similar to that from clones with the wild-type sequence. The DNA sequencing of candidates with intense signals revealed that all of these mutants had the Cys:Cys pair at the position of the S–S bond. For the second screening of λ graft mutants, we cultured the candidates at 24 °C instead of the normal growth temperature of yeast (30 °C) (Fig. 1D). Because the levels of secretion of λ graft mutants, which do not include revertants, were still low even at 24 °C, we compared the levels of secretion of mutants with a 1/5 dilution of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1D, lane 1). The λ graft mutants were the most aggregation-prone among the Ig fold domains studied here, and this could be related to the low levels of secretion of λ graft mutants in liquid cultures. Thermal Unfolding of the Obtained Mutants—Almost 90% of the selected mutants were unfolded in a cooperative manner, as judged from the thermal transition detected by means of CD, indicating that they retained the ability to form the native structures (Fig. 2). The Trp:Ile G17D mutant of λ graft was not soluble after refolding, and thus, we examined 35 mutants. Among them, 31 showed cooperative thermal unfolding curves. Because ΔHU reflects the steepness of the thermal transition, this value is a good index of the cooperativity of unfolding. The ΔHU values at the Tm of these mutants were 240–390 kJ/mol for VHH, 240–310 kJ/mol for β2-m, 180–230 kJ/mol for CL fragment, and 180–260 kJ/mol for λ graft. The ΔHU values of oxidized wild-type VHH, β2-m, CL fragment, and λ graft at their Tm values were 380, 260, 270, and 290 kJ/mol, respectively. Considering the difficulty in estimating ΔHU from one transition curve, the ΔHU values of the mutant and wild-type proteins were similar. In addition, the ΔHU values of mutants were reasonable values as compared with those of typical globular proteins with molecular weights between 8,000 and 15,000 (from 160 to 470 at 50 °C) (29Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Some of the mutants obtained for VHH (Trp:Ala, Ala:Ala, and Trp:Pro G10D), β2-m (Val:Val, Val:Ala, and Ala:Val), and CL fragment (Ala:Val, Ala:Ile, and Val:Val) showed higher Tm values than those of the corresponding reduced wild-type proteins (Table I). The largest difference in Tm values between the selected mutants and the reduced wild-type protein was 6 °C. This indicates that a Cys:Cys pair at the position of an S–S bond does not always best fit this position under reducing conditions. As the Ig fold domains used here were evolved to function under oxidized conditions, it is reasonable that their sequences are not optimal for reducing environments. The difference in Tm values between oxidized and reduced wild-type λ grafts was 9 °C (Table I), which was the smallest among the Ig fold domains examined here. Loop entropy calculations (30Poland D.G. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 379-399Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the enthalpy values of oxidized proteins allow prediction of the Tm values of the reduced proteins: 41 °C for VHH, 39 °C for β2-m, 33 °C for CL fragment, and 31 °C for λ graft. In this calculation, ΔCp was assumed to be 6 kJ mol-1 K-1, because the ΔCp values of eight typical small globular proteins, of which the molecular weights are between 8,000 and 15,000, are reported to range from 4 to 9 kJ mol-1 K-1, and the average ΔCp is 6 ± 2 kJ mol-1 K-1 (29Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The predicted Tm values are close to the observed Tm values of reduced wild-type VHH (41 °C), β2-m (37 °C), and CL fragment (32 °C). However, in the case of λ graft, the observed Tm was about 14 °C higher than the predicted value. This suggests that reduction of the S–S bond in λ graft triggers new and preferable effects, such as hydrogen bond formation or the relaxation of main chain distortion caused by the S–S bond. Because Val:Ala was not selected on the screening of CL fragment mutants, although this pair was found on the other three screenings, we prepared a Val:Ala mutant of CL fragment and compared it with the selected mutants. This comparison revealed a preference, or polarity, for Ala:Val and Val:Ala mutations in CL fragment. The differences in Tm between the Ala:Val and Val:Ala mutants of VHH, β2-m, and λ graft were 4, 1, and 1 °C, respectively. On the other hand, the Tm difference between the Ala:Val and Val:Ala mutants for CL fragment was 8 °C. The occurrence of polarity implies that the pairs substituted for the S–S bonds were determined not only by the structural similarity to the Cys pair but also by the environment around the positions of the replaced Cys residues. For comparison, and because Ala:Ala has often been used to replace S–S bonds (5Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Wu L.C. Peng Z.Y. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Noda Y. Yokota A. Horii D. Tominaga T. Tanisaka Y. Tachibana H. Segawa S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2130-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we made Ala:Ala mutants for β2-m, CL fragment, and λ graft. In the case of CL fragment, the Tm was >10 °C lower than that of the most stable selected mutant, Ala:Val, indicating that Ala:Ala is not always an appropriate pair to replace an S–S bond. Although Val:Val was selected from β2-m, CL fragment, and λ graft libraries, we could not find this pair in the selected VHH mutants. We prepared a Val:Val mutant as a control and compared the stability. The Val:Val mutant of VHH was 2–13 °C less stable than the selected pairs and thus was not selected on the screening. Antigen Binding of the Obtained VHH Mutants—The wild-type VHH used here was the variable domain of a llama heavy chain antibody raised against the α-subunit of hCG. To determine whether S–S bond substitution affects the antigen-binding ability, Sepharose-immobilized VHH variants were prepared and incubated with hCG at room temperature (Fig. 3). The amounts of hCG bound to immobilized Ala:Ala, Ala:Ser, Gly:Val, Ala:Ile, Ala:Val, Trp:Pro G10D, Trp:Ala, Trp:Gly, and Ser:Ser were similar to those of wild-type VHH, indicating that these mutants retain antigen-binding affinity. Ala:Leu, Ala:Phe, Val: Ala, Gly:Ile, Ser:Ala G97V, Gly:Phe, Gly:Ala, and Gly:Leu also bound hCG; however, the amounts of bound hCG were smaller than those for wild-type VHH. hCG did not interact with the Sepharose alone (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 13). The Val:Val mutant, which was prepared as a negative control and exhibited lower stability, bound only a small amount of hCG (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 15). About 10% of the Val:Val mutant was unfolded at 25 °C, as observed in the thermal unfolding curve (Fig. 2A). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the equilibrium between the unfolded and folded molecules of the Val:Val mutant greatly reduced the antigen-binding affinity at room temperature. We also carried out competition experiments on the immobilized (7 μg) and soluble (5 μg) wild-type and Ala:Ile VHHs. The addition of soluble protein reduced the amount of hCG bound to the immobilized wild-type and Ala:Ile VHHs by 90 and 50%, respectively (data not shown). This finding further corroborates the presence of specific interactions between hCG and VHH mutants.

When applied to synchronized cells during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, PACAP38 diminished the subsequent nuclear uptake of bromodeoxyuridine. When applied for 2 days, it reduced the cell number. PACAP38 did not exert its antiproliferative effect by activating protein kinase A. It also did not reduce the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases essential for G1 phase progression. Instead, PACAP38 acted on a member of the Rho family of small GTPases. It reduced the activity of RhoA as was shown with a Rhotekin pull-down assay. The decrease in endogenous RhoA activity induced by treatment of the cells with C3 exotoxin or by expression of dominant negative RhoA also reduced the nuclear uptake of bromodeoxyuridine. In contrast, expression of constitutively active RhoA prevented the effect of PACAP38. Our data show a novel signal transduction pathway by which the neuropeptide influences cell proliferation.

Whereas both peptides stimulate the G protein-coupled receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2 at subnanomolar concentrations, only PACAP38 stimulates PAC1 receptors with a potency in the same range (2Harmar A.J.

The 7 isoforms reported differ in their third intracellular loop and can couple to adenylyl cyclase as well as phospholipases C and D (12Nicot A. Cicco-Bloom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the cellular proliferation cycle, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) determine the progression through the G1 phase into the S phase. Thus, the association of cyclin D with CDK4/6 and of cyclin E with CDK2 is important for G1 progression and G1/S transition, respectively. The complexes induce the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product that allows the transcription of E2F-regulated genes (18Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 9: 1149-1163Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Upon activation, extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) increase the activity of cyclin D1. However, only the sustained activation of ERKs and cyclin D1 leads to G1 progression (19Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol.

In preliminary experiments, we have observed that PACAP38 strongly inhibited the S phase-dependent nuclear uptake of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in cultured astroglial cells from the rat neocortex. This apparent antiproliferative effect was in contrast to our previous observation of a PACAP38-induced activation of ERKs (36Just L. Morl F. Barmann C. Olenik C. Meyer D.K. Glia. 2000; 30: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the antiproliferative effect of PACAP38 in cultured astroglial cells. The antiproliferative effect of PACAP38 was shown to be because of inactivation of the small GTPase RhoA that was essential for the proliferation of cultured astroglial cells. Primary Cultures of Dissociated Neocortical Astroglial Cells—Cultures were set up as described previously (37Hildebrand B. Olenik C. Theodoridu A. Boeckh C. Uhl A. Meyer D.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, neocortices of newborn Wistar rats were dissected, chopped, and dissociated by trituration. Cell debris was removed by 3 centrifugations (150 × g, 5 min). The last cell pellet was suspended in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% endotoxin-free fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). Viable cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells per well (35 mm diameter, BD Biosciences) and incubated with the FCS-containing Dulbecco's modified essential medium. After 4 days, the culture medium was renewed. Experiments were performed 6 to 7 days after seeding, when the cells were pre-confluent. At this time, more than 96% were astroglial cells of type I, as indicated by the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein and the absence of A2B5 antigen (37Hildebrand B. Olenik C. Theodoridu A. Boeckh C. Uhl A. Meyer D.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nuclear Uptake of BrdUrd—The nucleotide BrdUrd is taken up during the S phase of the cell cycle. Unless indicated otherwise, experiments were performed in astroglial cells synchronized by FCS withdrawal from the incubation medium for 24 h. To start again the G1 phase progression, FCS (final concentration 10%) was added for 16 h. PACAP38 and other agents to be tested were present during this period. BrdUrd (10 μm; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was added to the medium for the last 60 min of the incubation. Cells were fixed with methanol (-20 °C), washed with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and then incubated with 2 n HCl (10 min, 37 °C). After the medium had been neutralized with borate buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.5), the cells were washed and incubated for 3 h with a mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Diagnostics). The immune complex was detected with a Cy3-labeled secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). To estimate the total cell number, fixed cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Roche Diagnostics) for 5 min. Apoptotic cells were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) added to the incubation medium at a concentration of 5 μg/ml for 20 min prior to fixation. MAP Kinase Assays—ERKs were determined in their activity with a non-radioactive procedure (New England BioLabs, Schwalbach, Germany). After incubation with PACAP38, the astroglial cells were lysed in buffer. After sonication and centrifugation protein concentrations were determined. Aliquots containing 300 μg of protein were used to immunoprecipitate active ERKs with an immobilized monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibody (overnight at 4 °C). To estimate the activity of the precipitated ERKs, the washed precipitate was incubated for 30 min with an Elk-1 fusion protein at 30 °C in the presence of ATP. Reactions were stopped by addition of 3× Laemmli buffer. After electrophoresis in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Unspecific binding was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Elk-1 proteins phosphorylated during the incubation were detected with a phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T, the blot was incubated for 1 h with an anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). Proteins were visualized using the Phototype®-horseradish peroxidase Western blot Detection Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytochemical Staining—Cultured astroglial cells were fixed with a cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (38Schaefer A.W. Kabir N. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) containing 80 mm Pipes, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, plus 4% polyethylene glycol (Mr 35,000) for 15 min. After washing with cytoskeletal stabilization buffer, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer. For actin staining, cells were incubated with Alexa 468-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Heidelberg, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline and washed again with cytoskeletal stabilization buffer. Infection of Astroglial Cells with a Tetracycline responsive Adenovirus System—The adenoviral Tet-On system used here (BD Adeno-X Tet-On Expression System 2, Clontech) is based on the infection of target cells with two different viruses: the recombinant adenovirus containing the gene-of-interest and the Tet-On virus. The latter produces a protein that binds to the Tet-responsive expression cassette in the recombinant adenovirus thereby initiating transcription. As the protein can only bind in the presence of doxycycline, the system allows the graded expression of the gene of interest by application of doxycycline (39Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 40Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). The coding regions of dominant negative RhoA(T19N) (dnRhoA), constitutively active RhoA(G14V) (caRhoA) or PKI were cloned into the tetracycline-responsive pAdeno-X vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. The vector was modified by introducing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and an internal ribosomal entry site into the EcoRI and XhoI sites. Following propagation in HEK 293 cells, the viral lysate was purified by filtration (pore size 0.45 μm) and viral titers were determined using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech). In general, infectious units in the range of 3-7 × 109/ml were obtained. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Six to 7 days after seeding, neocortical astroglial cells were infected for 24 h with recombinant adenovirus and Tet-On virus (in a ratio of 1:1; multiplicity of infection ∼10). To induce expression of EGFP and the protein of interest, 1 μm doxycycline was added to the incubation medium. 36 h after addition of doxycycline the actual experiments were performed. In all experiments, we obtained an infection rate ≥90%, measured by counting EGFP positive cells compared with DAPI positive cells. Transient Transfection of Astroglial Cells—Neocortical astroglial cells were transfected with a pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech) that expressed an enhanced green fluorescent protein/ERF fusion protein (pEGFP-ERF) (41LeGallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The vector was a gift of Dr. Mavrothalassitis (IMBB-Forth, University of Crete, Crete, Greece). Astroglial cells were used after 7 days in vitro. Transient transfection was performed with a mixture of DOTAP and cholesterol (1:1) as a DNA carrier; the lipid: DNA ratio was 8:1. Three μg of pEGFP-ERF plasmid were added per 35-mm well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and pH 7.3. After 6 h, the transfection medium was removed and fresh Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS was added. After 64 h, the cells were used for the experiments. Control experiments were performed with cells transfected with pEGFPC1 without ERF. In these cells, the intracellular localization of EGFP fluorescence was not changed by treatment with serum-free medium or PACAP38 (data not shown). Expression of GST-C21 Protein—The fusion protein GST-C21 contains the Rho-binding region of the Rho effector Rhotekin. The pGEXC21 plasmid encodes the N-terminal 90 amino acids of Rhotekin (42Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It was a gift of Prof. Collard (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells grown at 37 °C. Expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) at A600 1.0. One hour after induction, the cells were collected and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for purification of the GST-C21 protein by affinity purification using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Loaded beads were washed twice with GST-fishing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C. GST-C21 Pull-down Experiments—After drug treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After addition of 250 μl of ice-cold GST-Fish lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin), the cells were harvested. The detergent-soluble supernatant was recovered after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. GTP-Rho was precipitated for 1 h with 20 μl of GST-C21 fusion protein at 4 °C. The complex was washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended, and boiled with Laemmli buffer. Bound RhoA protein was detected by Western blotting using anti-RhoA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Bacterial Toxins—The C2II binding component from Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin C3 toxin (C3FT) were gifts from Dr. H. Barth (51Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C2II binds to the cell membrane and mediates the entry into the cell of the C3FT, which then selectively inactivates the small GTPase RhoA. CNFy toxin from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was prepared as described previously (43Hoffmann C. Pop M. Leemhuis J. Schirmer J. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16026-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Data Collection and Statistical Evaluation—Experiments were repeated at least once. For experiments on BrdUrd uptake, at least 3 wells of a 6-well plate were used per group. BrdUrd as well as DAPI positive cells were counted in an area of 0.1 mm2 with use of a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Five or more areas were counted per well. Statistical comparisons were made by Kruskal Wallis' test followed by Mann-Whitney U test. The mean value of the control areas was used to express all groups as percent of controls. Mean ± S.E. (n) are given; (n) signifies the number of areas counted. Materials—PACAP38 and VIP were from Biomar (Marburg, Germany). SB203580, H89, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were from Calbiochem (Schwalbach, Germany). Cytochalasin D, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, and U0126 were from Sigma. PACAP38 Reduces the Nuclear Uptake of BrdUrd in Neocortical Astroglial Cells—In the presence of FCS (10%) in the incubation medium, astroglial cells passed through the G1 phase and entered the S phase, as indicated by nuclear BrdUrd immunostaining. When either PACAP38 or VIP was present in the incubation medium during the 16 h of incubation, the peptides decreased the nuclear uptake of BrdUrd in a concentration-dependent manner, with EC50 values of ∼0.2 and 50 nm, respectively (Fig. 1A). The lower potency of VIP indicated that it did not act via VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. To test whether PAC1 receptors were involved, we used the PAC1 receptor-specific antagonist PACAP-(6-38), which blocks adenylyl cyclase activation by PACAP38 at a concentration of 1.5 nm (44Robberecht P. Gourlet P. De Neef P. Woussen-Colle M.C. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Vandermeers A. Christophe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). When used at a concentration of 100 nm, PACAP-(6-38) had no effect of its own on nuclear BrdUrd uptake. Despite the high concentration, it did not block the inhibitory effect of 0.5 nm PACAP38, indicating that PAC1 receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase were not involved (Table I).Table IPACAP-(6-38) does not block the effect of PACAP38 on nuclear uptake of BrdUrdTreatmentBrdUrd positive cells% of controlsControls100 ± 8PACAP38, 0.5 nm55 ± 9aaa indicates significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with controls.PACAP-(6-38), 100 nm88 ± 7PACAP38, 0.5 nm, + PACAP-(6-38), 100 nm63 ± 12aa a indicates significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Open table in a new tab To test the long-term effects of PACAP38, we added the neuropeptide to free-cycling cells for 12, 24, or 48 h. Compared with controls, PACAP38 (10 nm) reduced the subsequent nuclear immunostaining of BrdUrd by ≥72% independent of the duration of its presence (Fig. 1B). Because PACAP38 was active over 2 days, we tested whether it reduced the total cell number. When applied for 48 h, PACAP38 reduced the total cell number by 18.5% (Fig. 1C). To exclude that this decrease was because of PACAP38-induced cell death, we used propidium iodide (5 μm; added for 20 min) to stain dead cells. Treatment with 10 nm PACAP38 for 16 h did not significantly increase the number of propidium iodide positive cells (controls 1.7 ± 0.33%; PACAP38 2.8 ± 0.52% (p > 0.05; n = 15). We concluded that PACAP38 indeed exerted an antiproliferative effect. PACAP38 Inhibits Growth Factor-induced BrdUrd Uptake—The EGF and bFGF enhance proliferation in the absence of fetal serum constituents. So does tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C. We examined whether PACAP38 changed the effects of EGF (5 nm), bFGF (100 nm), or TPA (100 nm) on the nuclear uptake of BrdUrd. Glial cells were incubated in FCS-free incubation medium for 24 h in the absence or presence of the growth factors. Compared with controls, TPA, EGF, and bFGF enhanced the number of BrdUrd positive cells by 106, 62, and 65%, respectively. PACAP38 (10 nm) reduced the effects of the 3 different stimuli by ∼64% (Fig. 1D), suggesting that it did not act on the receptors of the growth factors but on a signal transduction pathway shared by the 3 stimuli. PACAP38 Can Reduce Proliferation Independent of PKA—In neuroblasts, PACAP38 reduces proliferation by activating adenylyl cyclase and thus PKA (4Lu N. Cicco-Bloom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3357-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To study whether PACAP38 decreased astroglial proliferation via this pathway, we used the PKA inhibitor protein PKI (45Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was expressed in glial cells using an adenoviral mediated expression system. After infection with either Ad.EGFP or Ad.PKI/EGFP, 91.5 ± 1.3 and 93.6 ± 2%, respectively, of the glial cells showed green fluorescence. Compared with untreated cells, expression of EGFP alone did not change nuclear BrdUrd uptake in synchronized FCS-stimulated astroglial cells (Fig. 2A). Also the inhibitory effect of PACAP38 (10 nm) was not changed by EGFP expression (Fig. 2A). Compared with cells expressing only EGFP, those expressing PKI/EGFP showed an unchanged nuclear uptake of BrdUrd, indicating that active PKA was not necessary for the FCS-induced proliferation (Fig. 2A). Expression of PKI/EGFP did not prevent but only slightly reduced (by 13.3%; p = 0.086) the inhibitory effect of PACAP38 on nuclear BrdUrd uptake (Fig. 2A). To confirm that PKI expression blocked PKA activity, we studied the effect of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin on proliferation. In EGFP expressing cells, forskolin (10 μm) reduced the nuclear uptake of BrdUrd by 76.8%. This effect was indeed no longer present in cells expressing PKI (Fig. 2B). These findings suggested that PACAP38 reduced glial proliferation mainly by an action independent of PKA. To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously applied FSK and PACAP38. The strong reduction in FCS-induced BrdUrd uptake caused by forskolin was indeed further enhanced by additional application of PACAP38 (Fig. 2C). Finally, we used the pharmacological PKA inhibitor H89. It neither changed FCS-stimulated nuclear BrdUrd uptake nor its reduction caused by PACAP38 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data indicated that PACAP38 exerted an antiproliferative effect, which was independent of PKA, although active PKA was able to reduce glial proliferation. PACAP38 Does Not Reduce Proliferation by an Action on ERKs—Kinases of the MAP kinase family, i.e. ERK1 and ERK2, are essential for G1 progression and entry of the S phase. First, we confirmed the role of the ERKs in astroglial proliferation. We used U0126 to inhibit the dual-specificity kinases MEK1/2, which prevents the activation of the ERKs (46Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). U0126 (10 μm) indeed reduced the FCS-stimulated nuclear BrdUrd uptake of synchronized cells by 83.5% (Fig. 3A). When used alone, PACAP38 (10 nm) reduced the BrdUrd uptake by 66.2%. Together with U0126, however, PACAP38 reduced the nuclear BrdUrd uptake by 93.6%. This significant additional effect suggested that U0126 and PACAP38 acted via different mechanisms. Next, we examined whether PACAP38 (10 nm) reduced the activity of the ERKs using an immunoprecipitation assay. We added PACAP38 (10 nm)for upto 4 h to the FCS-containing incubation medium of astroglial cells. It slightly reduced ERK activity only after 1 h, but had no effect at later times (Fig. 3B). In a third approach, we investigated the activity of ETS2 repressor factor (ERF), which is phosphorylated by ERK2 (41LeGallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2004625221,"The Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae contains a single Fe-S cluster localized in subunit NqrF. Here we study the electronic properties of the Fe-S center in a truncated version of the NqrF subunit comprising only its ferredoxin-like Fe-S domain. Mössbauer spectroscopy of the Fe-S domain in the oxidized state is consistent with a binuclear Fe-S cluster with tetrahedral sulfur coordination by the cysteine residues Cys70, Cys76, Cys79, and Cys111. Important sequence motifs surrounding these cysteines are conserved in the Fe-S domain and in vertebrate-type ferredoxins. The magnetic circular dichroism spectra of the photochemically reduced Fe-S domain exhibit a striking similarity to the magnetic circular dichroism spectra of vertebrate-type ferredoxins required for the in vivo assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. This study reveals a novel function for vertebrate-type [2Fe-2S] clusters as redox cofactors in respiratory dehydrogenases."
