https://openalex.org/W2092314167,"Wounding of the leaves of potato or tomato plants by adult Colorado potato beetles, or their larvae, induces a rapid accumulation of a proteinase inhibitor throughout the plants' tissues that are exposed to air. This effect of insect damage can be simulated by mechanically wounding the leaves. The transport of a factor out of damaged leaves takes place rapidly after the wound is inflicted and the levels of proteinase inhibitor, in both damaged and adjacent leaves, rises strikingly within a few hours. The rapid accumulation of a powerful inhibitor of major intestinal proteinases of animals in response to wounding of the leaves is probably a defense mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1985788676,"Techniques of offspring size manipulation, ""allometric engineering,"" were used in combination with studies of natural selection to elucidate the causal relation between egg size and offspring survival of lizards. The results experimentally validate premises underlying theories of optimal egg size: fecundity selection favoring the production of large clutches of small eggs was balanced by survival selection favoring large offspring. However, large hatchlings did not always have the highest survival, contrary to most theoretical expectations. Optimizing selection on offspring size per se was the most common pattern. Moreover, matches between average and optimal egg size were qualitative, not quantitative, perhaps reflecting known functional constraints on the production of large eggs."
https://openalex.org/W1969948439,"Deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America was accompanied by sequestration of organic carbon in newly exposed soils. The greatest rate of land exposure occurred around 12,000 to 8,000 years ago, and the greatest increase in the rate of carbon sequestration by soils occurred from 8,000 to 4,000 years ago. Sequestration of carbon in deglaciated peat lands continues today, and a steady state has not been reached. The natural rate of carbon sequestration in soils, however, is small relative to the rate of anthropogenic carbon dioxide production."
https://openalex.org/W2062239463,"The structural and electronic properties of the [email protected]82 fullerene have been investigated by means of the Car-Parrinello method, which is based on the local density approximation of the density functional theory. The topological arrangement of the C82 cage was assumed to be a C3v symmetry isomer. Three configurations were considered, one with the lanthanum atom at the center of the cluster, one with it along the threefold axis, and one with it at a low-symmetry, highly coordinated site. The structure was fully relaxed and it was found that the last of these configurations is energetically preferred. In this position, the lanthanum atom is nearly in a La3+ state and the unpaired electron is somewhat delocalized on the cage, in agreement with available experimental data. This arrangement suggests that the chemical shifts of the 5s and 5p lanthanum states can be used as a structural probe and as a way of further validating this picture. It is argued that this conclusion is not affected by the assumed fullerene structure."
https://openalex.org/W1966399860,"Because there is an immediate need for policy decisions on how to prevent or adapt to climate change and how to allocate scarce funds for climate research, we need to move beyond isolated studies of the various parts of the problem. Analysis frameworks are needed that incorporate our knowledge about precursors to, processes of, and consequences from climate change. This framework also needs to represent the reliability with which the various pieces of the climate puzzle are understood and be able to propagate uncertainties through the analysis and to reflect them in the conclusions. 15 refs."
https://openalex.org/W1998510069,"Strontium and neodymium isotopic data for rocks from the voluminous 90-million-year-old Lamarck intrusive suite in the Sierra Nevada batholith, California, show little variation across a compositional range from gabbro to granite. Data for three different gabbro intrusions within the suite are identical within analytical error and are consistent with derivation from an enriched mantle source. Recognition of local involvement of enriched mantle during generation of the Sierran batholith modifies estimates of crustal growth rates in the United States. These data indicate that parts of the Sierra Nevada batholith may consist almost entirely of juvenile crust added during Cretaceous magmatism."
https://openalex.org/W2073793128,A saccate pollen grain with a branched pollen tube has been discovered within the pollen chamber of a fossil seed-fern ovule of Middle Pennsylvanian age. This suggests that microgametophytes comparable to those of living gymnosperms were produced by some Paleozoic pteridosperms.
https://openalex.org/W2104217584,The photosynthesis of Tidestromia oblongifolia (Amranthaceae) is remarkably well adapted to operate at the very high summer temperatures of the native habitat on the floor of Death Valley. The photosynthetic rate was very high and reached its daily maximum when the light intensity reached its noon maximum at the high leaf temperatures of 46° to 50°C which occurred at this time. At the intensity of noon sunlight the rate decreased markedly when the leaf temperature was experimentally reduced to below 44°C. The optimum rate occurred at 47°C. At this temperature the photosynthetic rate was essentially directly proportional to light intensity up to full sunlight.
https://openalex.org/W1973050753,"In vitro spermatogenesis takes place when intact testes are cultured in blood plasma containing ecdysone or certain other steroids possessing ecdysone activity. The ecdysone requirement can be satisfied by culturing the testes in the presence of living, active prothoracic glands. The most likely explanation of these results is that the prothoracic glands constitute the principal source of ecdysone."
https://openalex.org/W2013153609,"Cleaved cross sections of nanometer-scale ceramic superlattices fabricated from materials of the lead-thallium-oxygen system were imaged in the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The apparent height differences between the layers were attributed to composition-dependent variations in local electrical properties. For a typical superlattice, the measured modulation wavelength was 10.6 nanometers by STM and 10.8 nanometers by x-ray diffraction. The apparent height profile for potentiostatically deposited superlattices was more square than that for galvanostatically deposited samples. These results suggest that the composition follows the applied potential more closely than it follows the applied current. The x-ray diffraction pattern of a superlattice produced under potential control had satellites out to the fourth order around the (420) Bragg reflection."
https://openalex.org/W1985736040,"With the use of immunofluorescence techniques, gamma globulin antibody specific for the crystallins of Anolis carolinensis lateral eye lens was applied to sections through the median (parapineal) eye of Anolis carolinensis. Only the median eye lens exhibited fluorescence specific for the crystallins; other structures were negative. These results indicate that the lens of the reptilean median eye shares tissue-specific antigenic determinants with the lens of the lateral eye. This suggests a possible evolutionary relation between the two structures, based on biochemical, as well as previously reported anatomical, criteria."

https://openalex.org/W2111622090,"In their report on the ages of crystalline rocks from the Apollo 14 mission, Husain, Sutter, and Schaeffer
present some important results using the ^(40)Ar-^(39)Ar method. This technique, which has been used by several other workers, depends critically on the use of mineral or rock of precisely known ^(40)Ar/K ratio. The age
of the standard is not directly relevant. What is required is the 40Ar/K in the standard. These should be
adequately documented somewhere in the literature. Often the point is missed that the ^(40)Ar-^(39)Ar age is not absolute, but is relative to ^(40)Ar/K of the standard sample. The uncertainty of absolute ages determined by this method must include any uncertainty in the ^(40)Ar/K ratio of the comparison sample. At the present stage of development of argon-potassium dating in particular, and geochronology in general, it is rather surprising to find that workers continue to determine ages on lunar samples, using standards (terrestrial or otherwise) which are themselves uncertain to several percent. In the work by Husain et al. it would appear that the actual uncertainty in age due to both analytical error and the error in the hornblende monitor is 3.77 ± 0.15 ± 0.15 eons, or 3.77 ± ~0.30 eons. Analytical techniques which have been available for some years easily permit more definitive measurements to be made, particularly on valuable lunar materials. Since the time interval over which lunar igneous activity is presently observed to occur is rather restricted (4.00 to 3.20 eons from current data), the necessity for adequately precise data is apparent."

https://openalex.org/W2028450908,"In our article ""Airborne studies of the smoke from the Kuwait oil fires"" (15 May, p. 987) (1), we stated that the depletions of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) in the smoke plume from the Kuwait oil fires were 50 and 60% per hour, respectively. These values were derived from measurements made aboard a Convair C-131 aircraft, and measurements of CO(2) were used as a conserved tracer. Subsequent comparisons of these measurements of CO(2) (which were obtained from a continuous analyzer) with independent measurements of CO(2) (obtained from ""grab"" samples) revealed that the continuous CO(2) measurements were occasionally contaminated by cabin air. Recalculation of the depletion rates of SO(2) and NO(x), with the use of uncontaminated measurements of CO(2) from the ""grab"" sampler aboard the aircraft yielded values of 6 and 22%, respectively (2). Our conclusions with regard to the climatic effects of the Kuwait oil fires are unchanged."
