https://openalex.org/W2808262199,"Enantioselective carbon–hydrogen (C–H) activation reactions by asymmetric metallation could provide new routes for the construction of chiral molecules1,2. However, current methods are typically limited to the formation of five- or six-membered metallacycles, thereby preventing the asymmetric functionalization of C–H bonds at positions remote to existing functional groups. Here we report enantioselective remote C–H activation using a catalytic amount of a chiral norbornene as a transient mediator, which relays initial ortho-C–H activation to the meta position. This was used in the enantioselective meta-C–H arylation of benzylamines, as well as the arylation and alkylation of homobenzylamines. The enantioselectivities obtained using the chiral transient mediator are comparable across different classes of substrates containing either neutral σ-donor or anionic coordinating groups. This relay strategy could provide an alternative means to remote chiral induction, one of the most challenging problems in asymmetric catalysis3,4. Remote, enantioselective C–H activation reactions can be achieved by relaying ortho-C–H activation to the meta position, using a chiral norbornene as the mediator."

However, despite growing evidence implicating the PVT in stress processing, the neural mechanisms by which stress impacts PVT neurocircuitry and promotes stressed states remain unknown. Here we show that stress exposure drives a rapid and persistent reduction of inhibitory transmission onto projection neurons of the posterior PVT (pPVT). This stress-induced disinhibition of the pPVT was associated with a locus coeruleus-mediated rise in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the midline thalamus, required the function of dopamine D2 receptors on PVT neurons, and increased sensitivity to stress. Our findings define the locus coeruleus as an important modulator of PVT function: by controlling the inhibitory tone of the pPVT, it modulates the excitability of pPVT projection neurons and controls stress responsivity."

We analyzed baseline data from 6430 men and women (age 55–70 years) participating in the PREDIMED-Plus study. PREDIMED-Plus is a multi-centre randomized trial testing an energy-restricted MedDiet combined with promotion of physical activity and behavioral therapy for primary cardiovascular prevention compared to a MedDiet alone. Participants answered a 36-item questionnaire about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and a 17-item questionnaire that assessed adherence to an MedDiet. We used ANCOVA and multivariable-adjusted linear regression models to compare baseline adjusted means of the quality of life scales according to categories of adherence to the MedDiet. Higher adherence to the MedDiet was independently associated with significantly better scores in the eight dimensions of HRQoL. Adjusted differences of > = 3 points between the highest and the lowest dietary adherence groups to the MedDiet were observed for vitality, emotional role, and mental health and of > = 2 points for the other dimensions. In conclusion, this study shows a positive association between adherence to a MedDiet and several dimensions of quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2808474415,"Ectopic expression of defined transcription factors can force direct cell-fate conversion from one lineage to another in the absence of cell division. Several transcription factor cocktails have enabled successful reprogramming of various somatic cell types into induced neurons (iNs) of distinct neurotransmitter phenotype. However, the nature of the intermediate states that drive the reprogramming trajectory toward distinct iN types is largely unknown. Here we show that successful direct reprogramming of adult human brain pericytes into functional iNs by Ascl1 and Sox2 encompasses transient activation of a neural stem cell-like gene expression program that precedes bifurcation into distinct neuronal lineages. During this transient state, key signaling components relevant for neural induction and neural stem cell maintenance are regulated by and functionally contribute to iN reprogramming and maturation. Thus, Ascl1- and Sox2-mediated reprogramming into a broad spectrum of iN types involves the unfolding of a developmental program via neural stem cell-like intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W2808295659,"Recent work has highlighted the importance of transient low-frequency oscillatory (LFO; <4 Hz) activity in the healthy primary motor cortex during skilled upper-limb tasks. These brief bouts of oscillatory activity may establish the timing or sequencing of motor actions. Here, we show that LFOs track motor recovery post-stroke and can be a physiological target for neuromodulation. In rodents, we found that reach-related LFOs, as measured in both the local field potential and the related spiking activity, were diminished after stroke and that spontaneous recovery was closely correlated with their restoration in the perilesional cortex. Sensorimotor LFOs were also diminished in a human subject with chronic disability after stroke in contrast to two non-stroke subjects who demonstrated robust LFOs. Therapeutic delivery of electrical stimulation time-locked to the expected onset of LFOs was found to significantly improve skilled reaching in stroke animals. Together, our results suggest that restoration or modulation of cortical oscillatory dynamics is important for the recovery of upper-limb function and that they may serve as a novel target for clinical neuromodulation. Recovery of skilled motor function in rodents after stroke correlates with the restoration of low-frequency quasi-oscillatory activity in the motor cortex, and neuromodulatory electrical stimulation targeting this activity can further accelerate recovery."

https://openalex.org/W2807977171,"Neural circuit assembly relies on the precise synchronization of developmental processes, such as cell migration and axon targeting, but the cell-autonomous mechanisms coordinating these events remain largely unknown. Here we found that different classes of interneurons use distinct routes of migration to reach the embryonic cerebral cortex. Somatostatin-expressing interneurons that migrate through the marginal zone develop into Martinotti cells, one of the most distinctive classes of cortical interneurons. For these cells, migration through the marginal zone is linked to the development of their characteristic layer 1 axonal arborization. Altering the normal migratory route of Martinotti cells by conditional deletion of Mafb-a gene that is preferentially expressed by these cells-cell-autonomously disrupts axonal development and impairs the function of these cells in vivo. Our results suggest that migration and axon targeting programs are coupled to optimize the assembly of inhibitory circuits in the cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2797507121,"Superoxide is a reactive oxygen species produced during aerobic metabolism in mitochondria and prokaryotes. It causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA and is implicated in cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders and aging. As protection, cells express soluble superoxide dismutases, disproportionating superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Here, we describe a membrane-bound enzyme that directly oxidizes superoxide and funnels the sequestered electrons to ubiquinone in a diffusion-limited reaction. Experiments in proteoliposomes and inverted membranes show that the protein is capable of efficiently quenching superoxide generated at the membrane in vitro. The 2.0 Å crystal structure shows an integral membrane di-heme cytochrome b poised for electron transfer from the P-side and proton uptake from the N-side. This suggests that the reaction is electrogenic and contributes to the membrane potential while also conserving energy by reducing the quinone pool. Based on this enzymatic activity, we propose that the enzyme family be denoted superoxide oxidase (SOO). The membrane-bound enzyme CybB can directly oxidize superoxide to molecular oxygen and transfer the sequestered electrons to ubiquinone in vitro, providing a mechanism for superoxide scavenging distinct from that of superoxide dismutase."

GLUT5 (fructose) and GLUT2 (glucose/fructose) might provide alternative targets for BC imaging as to why effects of hypoxia on GLUT1/2/5 levels and function were examined in human BC models. GLUT1/2/5 and HIF1a mRNA was analyzed in BC patient biopsies. In MCF10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB231 cells, [18F]FDG, 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D- fructose (6-[18F]FDF) and [18F]-fluoroazomycin arabinoside were used in radiotracer experiments, whereas GLUT1/2/5 mRNA was analyzed with real-time PCR and protein levels determined via Western blot/ immunohistochemistry. Positron emission tomography imaging was performed in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 tumor-bearing mice. Glucose/fructose/cytochalasin B reduced cellular 6-[18F]FDF uptake by 50%, indicating functional involvement of GLUT2. With GLUT5 staining lower than GLUT1, 6-[18F]FDF revealed lower uptake than [18F]FDG [standardized uptake value (SUV)6_[18F]FDF, 120 min 0.77 ± 0.06 vs. SUV[18F]FDF, 120 min 1.08 ± 0.07] in MDA-MB231 tumors and was blocked by 20% with cytochalasin B after 10 min. Whereas correspondence between 6-[18F]FDF uptake and GLUT5 protein was low, high GLUT2 levels were detected in all cell lines and tumor models. Besides GLUT1, GLUT5 seems to be regulated under hypoxia on the molecular and functional level. Additionally, results strongly support a functional involvement of GLUT2 in fructose metabolism, possibly by compensating for the weaker expression and function of GLUT5 in BC.—Hamann, I., Krys, D., Glubrecht, D., Bouvet, V., Marshall, A., Vos, L., Mackey, J.

Managing obesity is of interest to address the worldwide health problem; however, the role of genetic variability in human obesity development and specific targets for obesity-related metabolic disease have not been thoroughly studied. A SNP in the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) gene that results in the substitution of a valine with a methionine at codon 66 (Val66Met) occurs with a high frequency in humans. This study addressed the effect of genetic variability in developing obesity and the efficacy of the inhibition of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a multifunctional receptor implicated in obesity and insulin resistance, in WT mice and mice with the BDNF Val66Met variant. CD36 inhibition by salvionolic acid B (SAB) in diet-induced obese WT mice reduced visceral fat accumulation and improved insulin resistance. The benefit of SAB was abrogated in CD36 knockout mice, showing the specificity of SAB. In addition, mice with the Val66Met variant in both alleles (BDNFM/M) fed a high-fat diet exhibited extreme obesity with increased CD36 gene and protein levels in macrophages. Chronic SAB treatment in BDNFM/M mice significantly decreased visceral fat accumulation and improved insulin resistance. Notably, the effect of SAB was greater in the extremely obese BDNFM/M mice compared with the WT mice. The study demonstrated a link between BDNF Val66Met and elevated CD36 expression and suggested that CD36 inhibition may be a potential strategy to improve metabolic dysfunctions and to normalize risk factors for vascular diseases in the obese population.

https://openalex.org/W2950530098,"Commensal bacteria are the representative of the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes present in a community. The usage of antibiotics along with the demographic factors is generally associated with an increase in antibiotics resistance in pathogens. Northeast (NE) India is untapped with regard to antibiotic resistance prevalence and spread. In the current study, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant commensal Escherichia coli in pre-school and school-going children (n = 550, 1-14 years old) from the rural areas of the state of Sikkim-an NE Indian state, with respect to associated demographic factors was investigated. A total of 550 fecal E. coli isolates were collected during July 2015 to June 2017. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data to ascertain the potential factors associated with the carriage of antibiotic resistance E. coli among the children. Statistical analysis along with a logistic regression identified potential external factors affecting the observed antibiotic resistance pattern. The data indicated a high prevalence of resistance to common antibiotics like ampicillin (92%), ceftazidime (90%), cefoxitin (88%), streptomycin (40%) and tetracycline (36%), but no resistance to chloramphenicol. The resistance to the combination of penicillin and quinolone group of antibiotics was observed in fifty-two percent of the isolates. A positive correlation between the harboring of antibiotics resistant E. coli with different demographic factors was observed such as, with children living in nuclear family (vs joint family 63.15%, OR 0.18, 95% CI:0.11-0.28, p < 0.01), below higher secondary maternal education (vs college graduates 59.27% OR 0.75, 95% CI:0.55-1.02, p < 0.02). A close association between different demographic factors and the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant commensal E. coli in the current study suggests a concern over rising misuse of antibiotics that warrants a future threat of emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogen isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2808604828,"Biochemical, structural and cellular studies reveal Jumonji-C (JmjC) domain-containing 7 (JMJD7) to be a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes (3S)-lysyl hydroxylation. Crystallographic analyses reveal JMJD7 to be more closely related to the JmjC hydroxylases than to the JmjC demethylases. Biophysical and mutation studies show that JMJD7 has a unique dimerization mode, with interactions between monomers involving both N- and C-terminal regions and disulfide bond formation. A proteomic approach identifies two related members of the translation factor (TRAFAC) family of GTPases, developmentally regulated GTP-binding proteins 1 and 2 (DRG1/2), as activity-dependent JMJD7 interactors. Mass spectrometric analyses demonstrate that JMJD7 catalyzes Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent hydroxylation of a highly conserved lysine residue in DRG1/2; amino-acid analyses reveal that JMJD7 catalyzes (3S)-lysyl hydroxylation. The functional assignment of JMJD7 will enable future studies to define the role of DRG hydroxylation in cell growth and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2809326591,"There is an association between puberty and depression, but many things remain poorly understood. When assessing puberty in females, most studies combine indicators of breast and pubic hair development which are controlled by different hormonal pathways. The contributions of pubertal timing (age at onset) and pubertal status (stage of development, irrespective of timing) are also poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that stage of breast development in female adolescents, controlled largely by increased estradiol, would be more strongly associated with depression than pubic hair development which occurs in both males and females, and is controlled by adrenal androgens. We investigated whether this association was independent of pubertal timing.ROOTS is an ongoing cohort of 1,238 adolescents (54% female) recruited in Cambridgeshire (UK) at age 14.5, and followed-up at ages 16 and 17.5. Depression was assessed using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) and clinical interview. Breast and pubic hair development were assessed at 14.5, using Tanner rating scales.For each increase in Tanner breast stage at 14.5, depressive symptoms increased by 1.4 MFQ points (95% CI 0.6 to 2.3), irrespective of age at onset. Pubic hair status was only associated with depressive symptoms before adjustment for breast status, and was not associated with depression in males. The same pattern was observed longitudinally, and for depression diagnoses.We did not directly measure hormone levels, our findings are observational, and the study had a relatively low response rate.Females at more advanced stages of breast development are at increased risk of depression, even if their age at pubertal onset is not early. Alongside social and psychological factors, hormones controlling breast but not pubic hair development may contribute to increased incidence of female depression during puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2809447484,"The hepatic Na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP in man, Ntcp in animals) is the high-affinity receptor for the hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis D (HDV) viruses. Species barriers for human HBV/HDV within the order Primates were previously attributed to Ntcp sequence variations that disable virus-receptor interaction. However, only a limited number of primate Ntcps have been analysed so far. In the present study, a total of 11 Ntcps from apes, Old and New World monkeys were cloned and expressed in vitro to characterise their interaction with HBV and HDV. All Ntcps showed intact bile salt transport. Human NTCP as well as the Ntcps from the great apes chimpanzee and orangutan showed transport-competing binding of HBV derived myr-preS1-peptides. In contrast, all six Ntcps from the group of Old World monkeys were insensitive to HBV myr-preS1-peptide binding and HBV/HDV infection. This is basically predetermined by the amino acid arginine at position 158 of all studied Old World monkey Ntcps. An exchange from arginine to glycine (as present in humans and great apes) at this position (R158G) alone was sufficient to achieve full transport-competing HBV myr-preS1-peptide binding and susceptibility for HBV/HDV infection. New World monkey Ntcps showed higher sequence heterogeneity, but in two cases with 158G showed transport-competing HBV myr-preS1-peptide binding, and in one case (Saimiri sciureus) even susceptibility for HBV/HDV infection. In conclusion, amino acid position 158 of NTCP/Ntcp is sufficient to discriminate between the HBV/HDV susceptible group of humans and great apes (158G) and the non-susceptible group of Old World monkeys (158R). In the case of the phylogenetically more distant New World monkey Ntcps amino acid 158 plays a significant, but not exclusive role."
https://openalex.org/W2802367205,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional protein that contains angiogenic and neurotrophic properties. In the current study, we investigated the analgesic effects of HGF by using a plasmid DNA that was designed to express 2 isoforms of human HGF-pCK-HGF-X7 (or VM202)-in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) -induced mouse neuropathic pain model. Intramuscular injection of pCK-HGF-X7 into proximal thigh muscle induced the expression of HGF in the muscle, sciatic nerve, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This gene transfer procedure significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia after CCI. Injury-induced expression of activating transcription factor 3, calcium channel subunit α2δ1, and CSF1 in the ipsilateral DRG neurons was markedly down-regulated in the pCK-HGF-X7-treated group, which suggested that HGF might exert its analgesic effects by inhibiting pain-mediating genes in the sensory neurons. In addition, suppressed CSF1 expression in DRG neurons by pCK-HGF-X7 treatment was accompanied by a noticeable suppression of the nerve injury-induced glial cell activation in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Taken together, our data show that pCK-HGF-X7 attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain by inhibiting pain-related factors in DRG neurons and subsequent spinal cord glial activation, which suggests its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain.-Nho, B., Lee, J., Lee, J., Ko, K.

The goal of this study was to determine the effects of maternal folic acid supplementation (10 mg/kg diet), with (50 μg/kg diet) and without B12, on adult female offspring adiposity and glucose homeostasis. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed 1 of 3 diets from weaning and throughout breeding, pregnancy, and lactation: control (2 mg/kg diet folic acid, 50 μg/kg diet B12), supplemental folic acid with no B12 (SFA-B12), or supplemental folic acid with adequate B12 (SFA+B12). Female offspring were weaned onto the control diet or a Western diet (45% energy fat, 2 mg/kg diet folic acid, 50 μg/kg diet B12) for 35 wk. After weaning, control diet-fed offspring with SFA-B12 dams had fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, lower β cell mass, and greater islet hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox α and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 mRNA than did offspring from control dams. In Western diet-fed offspring, those with SFA-B12 dams had lower fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, and were smaller than control offspring. Our findings suggest that maternal folic acid supplementation with B12 deficiency during pregnancy/lactation programs the metabolic health of adult female offspring but is dependent on offspring diet.-Henderson, A.

https://openalex.org/W2808326604,"Although defects in the RB1 tumour suppressor are one of the more common driver alterations found in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), therapeutic approaches that exploit this have not been identified. By integrating molecular profiling data with data from multiple genetic perturbation screens, we identified candidate synthetic lethal (SL) interactions associated with RB1 defects in TNBC. We refined this analysis by identifying the highly penetrant effects, reasoning that these would be more robust in the face of molecular heterogeneity and would represent more promising therapeutic targets. A significant proportion of the highly penetrant RB1 SL effects involved proteins closely associated with RB1 function, suggesting that this might be a defining characteristic. These included nuclear pore complex components associated with the MAD2 spindle checkpoint protein, the kinase and bromodomain containing transcription factor TAF1, and multiple components of the SCFSKP Cullin F box containing complex. Small-molecule inhibition of SCFSKP elicited an increase in p27Kip levels, providing a mechanistic rationale for RB1 SL. Transcript expression of SKP2, a SCFSKP component, was elevated in RB1-defective TNBCs, suggesting that in these tumours, SKP2 activity might buffer the effects of RB1 dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2808856645,"Activation of adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) by its natural ligand, adiponectin has been known to be involved in modulating critical metabolic processes such as glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation as demonstrated by a number of in vitro and in vivo studies over last two decades. These findings suggest that AdipoRs' agonists could be developed into a potential therapeutic agent for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, especially for type II diabetes, a long-term metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Because of limitations in production of biologically active adiponectin, adiponectin-mimetic AdipoRs' agonists have been suggested as alternative ways to expand the opportunity to develop anti-diabetic agents. Based on crystal structure of AdipoR1, we designed AdipoR1's peptide agonists using protein-peptide docking simulation and screened their receptor binding abilities and biological functions via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biological analysis. Three candidate peptides, BHD1028, BHD43, and BHD44 were selected and confirmed to activate AdipoR1-mediated signal pathways. In order to enhance the stability and solubility of peptide agonists, candidate peptides were PEGylated. PEGylated BHD1028 exhibited its biological activity at nano-molar concentration and could be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes. Also, SPR and virtual screening techniques utilized in this study may potentially be applied to other peptide-drug screening processes against membrane receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2796917569,"Muscle mitochondria are crucial for systemic metabolic function, yet their regulation remains unclear. The zinc finger MYND domain-containing protein 17 (Zmynd17) was recently identified as a muscle-specific gene in mammals. Here, we investigated the role of Zmynd17 in mice. We found Zmynd17 predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, especially in fast glycolytic muscle. Genetic Zmynd17 inactivation led to morphologic and functional abnormalities in muscle mitochondria, resulting in decreased respiratory function. Metabolic stress induced by a high-fat diet upregulated Zmynd17 expression and further exacerbated muscle mitochondrial morphology in Zmynd17-deficient mice. Strikingly, Zmynd17 deficiency significantly aggravated metabolic stress-induced hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, middle-aged mice lacking Zmynd17 exhibited impaired aerobic exercise performance, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Thus, our results indicate that Zmynd17 is a metabolic stress-inducible factor that maintains muscle mitochondrial integrity, with its deficiency profoundly affecting whole-body glucose metabolism.—Fujita, R., Yoshioka, K., Seko, D., Suematsu, T., Mitsuhashi, S., Senoo, N., Miura, S., Nishino, I., Ono, Y.

However, normative data is influenced by anthropometry and such differences among subjects impede accurate assessment. De-correlation of anthropometry from gait parameters and mobility measures is therefore desirable.87 (42 male) healthy subjects varying form 21 to 84 years of age were assessed on gait parameters (cadence, ankle velocity, stride time, stride length) and mobility measures (the 3-meter/7-meter Timed Up-and-Go, 10-meter Walk Test). Multiple linear regression models were derived for each gait parameter and mobility measure, with anthropometric measurements (age, height, body mass, gender) and self-selected walking speed as independent variables. The resulting models were used to normalize the gait parameters and mobility measures. The normalization's capability in de-correlating data and reducing data dispersion were evaluated.Gait parameters were predominantly influenced by height and walking speed, while mobility measures were affected by age and walking speed. Normalization de-correlated data from anthropometric measurements from |rs| < 0.74 to |rs| < 0.23, and reduced data dispersion by up to 69%.Normalization of gait parameters and mobility measures through linear regression models augment the capability to compare subjects with varying anthropometric measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4210392811,"During its life cycle, Zika virus (ZIKV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus that is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome and causes microencephaly in fetuses and newborn children, encodes a critical and indispensable helicase domain that has 5'-triphosphatase activity and performs ATP hydrolysis to generate energy and thus, sustains unwinding of double-stranded RNA during ZIKV genome replication. Of these processes, ATP hydrolysis represents the most basic event; however, its dynamic mechanisms remain largely unknown, impeding the further understanding of the function of ZIKV helicase and the ongoing anti-ZIKV drug design. In this work, we determined the crystal structure of ZIKV helicase in complex with ADP-AlF3-Mn2+ and ADP-Mn2+ separately. The structural analysis indicates that these structures represent the intermediate state and posthydrolysis state, respectively, of the ATP hydrolysis process of ZIKV helicase. These findings, together with our earlier work, which identified the prehydrolysis state of ZIKV helicase, lead to a proposal of the ATP hydrolysis cycle for ZIKV helicase. On this basis, we used site- directed mutagenesis combined with an enzymatic study to identify successfully residues that are critical for the ATPase activity of ZIKV helicase; this will provide new ideas to understand the function for the key enzyme of ZIKV.—Yang, X., Chen, C., Tian, H., Chi, H., Mu, Z., Zhang, T., Yang, K., Zhao, Q., Liu, X., Wang, Z., Ji, X., Yang, H.

Antisense-mediated exon skipping has the ability to correct out-of-frame mutations in DMD to produce truncated but functional dystrophin. Traditional antisense approaches have however been limited by their poor uptake into cardiac muscle. The addition of cell-penetrating peptides to antisense molecules has increased their potency and improved their uptake into all muscles, including the heart. We have investigated the efficacy of the Peptide-conjugated phosphodiamidate morpholino oligomer (P-PMO) Pip6a-PMO, for restoration of cardiac dystrophin and functional rescue in DMD mice- the mdx mouse and the less well characterised Cmah-/-mdx mouse (which carry a human-like mutation in the mouse Cmah gene as well as a mutation in DMD).

Mice received 4 doses of 18 mg/kg followed by 8 doses of 12.5 mg/kg. The cardiac function of the mice was analysed 2 weeks after their final injection by MRI followed by conductance catheter and their muscles were harvested for dystrophin quantification. In the second study, male Cmah-/-mdx mice, received 12.5 mg/kg Pip6a-PMO, i.v fortnightly from 8 to 26 weeks and assessed by MRI at 3 time points (12, 18 and 28 weeks) alongside mock-injected age-matched mdx, C57BL10 and Cmah-/-mdx controls. The mice also underwent MEMRI and conductance catheter at 28 weeks. This allowed us to characterise the cardiac phenotype of Cmah-/-mdx mice as well as assess the effects of P-PMO on cardiac function. Pip6a-PMO treatment resulted in significant restoration of dystrophin in mdx and Cmah-/-mdx mice (37.5% and 51.6%, respectively), which was sufficient to significantly improve cardiac function, ameliorating both right and left ventricular dysfunction. Cmah-/-mdx mice showed an abnormal response to dobutamine stress test and this was completely ameliorated by PIP6a-PMO treatment. These encouraging data suggest that total restoration of dystrophin may not be required to significantly improve cardiac outcome in DMD patients and that it may be realistic to expect functional improvements with modest levels of dystrophin restoration which may be very achievable in future clinical trials."

The aim of the current study was to investigate the possible role of GDF11 in liver IRI. We investigated the effects of GDF11 in liver IRI in both young (3 mo) and old (22 mo) mice in vivo, and in primary young and old mouse hepatocytes in vitro. Both serum and hepatic GDF11 protein expression levels increased with age and after IRI. Treatment with recombinant GDF11 significantly increased IRI-induced elevations of serum aminotransferase levels, worsened the histologic status of livers, and impaired liver regeneration. In contrast, inhibition of GDF11 activity with neutralizing Abs significantly decreased liver injury and improved liver regeneration after IRI. In vitro, treatment with recombinant GDF11 significantly delayed cell proliferation in cultured hepatocytes that were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation insult. Moreover, suppression of cell-cycle progression may be a key mechanism by which GDF11 inhibited hepatocyte regeneration. Collectively, rather than acting as a rejuvenating agent, GDF11 worsens hepatocellular injury and impairs liver regeneration after IRI.—Liu, A., Dong, W., Peng, J., Dirsch, O., Dahmen, U., Fang, H., Zhang, C., Sun, J.

https://openalex.org/W2809059702,"Background Several studies reported that the majority of deaths in HIV-infected people are documented in their early antiretroviral therapy (ART) follow-ups. Early mortality refers to death of people on ART for follow up period of below 24 months due to any cause. The current study assessed predictors of early HIV mortality in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods We have conducted a retrospective analysis of 5299 patient records dating from June 2003- March 2015. To estimate survival time and compare the time to event among the different groups of patients, we used a Kaplan Meir curve and log-rank test. To identify mortality predictors, we used a cox regression analysis. We used SPSS-20 for all analyses. Results A total of 326 patients died in the 12 years follow-up period contributing to 6.2% cumulative incidence and 21.7 deaths per 1000 person-year observations incidence rate. Eighty-nine percent of the total deaths were documented in the first two years follow up—an early-term ART follow up. Early HIV mortality rates among adults were 50% less in separated, divorced or widowed patients compared with never married patients, 1.6 times higher in patients with baseline CD4 count <200 cells/μL compared to baseline CD4 count ≥200 cells/μL, 1.5 times higher in patients with baseline WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 compared to baseline WHO clinical stage 1 or 2, 2.1 times higher in patients with immunologic failure compared with no immunologic failure, 60% less in patients with fair or poor compared with good adherence, 2.9 times higher in patients with bedridden functional status compared to working functional status, and 2.7 times higher with patients who had no history of HIV testing before diagnosis compared to those who had history of HIV testing. Most predictors of early mortality remained the same to the predictors of an overall HIV mortality. When discontinuation was assumed as an event, the predictors of an overall HIV mortality included age between 25–50 years, base line CD4 count, developing immunologic failure, bedridden functional status, and no history of HIV testing before diagnosis. Conclusions The great majority of deaths were documented in the first two years of ART, and several predictors of early HIV mortality were also for the overall mortality when discontinuation was assumed as event or censored. Considering the above population, interventions to improve HIV program in the first two years of ART follow up should be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2796822606,"Although autacoids primarily derived from the cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways are essential mediators of inflammation, endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) act as robust agonists of resolution. SPM biosynthesis is initiated by the conversion of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid primarily via the 12/15-LOX pathway. Although 12/15-LOX activity is prominent in the cornea, the role of SPM pathway activation during infection remains largely unknown and is the focus of the current study. Pseudomonas keratitis was induced in resistant BALB/c and susceptible C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Biosynthetic pathways for proinflammatory autacoids and SPMs were assessed. Divergent lipid mediator profiles demonstrate the importance of 15-LOX pathways in the pathogenesis of ocular infectious disease. Results indicate that an imbalance of LOX enzymatic pathways contributes to susceptibility observed in B6 mice where deficient activation of SPM circuits, as indicated by reduced 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid levels, prevented transition toward resolution and led to chronic inflammation. In sharp contrast, BALB/c mice demonstrated a well-balanced axis of 5-LOX/12-LOX/15-LOX pathways, resulting in sufficient proresolving bioactive metabolite formation and immune homeostasis. Furthermore, a novel immunoregulatory role for 15-LOX was revealed in inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages), which influenced phagocytic activity. These data provide evidence that SPM circuits are essential for host defense during bacterial keratitis.-Carion, T. W., Greenwood, M., Ebrahim, A. S., Jerome, A., Suvas, S., Gronert, K., Berger, E.

https://openalex.org/W2808985258,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are an important source of severe and incurable human diseases. The vast majority of these mutations are heteroplasmic, meaning that mutant and wild-type genomes are present simultaneously in the same cell. Only a very high proportion of mutant mitochondrial DNA (heteroplasmy level) leads to pathological consequences. We previously demonstrated that mitochondrial targeting of small RNAs designed to anneal with mutant mtDNA can decrease the heteroplasmy level by specific inhibition of mutant mtDNA replication, thus representing a potential therapy. We have also shown that 5S ribosomal RNA, partially imported into human mitochondria, can be used as a vector to deliver anti-replicative oligoribonucleotides into human mitochondria. So far, the efficiency of cellular expression of recombinant 5S rRNA molecules bearing therapeutic insertions remained very low. In the present study, we designed new versions of anti-replicative recombinant 5S rRNA targeting a large deletion in mitochondrial DNA which causes the KSS syndrome, analyzed their specific annealing to KSS mitochondrial DNA and demonstrated their import into mitochondria of cultured human cells. To obtain an increased level of the recombinant 5S rRNA stable expression, we created transmitochondrial cybrid cell line bearing a site for Flp-recombinase and used this system for the recombinase-mediated integration of genes coding for the anti-replicative recombinant 5S rRNAs into nuclear genome. We demonstrated that stable expression of anti-replicative 5S rRNA versions in human transmitochondrial cybrid cells can induce a shift in heteroplasmy level of KSS mutation in mtDNA. This shift was directly dependent on the level of the recombinant 5S rRNA expression and the sequence of the anti-replicative insertion. Quantification of mtDNA copy number in transfected cells revealed the absence of a non-specific effect on wild type mtDNA replication, indicating that the decreased proportion between mutant and wild type mtDNA molecules is not a consequence of a random repopulation of depleted pool of mtDNA genomes. The heteroplasmy change could be also modulated by cell growth conditions, namely increased by cells culturing in a carbohydrate-free medium, thus forcing them to use oxidative phosphorylation and providing a selective advantage for cells with improved respiration capacities. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach and propose further development of the anti-replicative strategy based on the RNA import into human mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2809016581,"Objective Endothelial barrier function in the onset and Tongxinluo (TXL) protection of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and TXL can induce the secretion of Angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells during hypoxia/reoxygenation. We intend to demonstrate whether TXL can attenuate myocardial I/R injury in diabetes, characterized with microvascular endothelial barrier disruption, by induction of Angptl4-mediated protection of endothelial barrier integrity. Methods and results I/R injury was created by coronary ligation in ZDF diabetic and non-diabetic control rats. The animals were anesthetized and randomized to sham operation or I/R injury with or without the exposure to insulin, rhAngptl4, TXL, Angptl4 siRNA, and the PPAR-α inhibitor MK886. Tongxinluo, insulin and rhAngptl4 have the similar protective effect on diabetic hearts against I/R injury. In I/R-injured diabetic hearts, TXL treatment remarkably reduced the infarct size, and protected endothelial barrier integrity demonstrated by decreased endothelial cells apoptosis, microvascular permeability, and myocardial hemorrhage, fortified tight junction, and upregulated expression of JAM-A, integrin-α5, and VE-cadherin, and these effects of TXL were as effective as insulin and rhAngptl4. However, Angptl4 knock-down with siRNA interference and inhibition of PPAR-α with MK886 partially diminished these beneficial effects of TXL and rhAngptl4. TXL induced the expression of Angptl4 in I/R-injured diabetic hearts, and was canceled by Angptl4 siRNA and MK886. TXL treatment increased myocardial PPAR-α activity, and was abolished by MK886 but not by Angptl4 siRNA. Conclusions TXL protects diabetic hearts against I/R injury by activating Angptl4-mediated restoration of endothelial barrier integrity via the PPAR-α pathway."

However, due to the vulnerability of critically ill patients, invasive diagnostic methods should be performed with caution in the intensive care unit (ICU). It would be helpful if the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical impact of virus detection are elucidated. Methods We evaluated patients with severe pneumonia between January 1st 2008 and December 31st 2015. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for 8 respiratory viruses when viral pathogen could not be excluded as the origin of severe pneumonia. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, microbiological findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. Results Of the 2,347 patients admitted to the medical ICU, 515 underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viruses, 69 of whom had positive results. The detection rate was higher during the winter, with a community onset, in patients with history of recent chemotherapy, and low platelet count. Additional bronchoscopic sampling along with upper respiratory specimen increased the yield of viral detection. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen detected, while influenza A was the most common virus with bacterial coinfection. Respiratory virus detection led to changes in clinical management in one-third of the patients. Conclusions The detection of viral pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia is not rare, and can be more common in certain group of patients. Invasive sampling for RT-PCR can be helpful, and such detection can lead to positive changes in clinical management."

The interactions of cyclophilin A with its ligand extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN or CD147) may be involved in this inflammatory process. To this end, here we induced APE by intravenous injections of microspheres in Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that after the APE, cyclophilin A and CD147 levels increased synchronously in RV tissue following APE and peaked at 24 h. The cyclophilin A inhibitor cyclosporine A attenuated the APE-induced cyclophilin A levels, and a monoclonal antibody of CD147 (anti-CD147) abrogated the elevation of CD147 in the RV but not the increase of cyclophilin A. Importantly, treatment with cyclosporine A, anti-CD147, or both attenuated APE-induced increases in RV systolic pressure, plasma cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) concentrations, the RV/left ventricle diameter ratio, and the Tei index, measured by echocardiography 24 h after APE induction. These beneficial effects were associated with reduced RV neutrophil infiltration and prevention of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 activation. These findings suggested that inhibiting the cyclophilin A–CD147 interaction attenuates APE-associated RV cardiomyocyte injury and dysfunction by suppressing inflammation.

The phenotype of Hint2 knockout ( Hint2-/-) mice includes progressive hepatic steatosis and lysine hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins, which are features of respiratory chain malfunctions. We postulated that the absence of HINT-2 induces a defect in mitochondria bioenergetics. Isolated Hint2-/- hepatocytes produced less ATP and generated a lower mitochondrial membrane potential than did Hint2+/+ hepatocytes. In extracellular flux analyses with glucose, the basal, ATP-linked, and maximum oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were decreased in Hint2-/- hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells lacking HINT-2. Conversely, in HINT-2 overexpressing SNU-449 and HepG2 cells, the basal, ATP-linked, and maximum OCRs were increased. Similarly, with palmitate, basal and maximum OCRs were decreased in Hint2-/- hepatocytes, but they were increased in HINT-2 overexpressing HepG2 cells. When assayed with radiolabeled substrate, palmitate oxidation was reduced by 25% in Hint2-/- mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2808986508,"Introduction The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics, risky sexual behaviour, alcohol use and transactional sex among female bar workers in Yaounde, Cameroon. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a representative sample of 410 female bar workers, recruited through a modified version of venue-based cluster sampling technique from May to June 2017. Transactional sex was defined as having received money/gifts in exchange for sex with any sexual partner in the past 12 months. Logistic regression models were performed to identify the factors associated with transactional sex. The level of statistical significance was set at p< = 0.05. Results About 14.9% (n = 61) of respondents reported to have engaged in transactional sex, 83.7% (n = 338) had multiple sexual partners at the time of the study, 14.4% (n = 55) had sex with one or more of their male customers in the past 6 months. Almost 73.4% (n = 301) reported alcohol use. Of these, 37.2% (n = 112) were frequent alcohol consumers. About 17.6% (n = 72) reported to have had unprotected sex under the influence of alcohol in the past 6 months. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that those who engaged in transactional sex were more likely to have had sex with a male customer in the past 6 months (aOR = 7.34; 95% CI, 3.63–16.98), had sex under the influence of alcohol in the past 6 months (aOR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.18–4.96) and frequent alcohol consumers (aOR = 2.06; 95%CI, 1.04–4.10). Respondents who had their last sexual intercourse 4 weeks or more prior to the study (aOR = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08–0.84) were less likely to have engaged in transactional sex. Conclusions Our study concludes that female bar workers are exposed to male customers and engage in risky sexual practices including transaction sex. Most of them also consume alcohol which increases their risk of HIV and STI acquisition. They are a high-risk group that need to be targeted with HIV prevention interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2802662564,"mAbs have emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. However, in several malignancies, no effective antitumor mAbs are yet available. Identifying therapeutic mAbs that recognize common tumor antigens could render the treatment widely applicable. Here, a human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library was sequentially affinity selected against a panel of human cancer cell lines and an antibody fragment (named MS5) that bound to solid and blood cancer cells was identified. The MS5 scFv was fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain to generate an antibody (MS5-Fc fusion) that induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages. In addition, the MS5-Fc antibody bound to primary leukemia cells and induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the majority of analyzed cancer cells, the MS5-Fc antibody induced cell surface redistribution of the receptor complexes, but not internalization, thus maximizing the accessibility of the IgG1 Fc domain to immune effector cells. In vitro stability studies showed that the MS5-Fc antibody was stable after 6 d of incubation in human serum, retaining ∼60% of its initial intact form. After intravenous injections, the antibody localized into tumor tissues and inhibited the growth of 3 different human tumor xenografts (breast, lymphoma, and leukemia). These antitumor effects were associated with tumor infiltration by macrophages and NK cells. In the Ramos B-cell lymphoma xenograft model, the MS5-Fc antibody exhibited a comparable antitumor effect as rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 mAb. These results indicate that human antibodies with pan-cancer abilities can be generated from phage display libraries, and that the engineered MS5-Fc antibody could be an attractive agent for further clinical investigation.-Sioud, M., Westby, P., Vasovic, V., Fløisand, Y., Peng, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2809073686,"This paper describes the preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles with reconstituted hamster P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1) for studying the transport activity of this efflux pump in individual liposomes using optical microscopy. Pgp, a member of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter family, is known to contribute to the cellular multidrug resistance (MDR) against variety of drugs. The efficacy of many therapeutics is, thus, hampered by this efflux pump, leading to a high demand for simple and effective strategies to monitor the interactions of candidate drugs with this protein. Here, we applied small Pgp proteoliposomes to prepare giant Pgp-bearing liposomes via modified electroformation techniques. The presence of Pgp in the membrane of giant proteoliposomes was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Assessment of Pgp ATPase activity suggested that this transporter retained its activity upon reconstitution into giant liposomes, with an ATPase specific activity of 439 ± 103 nmol/mg protein/min. For further confirmation, we assessed the transport activity of Pgp in these proteoliposomes by monitoring the translocation of rhodamine 123 (Rho123) across the membrane using confocal microscopy at various ATP concentrations (0-2 mM) and in the presence of Pgp inhibitors. Rate of change in Rho123 concentration inside the liposomal lumen was used to estimate the Rho123 transport rates (1/s) for various ATP concentrations, which were then applied to retrieve the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of ATP in Rho123 transport (0.42 ± 0.75 mM). Similarly, inhibitory effects of verapamil, colchicine, and cyclosporin A on Pgp were studied in this system and the IC50 values for these Pgp inhibitors were found 26.6 ± 6.1 μM, 94.6 ± 47.6 μM, and 0.21 ± 0.07 μM, respectively. We further analyzed the transport data using a kinetic model that enabled dissecting the passive diffusion of Rho123 from its Pgp-mediated transport across the membrane. Based on this model, the permeability coefficient of Rho123 across the liposomal membrane was approximately 1.25×10-7 cm/s. Comparing the membrane permeability in liposomes with and without Pgp revealed that the presence of this protein did not have a significant impact on membrane integrity and permeability. Furthermore, we used this model to obtain transport rate constants for the Pgp-mediated transport of Rho123 (m3/mol/s) at various ATP and inhibitor concentrations, which were then applied to estimate values of 0.53 ± 0.66 mM for Km of ATP and 25.2 ± 5.0 μM for verapamil IC50, 61.8 ± 34.8 μM for colchicine IC50, and 0.23 ± 0.09 μM for cyclosporin A IC50. The kinetic parameters obtained from the two analyses were comparable, suggesting a minimal contribution from the passive Rho123 diffusion across the membrane. This approach may, therefore, be applied for screening the transport activity of Pgp against potential drug candidates."

The aim of this study was to analyze the evolution of mineral metabolism parameters during the first 36 months of HD treatment and identify the initial factors associated with severe SHPT.Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphate levels were measured monthly; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) and beta-CrossLaps (CTX) were measured biannually. Severe SHPT was defined as the need for cinacalcet treatment. Patients with less than 24 months of follow-up were excluded.One hundred thirty-three incident HD patients were included. Baseline mean PTH was 275 ± 210 pg/mL. After an initial drop at the third month (172 ± 133 pg/mL), the serum PTH level progressively increased to the maximum at 36 months (367 ± 254 pg/mL). This initial drop was associated with the initial correction of both hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Serum CTX and b-ALP revealed no significant changes over time. Severe SHPT was observed in 18% of patients and was associated with higher mean calcaemia and phosphataemia. In logistic regression, the initial factors associated with the risk of severe SHPT were: female sex, higher baseline PTH and CTX values. A receiver operation characteristic curve analysis identified a cut-off value of >374 pg/mL for baseline PTH and >1.2 μg/L for CTX for increased risk of developing severe SHPT. The relative risk of developing severe SHPT was 3.7 (1.8-7.5, p = 0.002) for high baseline CTX, 4.9 (2.4-9.7, p = 0.001) for high baseline PTH, and 7.7 (3.6-16, p< 0.0001) when both criteria were present.After an initial drop, a progressive increase in the serum PTH level during the first 3 years of HD treatment was observed despite aggressive therapy. High baseline levels of PTH and CTX increased the risk of developing severe SHPT."
https://openalex.org/W2796711458,"The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy remains enigmatic. Damage to the vasa nervorum may be responsible for this disorder. Recently, we showed that secretoneurin (SN) induces angiogenesis in hindlimb and myocardial ischemia. Moreover, beneficial effects were observed in wound healing. We therefore hypothesized that SN therapy may ameliorate diabetic neuropathy. We used db/db mice as animal model for neuropathy. Gene therapy was accomplished by intramuscular injection of SN plasmid along the sciatic nerve. Sciatic nerve motor and sensory conduction velocities were then measured for 9 wk. Nerve conduction velocities showed normal values in heterozygous mice for the observational period, but were severely reduced in homozygous mice in which velocities were significantly improved by SN, but not by control plasmid gene therapy. The reaction time in the tail-flick test improved significantly in SN-treated animals. The induction of growth of vasa nervorum seems to be part of the underlying mechanism. In addition, SN positively affected Schwann cell function in vitro and induced activation of important signaling pathways. Our observations suggest that SN exerts beneficial effects on nerve function in vivo and on Schwann cells in vitro. It therefore may be a promising treatment option for diabetic neuropathy.-Theurl, M., Lener, D., Albrecht-Schgoer, K., Beer, A., Schgoer, W., Liu, Y., Stanzl, U., Fischer-Colbrie, R., Kirchmair, R.

Since the inflammation process plays an important role in several diseases, TLRs have been considered potential therapeutic targets, including treatment for cancer. However, TLRs' role in cancer remains ambiguous. This study aims to analyze the expression levels of plasmatic cell membrane TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6) in human astrocytomas the most prevalent tumors of CNS different grades (II-IV). We demonstrated that TLR expressions were higher in astrocytoma samples compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. The gene and protein expressions were observed in GBM cell lines U87MG and A172, proving their presence in the tumor cells. Associated expressions between the known heterodimers TLR1-TLR2 were found in all astrocytoma grades. In GBMs, the mesenchymal subtype showed higher levels of TLR expressions in relation to classical and proneural subtypes. A strong association of TLRs with the activation of cell cycle process and signaling through canonical, inflammasome and ripoptosome pathways was observed by in silico analysis, further highlighting TLRs as interesting targets for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2809208997,"This study presents experimental results and an analysis approach for polarized light effects associated with thermomechanical stress during cooling of glass promoting solutions, with applications to cryopreservation and tissue banking in a process known as vitrification. Polarized light means have been previously integrated into the cryomacroscope—a visualization device to detect physical effects associated with cryopreservation success, such as crystallization, fracture formation, and contamination. The experimental study concerns vitrification in a cuvette, which is a rectangular container. Polarized light modeling in the cuvette is based on subdividing the tridimensional (3D) domain into a series of planar (2D) problems, for which a mathematical solution is available in the literature. The current analysis is based on tracking the accumulated changes in light polarization and magnitude, as it passes through the sequence of planar problems. Results of this study show qualitative agreement in light intensity history and distribution between experimental data and simulated results. The simulated results help explaining differences between 2D and 3D effects in photoelasticity, most notably, the counterintuitive observation that high stress areas may correlate with low light intensity regions based on the particular experimental conditions. Finally, it is suggested that polarized-light analysis must always be accompanied by thermomechanical stress modeling in order to explain 3D effects."
https://openalex.org/W2809416188,"Synapse maturation is a neural activity–dependent process during brain development, in which active synapses preferentially undergo maturation to establish efficient neural circuits in the brain. Defects in this process are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. We have previously reported that a postsynaptic transmembrane protein, signal regulatory protein-α (SIRPα), plays an important role in activity-dependently directing synapse maturation. In the presence of synaptic activity, the ectodomain of SIRPα is cleaved and released and then acts as a retrograde signal to induce presynaptic maturation. However, how SIRPα detects synaptic activity to promote its ectodomain cleavage and synapse maturation is unknown. Here, we show that activity-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα is critical for SIRPα cleavage and synapse maturation. We found that during synapse maturation and in response to neural activity, SIRPα is highly phosphorylated on its tyrosine residues in the hippocampus, a structure critical for learning and memory. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα was necessary for SIRPα cleavage and presynaptic maturation, as indicated by the fact that a phosphorylation-deficient SIRPα variant underwent much less cleavage and could not drive presynaptic maturation. However, SIRPα phosphorylation did not affect its synaptic localization. Finally, we show that inhibitors of the Src and JAK kinase family suppress neural activity–dependent SIRPα phosphorylation and cleavage. Together, our results indicate that SIRPα phosphorylation serves as a mechanism for detecting synaptic activity and linking it to the ectodomain cleavage of SIRPα, which in turn drives synapse maturation in an activity-dependent manner."

It is possible that during this vulnerable period, use of one drug leads to neurobiological alterations that affect subsequent consumption of the other drug. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of nicotine exposure during adolescence on ethanol intake, and the effect of these substances on brain gene expression. Forty-three adolescent female C57BL/6J mice were assigned to four groups. In the first phase of the experiment, adolescent mice (PND 36-41 days) were exposed to three bottles filled with water or nicotine (200 μg/ml) for 22 h a day and a single bottle of water 2 h a day for six days. In the second phase (PND 42-45 days), the 4-day Drinking-in-the-Dark paradigm consisting of access to 20% v/v ethanol or water for 2h or 4h (the last day) was overlaid during the time when the mice did not have nicotine available. Ethanol consumption (g/kg) and blood ethanol concentrations (BEC, mg %) were measured on the final day and whole brains including the cerebellum, were dissected for RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were detected with CuffDiff and gene networks were built using WGCNA. Prior nicotine exposure increased ethanol consumption and resulting BEC. Significant DEG and biological pathways found in the group exposed to both nicotine and ethanol included genes important in stress-related neuropeptide signaling, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, glutamate release, GABA signaling, and dopamine release. These results replicate our earlier findings that nicotine exposure during adolescence increases ethanol consumption and extends this work by examining gene expression differences which could mediate these behavioral effects."
https://openalex.org/W2809369828,"Inbreeding is a central topic in evolutionary biology and ecology and is of major concern for the conservation of endangered species. Yet, it remains challenging to comprehend the fitness consequences of inbreeding, because studies typically focus only on short-term effects on inbreeding in the offspring (e.g. survival until independence). However, there is no a priori reason to assume that inbreeding has no more effects in adulthood. Specifically, inbred males should have lower reproductive success than outbred males among other things because of inbreeding depression in attractiveness to females and a reduced lifespan. Such differences in future reproductive value should affect male mating behaviour, such that an inbred male of a given age should be more motivated to seize a current mating opportunity than an outbred male of the same age. We used an inventive experimental set-up that enabled us to assess male behaviour in relation to an apparent mating opportunity while excluding potential confounding effects of female preference. Age-, weight-, and size-matched inbred and outbred male canaries (Serinus canaria) were presented with a female that only one male at a time could access visually via a ‘peephole’ and thus when both males were equally interested in seizing the apparent mating opportunity this would result in contest. We find that inbred males spent more than twice as much time ‘peeping’ at the female than outbred males, suggesting that inbreeding indeed causes different behavioural responses to an apparent mating opportunity. Our study is among the first to highlight that inbreeding affects male mating behaviour, and therewith potentially male-male competition, which should be taken into account in order to understand the full range of inbreeding effects on fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2808887458,"The ability of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants to develop freezing tolerance through cold acclimation is a complex rait that responds to many environmental cues including day length and temperature. A large part of the freezing tolerance is conditioned by the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene regulon. We investigated whether the level of freezing tolerance of 12 winter wheat lines varied throughout the day and night in plants grown under a constant low temperature and a 12-hour photoperiod. Freezing tolerance was significantly greater (P<0.0001) when exposure to subfreezing temperatures began at the midpoint of the light period, or the midpoint of the dark period, compared to the end of either period, with an average of 21.3% improvement in survival. Thus, freezing survival was related to the photoperiod, but cycled from low, to high, to low within each 12-hour light period and within each 12-hour dark period, indicating ultradian cyclic variation of freezing tolerance. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of expression levels of CBF genes 14 and 15 indicated that expression of these two genes also varied cyclically, but essentially 180° out of phase with each other. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (1H-NMR) showed that the chemical composition of the wheat plants' cellular fluid varied diurnally, with consistent separation of the light and dark phases of growth. A compound identified as glutamine was consistently found in greater concentration in a strongly freezing-tolerant wheat line, compared to moderately and poorly freezing-tolerant lines. The glutamine also varied in ultradian fashion in the freezing-tolerant wheat line, consistent with the ultradian variation in freezing tolerance, but did not vary in the less-tolerant lines. These results suggest at least two distinct signaling pathways, one conditioning freezing tolerance in the light, and one conditioning freezing tolerance in the dark; both are at least partially under the control of the CBF regulon."
