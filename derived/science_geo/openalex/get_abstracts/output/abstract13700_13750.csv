Beginning near active growth plates as early as 2 weeks after transplantation, replacement of the abnormal spongiosa continued until medullary cavities were fully expanded."
https://openalex.org/W2025189606,"It has been proposed that the endocrine cells of the digestive tract derive from the neuroectoderm (neural crest). To test this hypothesis we removed the entire ectoderm, the precursor of the neural crest, of embryonic rats prior to the formation of the neural crest and cultured the mesoendoderm for 11 days. In every case where a pancreas developed, insulin was detected or B cells were observed. Thus, a neural crest origin for these cells is eiliminated."

One of these biologically active products has been identified as H2O2, on the basis of spectrometric, chromatographic, chemical, and biological properties. Now H2O2 has been shown to account for the biological activities mentioned above."

https://openalex.org/W2073152739,"Mefloquine hydrochloride, a new 4-quinolinemethanol, was administered as a single oral dose to 47 volunteers infected with malaria. Treatment resulted in rapid clearance of fever and parasitemia. No recrudescence of parasites was observed after treatment of chloroquine-sensitive infections of Plasmodium falciparum. More significantly, in nonimmune persons with chloroquine-resistant infections, 1 gram of mefloquine cured 10 of 12 patients and 1.5 grams cured all 8 patients who received this dose of the drug. The marked activity of a single dose of mefloquine against chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum suggests that this agent may be more useful than currently available drugs are for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2072294194,Neonatal rat anterior pituitary glands treated in organ culture with 1 nanomolar luteinzing hormone-releasing factor (LRF) showed a tenfold increase in medium luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations over control values. Simultaneous treatment of the glands with 1 nanomolar melatonin significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of LRF on release of LH. This finding indicates that melatonin can act directly on the neonatal pituitary to inhibit the LH response to LRF.

Variations in insulin release from islets of fed or fasted rats were accompanied by concomitant changes in tubulin polymerization. Glucose induced the formation of microtubules in vitro independent of extracellular calcium. Total and polymerized tubulin content were decreased by fasting and restored by glucose feeding.
https://openalex.org/W1544618542,"Homogeneous initiation factor MP forms a stable complex with Met-tRNAf which binds to nitrocellulose filters in the absence of ribosomal subunits. Complex formation is rapid at 0 degrees and the rate of reaction is stimulated 20-fold by GTP when freshly prepared initiation factor MP is used. Under optimal assay conditions, a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for initiation factor MP, GTP, and Met-tRNAf is indicated, based on a molecular weight for initiation factor MP of 180,000. Kinetic analysis of ternary complex formation suggests an ordered reaction sequence with binding of GTP followed by binding of Met-tRNAf. However, binding of GTP appears to produce an unstable state which leads to rapid inactivation of initiation factor MP in the absence of Met-tRNAf. Formation of a stable binary complex of initiation factor MP and Met-tRNAf occurs in the absence of GTP. The binary complex cannot subsequently bind GTP. While storage of initiation factor MP at 0 degrees for several weeks has no effect on the rate or extent of Met-tRNAf binding in the presence of GTP, the rate of binary complex formation is increased 10-fold. The binary and ternary complexes appear to bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits with equal efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1481481299,"A unique conformation of deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrates bound to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The effects of Mn(II) bound at the active site of the enzyme on the longitudinal (T1p-1) and transverse (T2p-1) relaxation rates of the alpha, beta, and gamma phosphorus atoms and 5 protons of enzyme-bound thymidine 5'-triphosphate (dTTP) were measured at 40.5 MHz (31P), 100 and 220 MHz (1H). From frequency dependence of T1p-1, a correlation time of 7 X 10(-10) s and Mn(II) to proton distances of 10.4, 9.9, 10.3, 10.8, and 8.4 A were calculated for the --CH3, H6, H'1, H'2, and H'4 protons. The calculated Mn(II) to phosphorus distances of 4.2, 4.8, and 3.2 A for the alpha, beta, and gamma phosphorus atoms indicates that Mn(II) corrdinates directly only with the gamma-phosphoryl group and that a puckered triphpsphate conformation exists for the enzyme-bound dTTP. This differs from the binary Mn(II)-dTTP complex in which alpha, beta, and gamma phosphoryl coordination occurs, and a thymine-deoxyribose torsion angly (chi) about the glycosidic bond of 40 degrees is detected. The eight manganese-substrate distances on the enzyme are fit by a unique Mn-dTTP conformation, with a torsion angle equal to 90 degrees, indistinguishable from that found for a deoxynucleotidyl unit in double helical DNA-B. Hence, binding to DNA polymerase appears to adjust the conformation of dTTP for Watson-Crick basepairing. Similarly, the binding of Mn-dATP to DNA polymerase I increased the distances from Mn(II) to the H2, H8, H'1, and H'4 protons of dATP but the adenine-deoxyribose torsion angle of 90 degrees was preserved. Such preorientation of substrates could facilitate incorporation of the complementary nucleotide. When positioned within the DNA structure, the conformation of enzyme-bound Mn-dTTP requires an inline nucleophilic attack on the alpha phosphorus with Mn(II) promoting pyrophosphate departure."

Arrest does not occur in either calcium or ionophore and monovalent cations alone. Activity returns with continued perfusion in potassium chloride or calcium chloride, and more slowly in sodium chloride, after removal of ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that a local rise in internal calcium causes ciliary arrest."

Time spent in each sleep stage varied both between sessions for a given subject and between subjects. In addition, we compare electroencephalogram records made during meditation with those made during naps taken at the same time of day. The range of states observed during meditation does not support the view that meditation produces a single, unique state of consciousness."

https://openalex.org/W1662413579,"The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity of Escherichia coli has been assayed using native palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein as the acyl donor. This substrate was synthesized by a plant chloroplast system which utilized E. coli acyl carrier protein. The properties of the acyltransferase as assayed with palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein were similar to those observed using palmitoyl-CoA as the acyl donor. This finding suggested that single enzyme catalyzed transfer of acyl groups from either thioester to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. This hypothesis was tested by assay of two classes of E. coli mutants which have altered sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases. Both classes (plsA and plsB) of mutants have similarly altered activities as assayed with either palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein or palmitoyl-CoA. These results indicate that the same acyltransferase enzyme (or enzyme system) catalyzes the incorporation of both thioester substrates into phospholipid. Other experiments have shown that the acyltransferase of a plsB mutant was abnormally thermolabile only when palmitoyl-CoA was the acyl donor in the reaction. No thermolability was observed with palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein as acyl donor. The thermolability observed with palmitoyl-CoA is attributed to the detergent properties of this substrate. In agreement with Lueking and Goldfine (Lueking, D. R., and Goldfine, H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4911-4917), we found that guanosine-5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) inhibits the acyltransferase only when palmitoyl-CoA was the acyl donor. No inhibition was observed when the acyltransferase was assayed with palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein in the presence of ppGpp. Incubation of the enzyme with ppGpp to assay results in a profound inhibition of acyltransfer from palmitoyl-CoA but has no effect on the incorporation of acyl groups from palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1580801862,"The rate of regeneration of reduced RNase by glutathione was examined in the presence of several added substances: substrate, phospholipid, other proteins, bacterial ribosomes, and neutral salts. Of these, only neutral salts showed substantial effects. K2HOP4 and (NH4)2SO4 strongly accelerated regeneration, the alkali chlorides showed moderate acceleration or inhibition, while LiBr and KSCN strongly inhibited. The t1/2 for regeneration in 1 M Pi is 4 min compared to 75 min in the absence of Pi; in 0.5 M KSCN t1/2 greater than 100 min. The pattern of specific salt effects is similar to a Hofmeister series. There is a strong parallel between the pattern of specific salt effects on the kinetics of RNase regeneration and the pattern of effects of the same salts on the equilibrium stability of biopolymers. This suggests that the role of salts in the regeneration is to stabilize or destabilize rate-limiting folding intermediates. Pi-accelerated glutathione regenerations showed a broad temperature optimum from 30-37 degrees. In strong contrast with the virtual concentration independence of the Pi-free controls, with Pi = 1 M, both rates and yields of RNase activity were decreased markedly at [RNase] greater than 2 x 10(-6) M. Phosphate and pyrophosphate showed additive, and in some cases, synergistic accelerations. These results suggest that specific ion binding occurs in addition to general solvent effects."

https://openalex.org/W1542137766,"The amino acid sequences of pig muscle and of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are compared with the three-dimensional structure of the lobster muscle enzyme. Residues in sheet and helical regions, on the exterior and interior, in subunit and domain interfaces, as well as residues in the active site have been examined for evolutionary conservation. The residues in the first (NAD binding) domain (1-147) are less conserved than residues in the second (catalytic) domain (148-334) probably because there are fewer internal residues and fewer residues involved in interactions between subunits. Residues in subunit interface are conserved to a significantly greater extent than others, and those involved in catalysis are conserved most of all. Patterns of residues in helices and sheets follow those found for other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2297871154,"The interaction of the dye tetraiodofluorescein with native aspartate transcarbamylase and its isolated subunits has been investigated by both binding and activity measurements at 4 and 23 degrees. At room temperature low concentrations of tetraiodofluorescein activate the native enzyme, but high concentrations inhibit the enzyme's activity. At the low temperature the native enzyme is inhibited by all concentrations of dye. Isolated catalytic subunit is very effectively inhibited at both temperatures. For the native enzyme these results are explained by 18 tetraiodofluorescein sites of approximately equal affinity (K = 7.3 X 10(-5) M) on each enzyme hexamer: one class of six sites at the nucleoside triphosphate effector binding sites is responsible for the activation, a second class which competes with the substrate carbamylphosphate causes the inhibition, and a third class does not interact with either the effectors or the substrates. Measurements of tetraiodofluorescein binding to isolated regulatory, catalytic, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-inactivated catalytic subunits support the above assignments. This scheme of tetraiodofluorescein binding sites successfully predicts the changes in the tetraiodofluorescein-aspartate transcarbamylase difference spectrum induced by the addition of various ligands. The activity changes induced by the dye are explained if the binding of a single tetraiodofluorescein molecule to one of the six regulatory sites activates all six of the catalytic sites, while while a dye molecule binding to any one of the catalytic sites inactivates only that catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W87711878,"The characteristics of adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uracil uptake in Escherichia coli B show that each base is transported by a specific system. The data support the concept that the transport of guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uracil function without direct involvement of the respective purine or pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes. Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase is not demonstrable in E. coli B, and large differences are observed in the inhibitory effects of heterologous purines on the uptake of guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine as compared to the corresponding inhibitory effects reported for the soluble purine phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes of E. coli B. Additional evidence is provided by the low Km values determined for the transport of adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine relative to the corresponding Km values for the phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes. Data are presented indicating that adenine may be transported without participation of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. The stimulatory effect of glucose, the inhibitory effect of KCN, and the high intracellular to extracellular concentration gradients of the bases produced in the presence of glucose provide evidence that the transport processes are energy-dependent. The Km values for transport of the purines and uracil range from 10(-7) M to 5 X 10(-7) M. Characteristics of adenine and uracil uptake are similar in E. coli B, E. coli K-12, and a showdomycin-resistant mutant of E. coli B. Adenosine and deoxyadenosine are transported in E. coli B by independent transport systems. Adenine or hypoxanthine does not share the adenosine or deoxyadenosine transport systems as evidence by the mutual lack of competition of free bases and nucleosides on transport. The transport systems for deoxyadenosine and adenosine are defective in the mutant."
https://openalex.org/W17138194,"The isolated alpha subunit or succinyl-CoA synthetase from Escherichia coli is capable of catalyzing one step of the overall reaction, namely its own phosphorylation by the substrate ATP. The data presented herein also suggest that the binding sites for other substrates (succinate, succinyl-CoA) are located either on the beta subunit or comprise part of both subunit types. From these observations and from our earlier finding that the two subunits species are necessary for the overall reaction, we propose that the active site is assembled at or close to the point of contact of the two subunits in the native alpha2beta2 enzymic structure."

Three subcutaneous injections of 1 milligram of this antagonist into rats during proestrus completely suppressed ovulation, while a single injection of 1.5 milligrams per rat inhibited 95.3 percent of the preovulatory surge of LH, 84.2 percent of the FSH surge, and suppressed ovulation by 86.4 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1518776709,"The effect of cessation of net phospholipid synthesis on the cytoplasmic and outer membranes of Escherichia coli was investigated in a mutant strain defective in the first enzyme of phospholipid synthesis, the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acyltransferase. The glycerol-P (glycerol) auxotropic phenotype of this strain resulted from an altered membranous glycerol-P acyltransferase activity with an apparent Km for glycerol-P 10 times higher than that of the parental activity. When net phospholipid synthesis was halted during glycerol deprivation, both soluble and cell envelope protein synthesis continued. Fractionation of the membranes derived from glycerol-supplemented and glycerol-deprived cultures by isopycnic banding in sucrose gradients revealed that both the cytoplasmic and outer membranes of the deprived culture banded at higher buoyant densities. The protein/phospholipid ratio of both the cytoplasmic and outer membranes increased approximately 60% during the period of glycerol deprivation. The distribution of two cytoplasmic membrane activities, NADH oxidase and 1-acylglycerol-P acyltransferase, and an outer membrane activity, phospholipase A1, showed that the total membranes derived from glycerol-deprived cultures were separated cleanly into cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions. Both cytoplasmic and outer membrane proteins were synthesized and integrated into their respective membranous structures when net phospholipid synthesis was halted. Hence, the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipid and membrane protein are not tightly coupled. Further, these data suggest that cellular control mechanisms exist which maintain the protein content of both membranous structures below the point where they are saturated with protein."
https://openalex.org/W1592194748,"Glyoxalate carboligase (EC 4.1.1.47) has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from Escherichia coli. The enzyme was found to be a dimer of subunits of identical molecular weight of 68,000. Resolution of the holoenzyme into apoenzyme and FAD led to a dissociation of the dimer into monomers. The apoenzyme could be reconsitituted to full catalytic activity with FAD or the flavin coenzyme analogue 5-deazaFAD. Reconstitution of the apoenzyme with the reduced flavin analogue 1,5-dihydro-5-deazaFADH2 led to the recovery of 50% of enzymatic activity. The reconstitution of apoglyoxalate carboligase with all three coenzymes followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km values of 0.25, 0.74, and 0.72 muM for FAD deazaFAD, and deazaFADH2, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1536498343,"The saturated fatty acid auxotroph of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, KD115, was used to determine the efficiency of various unsaturated fatty acids in supporting growth. The efficiency, as the number of cells produced per fmol of unsaturated fatty acid, ranged from zero for a number of acids to over 26 cells per fmol of eicosapentaenoic acid. Efficiencies tended to be higher for acids with fewer carbons or more double bonds. In a series of positional isomers of cis-octadecenoic acid, the delta9 isomer had the greatest efficiency (12 cells per fmol). Exogenous oleic acid was taken up and incorporated into cellular lipid early in the growth of the cells. Further growth proceeded with a decrease in the relative content of oleate in lipids until a minimum value of 9 mol % was reached at stationary phase. The initial concentration of supplemental acid did not affect the final mole % value. Other unsaturated fatty acids reached limiting values of mole % in phospholipid at stationary phase that were characteristic for the acid used. When cells were grown with glycerol as the carbon source, the efficiencies of most acids in supporting growth were one-third to one-fifth the value with glucose and the final mole % of supplement acid in phospholipid at stationary phase was two to five times greater. Apparently, mitochondrial energy transduction necessary for glycerol utilization requires higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids than do extramitochondrial functions. The respiratory rate of mitochondria was not decreased at lower levels of oleic or palmitoleic acid in lipids, although respiratory control was lower when the mole % of unsaturated fatty acid was lower. Mitochondria from cells supplemented with eicosaenoic acid were found to have both low respiration and respiratory control. The decreased respiration of these mitochondria coincided with a decreased cytochrome content, not a decrease in respiration per mol of cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1579932751,"Polysomes consisting of two to eight monosomes were isolated from yeast mitochondria by lysing the mitochondria with Triton X-100 and centrifugation in a 20 to 40% linear sucrose gradient. When yeast spheroplasts were pulse-labeled with [3H]-Leucine in the presence of cycloheximide to block cytoplasmic protein synthesis, radioactivity which was trichloroacetic acid-precipitable was present mainly in the polysome region. Incorporation of leucine was blocked by erythromycin, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Release of radioactivity to the top of the gradient resulted from treating labeled polysomes with either puromycin or ribonuclease (in the latter case with the breakdown of polysomes), indicating that the radioactivity was present in nascent polypeptide chains. Yeast cells were grown in chloramphenicol for 3 hours and in fresh medium for 1 hour and then pulse-labeled with either [3H]leucine or [14C]formate. Three parameters showed a 2-fold increase in cells grown in chloramphenicol prior to pulse labeling: the polysome to monosome ratio, the amount of labeled precursor incorporated into proteins, and the rate of polypeptide chain initiation as judged by the formation of fMet-puromycin. Conversely, these parameters were all decreased approximately 50% in cells treated with cycloheximide prior to pulse labeling. Mitochondria were also isolated from cells previously grown in chloramphenicol or cycloheximide and incubated in vitro with [3H]leucine under optimal conditions. Acid-precipitable radioactivity in the polysome region was increased 3-fold in mitochondria from cells grown previously in chloramphenicol and decreased 75% in those grown in cycloheximide. Furthermore, chain initiation was deomonstrated in the isolated mitochondria by formation of fMet-puromycin. The rate of chain initiation in vitro was increased 2-fold in mitochondria isolated from chloramphenicol-treated cells."

Although the probe also binds nonspecifically to the vesicle membrane, such binding is independent of the lac carrier protein and is unaffected by energization of the vesicles. The experiments provide further evidence that the dansylgalactosides are useful probes for the beta-galactoside transport system and support the hypothesis that the changes in dansylgalactoside fluorescence observed on energization of membrane vesicles reflect changes in the binding of the probe."
https://openalex.org/W2035481518,The functional implications of the different modes of regulation have been examined systematically. The results lead to certain predictions. The regulatory protein in repressor-controlled systems is constitutively synthesised. In activator-controlled systems synthesis of the regulatory protein is autogenously regulated. There is favourable agreement between these predictions and published experimental evidence.

https://openalex.org/W1547790006,"The inhibition of DNA replication in aerobically growing Escherichia coli by cyanide or carbon monoxide occurs within about 20 s at 15 degrees, as previously reported by Cairns and Denhardt (Cairns, J., and Denhardt, D.T. (1968) J. Mol. Biol. 36, 335-342). This rapid inhibition can be explained by the nearly complete depletion of both intracellular ATP and deoxynucleoside triphosphates which occurs during the time that replication stops. There is probably no direct effect of carbon monoxide on any of the enzymes involved in replication because this reagent has no effect on replication rate or ATP level in anaerobic cells. These cells produce ATP by glycolysis. The inhibition of replication by cyanide, a highly reactive compound, appears to be more complex since anaerobically growing cells can still be completely inhibited, although higher concentrations are required than for aerobically growing cells. The sensitivity of anaerobic cells to cyanide is probably due to the ability of this highly reactive compound to react nonspecifically with many proteins and other molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1587266897,"The kinetics of the RNA chain initiation reaction carried out by RNA polymerase bound to the initiator region of a DNA template have been analyzed. Initiation proceeds in a two-substrate reaction in which the initial binary complex (enzyme-DNA) is transformed into a ternary complex (enzyme-DNA-RNA) by formation of a dinucleoside tetraphosphate and release of inorganic pyrophosphate. In this reaction RNA polymerase serves as a reactant rather than acting catalytically. The concentration of the reacting binary complex decreases throughout the reaction; hence steady state approximations cannot be used. Kinetic equations for an ordered two-substrate reaction are derived. These are most useful for the special case of reaction in the presence of an inhibitor of initiation, such as rifampicin. Equations for the latter instance are solved exactly with recourse to the steady state approximation. It is found that measurements of the extent of the initiation reaction determined at different inhibitor and substrate concentrations can give information about the initiation reaction analogous to that obtained in standard steady state kinetic analysis. This theory is applied to the experimental study of the initiation reaction carried out by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. It is found that the inhibitor rifampicin, which blocks the initiation reaciton, acts by binding to the same form of the binary complex as the nucleoside triphosphate substrate (ATP or GTP) which is incorporated into the 5' terminus of nascent RNA molecule. The binding of the 5'-terminal nucleoside triphosphate to the enzyme appears to be rate-limiting for the initiation reaction under standard assay conditions. Initiation appears to follow an ordered reaction mechanism; however, the order of addition of the two substrates is still uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1522719650,"A stable Escherichia coli IF-2-fMet-tRNAfMet complex is formed upon incubation of IF-2 (prokaryotic initiation factor) with fMet-tRNAfMet is the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM NH4Cl, and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The complex thus formed is retained on a Millipore filter and is assayed accordingly. Complex formation does dot require GTP, is unstable in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+, and is specific for fMet-tRNAfMet. Other amino acyl-tRNAs or deacylated tRNAs do not form such a complex with IF-2. A crude ribosomal high salt wash preparation contains other protein factors which bind unspecifically to RNAs under the above binding conditions. One of these factors elute similarly to IF-1 on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Extensively purified IF-1 and IF-3 show weak and unspecific RNA-binding activities. The RNA-protein complex formed in each of the above cases, like the IF-2-fMet-tRNAfMet complex, is retained on Millipore filter and is sensitive to Mg2+."

https://openalex.org/W1542544020,"Unsaturated fatty acids provided during the release from glucose repression were shown to be essential for derepression of respiration in an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (KD115). Cells derepressed in the presence of oleic acid contained three to six times as much cytochrome per cell as those derepressed in the absence of unsaturated fatty acid or those derepressed with eicosaenoic acid. The delta9 isomer was the most efficient of the cis-octadecenoic acid isomers in supporting that increase, and eicosaenoic acid supported an increase at only 15% the rate observed with oleic acid. Derepression, even in the presence of oleic acid, proceeded only after a lag of 3 hours. When glucose was removed prior to the addition of oleate, the lag was reduced by the time of the preincubation with glycerol. This result suggests that some processes necessary for increased respiration can proceed in the absence of an added unsaturated fatty acid, but these processes apparently require certain levels of unsaturated acids in the pre-existing lipids, since they occurred in cells whose membranes contained 50 mol % oleate, but not in cells containing only 20 mol %. These processes leading to eventual increased respiration were inhibited by cycloheximide but not chloramphenicol, suggesting that protein synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes but not mitochondrial ribosomes were required. Derepression in the absence of oleate for 3 hours lessened the inhibition or respiration induction by ethidium bromide. This result indicates that the transcription of mitochondrial DNA necessary for the induction of respiration may have occurred in the absence of added unsaturated fatty acid, but that some subsequent event required added esterified unsaturated fatty acid."

https://openalex.org/W1540810740,"Isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli B grown on DL-alanine and glycerol carry out amino acid active transport coupled to a membrane-bound D-alanine dehydrogenase (Kaczorowski, G., Shaw, L., Fuentes, M., and Walsh, C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2855). Certain L-amino acids can also energize solute transport by conversion to their D isomers via an alanine reacemase. Both D-chloroalanine and L-chloroalanine initially drive amino acid and methyl-beta-thiogalactose uptake. The D isomer however causes rapid inactivation of both dehydrogenase-coupled transport and the phosphotransferase system. Transport functions can be protected by dithiothreitol which is postulated to act as a scavenging nucleophile. This inactivation by the D isomer is time-dependent and irreversible not only for proline transport but also for alpha-methylglucoside uptake. Unlike the D isomer, beta-chloro-L-alanine does not inactivate transport. L-Chloroalanine is not racemized to the D isomer but rather undergoes a racemase catalyzed beta elimination of chloride ion to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate can subsequently be oxidized to stimulate active transport. This pyridoxal phosphate-dependent racemase is inactivated by low concentrations of D-chloroalanine but the L isomer can only cause inactivation at a 40-fold higher concentration and longer times of exposure. The D-alanine dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation product of D-chloroalanine is chloropyruvate, and this keto acid is hypothesized to be the inactivating species of transport for the following reasons. Chloropyruvate has been isolated from D-chloroalanine oxidation but not from oxidation of the L isomer. Chlorolactate which can be oxidized to chloropyruvate (via membrane-bound lactate dehydrogenases) also causes inactivation of transport in E. coli K-12 membrane vesicles. Mutants having diminished lactate dehydrogenase activity show a slower rate of inactivation with chlorolactate. Moreover, synthetic chloropyruvate irreversibly inactivates both active transport of proline and phosphotransferase system-dependent group translocation of alpha-methylglucoside.

The DNA of a specialized transducing phage, o80dhis, was used as a template, and his RNA was measured by RNA/DNA hybridization. Taking advantage of the fact that E. coli RNA polymerase cannot initiate transcription when the nucleoside triphosphates are present at very low (5 muM) concentration, his RNA initiation was primed by dinucleoside monophosphates. It has been found that his RNA synthesis can be stimulated by one of the three dinucleotides CpA, ApA, and ApG. Under these conditions, it is the initiation of his RNA synthesis that is stimulated. Stimulation of his RNA synthesis by the three dinucleotides apparently occurs at a single initiation site, as judged by the nonadditivity of the effects of the three dinucleotides. This was further confirmed by the effect of phosphoribosyltransferase (the first enzyme of histidine biosynthesis, which specifically represses the synthesis of his RNA) on ApA primed RNA synthesis. Addition of his protein results in a sharp decrease of his RNA synthesis, with no effect whatsoever on the levels of RNAa transcribed from other regions of the template. Our data suggest that the 5' -terminal sequence of his RNA made in vitro is ApApG and that the base immediately preceding this sequence is C."
https://openalex.org/W1507602240,"In the accompanying report (Kaczorowski, G., Shaw, L., Laura, R., and Walsh, C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8921-8930), we have shown that the oxidation of beta-chloro-D-alanine by a membrane-bound D-alanine dehydrogenase results in the inactivation of both dehydrogenase-coupled and P-enolpyruvate-dependent active transport in membrane vesicles. We have also demonstrated that chemically prepared chloropyruvate has the same inactivating effects on transport. In this report, we show that in addition to abolishing hexose and proline uptake, chloropyruvate inhibits lactose and several other amino acid uptake systems to different extents, although proline transport is the most severely inhibited. The degree of transport inactivation also depends on whether the keto acid is added exogenously or is generated by the D-alanine dehydrogenase. Chloropyruvate treatment does not inhibit D-alanine dehydrogenase, D-lactate dehydrogenase of the passage of electrons to oxygen by the membrane cytochrome chain. However, alanine racemase and pyruvate oxidase (to a lesser extent) are inactivated by this keto acid. Treatment of vesicles with chloropyruvate does not affect the establishment of maintenance of a membrane potential, however, this does inhibit solute transport in response to an artificially induced potential. If chloropyruvate is added at any point during a time course of proline transport, there is an instantaneous blockade of amino acid uptake suggesting that the proline carrier can no longer translocate solute across the membrane. Upon examining the functionality of the carrier protein after exposure to chloropyruvate, there is no appreciable difference in efflux or exchange properties as compared to untreated controls. Therefore chloropyruvate does not block proline passage through the membrane, but rather appears to interfere with the ability of the proline carrier to sense the membrane potential. The beta-halo keto acid does not then uncouple respiration from energization of the membrane but does interfere with the ability of the energized membrane state to be used for the transport of most solutes."

Cross-linked proteins were analyzed by diagonal polyacrylamide/sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Three pairs of cross-linked proteins were identified: L2-L7,L12; L5-L7,L12; and L17-L32. The significance of the results in relation to the location of sites for factor binding, peptidyltransferase, and GTP hydrolysis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1521374905,"The biosynthesis of the phage T4-coded proline and serine transfer RNA species proceeds through a precursor RNA containing both tRNA sequences. Neither tRNA sequence in the precursor RNA contains the 3'-terminal C-C-A common to all mature tRNAs. Seidman and McClain ((1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 1491-1495) have proposed that the C-C-A sequence is added to serine tRNA while it is still part of the large precursor RNA. In the present work, I show that, in vitro, a purified preparation of Escherichia coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.25) accurately synthesized 3'-terminal C-C-A in the serine tRNA portion of the precursor RNA. This result establishes a role of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in the biosynthesis of the phage T4 serine tRNA. The finding that tRNA nucleotidyltransferase utilizes the large precursor RNA as a substrate represents a novel function of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1543448726,"Studies carried out in arginyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli indicate that metals may have two functional roles in the catalytic mechanism. Complete metal activation is observed when MgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, or FeCl2 is present at a concentration (5.0 mM) in excess of the total ATP concentration (2.0 mM). When CaCl2 is substituted for MgCl2, activity is not observed unless a small amount (0.1 mM) of MgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, FeCl2, or ZnCl2 (unable to produce activity alone at 5.0 mM) is added. A model, based on kinetic data, is proposed in which the enzyme possesses a site for free metal, which, when filled, lowers the Km for all three substrates (arginine, tRNAArg, and metal-ATP) and increases the Vmax of the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1526098634,"The DNA in gently lysates of T4-infected Escherichia coli cells sediments in sucrose gradients as two major components; the slower sedimenting component is designated as the S-5 fraction and the faster sedimenting component as the pad fraction. The distribution of these fractions in lysates of cells infected with T4 maturation-defective and DNA-arrest mutants was determined, and their template activities were compared in a DNA-dependent amino acid-incorporating system. The S-5 DNA template was found to be completely absent in E. coli B cells infected with a T4 maturation-defective mutant (gene 55). On the other hand, DNA sedimenting as the S-5 component is greatly increased, while that sedimenting as the pad component is virtually absent in nonpermissive cells infected with a DNA-arrest mutant (gene 46). The S-5 fractions prepared from cells infected with a DNA ligase mutant (gene 30) and a gene 30 gene 46 double mutant are reduced in their ability to stimulate amino acid incorporation compared to similar preparations from cells infected with wild type T4 or a gene 46 mutant. Moreover, the template activity of partially purified replicative DNA prepared from cells infected with phage-carrying mutations either on gene 30 or in both genes 46 and 56 (dCTPase) is lower than that of DNA obtained from cells infected with wild type phage. The polypeptide products of reaction mixtures programmed with several of the mutant DNAs were found to be qualitatively different from polypeptides synthesized in response to either mature DNA or replicative DNA prepared from cells infected with wild type phage. These data suggest that the expression of phage DNA may be significantly influenced by physical changes in the DNA arising from abnormal replication."
https://openalex.org/W1936253768,"The synthesis and template properties of T4 vegetative DNA were studied. The DNA-containing material in lysates of cells taken 20 min past T4 infection sediments in sucrose gradients as two major components. Both fractions function as templates for amino acid incorporation in a DNA-dependent in vitro system (coupled transcription-translation). The slower sedimenting activity is not present in uninfected cells and appears in wild type T4-infected cells only after 12 min at 30 degrees, shortly after DNA synthesis starts. It is dependent for its activity on an added S-30 fraction from either uninfected or T4-infected cells and is completely inhibited by deoxyribonuclease or rifampin. On a weight basis the slower sedimenting template is about 30 to 70% as active as mature T4 DNA when supplemented with S-30 extracts from uninfected cells. The spectrum of proteins synthesized in response to the slower sedimenting template is different from that produced in response to mature T4 DNA. In contrast to mature DNA, this template is capable of directing the synthesis of material that precipitates with antiserum directed against whole T4 particles. Thus, it appears capable of directing the synthesis of mRNA for phage structural proteins, i.e. late proteins. The faster sedimenting component is about 8-fold less active for stimulating amino acid incorporation than mature DNA. Significant amounts of RNA polymerase are associated with this DNA in active transcription complexes, yet polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins synthesized in response to this fraction show a pattern that resembles the early proteins made from mature T4 DNA in extracts from uninfected cells."
