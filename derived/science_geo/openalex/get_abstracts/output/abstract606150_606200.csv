https://openalex.org/W2791954023,"Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may represent two poles of brain pathology. Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted α5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease."

https://openalex.org/W2790653691,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 94,674 ancestrally diverse Kaiser Permanente members using 478,866 longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived measurements for untreated serum lipid levels empowered multiple new findings: 121 new SNP associations (46 primary, 15 conditional, and 60 in meta-analysis with Global Lipids Genetic Consortium data); an increase of 33–42% in variance explained with multiple measurements; sex differences in genetic impact (greater impact in females for LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and the opposite for triglycerides); differences in variance explained among non-Hispanic whites, Latinos, African Americans, and East Asians; genetic dominance and epistatic interaction, with strong evidence for both at the ABO and FUT2 genes for LDL; and tissue-specific enrichment of GWAS-associated SNPs among liver, adipose, and pancreas eQTLs. Using EHR pharmacy data, both LDL and triglyceride genetic risk scores (477 SNPs) were strongly predictive of age at initiation of lipid-lowering treatment. These findings highlight the value of longitudinal EHRs for identifying new genetic features of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism with implications for lipid treatment and risk of coronary heart disease. Genome-wide association analysis using electronic health record data from >94,000 individuals identifies loci associated with plasma lipid concentrations. Longitudinal measurements allow for the calculation of genetic risk scores and increase the variance explained."

The nucleotide-repeat expansions are translated into dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins, which are aggregation prone and may contribute to neurodegeneration. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genome-wide gene-knockout screens for suppressors and enhancers of C9ORF72 DPR toxicity in human cells. We validated hits by performing secondary CRISPR-Cas9 screens in primary mouse neurons. We uncovered potent modifiers of DPR toxicity whose gene products function in nucleocytoplasmic transport, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), proteasome, RNA-processing pathways, and chromatin modification. One modifier, TMX2, modulated the ER-stress signature elicited by C9ORF72 DPRs in neurons and improved survival of human induced motor neurons from patients with C9ORF72 ALS. Together, our results demonstrate the promise of CRISPR-Cas9 screens in defining mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2949291528,"Clustering of mutations has been observed in cancer genomes as well as for germline de novo mutations (DNMs). We identified 1,796 clustered DNMs (cDNMs) within whole-genome-sequencing data from 1,291 parent–offspring trios to investigate their patterns and infer a mutational mechanism. We found that the number of clusters on the maternal allele was positively correlated with maternal age and that these clusters consisted of more individual mutations with larger intermutational distances than those of paternal clusters. More than 50% of maternal clusters were located on chromosomes 8, 9 and 16, in previously identified regions with accelerated maternal mutation rates. Maternal clusters in these regions showed a distinct mutation signature characterized by C>G transversions. Finally, we found that maternal clusters were associated with processes involving double-strand-breaks (DSBs), such as meiotic gene conversions and de novo deletion events. This result suggested accumulation of DSB-induced mutations throughout oocyte aging as the mechanism underlying the formation of maternal mutation clusters. Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 1,291 parent–offspring trios identifies patterns of clustered de novo mutations. Clusters increase in number with maternal age and are associated with DNA double-strand-break processes."
https://openalex.org/W2793601014,"The polycomb repressor complex 2 molecule EZH2 is now known to play a role in essential cellular processes, namely, cell fate decisions, cell cycle regulation, senescence, cell differentiation, and cancer development/progression. EZH2 inhibitors have recently been developed; however, their effectiveness and underlying molecular mechanisms in many malignancies have not yet been elucidated in detail. Although the functional role of EZH2 in tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma (NB) has been investigated, mutations of EZH2 have not been reported. A Kaplan–Meier analysis on the event free survival and overall survival of NB patients indicated that the high expression of EZH2 correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. In order to elucidate the functional roles of EZH2 in NB tumorigenesis and its aggressiveness, we knocked down EZH2 in NB cell lines using lentivirus systems. The knockdown of EZH2 significantly induced NB cell differentiation, e.g., neurite extension, and the neuronal differentiation markers, NF68 and GAP43. EZH2 inhibitors also induced NB cell differentiation. We performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using Human Gene Expression Microarrays and found that NTRK1 (TrkA) is one of the EZH2-related suppression targets. The depletion of NTRK1 canceled EZH2 knockdown-induced NB cell differentiation. Our integrative methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using NB cell lines and clinical samples clarified that the NTRK1 P1 and P2 promoter regions were regulated differently by DNA methylation and EZH2-related histone modifications. The NTRK1 transcript variants 1/2, which were regulated by EZH2-related H3K27me3 modifications at the P1 promoter region, were strongly expressed in favorable, but not unfavorable NB. The depletion and inhibition of EZH2 successfully induced NTRK1 transcripts and functional proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that EZH2 plays important roles in preventing the differentiation of NB cells and also that EZH2-related NTRK1 transcriptional regulation may be the key pathway for NB cell differentiation."

Macrophages, mesothelial precursor cells, cytokines, and growth factors accumulated in the peritoneal lavage. Transcriptome profiling revealed YAP/TAZ activation in inflamed mesothelium with further activation in tumors, paralleled by increased levels of cells with nuclear YAP/TAZ. Arg1 was one of the highest upregulated genes in inflamed tissue and tumor. Inflamed tissue showed increased levels of single-nucleotide variations, with an RNA-editing signature, which were even higher in the tumor samples. Subcutaneous injection of asbestos-treated, but tumor-free mice with syngeneic mesothelioma tumor cells resulted in a significantly higher incidence of tumor growth when compared to naïve mice supporting the role of the environment in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2789422799,"SIRT1 (silent information regulator 2 homolog 1) is a crucial cellular survival protein especially in oxidative stress environments, and has been thought to locate within the nuclei, but also known to shuttle between cytoplasm and nuclei in some cell types. Here, we show for the first time the dynamics of SIRT1 in the presence of single or concurrent cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). In BEAS-2B HBEC or primary HBEC, SIRT1 was localized predominantly in cytoplasm, and the CSE (3%) induced nuclear translocation of SIRT1 from cytoplasm in the presence of L-buthionine sulfoximine (an irreversible inhibitor of γ-glutamylcystein synthetase), mainly through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) α subunit. This SIRT1 nuclear shuttling was associated with FOXO3a nuclear translocation and the strong induction of several anti-oxidant genes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2 and 3; therefore seemed to be an adaptive response. When BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with repeated exposure to a lower concentration of CSE (0.3%), the CSE-induced SIRT1 shuttling and resultant SOD2/3 mRNA induction were significantly impaired. Thus, this result offers a useful cell model to mimic the impaired anti-oxidant capacity in cigarette smoking-associated lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

However, little is known about how sexual behavior changes during pregnancy and postpartum periods which will help develop targeted HIV prevention and transmission interventions, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).MethodsCross-sectional study in HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant and postpartum women in Cape Town, South Africa. Interviewers collected survey data on demographic, sexual behaviors, and alcohol use among pregnant and post-partum women. We report descriptive results of sexual behavior by trimester and postpartum period, and results of multivariable logistic regression stratified by pregnancy status.ResultsWe enrolled 377 pregnant and postpartum women (56% pregnant, 40% HIV-infected). During pregnancy, 98% of women reported vaginal sex (8% anal sex, 44% oral sex) vs. 35% and 88% during the periods 0-6 and 7-12 months postpartum, respectively (pl0.05). More pregnant women reported having g1 partner in the past 12-months compared to postpartum women (18% vs. 13%, respectively, pl0.05). Sex frequency varied by trimester with greatest mean sex acts occurring during first trimester and g6-months postpartum (13 mean sex acts in first trimester; 17 mean sex acts g6-months postpartum). Pregnant women had increased odds of reporting condomless sex at last sex (aOR = 2.96;95%CI = 1.84-4.78) and ever having condomless sex in past 3-months (aOR = 2.65;95%CI = 1.30-5.44) adjusting for age, HIV status, and sex frequency compared to postpartum women.ConclusionWe identified that sexual behaviors and risk behaviors were high and changing during pregnancy and postpartum periods, presenting challenges to primary and secondary HIV prevention efforts, including PrEP delivery to pregnant and breastfeeding women."
https://openalex.org/W2792868678,"Selection of reference genes has become an integral step in any real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based expression studies. The importance of this study stems from the fact that riverine buffaloes are major dairy species of Indian sub-continent and the information generated here will be of great interest to the investigators engaged in functional genomic studies of this important livestock species. In this study, an effort was made to evaluate a panel of 10 candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta- actin (ACTB), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15), ribosomal protein L-4 (RPL4), ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), β2 Microglobulin (β2M) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) across 12 tissues (mammary gland, kidney, spleen, liver, heart, intestine, ovary, lung, muscle, brain, subcutaneous fat and testis) of riverine buffaloes. In addition to overall analysis, tissue wise evaluation of expression stability of individual RG was also performed. Three different algorithms provided in geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper softwares were used to evaluate the stability of 10 potential reference genes from different functional classes. The M-value given by geNorm ranged from 0.9797 (RPS9 and UXT) to 1.7362 (RPS15). From the most stable to the least stable, genes were ranked as: UXT/RPS9> RPL4> RPS23> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> GAPDH> B2M> RPS15. While NormFinder analysis ranked the genes as: UXT> RPS23> RPL4> RPS9> EEF1A1> HMBS> ACTB> β2M> GAPDH> RPS15. Based on the crossing point SD value and range of fold change expression, BestKeeper analysis ranked the genes as: RPS9> RPS23/UXT> RPL4> GAPDH> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> β2M> RPS15. Overall the study has identified RPS23, RPS9, RPL4 and UXT genes to be the most stable and appropriate RGs that could be utilized for normalization of transcriptional data in various tissues of buffaloes. This manuscript thus provide useful information on panel of reference genes that could be helpful for researchers conducting functional genomic studies in riverine buffaloes."

https://openalex.org/W2791890450,"M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1 mAChRs) are the most abundant muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus and have been shown to have procognitive effects. AMPA receptors (AMPARs), an important subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are key components in neurocognitive networks. However, the role of AMPARs in procognitive effects of M1 mAChRs and how M1 mAChRs affect the function of AMPARs remain poorly understood. Here, we found that basal expression of GluA1, a subunit of AMPARs, and its phosphorylation at Ser845 were maintained by M1 mAChR activity. Activation of M1 mAChRs promoted membrane insertion of GluA1, especially to postsynaptic densities. Impairment of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory by antagonism of M1 mAChRs paralleled the reduction of GluA1 expression, and improvement of learning and memory by activation of M1 mAChRs was accompanied by the synaptic insertion of GluA1 and its increased phosphorylation at Ser845. Furthermore, abrogation of phosphorylation of Ser845 residue of GluA1 ablated M1 mAChR-mediated improvement of learning and memory. Taken together, these results show a functional correlation of M1 mAChRs and GluA1 and the essential role of GluA1 in M1 mAChR-mediated cognitive improvement.-Zhao, L.-X., Ge, Y.-H., Xiong, C.-H., Tang, L., Yan, Y.-H., Law, P.-Y., Qiu, Y., Chen, H.-Z.

https://openalex.org/W2794254397,"Several groups have used CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated protein 9) for DNA virus editing. In most cases, one single-guide RNA (sgRNA) is used, which produces inconsistencies in gene editing. In this study, we used a swine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, as a model to systematically explore the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in DNA virus editing. In our current report, we demonstrated that cotransfection of 2 sgRNAs and a viral genome resulted in significantly better knockout efficiency than the transfection-infection-based approach. This method could result in 100% knockout of ≤3500 bp of viral nonessential large fragments. Furthermore, knockin efficiency was significantly improved by using 2 sgRNAs and was also correlated with the number of background viruses. We also demonstrated that the background viruses were all 2-sgRNA-mediated knockout mutants. Finally, this study demonstrated that the efficacy of gene knockin is determined by the replicative kinetics of background viruses. We propose that CRISPR/Cas9 coupled with 2 sgRNAs creates a powerful tool for DNA virus editing and offers great potential for future applications.—Tang Y.-D., Guo J.-C., Wang T.-Y., Zhao K., Liu J.-T., Gao J.-C., Tian Z.-J., An T.-Q., Cai X.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2789360542,"Background Alcohol consumption among patients with HIV/AIDS increases the burden of the disease. HIV/AIDS is an epidemic among Sub-Saharan African countries. Excessive use of alcohol causes a large degree of health problems, social and economic burden in societies. However, the prevalence and associated factors of alcohol use disorder among this group of people has not been studied very well. Therefore, this study sought to assess the magnitude and associated factors of alcohol use disorder among HIV patients attending the antiretroviral (ART) clinic. Methods A hospital based cross sectional study design was conducted at Bishoftu General Hospital from May to June 2015. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data was collected by face to face interview and chart review. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to assess alcohol use disorder. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify associated factors and P-value < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Results A total of 527 participants were enrolled in the study with a response rate of 100%. The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) was 14.2%. Factors associated with alcohol use disorder were educational status AOR = 8.5 (95%CI: 1.70, 42.99), social support AOR = 0.5(95%CI: 0.26, 0.95), cigarette smoking AOR = 3.49(95%CI: 1.01, 12.13), khat chewing AOR = 5.11 (95% CI: 1.60, 16.33), family history of alcohol use AOR = 3.58 (95% CI: 1.52, 8.47), and missing ART drugs AOR 3.05 (95% CI: 1.302, 7.131). Conclusion The prevalence of alcohol use disorder was high as compared to similar epidemiological studies. Educational status, social support, cigarette smoking, khat chewing, and family history of alcohol use were independent predictors. Providing health education about alcohol use and proper screening of alcohol use disorder among patients with HIV/AIDS is crucial. Strengthening the referral linkage with the psychiatric unit will decrease the burdens of the problem."
https://openalex.org/W2481211484,"Postcopulatory sexual selection may select for male primary sexual characteristics like sperm morphology and sperm motility, through sperm competition or cryptic female choice. However, how such characteristics influence male fertilization success remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate possible correlations between sperm characteristics and paternity success in the socially monogamous bluethroat (Luscinia svecica svecica), predicting that sperm length and sperm swimming speed is positively correlated with paternity success. In total, 25% (15/61) of broods contained extra-pair offspring and 10% (33/315) of the offspring were sired by extra-pair males. Paternity success did not correlate significantly with sperm morphology or any aspects of sperm motility. Furthermore, sperm morphology and sperm motility did not correlate significantly with male morphological characters that previously have been shown to be associated with paternity success. Thus, the sperm characteristics investigated here do not appear to be strong predictors of paternity success in bluethroats."
https://openalex.org/W2789650662,"Lipid metabolism is closely involved with signal transduction and energy homeostasis. Excess calorie intake causes abnormal lipid metabolism, promoting obesity and insulin resistance. Diacylglycerol (DG) represents not only a lipidic second messenger but also an intermediate metabolite for triglyceride metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it remains undetermined how the roles of DG in signaling and energy homeostasis is regulated within the cell. Of DG kinases (DGKs), which are enzymes that phosphorylate DG, DGKε resides in the ER. This study examined how DGKε is implicated in signal transduction and lipid homeostasis. DGKε-deficient mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 40 d. We observed that DGKε deficiency promotes fat accumulation in adipocytes and subsequently promotes insulin resistance in mice fed an HFD. This abnormal fat metabolism is mediated by down-regulation of lipolytic activities, such as adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. In addition, activation of DG-sensitive PKC leads to insulin resistance in adipose tissue, which may be caused by delayed metabolism of DG. Our data suggest that DGKε links the second messenger signaling system to energy homeostasis in adipocytes and that its deficiency results in abnormal lipid metabolism such as obesity and insulin resistance.-Nakano, T., Seino, K., Wakabayashi, I., Stafforini, D.

https://openalex.org/W2791786967,"Volcanic lakes are characterized by physicochemical favorable conditions for the development of reservoirs of C-bearing greenhouse gases that can be dispersed to air during occasional rollover events. By combining a microbiological and geochemical approach, we showed that the chemistry of the CO2- and CH4-rich gas reservoir hosted within the meromictic Lake Averno (Campi Flegrei, southern Italy) are related to the microbial niche differentiation along the vertical water column. The simultaneous occurrence of diverse functional groups of microbes operating under different conditions suggests that these habitats harbor complex microbial consortia that impact on the production and consumption of greenhouse gases. In the epilimnion, the activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic biota, together with CO2 dissolution at relatively high pH, enhanced CO2- and CH4 consumption, which also occurred in the hypolimnion. Moreover, results from computations carried out to evaluate the dependence of the lake stability on the CO2/CH4 ratios, suggested that the water density vertical gradient was mainly controlled by salinity and temperature, whereas the effect of dissolved gases was minor, excepting if extremely high increases of CH4 are admitted. Therefore, biological processes, controlling the composition of CO2 and CH4, contributed to stabilize the lake stratification of the lake. Overall, Lake Averno, and supposedly the numerous worldwide distributed volcanic lakes having similar features (namely bio-activity lakes), acts as a sink for the CO2 supplied from the hydrothermal/magmatic system, displaying a significant influence on the local carbon budget."
https://openalex.org/W2790473418,"The ability of Plasmodium parasites to egress from their host red blood cell is critical for the amplification of these parasites in the blood. Previous forward chemical genetic approaches have implicated the subtilisin-like protease (SUB1) and the cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3) as key players in egress, with the final step of SUB1 maturation thought to be due to the activity of DPAP3. In this study, we have utilized a reverse genetics approach to engineer transgenic Plasmodium falciparum parasites in which dpap3 expression can be conditionally regulated using the glmS ribozyme based RNA-degrading system. We show that DPAP3, which is expressed in schizont stages and merozoites and localizes to organelles distinct from the micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules, is not required for the trafficking of apical proteins or processing of SUB1 substrates, nor for parasite maturation and egress from red blood cells. Thus, our findings argue against a role for DPAP3 in parasite egress and indicate that the phenotypes observed with DPAP3 inhibitors are due to off-target effects."
https://openalex.org/W2790508393,"Lignin is a polymer present in the secondary cell walls of all vascular plants. It is a known barrier to pulping and the extraction of high-energy sugars from cellulosic biomass. The challenge faced with predicting outcomes of transgenic plants with reduced lignin is due in part to the presence of unique protein-protein interactions that influence the regulation and metabolic flux in the pathway. Yet, it is unclear why certain plants have evolved to create these protein complexes. In this study, we use mathematical models to investigate the role that the protein complex, formed specifically between Ptr4CL3 and Ptr4CL5 enzymes, have on the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. The role of this Ptr4CL3-Ptr4CL5 enzyme complex on the steady state flux distribution was quantified by performing Monte Carlo simulations. The effect of this complex on the robustness and the homeostatic properties of the pathway were identified by performing sensitivity and stability analyses, respectively. Results from these robustness and stability analyses suggest that the monolignol biosynthetic pathway is resilient to mild perturbations in the presence of the Ptr4CL3-Ptr4CL5 complex. Specifically, the presence of Ptr4CL3-Ptr4CL5 complex increased the stability of the pathway by 22%. The robustness in the pathway is maintained due to the presence of multiple enzyme isoforms as well as the presence of alternative pathways resulting from the presence of the Ptr4CL3-Ptr4CL5 complex."

Pattern recognition receptor agonists, in particular polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [p(I:C)], are promising adjuvant candidates for therapeutic vaccination to generate protective T-cell immunity. Here we established an ex vivo skin explant model to study the expression and activation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-sensing pattern recognition receptors in LCs and KCs in human skin. Whereas KCs expressed all known dsRNA sensing receptors at a constitutive and inducible level, LCs exclusively expressed melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) in untreated skin and freshly isolated cells. Comparative assessments of downstream signaling pathways induced by p(I:C) revealed distinct mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein, IFN-regulatory factor 3, and NF-κB activation in LCs and KCs. Consequently, p(I:C) treatment of LCs significantly induced IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA expression, while in KCs an up-regulation of IFN-β and TNF-α mRNA was detectable. Stimulation of LCs with specific ligands revealed that not the TLR3- but only the MDA5-specific ligand induced IFN-α2, IFN-β, and TNF-α cytokines, but no IL-6 and -8. In KCs, both ligands induced production of high IL-6 and IL-8 levels, and low IFN-α2 and IFN-β levels, indicating that different dsRNA-sensing receptors and/or downstream signaling pathways are activated in both cell types. Our data suggest that MDA5 may be an attractive adjuvant target for epicutaneous delivery of therapeutic vaccines with the goal to target LCs.-Tajpara, P., Schuster, C., Schon, E., Kienzl, P., Vierhapper, M., Mildner, M., Elbe-Burger, A.

https://openalex.org/W2793042800,"Background The harmful effects of marijuana on health and in particular cardiovascular health are understudied. To develop such knowledge, an efficient method of developing an informative cohort of marijuana users and non-users is needed. Methods We identified patients with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease using ICD-9 codes who were seen in the San Francisco VA in 2015. We imported these patients’ medical record notes into an informatics platform that facilitated text searches. We categorized patients into those with evidence of marijuana use in the past 12 months and patients with no such evidence, using the following text strings: “marijuana”, “mjx”, and “cannabis”. We randomly selected 51 users and 51 non-users based on this preliminary classification, and sent a recruitment letter to 97 of these patients who had contact information available. Patients were interviewed on marijuana use and domains related to cardiovascular health. Data on marijuana use collected from the medical record was compared to data collected as part of the interview. Results The interview completion rate was 71%. Among the 35 patients identified by text strings as having used marijuana in the previous year, 15 had used marijuana in the past 30 days (positive predictive value = 42.9%). The probability of use in the past month increased from 8.8% to 42.9% in people who have these keywords in their medical record compared to those who did not have these terms in their medical record. Conclusion Methods that combine text search strategies for participant recruitment with health interviews provide an efficient approach to developing prospective cohorts that can be used to study the health effects of marijuana."

Objective Investigate the means, differences, and trends in lipid profile measures [TC, total cholesterol; LDL-c, low-density lipoprotein; HDL-c, high-density lipoprotein; and TG, triglycerides] among US adults by diabetes status and cholesterol-lowering medication. Methods Population number and proportion of adults aged ≥21 years with diabetes and taking cholesterol-lowering medication were estimated using data on 10,384 participants from NHANES 2003–2012. Age-standardized means, trends, and differences in lipid profile measures were estimated by diabetes status and cholesterol medication use. For trends and differences, linear regression analysis were used adjusted for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Results Among diabetic adults, 52% were taking cholesterol-lowering medication compared to the 14% taking cholesterol-lowering medication without diabetes. Although diabetic adults had significantly lower TC and LDL-c levels than non-diabetic adults [% difference (95% confidence interval): TC = -5.2% (-6.8 –-3.5), LDL-c = -8.0% (-10.4 –-5.5)], the percent difference was greater among adults taking cholesterol medication [TC = -8.0% (-10.3 –-5.7); LDL-c = -13.7% (-17.1 –-10.2)] than adults not taking cholesterol medication [TC = -3.5% (-5.2 –-1.6); LDL-c = -4.3% (-7.1 –-1.5)] (interaction p-value: TC = <0.001; LDL-c = <0.001). From 2003–2012, mean TC and HDL-c significantly decreased among diabetic adults taking cholesterol medication [% difference per survey cycle (p-value for linear trend): TC = -2.3% (0.003) and HDL-c = -2.3% (0.033)]. Mean TC, HDL-c, and LDL-c levels did not significantly change from 2003 to 2012 in non-diabetic adults taking cholesterol medication or for adults not taking cholesterol medications. Conclusions Diabetic adults were more likely to have lower lipid levels, except for triglyceride levels, than non-diabetic adults with profound differences when considering cholesterol medication use, possibly due to the positive effects from clinical diabetes management."

Moreover, the P18 helix connects the C- and S-domains between its loop and the P8 helix in the S-domain (the P8/ P18-interaction). In contrast to the ""P6-mimic"", the presence of P18 does not contribute to the catalytic performance by the C-domain lacking the S-domain in cleavage of an all ribo model hairpin loop substrate while deletion or disruption of the P8/ P18-interaction in full-size RPR lowers the catalytic efficiency in cleavage of the same model hairpin loop substrate in keeping with previously reported data using precursor tRNAs. Consistent with that P18 is not required for cleavage mediated by the C-domain we show that the archaeal Pyrococcus furiosus RPR C-domain, which lacks the P18 helix, is catalytically active in trans without the S-domain and any protein. Our data also suggest that the S-domain has a larger impact on catalysis for E. coli RPR compared to P. furiosus RPR. Finally, we provide data indicating that the absence of the S-domain and P18, or the P8/ P18-interaction in full-length RPR influences the charge distribution near the cleavage site in the RPR-substrate complex to a small but reproducible extent."

https://openalex.org/W2792080344,"The prototypes of ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI scanners developed in recent years represent new, innovative, cost-effective and safer systems, which are suitable to be integrated in multi-modal (Magnetoencephalography and MRI) devices. Integrated ULF-MRI and MEG scanners could represent an ideal solution to obtain functional (MEG) and anatomical (ULF MRI) information in the same environment, without errors that may limit source reconstruction accuracy. However, the low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ULF images, as well as their limited coverage, do not generally allow for the construction of an accurate individual volume conductor model suitable for MEG localization. Thus, for practical usage, a high-field (HF) MRI image is also acquired, and the HF-MRI images are co-registered to the ULF-MRI ones. We address here this issue through an optimized pipeline (SWIM-Sliding WIndow grouping supporting Mutual information). The co-registration is performed by an affine transformation, the parameters of which are estimated using Normalized Mutual Information as the cost function, and Adaptive Simulated Annealing as the minimization algorithm. The sub-voxel resolution of the ULF images is handled by a sliding-window approach applying multiple grouping strategies to down-sample HF MRI to the ULF-MRI resolution. The pipeline has been tested on phantom and real data from different ULF-MRI devices, and comparison with well-known toolboxes for fMRI analysis has been performed. Our pipeline always outperformed the fMRI toolboxes (FSL and SPM). The HF-ULF MRI co-registration obtained by means of our pipeline could lead to an effective integration of ULF MRI with MEG, with the aim of improving localization accuracy, but also to help exploit ULF MRI in tumor imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2792220358,"Detoxified pneumolysin, PlyD1, is a protein vaccine candidate that induces protection against infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae in mouse models. Despite extensive knowledge on antibody responses against PlyD1, limited information is available about PlyD1 induced T cell recognition. Here we interrogated epitope breadth and functional characteristics of the T cell response to PlyD1 in two mouse strains. BALB/c (H-2d) and C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were vaccinated with Al(OH)3-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted PlyD1, or placebo, on day 0, 21 and 42 and were sacrificed at day 56 for collection of sera and spleens. Vaccination with adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted PlyD1 induced anti-pneumolysin IgG antibodies with neutralizing capacity in both mouse strains. Adjuvantation of PlyD1 enhanced the serological responses in both strains. In vitro restimulation of splenocytes with PlyD1 and 18-mer synthetic peptides derived from pneumolysin revealed specific proliferative and cytokine responses. For both mouse strains, one immunodominant and three subdominant natural epitopes were identified. Overlap between H-2d and H-2b restricted T cell epitopes was limited, yet similarities were found between epitopes processed in mice and predicted to be immunogenic in humans. H-2d restricted T cell epitopes were localized in pneumolysin domains 2 and 3, whereas H-2b epitopes were scattered over the protein. Cytokine responses show mostly a Th2 profile, with low levels of Th1 cytokines, in both mouse strains. In conclusion, PlyD1 evokes T cell responses in mice directed against multiple epitope regions, that is dependent on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) background. These results are important to understand human PlyD1 T cell immunogenicity, to guide cell mediated immunity studies in the context of vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2792930526,"We introduce a Schelling model in which people are modelled as agents following simple behavioural rules which dictate their tolerance to others, their corresponding preference for particular locations, and in turn their movement through a geographic or social space. Our innovation over previous work is to allow agents to adapt their tolerance to others in response to their local environment, in line with contemporary theories from social psychology. We show that adaptive tolerance leads to a polarization in tolerance levels, with distinct modes at either extreme of the distribution. Moreover, agents self-organize into communities of like-tolerance, just as they congregate with those of same colour. Our results are robust not only to variations in free parameters, but also experimental treatments in which migrants are dynamically introduced into the native population. We argue that this model provides one possible parsimonious explanation of the political landscape circa 2016."
https://openalex.org/W2791289951,"Intra-operative complications like mechanical damages to the leads, infections and hematomas during generator replacements of implantable pacemakers and defibrillators contribute to additional costs for hospitals. The aim of this study was to evaluate operation room use, costs and budget impact of generator replacements using either a traditional surgical intervention (TSI) with scissors, scalpel and electrocautery vs. a new radiofrequency energy based surgical system, called PEAK PlasmaBladeTM (PPB).We conducted a retrospective analysis of a population including 508 patients with TSI and 254 patients with PPB who underwent generator replacement at the Kepler University Hospital in Linz or the St. Josef Hospital in Braunau, Austria. The economic analysis included costs of resources used for intra-operative complications (lead damages) and of procedure time for TSI vs. PPB.Proportion of males, mean age and type of generator replaced were similar between the two groups. Lead damages occurred significantly more frequent with TSI than with PPB (5.3% and 0.4%; p< 0.001) and the procedure time was significantly longer with TSI than with PPB (47.9±24.9 and 34.1±18.1 minutes; p<0.001). Shorter procedure time and a lower rate of lead damages with PPB resulted in per patient cost savings of €81. Based on estimated 2,700 patients annually undergoing generator replacement in Austria, the use of PPB may translate into cost savings of €219,600 and 621 saved operating facility hours.PPB has the potential to minimize the risk of lead damage with more efficient utilization of the operating room. Along with cost savings and improved quality of care, hospitals may use the saved operating room hours to increase the number of daily surgeries."

We studied the career paths of 15 thousand Hungarian students based on the integrated database of the National Tax Administration, the National Health Insurance Fund, and the higher education information system of the Hungarian Government. A brief analysis of gender pay gap and the spatial distribution of over-education is presented to demonstrate the background of the research and the resulted open dataset. We highlighted the hierarchical and clustered structure of the career paths based on the multi-resolution analysis of the graph modularity. The results of the cluster analysis can support policymakers to fine-tune the fragmented program structure of higher education."

https://openalex.org/W2789277493,"Muscle-tendon vibration has often been used to study the contribution of proprioception to kinesthesia and postural control. This technique is known to simulate the lengthening of the vibrated muscle and, in the presence of balance constraints, evoke compensatory postural responses. The objective of the present study was to clarify the consequences of this stimulation on the dynamic features of whole-body movement perception in upright stance and in the absence of balance constraints. Eleven participants were restrained in a dark room on a motorized backboard that was able to tilt the upright body around the ankle joints. The participants were passively tilted backwards or forwards with a maximum amplitude of four degrees and at very low acceleration (thus preventing the semicircular canals from contributing to movement perception). In half the trials, the body displacement was combined with continuous vibration of the Achilles tendons, which simulates a forward tilt. Participants used a joystick to report when and in which direction they perceived their own whole-body movement. Our results showed that during backward whole-body displacement, the movement detection threshold (i.e. the minimum angular velocity required to accurately perceive passive displacement) was higher in the presence of vibration, whereas the accuracy rate (i.e. the proportion of the overall trial duration during which the movement was correctly indicated) was lower. Conversely, the accuracy rate for forward displacements was higher in the presence of vibration. In the absence of vibration, forward movement was detected earlier than backward movement. The simulated whole-body displacement evoked by Achilles tendon vibration was therefore able to either enhance or disrupt the perception of real, slow, whole-body tilt movements, depending on the congruence between the direction of real and simulated displacements."
