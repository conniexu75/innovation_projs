(p. 1330 ; see the Perspective by Hoffert ) made the assumption that all existing infrastructure will be used until the end of its lifetime, after which it will be replaced by infrastructure that does not produce CO 2 . They then calculated the amount of additional CO 2 that will be added to the atmosphere. The outcome is that the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 would remain below 430 parts per million (ppm) (present levels are 390 ppm) and global mean temperatures would increase to 1.3°C above preindustrial values (about 0.5°C above present), well below current targets of 450 ppm and 2°C, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2009315184,"Avoiding Loss in a Quantum System Single electron spins in solid-state environments have been explored as candidates for quantum information storage and computation; however, they often interact strongly with their surroundings and lose the stored information on the time scale of pico- to milliseconds. Dynamical decoupling schemes have been introduced to “undo” the effects of this interaction by applying a sequence of control pulses that reverse the undesirable evolution of the system. De Lange et al. (p. 60 , published online 9 September) tested several decoupling schemes on a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond and found that a scheme with evenly spaced pulses with double-axis decoupling could prolong the coherence time of an arbitrary spin state up to 25-fold."

In plants, too, repeated structures arise during growth and development. As the above-ground shoot grows, it sends out leaves or branches at intervals guided by hormone signaling. As the below-ground root grows, it too ramifies, sending out lateral roots. Moreno-Risueno et al. (p. 1306 ; see the Perspective by Traas and Vernoux ) explored the expression of genes underlying development of lateral roots and found that oscillations in gene expression guide the specification of lateral roots."

https://openalex.org/W2030602441,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein, and the microtubule-associated protein tau are key pathogenic factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). How exactly they impair cognitive functions is unknown. We assessed the effects of Aβ and tau on axonal transport of mitochondria and the neurotrophin receptor TrkA, cargoes that are critical for neuronal function and survival and whose distributions are altered in AD. Aβ oligomers rapidly inhibited axonal transport of these cargoes in wild-type neurons. Lowering tau levels prevented these defects without affecting baseline axonal transport. Thus, Aβ requires tau to impair axonal transport, and tau reduction protects against Aβ-induced axonal transport defects."

Plant cell walls are an attractive sugar source; however, yeast does not grow efficiently on cellulose–derived sugars (cellodextrins). Galazka et al. (p. 84 , published online 9 September) now show that a model cellolytic fungus Neurospora crassa relies on a cellodextrin transport system to facilitate growth on cellulose. Yeast reconstituted with this transport system grew efficiently on cellodextrins, which could potentially improve the efficiency of cellulosic biofuel production."

And, if they do, are multiply represented stimuli remembered better? These questions and related ones have fascinated psychologists for decades, but only recently has it become feasible to begin tackling them using neuroimaging. Xue et al. (p. 97 , published online 9 September) provide evidence that the greater the similarity in the patterns of neural activity during encoding of the item, the greater the likelihood that the item will be remembered."
https://openalex.org/W2168875869,"Transient Protein Conformations Transient conformations are important to protein function; however, detecting and characterizing these states is technically challenging. Korzhnev et al. (p. 1312 ; see the Perspective by Al-Hashimi ) combined recently developed methods to determine the three-dimensional atomic-resolution structure of a transient intermediate of a four-helix bundle protein domain. The intermediate formed rapidly but, owing to structural peculiarities, slowly rearranged into its native state. The methods can be applied not only to folding intermediates but also to excited states important for protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2166903146,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted a number of genes with connections to type 1 diabetes and other common diseases, but in most instances the mechanism by which DNA variation affects disease risk is far from clear. Recent advances in rat genomics now make a systems-genetics approach possible, which should help to reveal links between diseases and gene functions. Using gene expression studies across seven types of rat tissue, together with GWAS and human genetics, Heinig et al. have now identified the inflammatory network driven by interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) as a contributor to type 1 diabetes risk. They also implicate the innate viral response pathway and macrophages in the aetiology of the disease. The study shows how co-expression networks across species provide functional annotation of genes, and how this can be used to reveal a signal of common genetic variation of small effect that is not detected by GWAS. Here, a combination of genetic studies of gene expression, cross-species network analysis and genome-wide association studies has been used to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation in rats. The results show that an inflammatory network driven by interferon regulatory factor 7 contributes to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, and implicate the innate viral-response pathway and macrophages in the aetiology of this disease. Combined analyses of gene networks and DNA sequence variation can provide new insights into the aetiology of common diseases that may not be apparent from genome-wide association studies alone. Recent advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches1,2. Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF73)-driven inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that Epstein–Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration4,5, is expressed in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN, which was conserved in monocytes. IDIN genes were more likely to associate with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D)—a macrophage-associated autoimmune disease—than randomly selected immune response genes (P = 8.85 × 10−6). The human locus controlling the IDIN was associated with the risk of T1D at single nucleotide polymorphism rs9585056 (P = 7.0 × 10−10; odds ratio, 1.15), which was one of five single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region associated with EBI2 (GPR183) expression. These data implicate IRF7 network genes and their regulatory locus in the pathogenesis of T1D."

Lee et al. (p. 1320 ) connected two aqueous reservoirs with opened, single-walled carbon nanotubes, half a millimeter long but only 1.5 nanometers wide, and observed a high, stable proton current under electroosmotic conditions arising from a single nanotube. The addition of alkali cations caused random pore blocking and oscillations in ion current, resembling events seen in biological ion channels."

https://openalex.org/W2026249950,"High-Temperature Electronic Switching In electronic circuitry, the band gap of a semi-conductor helps to provide the barrier that keeps charge carriers from flowing until a voltage is applied that switches the device. As temperatures rise, the carriers acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the band gap, causing the device to leak current even when they are turned off. The higher band gap of silicon carbide (SiC) makes it an attractive candidate for higher-temperature operations compared to conventional silicon, but several performance issues occur with SiC junction field-effect transistors. T.-H. Lee et al. (p. 1316 ) describe the fabrication of SiC nano-electromechanical switches that formed inverter circuits with extremely low leakage currents and switched billions of times at 500°C."
https://openalex.org/W2016971983,"Charging Back and Forth Ion binding by proteins can exert a major influence on electron transfer events in biological systems. Park et al. (p. 1324 ) discovered an analogous phenomenon in a simpler synthetic system. Specifically, a certain flexible molecule, known as a calix[4]pyrrole derivative, adopts a conical conformation upon binding anions, such as chloride or bromide, and this in turn leads to electron transfer to a guest acceptor that drifts into the cone. Addition of a cation that fitted more snugly into the conical cavity resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer reaction. The whole process was mapped out by spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the intermediates and products."
https://openalex.org/W2065868796,"Filopodia are finger-like protrusive structures, containing actin bundles. By incubating frog egg extracts with supported lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, we have reconstituted the assembly of filopodia-like structures (FLSs). The actin assembles into parallel bundles, and known filopodial components localize to the tip and shaft. The filopodia tip complexes self-organize--they are not templated by preexisting membrane microdomains. The F-BAR domain protein toca-1 recruits N-WASP, followed by the Arp2/3 complex and actin. Elongation proteins, Diaphanous-related formin, VASP, and fascin are recruited subsequently. Although the Arp2/3 complex is required for FLS initiation, it is not essential for elongation, which involves formins. We propose that filopodia form via clustering of Arp2/3 complex activators, self-assembly of filopodial tip complexes on the membrane, and outgrowth of actin bundles."
https://openalex.org/W2074595453,"The disulfide relay system of the mitochondrial intermembrane space has been extensively characterized in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. It contains two essential components, Mia40 and Erv1. The genome of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> contains a single gene for each of these components. Although insertional inactivation of Erv1 leads to a lethal phenotype, inactivation of Mia40 results in no detectable deleterious phenotype. <i>A. thaliana</i> Mia40 is targeted to and accumulates in mitochondria and peroxisomes. Inactivation of Mia40 results in an alteration of several proteins in mitochondria, an absence of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CSD1), the chaperone for superoxide dismutase (Ccs1) that inserts copper into CSD1, and a decrease in capacity and amount of complex I. In peroxisomes the absence of Mia40 leads to an absence of CSD3 and a decrease in abnormal inflorescence meristem 1 (Aim1), a β-oxidation pathway enzyme. Inactivation of Mia40 leads to an alteration of the transcriptome of <i>A. thaliana</i>, with genes encoding peroxisomal proteins, redox functions, and biotic stress significantly changing in abundance. Thus, the mechanistic operation of the mitochondrial disulfide relay system is different in <i>A. thaliana</i> compared with other systems, and Mia40 has taken on new roles in peroxisomes and mitochondria."

Here, we show that nimbolide, a triterpenoid isolated from Azadirachta indica, enhanced the apoptosis induced by inflammatory cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells. This limonoid abrogated the expression of proteins associated with cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, IAP-1, and IAP-2), proliferation (cyclin D1), invasion (MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF), all regulated by nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Nimbolide inhibited the activation of NF-κB induced by carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli. Constitutively active NF-κB found in most tumor cells was also inhibited. We found that suppression of NF-κB activation by nimbolide was caused by inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK), which led to suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and gene transcription. Reducing agent reversed the action of the limonoid, suggesting the involvement of a cysteine residue. Replacement of Cys179 of IKK-β with alanine abolished the effect of nimbolide, suggesting that Cys179 plays a critical role in inhibiting the NF-κB activation. Overall, our results indicate that nimbolide can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents through interaction with IKK, leading to inhibition of NF-κB-regulated proteins.

Extensive research during the past 2 decades has made it clear that cancer is a disease in which multiple cell signaling pathways are dysregulated and thus mono-targeted therapies are unlikely to provide a significant benefit (1Sartore-Bianchi A. Ricotta R. Cerea G. Maugeri M.R. Siena S. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 2007; 22: S77-S87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Natural products derived from fruits, vegetables, spices, legumes, cereals, and traditional medicines are preferred as potential therapeutics for cancer and other chronic diseases because of their safety, affordability, long term use, and ability to target multiple cell signaling pathways (2Singh S. Cell. 2007; 130: 765-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Promiscuous drugs that interact with multiple targets as compared with a single target are becoming a virtue in drug development as in case of imatinib, sunitinib, or sorafenib (3Mencher S.K.

Neem (Azadirachta indica, a tree in the Mahogany family; Azad Dirakht in Persian means “free tree”; called Muarubaini in Swahili, which means “treats 40 different diseases”) is one such traditional medicinal plant, the extract of which has been used for thousands of years for most acute and chronic diseases in India and Africa and thus has been named “Heal All,” “Nature's Drugstore,” “Village Pharmacy,” and “Panacea for all Diseases.” Over 300 bioactive components from this plant have been isolated, one-third of which are limonoids (4Siddiqui S.

Because of the critical role of NF-κB in apoptosis, tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis and its activation by various carcinogens, including DMBA, we hypothesized that nimbolide may modulate this cell signaling pathway. 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene IκB kinase phorbol myristate acetate okadaic acid poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase NF-κB-inducing kinase TNF receptor-associated death domain secretory alkaline phosphatase phosphatidylserine cigarette smoke condensate 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. NF-κB is a ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that is activated in response to a number of carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)), tumor promoters, cigarette smoke, environmental pollutants, ionizing radiation, and stress. In resting cells, NF-κB is kept in an inactive state in the cytoplasm as a heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and IκB proteins, including IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ (21Ting J.P. Duncan J.A. Lei Y. Science. 2010; 327: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In response to activation signals, the IκBα subunit is phosphorylated at serine residues 32 and 36 and ubiquitinated at lysine residues 21 and 22, which target them for proteasome-mediated degradation. The p65 subunit is then phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus where it binds to a specific DNA sequence and activates the transcription of over 500 genes involved in immunoregulation, growth regulation, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis. The phosphorylation of IκBα is catalyzed by IκBα kinase (IKK), which consists of three subunits, IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ (also called NEMO). Some natural compounds have been reported to inhibit NF-κB activation through modification of a specific cysteine residue (Cys179) in the activation loop of IKK-β (22Reynaert N.L. Ckless K. Korn S.H.

Our results demonstrate that this limonoid inhibits the NF-κB activation pathway induced by carcinogens, tumor promoters, inflammatory stimuli, and growth factors through direct interaction with Cys179 of IKK-β, leading to suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, inhibition of p65 nuclear translocation, down-regulation of NF-κB-regulated gene products, inhibition of cell proliferation, and potentiation of apoptosis induced by TNF-α and chemotherapeutics in tumor cells. Nimbolide (Fig. 1A) was isolated from Azadirachta indica leaves as reported previously (27Nair M.S. Gopal S. Issac D. Phytochemistry. 1997; 46: 1177-1178Crossref Google Scholar). A 50 mm solution of this limonoid was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in small aliquots at −20 °C. Nimbolide was diluted in the culture medium just before use.

All culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To determine NF-κB activation, we prepared nuclear extracts and performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (28Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The H1299 cells (2.5 × 104) were suspended in serum-free medium and seeded into the upper wells. After incubation overnight, cells were treated with 2.5 μm nimbolide for 4 h and then stimulated with 1 nm TNF in the presence of 1% FBS. After 24 h of incubation, the invaded cells were fixed, stained with Diff-Quik stain, and counted in five random microscopic fields. We performed IKK assay to determine the effect of nimbolide on TNF-α-induced IKK activation using a method described previously (30Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We performed immunocytochemical analysis to determine the effect of nimbolide on TNF-α-induced p65 nuclear translocation, as described previously (24Pandey M.K. Sandur S.K. Sung B. Sethi G. Kunnumakkara A.B. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17340-17350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Stained slides were analyzed using a Labophot-2 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured with a Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon, Lewisville, TX) and analyzed with MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging, Sunnyvale, CA). The effect of nimbolide on the induction of NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription by TNF-α, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1), TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), TAK1/TBL1-β, and IKK-β was analyzed using a secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay, as described previously (31Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To determine plasma membrane integrity and intracellular esterase activity, we performed a live/dead assay. It is a two-color fluorescence assay that simultaneously determines live cells and dead cells. Intracellular esterases from live cells convert nonfluorescent cell-permeable calcein acetoxymethyl (calcein AM) to the intensely fluorescent calcein. Cleaved calcein is retained within cells. It also examines dead cells that have damaged membranes; the ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) enters damaged cells and is fluorescent when bound to nucleic acids. EthD-1 produces a bright red fluorescence in damaged or dead cells. This assay was performed as described previously (32Takada Y. Khuri F.R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26287-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The annexin V assay provides a simple and effective method to detect apoptosis at a very early stage. This assay takes advantage of the fact that phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer (cell surface) leaflet soon after the induction of apoptosis and that the annexin V protein has a strong, specific affinity for PS. PS on the outer leaflet is available to bind labeled annexin V, providing the basis for a simple staining assay. We measured the loss of membrane asymmetry that occurs when PS moves to the extracellular surface of the membrane using an annexin V staining kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The assay was performed by following the manufacturer's instructions. The effects of nimbolide on the proliferation of leukemic cells and on the cytotoxic potential of TNF-α and other chemotherapeutic agents were determined by measuring mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) as the substrate (33Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Different parameters were monitored in normal and treated cells. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Data are given as the mean ± S.D. The statistical analysis was carried out using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Our goal in this study was to determine whether nimbolide affects the NF-κB activation pathway, NF-κB-regulated gene products, and NF-κB-mediated cellular responses in tumor cells. We focused primarily on TNF-α-induced cellular effects because the role of TNF-α in the NF-κB activation pathway is relatively well defined. When nimbolide or NF-κB activators were added alone, at the concentrations and the exposure times employed in our study, cell viability was not affected. Because NF-κB has been implicated in the survival and proliferation of various tumor cells, we examined the effect of nimbolide on cell proliferation. The limonoid suppressed the proliferation of various myeloid leukemic (KBM-5, HL-60, U-937, and K-562), T-cell lymphoma (Jurkat), and myeloma (U266, MM.1S, and RPMI-8226) cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The suppression of cell proliferation could be observed at nimbolide concentrations as low as 1 μm (Fig. 1B). No significant inhibition of cell growth was noted after 1 day. These results indicate that nimbolide exhibits potent anti-proliferative effects on both leukemic and myeloid cells. Among the cytokines, TNF-α is a well known apoptosis-inducing agent (34Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). We investigated whether nimbolide could potentiate TNF-α-induced apoptosis. When apoptosis was examined by measuring intracellular esterase activity, we found that nimbolide treatment increased TNF-α-induced apoptosis in KBM-5 and U266 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The TNF-α-induced apoptosis increased from 4 to 59% in KBM-5 cells and from 5 to 50% in U-266 cells (Fig. 2A). The results of the MTT assay also indicated that nimbolide enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). When apoptosis was examined by a PS externalization assay, significantly more annexin V-positive cells were found after treatment with nimbolide and TNF-α than after treatment with the cytokine alone (Fig. 2C). TNF-α binds to TNFR1 and sequentially recruits TRADD, FADD, and the FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (caspase-8), leading to activation of caspase-9 and -3. Activated caspase-3 then induces PARP cleavage, a sign of apoptosis. Thus, we examined whether nimbolide could enhance the TNF-α-induced activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9. We found that TNF-α alone had little effect on caspase activation, but nimbolide sensitized the cells to caspase activation (Fig. 2D) and subsequent PARP cleavage (Fig. 2E). Overall, these results indicate that nimbolide significantly increases the apoptotic potential of TNF-α in tumor cells. Although most tumor cells are initially sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, gradually they develop chemoresistance in part because of induction of NF-κB-mediated multidrug resistance. Whether nimbolide can potentiate the apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutic agents was examined. We found that this limonoid potentiated the apoptotic effects of both 5-fluorouracil and thalidomide (Fig. 2B) in KBM-5 cells. These results indicate that nimbolide significantly enhances the apoptotic potential of chemotherapeutic agents. We investigated in detail how nimbolide potentiates the effect of cytokines or chemotherapeutic agents. The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, IAP-1, and IAP-2 are all known to be induced by TNF-α and to play a major role in cell survival. We found that nimbolide down-regulated the expression of all these TNF-α-induced proteins (Fig. 3A). We next examined whether suppression of cell proliferation by nimbolide is due to down-regulation of proteins such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, and COX-2. We found that the limonoid inhibited the expression of all three of these TNF-α-induced proteins (Fig. 3B). MMP-9, by virtue of its ability to degrade the extracellular matrix, has been implicated in cellular invasion (35John A. Tuszynski G. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). ICAM-1, an adhesion molecule, has also been shown to be required for tumor metastasis (36Kobayashi H. Boelte K.C. Lin P.C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007; 14: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and VEGF plays a critical role in angiogenesis by promoting vascular endothelial cell growth and enhancing vascular permeability (37Bose D. Meric-Bernstam F. Hofstetter W. Reardon D.A. Flaherty K.T. Ellis L.M. Lancet Oncol. 2010; 11: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether nimbolide can modulate the expression of these gene products. Our results revealed that nimbolide down-regulated the expression of all these proteins (Fig. 3C). Both IL-6 and TNF-α have been linked with the proliferation of leukemic cells. We investigated whether nimbolide has an effect on the production of IL-6 and TNF-α in U266 cells. The production of IL-6 and TNF-α in U266 cells was suppressed by nimbolide in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). We next examined whether nimbolide can affect tumor cell invasion. As shown in Fig. 3E, TNF-α increased tumor cell invasion by almost 2.4-fold, and pretreating cells with nimbolide suppressed the TNF-α-induced cell invasion. Whether enhancement of apoptosis or down-regulation of anti-apoptotic, proliferative, and metastatic gene products, all require the activation of NF-κB. Therefore, we investigated whether the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB is modulated by nimbolide. We found that TNF-α induces NF-κB activation, whereas nimbolide alone did not. However, pretreatment of cells with nimbolide inhibited the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in a dose- (Fig. 4A) and time-dependent (Fig. 4B) manner. Treatment of cells with 10 μm nimbolide for 4 h was optimal for inhibiting the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation without affecting cell viability. NF-κB is a complex of proteins in which various combinations of Rel or NF-κB proteins constitute active NF-κB heterodimers that bind to a specific DNA sequence. In our study, when nuclear extracts from TNF-α-activated cells were incubated with p50 (NF-κB) or p65 (RelA) antibodies, the resulting bands were shifted to higher molecular masses, suggesting that the TNF-α-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65. Preimmune serum had no effect on DNA binding, and the addition of excess unlabeled NF-κB (cold oligonucleotide; 100-fold excess) caused a decrease in the intensity of the band, whereas the addition of a mutated oligonucleotide had no effect on DNA binding (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the band visualized in TNF-α-treated cells was indeed NF-κB. Numerous agents, including cigarette smoke, OA, PMA, and LPS, are potent activators of NF-κB, but they work by different mechanisms. We determined whether nimbolide affects the NF-κB activation induced by these agents using EMSA. All of these agents activated NF-κB in KBM-5 cells, and nimbolide suppressed this activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that nimbolide acts at a step in the NF-κB activation pathway that is common to all four agents. Human multiple myeloma cells (U266, MM.1S, and RPMI-8226) are known to constitutively express NF-κB. We found that nimbolide inhibited constitutive NF-κB activation in these cells (Fig. 4E), indicating that it can suppress not only inducible but also constitutively active NF-κB in tumor cells. Nimbolide also inhibited constitutive NF-κB in SCC-4 cells (Fig. 4E). We next determined whether the nimbolide-mediated inhibition in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation is cell type-specific. The inhibitory effect of nimbolide on TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was observed not only in KBM-5 cells but also in other leukemic cells (U-937, HL-60, Jurkat, K-562; Fig. 4F) and in MCF-7, H-1299, and A293 cells (Fig. 4G). Some NF-κB inhibitors, such as plumbagin (38Sandur S.K. Ichikawa H. Sethi G. Ahn K.S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17023-17033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (a serine protease inhibitor) (25Ha K.H. Byun M.S. Choi J. Jeong J. Lee K.J. Jue D.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7271-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (39Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke Jr., T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), directly modify NF-κB to suppress its DNA binding. We determined whether nimbolide mediates suppression of NF-κB activation through a similar mechanism using EMSA. Nimbolide did not modify the DNA-binding ability of NF-κB proteins prepared from TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that it inhibits NF-κB activation using a mechanism different from that of plumbagin, l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and caffeic acid phenethyl ester. IκBα is the inhibitory subunit present in the NF-κB complex. The translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic degradation of IκBα. To determine whether the inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was due to suppression of IκBα degradation, we pretreated KBM-5 cells with nimbolide and exposed them to TNF-α for 0–60 min. We then analyzed the D"

Atmospheric CO 2 on Mars was not enriched in 13 C, which implies that volcanic degassing and carbonate formation have been important in the recent past, but it was enriched in 18 O, which suggests that low-temperature water-rock interactions have been dominant on Mars.

https://openalex.org/W2034153554,"Background Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a highly evolutionarily conserved, multi-domain signaling protein that localizes to focal adhesions, myofilaments and centrosomes where it forms distinct multi-protein complexes to regulate cell adhesion, cell contraction, actin cytoskeletal organization and mitotic spindle assembly. Numerous studies have demonstrated that ILK can regulate the phosphorylation of various protein and peptide substrates in vitro, as well as the phosphorylation of potential substrates and various signaling pathways in cultured cell systems. Nevertheless, the ability of ILK to function as a protein kinase has been questioned because of its atypical kinase domain. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we have expressed full-length recombinant ILK, purified it to >94% homogeneity, and characterized its kinase activity. Recombinant ILK readily phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) peptide and the 20-kDa regulatory light chains of myosin (LC20). Phosphorylation kinetics are similar to those of other active kinases, and mutation of the ATP-binding lysine (K220 within subdomain 2) causes marked reduction in enzymatic activity. We show that ILK is a Mn-dependent kinase (the Km for MnATP is ∼150-fold less than that for MgATP). Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data demonstrate that ILK is a bona fide protein kinase with enzyme kinetic properties similar to other active protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2034105640,"Hyperpolarization-activated cAMP-regulated (HCN) channels play important physiological roles in both cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Among the four HCN isoforms, HCN2 and HCN4 show high expression levels in the human heart, with HCN4 being the major cardiac isoform. The previously published crystal structure of the mouse HCN2 (mHCN2) C-terminal fragment, including the C-linker and the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (CNBD), has provided many insights into cAMP-dependent gating in HCN channels. However, structures of other mammalian HCN channel isoforms have been lacking. Here we used a combination of approaches including structural biology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology to study cAMP-dependent gating in HCN4 channel. First we solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal fragment of human HCN4 (hHCN4) channel at 2.4 Å. Overall we observed a high similarity between mHCN2 and hHCN4 crystal structures. Functional comparison between two isoforms revealed that compared with mHCN2, the hHCN4 protein exhibited marked different contributions to channel function, such as a ∼3-fold reduction in the response to cAMP. Guided by structural differences in the loop region between β4 and β5 strands, we identified residues that could partially account for the differences in response to cAMP between mHCN2 and hHCN4 proteins. Moreover, upon cAMP binding, the hHCN4 C-terminal protein exerts a much prolonged effect in channel deactivation that could have significant physiological contributions.

Ion channels form the molecular basis for cell membrane excitability (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Other than under the direct influence of membrane potential changes, ion channels also respond to chemical cues acting from either the extracellular or intracellular side. Cyclic nucleotides, including cAMP and cGMP (together hereafter referred to as cNMP), are important intracellular second messengers. They bind directly to and regulate not only protein kinases like PKA but also transmembrane ion channels. In the superfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels, CNG, HCN, and EAG channels all contain a sequence fragment homologous to other cNMP-binding proteins downstream from the last transmembrane domain (S6) on the intracellular side (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1990; 345: 672Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 4Biel M.

Sci. 1999; 868: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Indeed, both cAMP and cGMP directly bind to and open CNG and HCN channels. CNG channels function mainly in the olfactory and visual sensory systems; they open upon direct cNMP binding but respond weakly to membrane potential changes. On the other hand, HCN channels are mainly voltage-gated and open upon membrane hyperpolarization (6Bell D.C. Yao H. Saenger R.C. Riley J.H. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The opening of HCN channels can be dramatically facilitated upon cNMP binding. cNMP binding shifts the voltage-dependent channel activation curve toward more positive potentials, increasing the macroscopic current amplitude and making the channel activate faster and deactivate slower. Each functional HCN channel is composed of four subunits, and each subunit contains a transmembrane domain, similar to other voltage-gated K+ channels, and a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). 3The abbreviations used are: CNBDcyclic-nucleotide binding domainITCisothermal titration calorimetryFAfluorescence anisotropy. Between the last transmembrane domain S6 and CNBD, there is a 90-amino acid sequence called the C-linker. Previous extensive biophysical studies have provided valuable insights into cAMP-dependent binding and gating for mammalian HCN channels (7Ulens C. Siegelbaum S.A.

This crystal structure contained the C-linker and CNBD, with either cAMP or cGMP bound to the binding pocket. Each CNBD has a very similar fold as other cNMP-binding proteins, containing eight β-strands (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed.

The negatively charged cyclic-phosphate group in cNMP interacts with a highly conserved positively charged arginine residue (Arg591), which has been shown to be critical for cNMP binding in both CNG and HCN channels (11Tibbs G.R.

Through intricate inter-subunit interactions, especially interactions in the C-linker region, four subunits form a tetrameric structure with 4-fold symmetry. Stemmed from the crystal structure of the mouse HCN2 protein, other biophysical studies further enhanced our understanding of ligand binding and gating in HCN channels (12Zhou L. Siegelbaum S.A.

The mammalian HCN channel family contains four homologous members, HCN1, HCN2, HCN3, and HCN4. Among them, HCN2 and HCN4 are the dominant forms expressed in heart. In the human heart, HCN2 shows significant expression in various regions, especially in ventricle (17Gaborit N. Le Bouter S. Szuts V. Varro A. Escande D. Nattel S. Demolombe S. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 675-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Stillitano F. Lonardo G. Zicha S. Varro A. Cerbai E. Mugelli A. Nattel S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2008; 45: 289-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The expression level of HCN4 is much higher, especially in the sinoatrial node, where impulses initiate and propagate throughout the heart. Cardiac automaticity is accomplished through a complicated coordination among different types of ion channels and transporters and involves not only HCN channels but also various calcium, potassium, sodium channels, and sodium-calcium exchangers, etc. (19Mangoni M.E. Nargeot J. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 919-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence support the important roles played by HCN channels in cardiac pacemaking. For example, several clinically approved compounds used for slowing heart rate, such as ivabradine, are rather specific HCN channel blockers (20DiFrancesco D. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2005; 21: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence from transgenic mice, and more importantly, human patients, directly associate HCN channel genes with cardiac automaticity (21Ludwig A. Herrmann S. Hoesl E. Stieber J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Nof E. Antzelevitch C. Glikson M. Pacing Clin. Electrophysiol. 2010; 33: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Currently, it is widely accepted that the HCN channel is one of the major players involved in cardiac physiology; however, the exact role it plays during heart pacemaking and cardiac automaticity is still an open question. To date, five different mutations in the HCN4 channel have been reported in human patients showing sick sinus syndromes. Interestingly, three of these mutations are single-point mutations located in the C-terminal fragment containing the C-linker and CNBD domain (22Nof E. Antzelevitch C. Glikson M. Pacing Clin. Electrophysiol. 2010; 33: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One of these mutations leads to deletion of the C terminus including CNBD (573X) (23Schulze-Bahr E. Neu A. Friederich P. Kaupp U.B. Breithardt G. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), whereas the other two are single amino acid missense mutations, leading to either reduced channel expression (D553N) or compromised channel function (S672R) (24Ueda K. Nakamura K. Hayashi T. Inagaki N. Takahashi M. Arimura T. Morita H. Higashiuesato Y. Hirano Y. Yasunami M. Takishita S. Yamashina A. Ohe T. Sunamori M. Hiraoka M. Kimura A. J. Biol.

Corresponding to the loss-of-function phenotype of these mutant HCN4 channels, patients carrying these mutations show symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias or bradycardia (slower heart rate). Thus, these observations have further underscored the critical roles played by HCN channels and the regulation by cAMP in cardiac physiology. Even though all four HCN channel isoforms share high sequence identity, they respond differently to increases in intracellular cAMP concentration. Indeed, when we replaced the CNBD and C-linker domain of HCN2 with the corresponding ones from HCN4, we observed a marked difference in cAMP-dependent regulation of channel gating from HCN2 controls. We proceeded to crystallize the human HCN4 C-linker and CNBD fragment and solved its structure in complex with cAMP to 2.4-Å resolution. Furthermore, we identified structural differences between hHCN4 and mHCN2 proteins and carried out further studies to investigate the different responses to cAMP between two HCN isoforms. To make a chimera between hHCN4 and mHCN2, we first amplified by PCR the C-linker and CNBD region from hHCN4. Then we cut and inserted this DNA fragment (Asp521-Asn739) into the pGH-mHCN2 vector through restriction sites of pflmI and BsmI. Plasmids encoding HCN channels in the pGH vector were linearized overnight by digestion with SphI and further purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. mMessage machine (Ambion) was used for in vitro cRNA synthesis. 40–50 ng of cRNA was injected into each oocyte at stage IV. After incubating the injected oocyte at 17 °C for 3–5 days, we recorded macroscopic HCN channel currents from membrane patches using the inside-out patch clamp recording configuration. We used the following pipette/bath solution during experiments (in mm): KCl, 107; NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10, pH 7.4, adjusted by KOH. We used EPC9 (a generous gift from Dr. Siegelbaum) for data acquisition, Pulsefit 8.0 for data analysis, and OriginPro 8.0 for graph plotting. A DNA fragment corresponding to residues 521–724 of the human HCN4 channel (hereafter referred to as hHCN4C) was cloned into pSMT3 vector through BamHI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid, pSMT3-hHCN4C, was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Gold (Novagen) cells where hHCN4C was expressed as a Smt3 fusion protein with a N-terminal His tag. This fusion protein was expressed with the autoinduction protocol according to Dr. William Studier (26Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). After induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold 2× PBS, and then lysed with sonication. The following purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The Smt3-hHCN4C fusion protein was first purified on a HisTrap column (buffer A, 2× PBS + 300 mm NaCl; and buffer B, 2× PBS + 400 mm imidazole). After cleaving the Smt3 tag with Ulp1 protease, the protein sample was dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The Smt3 tag was separated from hHCN4C using a HiTrap Q column because Smt3 bound to the Q column, whereas hHCN4C did not. Next we adjusted the pH of the flow- through after a HiTrap Q column to 6.0 with 1 m MES, pH 5.5, and loaded it onto a HiTrap S column. The bound hHCN4C was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (buffer A, 30 mm MES, pH 6.0; and buffer B, 30 mm MES, pH 6.0, + 1 m NaCl), and two well separated peaks, S1 and S2, were observed. Each peak was concentrated separately and further purified with size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (buffer used: 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, + 200 mm NaCl). Finally, the purified protein was concentrated to >10 mg/ml in buffer containing 5 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, and 50 mm NaCl. The pSMT3 vector-Ulp1 protease system was a generous gift from Dr. Chris Lima. All columns used during protein purification were from GE Healthcare. Concentrated protein samples were separated into two pools and dialyzed against buffers containing (in mm) 20 HEPES, 300 NaCl, and 1 DTT, pH 7.2, either with or without 5 mm cAMP. We used an XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman/Coulter) equipped with Rayleith interference optics. Protein samples were loaded at concentrations of 4, 2, or 1 mg/ml and spun sequentially at 12,000, 17,000, and 25,000 rpm at 4 °C. We monitored the progress of equilibrium by taking scans every hour and analyzed the readings using WinMatch. We used WinReed to process the final scans and then globally fit the traces by WinNonLin. We used a three-species model containing monomer, dimer, and tetramer. After obtaining σ from sedimentation equilibrium experiments, we calculated the molecular weight using SEDNTERP software, using the following equation, MW=σ×R×T(1−V¯×ρ)×ω2(Eq. 1) which uses the following parameters: ̄ν, partial specific volume; ρ, solvent density, ω, rotor speed; σ, reduced molecular weight, R, gas constant (8.314 × 107 erg/mol/K), T, temperature. We did cAMP binding assays on purified HCN C-terminal protein samples using two equilibrium methods, ITC and FA. For ITC experiments, we sequentially injected 1.25 mm cAMP into the sample cell containing the protein sample at a concentration of 75 μm at a fixed time interval (iTC200 Microcalorimeter by Microcal). Then we obtained the Kd value by fitting the curve of heat exchange versus protein:cAMP ratio. For FA experiments, we mixed different concentrations of protein samples with a fluorescent cAMP analog (8-Fluo-cAMP from Biolog.de) and used BEACON 2000 to measure the fluorescence anisotropy. We obtained the Kd value from the binding curve of FA versus protein concentration. Crystallization screens were set up at both room temperature and 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The concentrated protein was mixed with the reservoir solution at a 1:1 ratio. hHCN4C crystals were grown at 4 °C using 12% ethanol, sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and 200 mm Li2SO4. Prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, these crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in 12% ethanol, sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 200 mm Li2SO4, and 15% MPD. Two native data sets were collected from a single frozen crystal at the X4C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. One native data set diffracted to 2.4 Å was collected at a detector distance of 175 mm. Due to overloaded reflections, a second data set, a low resolution data set, was collected from the same crystal at a detector distance of 300 mm. These two data sets were indexed, merged, and processed using the HKL2000 (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). This crystal belongs to the I422 space group. Using a previously published mouse HCN2 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1Q43) as search model, we did molecular replacement in PHASER to obtain the phase information (28McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar). Further manual model building was carried out with COOT (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Initial refinement was performed with CNS using iterative cycles of simulated annealing (30Brunger A.T. Nature Protocols. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), and in the final stages of the refinement, we used REFMAC (31Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final refined model has overall good stereochemistry with only one Ramachandran outlier, Ala645, on a loop. We used VMD (32Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27–38): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar) and PYMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC.) for structure presentation. Prompted by the differential distribution of HCN2 and HCN4 isoforms in the heart and the different responses to cAMP, we carried out electrophysiological experiments to analyze the function of the human HCN4 C-terminal fragment and compare it to the corresponding part from mouse HCN2, which had been crystallized and well characterized (10Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). We chose Xenopus oocyte as the expression system and used the inside-out patch-clamp recording configuration to quantify the responses to cAMP. Therefore, we exposed the intracellular side (CNBD) to the bath solution to facilitate the exchange of different concentrations of cAMP. This is advantageous over the whole cell recording configuration on mammalian cells, in which the cAMP concentration is determined by both the pipette solution as well as the intracellular signaling pathways and thus cannot be easily manipulated. However, unlike the mouse HCN2 channel, the full-length human HCN4 channel does not express well in Xenopus oocytes. Therefore, we used the full-length mHCN2 channel as a reference and replaced its C-linker + CNBD fragment with the corresponding region from hHCN4, aiming to directly compare the cAMP-dependent gating machineries between the two isoforms. We named this chimeric channel mHCN2-h4 (Fig. 1A). Inside-out patches from oocytes expressing this construct showed a robust expression of HCN currents of typical characteristics (Fig. 1, B and C). Applying cAMP to the intracellular side significantly facilitated channel gating for both mHCN2 and mHCN2-h4. Based on the amplitude of tail currents recorded at −40 mV, we generated voltage-dependent channel activation curves and then fit the tail current amplitudes with the Boltzmann equation to obtain the V½ value (Fig. 1, D and E). With relatively high concentrations of cAMP applied (10 μm), we measured the maximal shift in V½ as 16.8 ± 0.7 mV (n = 6) for mHCN2 and 14.9 ± 1.3 mV (n = 6) for mHCN2-h4 (Fig. 1F). We further compared the mHCN2 and mHCN2-h4 proteins by applying different concentrations of cAMP and measuring the corresponding ΔV½ (the shift in V½) and then obtained the dose-response curve. Even though we observed a similar maximal shift with saturating concentrations of cAMP, there was a significant difference in K½ or EC50, the apparent affinity or half-maximal effective concentration, between the two channels (Fig. 1F). For mHCN2, the K½ for cAMP to shift the voltage-dependent channel activation curve was 0.08 ± 0.01 μm with a Hill coefficient of 1.25 ± 0.16. However, when the C-linker and CNBD were replaced by corresponding regions from the hHCN4 protein (mHCN2-h4), the K½ was increased by 3-fold to 0.24 ± 0.02 μm with the Hill coefficient of 1.4 ± 0.13. The K½ value measured from this mHCN2-h4 chimera should be close to that of full-length hHCN4 channel, as it was previously shown that the response to cAMP was largely determined by the C terminus, especially the C-linker and CNBD (33Wang J. Chen S. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mHCN2 and hHCN4 channel isoforms share identical sequences in the S4–S5 linker of the transmembrane domain as well as in the first α-helix of the C-linker, all of which have been shown to be important for coupling between ligand binding and channel gating (9Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 34Johnson Jr., J.P. Zagotta W.N.

The above results (Fig. 1) established a difference in the response to cAMP responsiveness between mHCN2 and hHCN4 channels, which is most likely attributed to the C-terminal fragment. Thus, we next pursued structural studies of the hHCN4 C-terminal fragment to discern the structural determinants of its differential cAMP sensitivity compared with the corresponding mHCN2 region. We expressed the hHCN4 C-terminal region containing residues 521 to 724 (hHCN4C) in E. coli. This region includes the C-linker region and the CNBD (Fig. 2). We purified this protein through 3 major steps using a HisTrap affinity column, ion-exchange HiTrap S column, and the size exclusion Superdex 75 column. Interestingly, during elution of the HiTrap S column, we observed two well separated peaks and named them S1 and S2 (Fig. 3A). Both peaks ran at the same position on the SDS-PAGE gel, indicating that they are two populations of the hHCN4C protein (Fig. 3B). We collected S1 and S2 separately and further purified each on size exclusion columns.FIGURE 3Purification and biochemical characterization of the hHCN4C protein. A, elution profile of the hHCN4C protein from the ion-exchange HiTrap S column. Blue trace, UV absorbance (left y axis); red trace, the percentage of buffer B (1 m NaCl, right y axis).

On the size exclusion Superdex 200 column, the elution volumes of S1 and S2 were 16.03 and 15.50 ml, respectively (Fig. 3C, dashed lines; supplemental Fig. S1). This indicates that S1 had a lower apparent molecular weight than S2 and thus probably had a lower oligomerization state than S2. Interestingly, when cAMP was added to the running buffer, both S1 and S2 were both eluted out at similar volumes, about 15 ml (Fig. 3C, solid lines). These results are consistent with previous observations that cAMP binding promotes the formation of tetramers in HCN channels (10Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 38Zhou L. Olivier N.B. Yao H. Young E.C. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 2004; 44: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Corresponding to the differential behavior by size exclusion chromatography, S1 and S2 showed distinct tendencies for oligomerization as revealed by analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation experiments. For the S1 fraction, we observed a significant difference after adding cAMP. After fitting the data, the calculated molecular mass without cAMP for S1 was 28,908 Da, which is close to the expected molecular mass of a monomer (24,105 Da). However, the calculated molecular mass in the presence of cAMP was 55,627 Da, suggesting that the presence of cAMP shifted the equilibrium toward a higher order oligomeric state. In contrast, for the S2 fraction, adding cAMP did not lead to any obvious changes in the analytical ultracentrifugation results. The calculated molecular masses for S2 were 54,778 (with cAMP) or 57,778 Da (without cAMP), respectively, and both values were close to the S1 value in the presence of cAMP. Given these results, we hypothesized that the S1 fraction was most likely the cAMP-free form, whereas the S2 fraction was the cAMP-bound form (bound with endogenous cAMP from E. coli), even with extensive dialysis before loading onto the HiTrap S column. Our hypothesis was confirmed by the following crystallographic studies. We set up crystallization screens for the purified S1 or S2 fractions without adding cAMP, and only obtained crystals for the S2 fraction. However, when we added cAMP to the crystallization drops, we obtained similar crystals for both the S1 and S2 fractions. After optimizing the crystallization and cryoprotection conditions, we collected a native data set at 2.4-Å resolution at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), the Brookhaven National laboratory. The crystals were in an I422 space group with a = 69.264 Å and c = 191.616 Å, with one monomer in each asymmetric unit. Because the sequence identity between hHCN4 and mHCN2 in this region is as high as 94.1%, we used molecular replacement to obtain the phases and then solved the structure. After refinement at 2.4-Å resolution to a Rwork of 23.7% and Rfree of 27.5%, the final model contained residues 521 to 717 with no break in the middle (Table 1). The last 7 residues at the extreme C terminus were too disordered to model. The overall model has good stereochemistry with only one Ramachandran outlier on a loop. As expected, we did observe well defined electron density in the cAMP binding pocket, and more importantly, cAMP could be fitted well in this density (Fig. 4D). Therefore, we concluded that the S2 fraction did contain cAMP in the binding pocket. B"

ACE contains two domains, the N and C domains, both of which are heavily glycosylated. Structural studies of ACE have been fraught with severe difficulties because of surface glycosylation of the protein. In order to investigate the role of glycosylation in the N domain and to create suitable forms for crystallization, we have investigated the importance of the 10 potential N-linked glycan sites using enzymatic deglycosylation, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry. A number of glycosylation mutants were generated via site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in CHO cells, and analyzed for enzymatic activity and thermal stability. At least eight of 10 of the potential glycan sites are glycosylated; three C-terminal sites were sufficient for expression of active N domain, whereas two N-terminal sites are important for its thermal stability. The minimally glycosylated Ndom389 construct was highly suitable for crystallization studies. The structure in the presence of an N domain-selective phosphinic inhibitor RXP407 was determined to 2.0 Å resolution. The Ndom389 structure revealed a hinge region that may contribute to the breathing motion proposed for substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2021617109,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a causative factor of inflammatory bowel diseases. ER stress mediators, including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), are elevated in intestinal epithelia from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. The present study arose from the question of how chemical ER stress and CHOP protein were associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated epithelial inflammatory response. In a human intestinal epithelial cell culture model, chemical ER stresses induced proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and the nuclear translocation of CHOP protein. CHOP was positively involved in ER-activated IL-8 production and was negatively associated with expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). ER stress-induced IL-8 production was enhanced by NF-κB activation that was negatively regulated by PPARγ. Mechanistically, ER stress-induced CHOP suppressed PPARγ transcription by sequestering C/EBPβ and limiting availability of C/EBPβ binding to the PPARγ promoter. Due to the CHOP-mediated regulation of PPARγ action, ER stress can enhance proinflammatory NF-κB activation and maintain an increased level of IL-8 production in human intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, PPARγ was a counteracting regulator of gut inflammatory response through attenuation of NF-κB activation. The collective results support the view that balances between CHOP and PPARγ are crucial for epithelial homeostasis, and disruption of these balances in mucosal ER stress can etiologically affect the progress of human inflammatory bowel diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2046013583,"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, possesses two dithiol glutaredoxins (Grx1 and Grx2). Grx1 occurs in the cytosol and catalyzes protein deglutathionylations with k(cat)/K(m)-values of up to 2 × 10(5) M(-1) S(-1). It accelerates the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase by trypanothione although less efficiently than the parasite tryparedoxin and has low insulin disulfide reductase activity. Despite its classical CPYC active site, Grx1 forms dimeric iron-sulfur complexes with GSH, glutathionylspermidine, or trypanothione as non-protein ligands. Thus, contrary to the generally accepted assumption, replacement of the Pro is not a prerequisite for cluster formation. T. brucei Grx2 shows an unusual CQFC active site, and orthologues occur exclusively in trypanosomatids. Grx2 is enriched in mitoplasts, and fractionated digitonin lysis resulted in a co-elution with cytochrome c, suggesting localization in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Grx2 catalyzes the reduction of insulin disulfide but not of ribonucleotide reductase and exerts deglutathionylation activity 10-fold lower than that of Grx1. RNA interference against Grx2 caused a growth retardation of procyclic cells consistent with an essential role. Grx1 and Grx2 are constitutively expressed with cellular concentrations of about 2 μM and 200 nM, respectively, in both the mammalian bloodstream and insect procyclic forms. Trypanothione reduces the disulfide form of both proteins with apparent rate constants that are 3 orders of magnitude higher than those with glutathione. Grx1 and, less efficiently, also Grx2 catalyze the reduction of GSSG by trypanothione. Thus, the Grxs play exclusive roles in the trypanothione-based thiol redox metabolism of African trypanosomes."

Here, we focused on amino acid sequence motifs that could be involved in Zera oligomerization, leading to PB-like structures in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. By using fusions of Zera with fluorescent proteins, we found that the lack of the repeat region (PPPVHL)8 of Zera resulted in the secretion of the fusion protein but that this repeat by itself did not form PBs. Although the repeat region containing eight units was the most efficient for Zera self-assembly, shorter repeats of 4–6 units still formed small multimers.

Immunoelectron microscopy and confocal studies on PB development over time revealed that early, small, Zera-derived oligomers were sequestered in buds along the rough ER and that the mature size of the PBs could be attained by both cross-linking of preformed multimers and the incorporation of new chains of Zera fusions synthesized by active membrane-bound ribosomes.

Brose N. Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Priming involves the disassembly of cis SNARE complexes and the assembly of loose trans SNARE complexes in advance of fusion triggering (9Klenchin V.A. Martin T.F.

The in vivo pathway for trans SNARE complex assembly is unknown but may involve the zippering of VAMP-2 into syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 heterodimers as suggested from in vitro studies (12Walter A.M. Wiederhold K. Bruns D. Fasshauer D. Sørensen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The assembly of SNARE complexes is catalyzed by essential accessory factors. At intracellular sites of membrane fusion in the secretory pathway, SNARE complex assembly is catalyzed by Sec-1/Munc18 proteins acting in concert with a heterogeneous class of tethering factors that directly bind SNARE proteins (13Shorter J.

FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For regulated vesicle exocytosis, Munc18-1 participates in promoting SNARE complex assembly (15Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) with other accessory proteins. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that proteins in the Munc13/CAPS family function in the priming of vesicles in endocrine and neural cells (8Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CAPS-1 is a multi-domain 1289 residue protein that reconstitutes regulated vesicle exocytosis in permeable neuroendocrine cells (16Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Regions in the C-terminal half of CAPS exhibit homology to a corresponding C-terminal region of Munc13-1 that was reported to bind syntaxin-1 (17Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CAPS contains a central pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (19Grishanin R.N. Kowalchyk J.A. Klenchin V.A. Ann K. Earles C.A. Chapman E.R. Gerona R.R. Martin T.F. Neuron. 2004; 43: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), a lipid that is required for priming in exocytosis (20Hay J.C.

Haucke V. Jahn R. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). CAPS markedly accelerates SNARE-dependent liposome fusion in vitro when PI(4,5)P2 is present in the syntaxin-1/SNAP-25-containing acceptor liposomes, which is dependent on the PH domain (22James D.J. Khodthong C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The stimulation of liposome fusion by CAPS is preceded by the increased assembly of trans SNARE complexes on the liposomes (23James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).A potential mechanism by which CAPS could promote SNARE complex formation would be through direct SNARE protein binding, however the SNARE binding properties of CAPS are unknown. The current work reveals that CAPS binds independently to each of the three SNARE proteins required for vesicle exocytosis. CAPS binds to the SNARE motifs in each of the SNARE proteins and exhibits specificity for a subset of exocytic SNARE protein isoforms. The functional significance of CAPS interactions with the SNARE (plus linker) domain of syntaxin-1 was shown in liposome fusion studies. We suggest that CAPS promotes the priming of vesicle exocytosis by driving trans SNARE complex formation through direct interactions with three SNARE motifs.DISCUSSIONCAPS is essential for optimal Ca2+-triggered vesicle exocytosis where it functions in priming reactions that precede triggered membrane fusion (19Grishanin R.N.

Priming involves the assembly of trans SNARE complexes but the assembly pathway utilized and the accessory factors that catalyze it remain uncertain. CAPS promotes SNARE-dependent liposome fusion in vitro (22James D.J. Khodthong C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23James D.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which may represent priming reactions that proceed into fusion in the absence of downstream regulators such as synaptotagmin and complexin. CAPS stimulates the formation of SNARE complexes that bridge the liposomes (23James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the current work was undertaken to identify direct CAPS interactions with SNARE proteins. The major conclusion from this work is that CAPS binds to each of the SNARE proteins that are required for regulated vesicle exocytosis. The results suggest the possibility that CAPS may promote trans SNARE complex assembly through direct binding interactions with each of the three SNARE proteins. This possibility will need to be tested in future work.General features of vesicle targeting to and fusion with acceptor membranes have been characterized at many trafficking steps in the secretory pathway. The core machinery for vesicle targeting and fusion consists of members from conserved families of Rab, Sec-1/Munc18, and SNARE proteins (40Grosshans B.L. Ortiz D. Novick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11821-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). At many membrane trafficking stations, the initial interaction of vesicles with target membranes is mediated by diverse stage-specific tethering factors or multi-subunit tethering complexes (14Sztul E. Lupashin V. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These tethering complexes are frequently regulated by vesicle Rab proteins and they commonly interact with, or include, Sec-1/Munc18 family members. Some tethering factors that initially link vesicle and target membranes have been shown to directly interact with SNARE proteins and to catalyze trans SNARE complex formation. In ER-Golgi trafficking, Rab1-regulated p115 bridges membranes and promotes trans SNARE complex formation through direct interactions with the Q-SNARE syntaxin-5 and the R-SNARE GOS-28 (13Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). p115 also interacts with other SNARE proteins involved in ER-Golgi trafficking via its SNARE motif-like C-terminal coiled-coil (13Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).For vesicle fusion in the regulated secretory pathway, stage-specific tethering complexes have not been identified. Mechanisms for the attachment of synaptic or dense-core vesicles to the plasma membrane are poorly understood (7Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, CAPS and Munc13 proteins, which are both essential for regulated vesicle exocytosis at a stage following vesicle attachment, may be the functional homologues of the stage-specific tethering factors that prime membrane fusion. Consistent with this, C-terminal domains shared between CAPS and Munc13 proteins were reported to exhibit weak homologies to subunits of several tethering factors (41Pei J. Ma C. Rizo J. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The SNARE protein binding properties of Munc13 proteins have not been fully determined. It was originally proposed that a C-terminal domain of Munc13-1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of syntaxin-1 (17Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but this was not confirmed in biochemical studies (42Basu J. Shen N. Dulubova I. Lu J. Guan R. Guryev O. Grishin N.V. Rosenmund C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1017-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Instead, in direct binding studies, a C-terminal domain of Munc13-1 was found to interact with heterodimeric and heterotrimeric SNARE complexes but interactions with individual SNARE proteins was not evident (45Weninger K. Bowen M.E. Choi U.B. Chu S. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2008; 16: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 48Guan R. Dai H. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1474-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By contrast, the current work revealed direct interactions between CAPS and each of the individual SNARE proteins required for regulated vesicle exocytosis.A novel and important feature of CAPS was revealed in finding that CAPS interacts with the SNARE motifs in the two Q-SNARE proteins. These comprised the H3 SNARE plus linker domain of syntaxin-1 and the SN1 SNARE domain of SNAP-25. High affinity CAPS binding required the membrane-integration or membrane-tethering of these SNARE proteins, whereas only very low affinity interactions occurred with soluble versions of the Q-SNARE proteins. In addition to the structural differences in membrane-integrated SNAREs responsible for this difference (31Ellena J.F. Liang B. Wiktor M. Stein A. Cafiso D.S. Jahn R. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20306-20311Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is likely that CAPS participates in forming a ternary CAPS-SNARE-membrane complex. The sites identified for CAPS binding in syntaxin-1 are membrane-proximal. The linker domain in syntaxin-1 forms part of a continuous helix with the H3 domain (43Stein A. Weber G. Wahl M.C. Jahn R. Nature. 2009; 460: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and residues required for CAPS binding are on the same face of the H3 domain (Lys-252) and linker (Lys-260) close to the membrane. Binding of the SN1 domain of SNAP-25 did not prevent CAPS interactions with syntaxin-1 but rather contributed an additional binding site for CAPS in heterodimeric Q-SNARE complexes (Fig. 4). Liposome fusion promoted by CAPS was previously shown to require SNAP-25 (23James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the current work showed that the C-terminal H3-linker domain of syntaxin-1 is sufficient for CAPS stimulation of fusion (Fig. 2). C-terminal mutations in syntaxin-1 impair CAPS function in fusion (Fig. 3), which is consistent with binding studies that show direct H3-linker binding by CAPS and strong binding competition by α-SNAP. These results for CAPS are different from but complementary to results for Munc18-1 that showed stimulation of SNARE-dependent liposome fusion requiring the N terminus of syntaxin-1 (15Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar).The finding that CAPS interacts with SNARE motifs in both syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 suggests several potential novel mechanisms for how CAPS may participate in SNARE complex formation during priming. Because CAPS can oligomerize (16Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 44Nojiri M. Loyet K.M. Klenchin V.A. Kabachinski G. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18707-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and may utilize a common Qa- and Qb-binding site on each monomer (Fig. 6D), CAPS could function in several ways to regulate the Q-SNARE proteins syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25. CAPS might promote Q-SNARE heterodimer formation through Qa and Qb binding by each monomer in a CAPS oligomer. This is unlikely to be the key rate-limiting step promoted by CAPS because CAPS stimulates SNARE-dependent fusion with proteoliposomes that contain pre-formed Q-SNARE heterodimers (23James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, because the helices in Q-SNARE heterodimers may improperly align in an antiparallel manner, oligomeric CAPS could stabilize parallel-aligned heterodimers as has been suggested for several accessory proteins including Munc13 (45Weninger K. Bowen M.E. Choi U.B. Chu S. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2008; 16: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, by interacting with the membrane-proximal regions of helices on syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 in SNARE heterodimers, CAPS oligomers could function to cluster or organize Q-SNARE heterodimers at fusion sites for optimal insertion of vesicle VAMP-2 (22James D.J. Khodthong C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This possibility could account for the observed ability of CAPS to promote liposome fusion at extremely low Q-SNARE densities (23James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These proposed direct actions of CAPS on Q-SNAREs will need to be explicitly tested.In accord with recent views that Munc18-1 regulates N-terminal domains of syntaxin-1 (15Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 46Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), Munc18-1 failed to compete with CAPS for binding to syntaxin-1 but it unexpectedly enhanced CAPS interactions with syntaxin-1 (Fig. 6F). This finding suggests that Munc18-1 may alter the conformation of syntaxin-1 to enable CAPS binding. Alternatively, CAPS and Munc18-1 might interact so that Munc18-1 binding to syntaxin-1 would provide an additional CAPS binding site. Nonetheless, that both Munc18-1 and CAPS were observed to co-reside on syntaxin-1-containing liposomes (Fig. 6E) is consistent with the assignments of N-terminal and C-terminal binding sites for Munc18-1 and CAPS, respectively. Because our liposome flotation studies of SNARE binding did not achieve complete stoichiometry, we cannot rule out possible binding of Munc18-1 and CAPS to different syntaxin-1-containing liposomes; however, it was clear that there is at least some overlap because Munc18-1 strongly affected CAPS binding (Fig. 6F). Overall, the results indicate that binding sites for Munc18-1 and CAPS on Q-SNARE heterodimers are complementary.CAPS also interacts with the membrane-integrated R-SNARE VAMP-2 (Fig. 7). VAMP-2 is not completely structured in isolation (31Ellena J.F. Liang B. Wiktor M. Stein A. Cafiso D.S. Jahn R. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20306-20311Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and it is unclear whether the reduced affinity and decreased stoichiometry for CAPS binding reflects the partly unfolded state for VAMP-2 on liposomes. CAPS interactions with VAMP-2, unlike those for syntaxin-1 C-terminal domain binding, were with N-terminal domains of VAMP-2 as indicated by the ability of botulinum neurotoxin D to abolish binding. A “zipper” model for heterotrimeric SNARE complex assembly proposes the N- to C-terminal insertion of VAMP-2 into syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 heterodimers (5Fasshauer D. Margittai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7613-7621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Pobbati A.V. Stein A. Fasshauer D. Science. 2006; 313: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This would imply an N-terminal nucleation sequence on VAMP-2 that is initially integrated into the SNARE helix bundle. Through its N-terminal VAMP-2 interactions, CAPS bound to heterodimeric Q-SNARE complexes could be involved in catalyzing the zippering of VAMP-2 into recipient complexes.CAPS is the only protein essential for regulated vesicle exocytosis that has been shown to exhibit direct independent interactions with each of the SNARE proteins required for vesicle fusion. However, recent studies have demonstrated that Munc18-1, in addition to its interactions with Q-SNARE heterodimers (Fig. 6 and Ref. 45Weninger K. Bowen M.E. Choi U.B. Chu S. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2008; 16: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), also interacts with VAMP-2 (47Xu Y. Su L. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The binding site for Munc18-1 on VAMP-2 is C-terminal whereas that for CAPS is N-terminal. Thus, studies on Munc18-1 and CAPS now indicate that their binding sites on Q-SNARE heterodimers and on the R-SNARE VAMP-2 are complementary. This suggests a possible mechanism for priming in which both factors bound to syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 heterodimers play a catalytic role in the insertion of VAMP-2 to form trans SNARE complexes. CAPS and Munc18-1 might act cooperatively with CAPS assisting in the initial nucleation of the N terminus of VAMP-2 into Q-SNARE recipient complexes followed by C-terminal “zippering” assisted by Munc18-1.In summary, we describe for the first time the unique interactions of CAPS with each of the SNARE proteins required for regulated vesicle exocytosis. CAPS binding to Q-SNAREs is mediated by C-terminal, membrane-proximal interactions with two of three SNARE motifs in the heterodimeric complex. By contrast, CAPS binds N-terminal portions of the R-SNARE VAMP-2. These findings provide potential insight into mechanisms by which CAPS could promote trans SNARE complex formation for priming vesicle exocytosis. IntroductionPeptide and neurotransmitter release from endocrine cells and neurons occurs by the regulated exocytic fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (1Malsam J. Kreye S. Söllner T.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2814-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion is mediated by trans complexes of SNARE proteins that bridge the vesicle and plasma membrane to promote close membrane apposition and bilayer mixing (2Weber T. Zemelman B.V.

The SNARE complexes for endocrine and neuronal vesicle fusion consist of parallel bundles of four α-helical SNARE motifs with one helix contributed by the vesicle v-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) 2The abbreviations used are: VAMP-2vesicle-associated membrane protein 2CAPS(aka CADPS)Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretionSNAP-25synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDaα-SNAPα-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteinSPRsurface plasmon resonanceMPB-PE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyramide]NBD-PEN-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamineRh-PEN-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolaminepfprotein-freePCphosphatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserinePI 4,5-P2phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.

Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Based on a central layer residue (arginine or glutamine) and helix position in the SNARE bundle, these proteins are also classified as R-, Qa-, and QbQc-SNAREs, respectively (4Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggested a “zipper” model for the assembly of ternary SNARE complexes involving the pairing of syntaxin-1 (Qa) with SNAP-25 (QbQc) followed by the N- to C-terminal insertion of the R-SNARE VAMP-2 (5Fasshauer D.

Science. 2006; 313: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Vesicle exocytosis is a sequential multi-step process that involves the initial tethering of vesicles to the plasma membrane (7Verhage M. Sørensen J.B. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Only a subset of membrane-attached vesicles rapidly fuse in response to Ca2+ elevations and these are considered to be primed in steps that render the exocytic machinery fusion-competent (8Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Priming involves the disassembly of cis SNARE complexes and the assembly of loose trans SNARE complexes in advance of fusion triggering (9Klenchin V.A. Martin T.F.

The in vivo pathway for trans SNARE complex assembly is unknown but may involve the zippering of VAMP-2 into syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 heterodimers as suggested from in vitro studies (12Walter A.M. Wiederhold K. Bruns D. Fasshauer D. Sørensen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The assembly of SNARE complexes is catalyzed by essential accessory factors. At intracellular sites of membrane fusion in the secretory pathway, SNARE complex assembly is catalyzed by Sec-1/Munc18 proteins acting in concert with a heterogeneous class of tethering factors that directly bind SNARE proteins (13Shorter J.

FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For regulated vesicle exocytosis, Munc18-1 participates in promoting SNARE complex assembly (15Shen J. Tareste D.C.

CAPS-1 is a multi-domain 1289 residue protein that reconstitutes regulated vesicle exocytosis in permeable neuroendocrine cells (16Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.

CAPS markedly accelerates SNARE-dependent liposome fusion in vitro when PI(4,5)P2 is present in the syntaxin-1/SNAP-25-containing acceptor liposomes, which is dependent on the PH domain (22James D.J. Khodthong C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The stimulation of liposome fusion by CAPS is preceded by the increased assembly of trans SNARE complexes on the liposomes (23James D.J. Kowalchyk J. Daily N. Petrie M. Martin T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).A potential mechanism by which CAPS could promote SNARE complex formation would be through direct SNARE protein binding, however the SNARE binding properties of CAPS are unknown. The current work reveals that CAPS binds independently to each of the three SNARE proteins required for vesicle exocytosis. CAPS binds to the SNARE motifs in each of the SNARE proteins and exhibits specificity for a subset of exocytic SNARE protein isoforms. The functional significance of CAPS interactions with the SNARE (plus linker) domain of syntaxin-1 was shown in liposome fusion studies. We suggest that CAPS promotes the priming of vesicle exocytosis by driving trans SNARE complex formation through direct interactions with three SNARE motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1970452627,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) plays an essential role in the toxic response to environmental pollutants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin (dioxin), in the adaptive up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and in hepatic vascular development. In our model of AHR signaling, the receptor is found in a cytosolic complex with a number of molecular chaperones, including Hsp90, p23, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP), also known as ARA9 and XAP2. To understand the role of AIP in adaptive and toxic aspects of AHR signaling, we generated a conditional mouse model where the <i>Aip</i> locus can be deleted in hepatocytes. Using this model, we demonstrate two important roles for the AIP protein in AHR biology. (i) The expression of AIP in hepatocytes is essential to maintain high levels of functional cytosolic AHR protein in the mammalian liver. (ii) Expression of the AIP protein is essential for dioxin-induced hepatotoxicity. Interestingly, classical AHR-driven genes show differential dependence on AIP expression. The Cyp1b1 and Ahrr genes require AIP expression for normal up-regulation by dioxin, whereas <i>Cyp1a1</i> and <i>Cyp1a2</i> do not. This differential dependence on AIP provides evidence that the mammalian genome contains more than one class of AHR-responsive genes and suggests that a search for AIP-dependent, AHR-responsive genes may guide us to the targets of the dioxin-induced hepatotoxicity."

Unfortunately, many molecules bind rather tightly, impairing reuse of such sensors. Salehi-Khojin et al. (p. 1327 ) showed that one solution to this problem was to run a strong current through the nanotubes after the detection event, which induced desorption of organic molecules. By comparison, thermal (as opposed to current-driven) desorption required heating to temperatures that irreparably degraded the sensor structure."
https://openalex.org/W2048195083,"The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a key player in multiple chromatin transactions. Core subunits of this complex, including the ATPase, Brg-1, and various Brg-1-associated factors (BAFs), work in concert to maintain a functional remodeling complex. This intra-complex regulation is supervised by protein-protein interactions, as stoichiometric levels of BAF proteins are maintained by proteasomal degradation. We show that the mechanism of BAF155-mediated stabilization of BAF57 involves blocking its ubiquitination by preventing interaction with TRIP12, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, as opposed to complexed BAF57, whose principal lysines are unavailable for ubiquitination, uncomplexed BAF57 can be freely ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Additionally, a BAF57 mutant, which contains no lysine residues, was found to retain its ability to be stabilized by interaction with BAF155, suggesting that in addition to the ubiquitin-dependent mechanism of BAF57 degradation, there exists a ubiquitin-independent mechanism that may involve the direct interaction of BAF57 with the proteasome. We propose that this regulatory mechanism exists to ensure functional fidelity of the complex and prevent the accumulation of uncomplexed proteins, which may disrupt the normal activity of the complex.

IntroductionMammalian DNA is packaged into chromatin with the help of nucleosomes as a means to regulate transcription, replication, DNA repair, and recombination, all highly dynamic processes (1Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). When compacted into chromatin, genes are often inactive due in part to the inability of the cell transcription machinery to gain access to regulatory regions (1Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). This access and subsequent gene activation is achieved partly with the help of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (2Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 265–266: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a large multiprotein machine that functions to decondense or loosen DNA, which is tightly wrapped around nucleosomes. The major catalytic component of the complex can be either Brg-1 or Brm, both ATPases that use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to expose gene promoters (3Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). By doing so, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have the ability to regulate transcription and, thus, control the vast majority of cellular processes. To obtain full functionality, however, the SWI/SNF complex requires the presence of Brg-1-associated factors or BAFs. 2The abbreviations used are: BAFBrg-1-associated factorTRIP12thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 12LMOLIM-onlySSBPsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinGRglucocorticoid receptorESIelectrospray ionizationUbubiquitinNLSnuclear localization signalCLIMcofactor of LIM-HD proteinRLIMRING finger LIM domain-binding protein. At least 10 BAFs exist, including but not limited to BAF47, BAF53, BAF57, BAF60, BAF155, BAF170, BAF180, BAF200, and BAF250 (4Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). These BAFs are present in different combinations depending on the specific complex(es) of which they are a part (5Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 6Ho L. Crabtree G.R.

Immunol. 2003; 274: 143-169PubMed Google Scholar).Although the functions of all the BAFs have not been fully elucidated, a number of specific roles/functions have been proposed. BAF47 is a known interacting partner with ALL-1 via it's SET domain (8Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Rozovskaia T. Burakov D. Sedkov Y. Tillib S. Blechman J. Nakamura T. Croce C.M. Mazo A. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4152-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). BAF53 is a known c-Myc-interacting nuclear cofactor and forms into complexes with histone acetyltransferase activity (9Park J. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). BAF57 interacts with estrogen receptor α (10Belandia B. Orford R.L. Hurst H.C. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4094-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and androgen receptor (11Link K.A. Burd C.J. Williams E. Marshall T. Rosson G. Henry E. Weissman B. Knudsen K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2200-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) to recruit the SWI/SNF complex. BAF60a mediates the interaction between GR and the SWI/SNF complex (12Hsiao P.W. Fryer C.J. Trotter K.W. Wang W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6210-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and also interacts with p53 to recruit the SWI/SNF complex (13Oh J. Sohn D.H. Ko M. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11924-11934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, although BAF155/BAF170 have not been shown to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes or be involved in SWI/SNF complex recruitment, they have been implicated as scaffolding proteins for the complex and have been shown to regulate the expression levels of other BAFs (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of BAF155 and BAF57, it was observed that that BAF155 interacts with and stabilizes BAF57 (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was revealed that BAF57 is regulated at the level of the proteasome and that either inhibiting the proteasome or expressing BAF155 resulted in an increase in BAF57 (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The importance of BAF155 in SWI/SNF subunit regulation was further defined, as it was demonstrated that SRG3, the murine homolog of BAF155, also interacts with and stabilizes BAF47, BAF60a, and Brg-1 (15Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Because the SWI/SNF complex functions in the regulation and fidelity of such tightly controlled cellular processes such as growth, development, mitosis, cell cycle control, differentiation, hormonal response, apoptosis, retroviral infection, and carcinogenesis (16Simone C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Iba H. Mizutani T. Ito T. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Klochendler-Yeivin A. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), understanding the regulation and fidelity of the SWI/SNF complex itself is of the utmost importance. Given the diverse components and proposed roles for the complex, the understanding of SWI/SNF subunit stoichiometry may be central to understanding the control of the complex.Although it is clear that BAF155 plays a role in SWI/SNF complex stoichiometry, to what extent and the mechanism(s) by which it is achieved are not fully understood. Biochemical analyses suggest that the presence of free unbound SWI/SNF complex subunits is unlikely (4Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 20Doan D.N. Veal T.M. Yan Z. Wang W. Jones S.N. Imbalzano A.N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3462-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the cell exercises cellular mechanisms by which protein subunit expression and/or degradation are controlled. Indeed, stable cell lines overexpressing BAF57 mutants actually down-regulate the endogenous BAF57 protein levels in the cell such that the total amount of cellular BAF57 remained the same as in parental cells (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In this report we set out to evaluate the mechanism(s) by which BAF155 regulates the stoichiometry of BAF57. We find that BAF155 stabilizes free and uncomplexed BAF57 by binding to it and blocking the extent to which it is ubiquitinated. In addition, we show that mutating the lysine residues within BAF57 stabilizes the protein in the absence of BAF155. Finally we propose TRIP12 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of BAF57 and demonstrate that BAF155 blocks the interaction between BAF57 and TRIP12. These results provide a mechanism describing how the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex maintains its subunit stoichiometry within the cell.DISCUSSIONThe supervision of SWI/SNF complex stoichiometry remains a relatively ill-defined process, and the regulation of SWI/SNF subunits within the cell has the potential to influence the precise control of many cellular processes. Multiple instances exist in which the strict expression levels of certain BAFs are altered in various cancers. Full-length wild-type BAF57 has been found to be reduced or lost in certain breast cancer cell lines such as BT549 cells (22Decristofaro M.F. Betz B.L. Rorie C.J. Reisman D.N. Wang W. Weissman B.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). BAF57 has also been found to be elevated in a subset of prostate cancers (23Link K.A. Balasubramaniam S. Sharma A. Comstock C.E. Godoy-Tundidor S. Powers N. Cao K.H. Haelens A. Claessens F. Revelo M.P. Knudsen K.E. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4551-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human ovarian (SKOV3) and colorectal (SNUC2B) carcinomas are null for BAF155 expression (24Delbove J.N. Knudsen E.S. Strobeck M.W. Weissman B.E. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2005; 46 (Abstr. 1956)Google Scholar). BAF47, now classified as a tumor suppressor, is mutated or truncated in a number of cancers including malignant rhabdoid tumors, choroid plexus carcinomas, medulloblastomas, and central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (25Roberts C.W.

Nature. 1998; 394: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse model deletions of BAF47 and Brg-1 are embryonic lethal (31Klochendler-Yeivin A. Fiette L. Barra J. Muchardt C. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 32Guidi C.J. Sands A.T. Zambrowicz B.P. Turner T.K. Demers D.A. Webster W. Smith T.W.

Chambon P. Crabtree G. Magnuson T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1287-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, in which complex subunit stoichiometry is changed, the endogenous functions of the SWI/SNF complex may be altered. By elucidating the mechanisms by which the stoichiometry of these proteins is regulated, we may be able to better understand the pathways that lead to cancer and perhaps other disease states upon their misregulation.In this report we examined the mechanism by which BAF155 stabilizes and maintains the stoichiometry of BAF57. This effect, however, in not limited to BAF57, as SRG3, a murine homolog of BAF155, interacts with and stabilizes BAF47, BAF60a, and Brg-1 (15Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have also verified that the same stabilization is seen with BAF155 and these SWI/SNF complex members (supplemental Fig. 1). Correspondingly, siRNA knockdown of BAF155 and BAF170 leads to decreased protein expression of BAF47, BAF60a, and Brg-1 (supplemental Fig. 2). These results suggest that BAF155 possesses a significant and critical role in maintaining the integrity and balance of this chromatin remodeling complex.We hypothesized that because previous reports determined that excess BAF57 was degraded by the proteasome (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), that BAF155 stabilizes BAF57 by blocking its ubiquitination. We also tested the ability of BAF155 to block the ubiquitination of Brg-1, as this core SWI/SNF complex member has also been shown to be stabilized by BAF155. Interestingly, we found that the ubiquitination of Brg-1 was also diminished in the presence of BAF155 (supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that this may be a general mechanism functioning to maintain the stoichiometry of the SWI/SNF complex.If in fact BAF57 ubiquitination levels are regulated by BAF155, we postulated that mutating specific lysines within BAF57 would stabilize the protein in the absence of BAF155. As predicted, we observed an increase in the stability of the BAF57 protein as lysine residues were removed (Fig. 3B), presumably due to the loss of ubiquitinated lysines that would target the protein for degradation. Accordingly, the extent to which BAF155 can further stabilize these BAF57 mutants is diminished with the conversion to arginines (Fig. 3C). A ubiquitination assay using these BAF57 lysine-to-arginine mutants provided additional confirmation of this model (Fig. 4). Thus, in the absence of BAF155, BAF57 is ubiquitinated in a lysine-dependent manner.Given that free, uncomplexed BAF57 is degraded by the proteasome via an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, we wanted to determine whether this was the only mechanism by which the protein is degraded. Some cellular proteins, whose cellular stoichiometry is also vital to their proper functioning, have been found to be degraded by ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent mechanisms (34Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 36Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). One such example is p53. p53 is degraded not only by ubiquitination but also by the 20 S proteasome in an ubiquitin-independent manner (34Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 has also been shown to be regulated by ubiquitination-dependent and -independent pathways as it was found to interact directly with the C8 α-subunit of the 20 S proteasome (36Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To determine whether similar dual mechanisms of degradation exist for BAF57, we constructed BAF57aa190–366 K→R, a BAF57 truncation mutant that contains no lysine residues (Fig. 5B). We also made BAF57aa190–366 WT, the same fragment but with the WT BAF57 sequence, which does contain lysines. As both the WT and mutant fragments were still stabilized by BAF155 (Fig. 5C), it is clear that both fragments are still very unstable as free entities. These results support the existence of a secondary, ubiquitin-independent degradation pathway for BAF57. Importantly, the WT version of this fragment is stabilized to a greater degree than the mutant version. This result is not unexpected, as BAF155 stabilizes the WT version by blocking both the ubiquitin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of BAF57 degradation, whereas the mutant version is only stabilized by the ubiquitin-independent mechanism upon BAF155 addition.However, is this ubiquitin-independent mechanism of degradation dependent on the proteasome? To answer this question, MG132 and epoxomicin time courses were performed on the BAF57aa190–366 K→R fragment, which revealed that the proteasome was in fact still involved in its degradation (Fig. 6C). One potential explanation for this result could be that BAF57, like p53 and p21, is also degraded via an indirect or direct interaction with the proteasome. Furthermore, the fact that the addition of BAF155 to the cycloheximide time course for BAF57aa190–366 K→R stabilized the protein and lengthened its half-life suggests that the protein retains sufficient native structure to bind BAF155 (Fig. 6C).TRIP12 (thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 12) is a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and a nuclear receptor co-regulator that interacts with the ligand binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor and with retinoid X receptor. We identified TRIP12 in an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiment as a BAF57-interacting protein. When BAF57 is alone, it co-immunoprecipitates with TRIP12; however, in the presence of BAF155, BAF57 and BAF155 interact and the BAF57-TRIP12 interaction is lost (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, in the presence of reduced levels of TRIP12, there is a concurrent stabilization of BAF57 supporting the proposal that TRIP12 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitinating BAF57 (Fig. 7B). Relatively little is known about TRIP12, although one ubiquitination pathway substrate has been identified when TRIP12 was shown to interact with the NEDD8 pathway-activating enzyme subunit APP-BP1 (37Park Y. Yoon S.K. Yoon J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 374: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRIP12 will only interact with free APP-BP1 monomer but not when APP-BP1 heterodimerizes with Uba3 (37Park Y. Yoon S.K. Yoon J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 374: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This mechanism is analogous to what we see for the relationship between TRIP12, BAF57, and BAF155.An intriguing possibility is that TRIP12 could be a component of a putative protein quality control system for BAF57, the entire SWI/SNF complex, or more broadly for multiprotein complexes in general. Protein quality control systems, particularly for nuclear proteins, have been found to exist in both yeast (38Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (39Iwata A. Nagashima Y. Matsumoto L. Suzuki T. Yamanaka T. Date H. Deoka K. Nukina N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9796-9803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In yeast, San1p, a ubiquitin ligase targets specific aberrant, misfolded, or mutant proteins to the proteasome while leaving wild-type versions of the same proteins alone (38Gardner R.G. Nelson Z.W. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2005; 120: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells the ubiquitin ligase UHRF-2 rids the cell of cytotoxic polyglutamine aggregates via proteasomal degradation (39Iwata A. Nagashima Y. Matsumoto L. Suzuki T. Yamanaka T. Date H. Deoka K. Nukina N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9796-9803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both of these ubiquitin ligases represent key components of their respective nuclear protein quality control machinery. Consequently TRIP12 could qualify as the principal ubiquitin ligase in a protein quality control system that regulates BAF57 stoichiometry and thereby controls SWI/SNF transcriptional fidelity.This type of mechanism to maintain protein stoichiometry in a multiprotein complex is unlikely to be unique to the SWI/SNF complex. For example, LIM homeodomain transcription factor-containing complexes can be biologically activated or repressed depending on the cofactors with which it interacts (40Ostendorff H.P. Peirano R.I. Peters M.A. Schlüter A. Bossenz M. Scheffner M. Bach I. Nature. 2002; 416: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Association with CLIM cofactors allows for transcriptional activation, whereas association with RLIM inhibits the transcription factor function. LIM-only (LMO) proteins also negatively regulate LIM homeodomain activity by competing for CLIM cofactors. The overall control of this multifunctional, multisubunit complex is regulated by RLIM, which is a RING H2 zinc finger ubiquitin ligase (40Ostendorff H.P. Peirano R.I. Peters M.A. Schlüter A. Bossenz M. Scheffner M. Bach I. Nature. 2002; 416: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). RLIM ubiquitinates both CLIM cofactors and LMO proteins (LMO2 and LMO4), thus targeting them to the 26 S proteasome for degradation (40Ostendorff H.P. Peirano R.I. Peters M.A. Schlüter A. Bossenz M. Scheffner M. Bach I. Nature. 2002; 416: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These events of cofactor exchange, mediated by the activity of RLIM, represent a tightly controlled mechanism of transcriptional regulation.The stoichiometry of various proteins in these LIM protein complexes has also been found to be regulated by other cellular factors. The basic helix-loop-helix factor SCL, for example, interacts with LMO2 and functions in the transcriptional control of hematopoiesis (41Lécuyer E. Larivière S. Sincennes M.C. Haman A. Lahlil R. Todorova M. Tremblay M. Wilkes B.C. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33649-33658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By doing so, SCL protects LMO2 from proteasomal degradation mediated by RLIM. This protein-protein interaction, therefore, regulates the protein levels of LMO2 so as to maintain proper SCL/LMO2 stoichiometry and, thus, elicit the desired transcriptional response (41Lécuyer E. Larivière S. Sincennes M.C. Haman A. Lahlil R. Todorova M. Tremblay M. Wilkes B.C. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33649-33658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBPs) have also been found to regulate the stoichiometry of LIM complex members (42Xu Z. Meng X. Cai Y. Liang H. Nagarajan L. Brandt S.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 942-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Specifically, SSBP2, a member of an erythroid DNA binding complex, increases the endogenous protein levels of LMO2 and the LIM domain-binding protein Ldb1 by inhibiting their interaction with RLIM and, thus, preventing them from being ubiquitinated and degraded (42Xu Z. Meng X. Cai Y. Liang H. Nagarajan L. Brandt S.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 942-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is believed that the cellular protein level of SSBP2 is so important that an increase or decrease in its expression would alter the stoichiometry of LMO2 and Ldb1 such that tumorigenesis may ensue (42Xu Z. Meng X. Cai Y. Liang H. Nagarajan L. Brandt S.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 942-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).An additional example involves p53 stoichiometry, which has also been shown to be regulated by protein-protein interactions. TAF(II)31, a coactivator protein, has been shown to bind to p53 at the same region required for its interaction with its E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (43Buschmann T. Lin Y. Aithmitti N. Fuchs S.Y. Lu H. Resnick-Silverman L. Manfredi J.J. Ronai Z. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13852-13857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The TAF(II)31-p53 interaction, therefore, inhibits MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, increases p53 protein levels, and activates p53-mediated transcription (43Buschmann T. Lin Y. Aithmitti N. Fuchs S.Y. Lu H. Resnick-Silverman L. Manfredi J.J. Ronai Z. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13852-13857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, multiprotein complexes, which employ precise protein-protein interactions and exercise this mechanism of regulated protein degradation, may be broadly employed.Taken together, these data suggest that BAF155 plays a significant scaffolding role within the SWI/SNF complex and is a major determinant in maintaining subunit stoichiometry. Thus, when within an intact SWI/SNF complex, the individual subunits are all protected from degradation. However, any free core subunit not protected within a SWI/SNF complex will be disposed of by the proteasome (Fig. 8). This cellular mechanism may prevent the accumulation of free BAF57, which could induce dominant negative effects. For example, BAF57 interacts with nuclear hormone receptors and is believed to interact directly with DNA, possibly at promoters (10Belandia B. Orford R.L. Hurst H.C. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4094-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 12Hsiao P.W. Fryer C.J. Trotter K.W. Wang W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6210-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). If an excess of BAF57 exists within the cell, then uncomplexed BAF57 would, therefore, prevent fully complemented SWI/SNF complexes from accessing its targets. In certain cancers, therefore, when one of these complex members is lost, this intra-complex self-stabilization would be disrupted, thus hampering the complex remodeling ability to mediate transcriptional regulation. A comprehensive understanding of this regulatory mechanism within multiprotein complexes will help to elucidate the relationships between transcriptional mis-regulation and may have a profound impact on our understanding of disease pathogeneses. IntroductionMammalian DNA is packaged into chromatin with the help of nucleosomes as a means to regulate transcription, replication, DNA repair, and recombination, all highly dynamic processes (1Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). When compacted into chromatin, genes are often inactive due in part to the inability of the cell transcription machinery to gain access to regulatory regions (1Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). This access and subsequent gene activation is achieved partly with the help of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (2Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 265–266: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a large multiprotein machine that functions to decondense or loosen DNA, which is tightly wrapped around nucleosomes. The major catalytic component of the complex can be either Brg-1 or Brm, both ATPases that use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to expose gene promoters (3Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). By doing so, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have the ability to regulate transcription and, thus, control the vast majority of cellular processes. To obtain full functionality, however, the SWI/SNF complex requires the presence of Brg-1-associated factors or BAFs. 2The abbreviations used are: BAFBrg-1-associated factorTRIP12thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 12LMOLIM-onlySSBPsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinGRglucocorticoid receptorESIelectrospray ionizationUbubiquitinNLSnuclear localization signalCLIMcofactor of LIM-HD proteinRLIMRING finger LIM domain-binding protein. At least 10 BAFs exist, including but not limited to BAF47, BAF53, BAF57, BAF60, BAF155, BAF170, BAF180, BAF200, and BAF250 (4Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). These BAFs are present in different combinations depending on the specific complex(es) of which they are a part (5Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 6Ho L. Crabtree G.R.

Immunol. 2003; 274: 143-169PubMed Google Scholar).Although the functions of all the BAFs have not been fully elucidated, a number of specific roles/functions have been proposed. BAF47 is a known interacting partner with ALL-1 via it's SET domain (8Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Rozovskaia T. Burakov D. Sedkov Y. Tillib S. Blechman J. Nakamura T. Croce C.M. Mazo A. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4152-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). BAF53 is a known c-Myc-interacting nuclear cofactor and forms into complexes with histone acetyltransferase activity (9Park J. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). BAF57 interacts with estrogen receptor α (10Belandia B. Orford R.L. Hurst H.C. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4094-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and androgen receptor (11Link K.A. Burd C.J. Williams E. Marshall T. Rosson G. Henry E. Weissman B. Knudsen K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2200-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) to recruit the SWI/SNF complex. BAF60a mediates the interaction between GR and the SWI/SNF complex (12Hsiao P.W. Fryer C.J. Trotter K.W. Wang W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6210-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and also interacts with p53 to recruit the SWI/SNF complex (13Oh J. Sohn D.H. Ko M. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11924-11934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, although BAF155/BAF170 have not been shown to interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes or be involved in SWI/SNF complex recruitment, they have been implicated as scaffolding proteins for the complex and have been shown to regulate the expression levels of other BAFs (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of BAF155 and BAF57, it was observed that that BAF155 interacts with and stabilizes BAF57 (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was revealed that BAF57 is regulated at the level of the proteasome and that either inhibiting the proteasome or expressing BAF155 resulted in an increase in BAF57 (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The importance of BAF155 in SWI/SNF subunit regulation was further defined, as it was demonstrated that SRG3, the murine homolog of BAF155, also interacts with and stabilizes BAF47, BAF60a, and Brg-1 (15Sohn D.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Because the SWI/SNF complex functions in the regulation and fidelity of such tightly controlled cellular processes such as growth, development, mitosis, cell cycle control, differentiation, hormonal response, apoptosis, retroviral infection, and carcinogenesis (16Simone C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Iba H. Mizutani T. Ito T. Rev. Med.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), understanding the regulation and fidelity of the SWI/SNF complex itself is of the utmost importance. Given the diverse components and proposed roles for the complex, the understanding of SWI/SNF subunit stoichiometry may be central to understanding the control of the complex.Although it is clear that BAF155 plays a role in SWI/SNF complex stoichiometry, to what extent and the mechanism(s) by which it is achieved are not fully understood. Biochemical analyses suggest that the presence of free unbound SWI/SNF complex subunits is unlikely (4Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 20Doan D.N. Veal T.M. Yan Z. Wang W. Jones S.N. Imbalzano A.N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3462-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the cell exercises cellular mechanisms by which protein subunit expression and/or degradation are controlled. Indeed, stable cell lines overexpressing BAF57 mutants actually down-regulate the endogenous BAF57 protein levels in the cell such that the total amount of cellular BAF57 remained the same as in parental cells (14Chen J. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9016-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In this report we set out to evaluate the mechanism(s) by which BAF155 regulates the stoichiometry of BAF57. We find that BAF155 stabilizes free and uncomplexed BAF57 by binding to it and blocking the extent to which it is ubiquitinated. In addition, we show that mutating the lysine residues within BAF57 stabilizes the protein in the absence of BAF155. Finally we propose TRIP12 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of BAF57 and demonstrate that BAF155 blocks the interaction between BAF57 and TRIP12. These results provide a mechanism describing how the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex maintains its subunit stoichiometry within the cell."

Membrane-bound receptors and enzymes are sensitive to their phospholipid microenvironment. Amphipathic indomethacin could therefore potentially modulate cell signaling by changing membrane properties. Here we examined the effect of indomethacin on membrane lateral heterogeneity. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of cells expressing lipid-anchored probes revealed that treatment of BHK cells with therapeutic levels of indomethacin enhances cholesterol-dependent nanoclustering, but not cholesterol-independent nanoclustering. Immuno-electron microscopy and quantitative spatial mapping of intact plasma membrane sheets similarly showed a selective effect of indomethacin on promoting cholesterol-dependent, but not cholesterol-independent, nanoclustering. To further evaluate the biophysical effects of indomethacin, we measured fluorescence polarization of the phase-sensitive probe Laurdan and FRET between phase-partitioning probes in model bilayers. Therapeutic levels of indomethacin enhanced phase separation in DPPC/DOPC/Chol (1:1:1) and DPPC/Chol membranes in a temperature-dependent manner, but had minimal effect on the phase behavior of pure DOPC at any temperature. Taken together, the imaging results on intact epithelial cells and the biophysical assays of model membranes suggest that indomethacin can enhance phase separation and stabilize cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters in biological membranes. These effects on membrane lateral heterogeneity may have significant consequences for cell signaling cascades that are assembled on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1980145801,"Lamin B is a component of the membranous spindle matrix isolated from Xenopus egg extracts, and it is required for proper spindle morphogenesis. Besides lamin B, the spindle matrix contains spindle assembly factors (SAFs) such as Eg5 and dynein which are known to regulate microtubule organization and SAFs known to promote microtubule assembly such as Maskin and XMAP215. Because lamin B does not bind directly to microtubules, it must affect spindle morphogenesis indirectly by influencing the function of spindle matrix-associated SAFs. Using different assays in Xenopus egg extracts, we found that depleting lamin B caused formation of elongated and multipolar spindles, which could be reversed by partially inhibiting the kinesin Eg5, revealing an antagonistic relationship between Eg5 and lamin B. However, lamin B only very weakly antagonizes Eg5 in mediating poleward microtubule-flux based on fluorescence speckle microscopy. Depleting lamin B led to a very small but statistically significant increase in flux. Furthermore, flux reduction caused by partial Eg5 inhibition is only slightly reversed by removing lamin B. Because lamin B does not bind to Eg5, our studies suggest two nonexclusive mechanisms by which lamin B can indirectly antagonize Eg5. It could function in a network that restricts Eg5-driven microtubule sliding only when microtubules come into transient contact with the network. Lamin B could also function to sequester microtubule polymerization activities within the spindle. Without lamin B, increased microtubule assembly caused by the released SAFs would lead to excessive microtubule sliding that results in formation of elongated and multipolar spindles.

Although such force balancing could theoretically be achieved by antagonizing motor forces exerted on MTs, the precision required makes it unlikely (1Mogilner A. Wollman R. Civelekoglu-Scholey G.

However, the mechanism by which the spindle matrix regulates force balancing and spindle morphogenesis remains unclear. microtubule Aurora A magnetic beads coated with the mitotic kinase AurA Xenopus lamin B3 COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 383–583) of Xenopus lamin B3 RanGTPase bound to GTP spindle assembly factor. Among the spindle matrix components identified thus far, lamin B is a conserved structural protein of the type V intermediate filaments (11Herrmann H. Bär H. Kreplak L. Strelkov S.V. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In interphase, the lamin B intermediate filaments represent the major structural component of the nuclear lamina found beneath the nuclear envelope (12Dechat T. Pfleghaar K. Sengupta K. Shimi T. Shumaker D.K. Solimando L. Goldman R.D. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 832-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Similar to other intermediate filaments, nuclear lamins do not actively produce force, but, together with chromatin, lamins can bear loads exerted on nuclear envelopes by both actin and MTs and enable the nucleus to maintain its shape and integrity (13Dahl K.N. Kahn S.M. Wilson K.L. Discher D.E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4779-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 14Dahl K.N. Scaffidi P. Islam M.F. Yodh A.G. Wilson K.L. Misteli T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Analogous to its role in the interphase nucleus, insoluble mitotic lamin B in the membranous spindle matrix that surrounds spindle MTs could function to limit motor-driven MT movement and help maintain spindle shape (15Zheng Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, both the insoluble and soluble mitotic lamin B might sequester SAFs to inhibit their activity within the spindle. Consistent with the idea that lamin B regulates spindle morphology, we have shown that reduction of lamin B in either Xenopus egg extracts or in HeLa cells results in formation of spindles with defective morphology (10Tsai M.Y.

Recent studies of spindle morphogenesis in Drosophila early embryos, which undergo partially open mitosis with incomplete breakdown of nuclear envelope and lamina, have revealed that lamin B exists in an envelope that surrounds prometaphase and metaphase spindles. Either hyperstabilizing or disrupting lamin B in the envelope disrupted spindle length maintenance. Additional studies suggest that the lamin B spindle envelope functions as an elastic spring that helps to increase the robustness of motor balancing in the spindle to stabilize the spindle length (2Civelekoglu-Scholey G. Tao L. Brust-Mascher I. Wollman R. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, how the lamin B spindle envelope regulates motor balance and whether the lamin B spindle envelope could affect the motor-driven poleward microtubule flux is unknown. Unlike the partially open mitosis in Drosophila early embryos, vertebrate mitosis is accompanied by a complete breakdown of nuclear envelope and lamina in prometaphase. Lamin B distributes into both a soluble pool and a membrane-associate fraction in the mitotic cytosol (18Lourim D. Krohne G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3675-3686PubMed Google Scholar, 19Adam S.A.

In Xenopus egg extracts, a fraction of lamin B3 (LB3), the major lamin B form in this system (20Lourim D. Kempf A. Krohne G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1775-1785PubMed Google Scholar), is recruited onto MTs and becomes further organized into a membranous network that associates with and surrounds the meiotic spindle (10Tsai M.Y.

LB3 does not directly bind to MTs, yet the isolated LB3 spindle matrix contains a number of SAFs including Eg5, dynein, XMAP215, and Maskin. This suggests that LB3 might affect spindle assembly by influencing the activities of spindle matrix-associated SAFs. Eg5 is a plus end-directed motor known to slide MTs that drive bipolar spindle assembly and spindle elongation in Xenopus egg extracts. Eg5-mediated MT sliding also drives poleward MT flux in spindles assembled in Xenopus egg extracts (21Miyamoto D.T. Perlman Z.E. Burbank K.S. Groen A.C. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Yang G. Cameron L.A. Maddox P.S. Salmon E.D. Danuser G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If lamin B functions in maintaining spindle morphology, we expect to see functional interactions between lamin B and Eg5 during spindle assembly. We have analyzed the effects of lamin B depletion and Eg5 inhibition on both spindle morphology and MT flux in Xenopus egg extracts. We report here that both the membrane-associated and the soluble LB3 can function indirectly to constrain Eg5-driven spindle pole separation in meiotic spindles in Xenopus egg extracts. Cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts were prepared as described previously (23Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Demembranated sperm chromatin was prepared as described previously and added to extracts to a final concentration of ∼400 sperm nuclei/μl. Aurora A (AurA) beads were prepared as described (24Tsai M.Y. Zheng Y. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2156-2163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 10 μl of protein A-coupled magnetic Dynabead (Invitrogen) slurry was washed using extract buffer (10 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.7, 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm EGTA) and incubated with 250 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal AurA antibody for 1 h. After washing with extract buffer, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of extract buffer and incubated at 1:100 with cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts for 40 min at 4 °C. The extracts used for the AurA bead assay were supplemented with rhodamine-tubulin (∼13 μg/ml final), RanL43E (a constitutively GTP-bound RanGTPase, 1–2 mg/ml final), and energy mix (3.8 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA). Extracts used for sperm spindle assembly were supplemented as described above, but without RanL43E. Monastrol was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make a 10 mm stock solution. 100 μl of magnetic protein A-Dynabead slurry was incubated with 100 μl of rabbit polyclonal LB3T antibody (1 mg/ml) (10Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Heidinger J.M. Shumaker D.K. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. Zheng Y. Science. 2006; 311: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or control IgG from unimmunized rabbit (1 mg/ml) for 1 h. The beads were washed in extract buffer and then incubated with 100 μl of egg extracts for 1 h at 4 °C. This immunodepletion procedure routinely removed ∼95% of the LB3 in egg extracts (supplemental Fig. S2A). For time lapse recording of spindle assembly, 10 μl of extract was placed in a magnetic flow chamber at 4 °C. The magnetic flow chamber was constructed by adhering a glass coverslip to a glass slide using double-stick transparent tape. A 3/8-inch × 1/8-inch axial disc magnet (K&J Magnetics) was affixed to the glass slide by double-stick tape. AurA beads were allowed to settle for 3 min at 4 °C, then the slide was placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope at room temperature. All time lapse recordings were started ∼2 min after beginning the reaction and were taken at 5-s intervals for a total of 15–25 min. For AurA bead MT spin-down assays, spindle assembly reactions were stopped at the indicated times. Sperm assays were stopped in a similar manner at 90 min. Reactions were stopped and spun down onto coverslips as described (23Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and stained with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 to enhance bead visualization. Both time lapse recording and still images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 fluorescence microscope and a 60 × oil lens or a 40 × dry lens on a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera and a LEP Mac5000 automated stage. AurA beads in MT structures from the movies were tracked using the Metamorph “Track objects ” application. Tracking data were exported to Excel, and the distance between AurA beads in the process of forming a spindle was calculated in each frame. A Matlab program determined the rate of AurA bead separation in 30-s windows (consisting of six time lapse frames) that stepped forward one frame (5 s) at a time (see supplemental Fig. S1A). Windows were checked to make sure that the beads were undergoing separation across the 30 s. This allowed us to minimize noise due to the loss and reappearance of AurA beads in particular frames. Bead separation rates were averaged across all windows for a given spindle, yielding the spindle elongation rate (code available upon request). Several spindles were measured for each extract. Four independent experiments were performed using different egg extracts made on different dates. AurA beads that interacted but did not separate, started further than 10 μm apart, or left the field of view for more than 1 min were excluded from analysis. For nearest neighbor assays, 70 images were acquired randomly for each reaction using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 fluorescence microscope with a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera and a LEP Mac5000 automated stage driven by Metamorph software. Matlab was used to identify beads and bead clusters by brightness and eccentricity (code available upon request). AurA beads in each image were identified, and the distance between two nearest neighbors (indicated by lines between the beads) was checked for MTs, measured, and exported as a Microsoft Excel file (supplemental Fig. S1B). The measurements were normalized relative to the average of the control dataset to allow the comparison of different egg extracts. At least three independent experiments were carried out and used for the analyses. Fluorescence speckle microscopy was performed on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 fluorescence microscope with a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera using a 100×/1.4 NA objective. Images were collected using Metamorph software. Egg extract used for fluorescence speckle microscopy was supplemented with rhodamine-tubulin (1:3 dye:protein ratio) to a concentration of 11–16 nm. Small aliquots (5.5 μl) of extracts were placed under a 22 × 22-mm coverslip and sealed with valap (1:1:1 parafin:lanolin:vaseline). Movies were taken at 25 °C at a rate of one frame every 3 s for 4 min. Analysis was performed as described previously (22Yang G. Cameron L.A. Maddox P.S. Salmon E.D. Danuser G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).

We reasoned that because these structures form quickly and robustly, they could be used to approximate interpolar MT interactions and force balancing found during spindle assembly. We therefore characterized the spindle-like structures and found that at the beginning of the reaction AurA beads tended to cluster in groups of two to four, and all beads nucleated microtubule asters. Beads then separate from one another to form bipolar (Fig. 1A top and supplemental Movie S1) or multipolar spindle-like structures (∼53% of total structures; Fig. 1A, bottom, and supplemental Movie S2). MT asters nucleated from single AurA beads remained monopolar (∼47%) until they contacted MTs nucleated from other beads to form highly interconnected MT structures by 15 min into the reaction (supplemental Movie S3). When separate MT structures come in contact with one another, they interact, and the beads in these structures maintain their distance or move further apart. With extended reaction time (20–25 min), some spindle-like structures maintained a steady distance between AurA beads, whereas others continued to elongate or fell apart (data not shown). Using GFP-tagged EB1, we tracked plus-end MT behavior in spindle-like structures and found that MTs polymerized from one bead toward the other in an antiparallel fashion (supplemental Movie S4). These MTs underwent flux toward AurA beads (Fig. 1, B–E and supplemental Movie S5) with the average flux rate of 2.229 μm/min (S.D., 0.523; speckles tracked, 632; spindle-like structures tracked, 4), which is similar to the flux rate found in sperm spindles. Kymograph analysis showed that the flux rate of the speckles is similar to the rate of separation of the AurA beads (Fig. 1C). Given the importance of microtubule sliding to bead separation, we examined the effect of inhibiting Eg5 on bead separation and found that partially inhibiting Eg5 using 15 μm Monastrol allowed separation of AurA beads and formation of spindle-like structures, but the rate of AurA bead separation was reduced (Fig. 1F and supplemental Fig. S1A). To investigate the effects of LB3 on motor forces, we used the AurA bead system and measured the distance between beads and their nearest neighbors in randomly captured fields (disregarding beads in contact with each other). To check this assay for accuracy, we first made a Monastrol dose-response curve. The average distance between AurA beads decreased as the concentration of Monastrol in the egg extract increased, yielding an estimated EC50 value of 21 μm (Fig. 2, A and B). This EC50 value matches reported values for Monastrol (supplemental Table S1). In contrast to the Monastrol results, depletion of LB3 resulted in a significant increase in the distance between AurA beads in MT structures (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine whether LB3 opposed Eg5 activity, we next measured the average distance of AurA beads in either mock or LB3-depleted egg extracts with increasing concentrations of Monastrol. Depleting LB3 significantly relieved the effect of Monastrol on the average distance between AurA beads in all Monastrol concentrations tested (Fig. , 2C and E). The EC50 values for Monastrol in the presence or absence of LB3 are comparable (supplemental Table S1). This suggests that LB3 does not affect the ability of Eg5 to interact with Monastrol. Moreover, LB3 does not interact with Eg5 in egg extracts based on immunoprecipitation analyses (supplemental Fig. S2B). We confirmed the antagonistic relationship between Eg5 and LB3 using a rabbit antibody raised against the N terminus of Eg5 (amino acids 1–545) to inhibit the activity of Eg5. Results were similar to the Monastrol experiments (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). To verify further that LB3 and Eg5 counteract each other, we employed a second assay that measures the initial separation of clustered beads at the beginning of the formation of spindle-like structures. All AurA beads within MT structures were counted and assigned to clustered and unclustered groups (see arrows and arrowheads, respectively, in Fig. 3). Any beads that made contact were defined as clustered, whereas individual beads were defined as unclustered beads. The clustering index, which was calculated by dividing the number of clustered beads by the number of unclustered beads in MT structures, was used to determine the degree of clustering of the beads. In control reactions without Monastrol, the clustering index decreased as a function of time, indicating that the clustered beads separated continuously from one another during the course of reactions, whereas the clustering index remained relatively constant in the presence of Monastrol during the reaction (supplemental Fig. S2C). This demonstrates that the clustering index is a measure of the degree of separation of initially clustered AurA beads instead of the collapse of the already separated beads during the reaction. Using the clustering assay at the 15-min time point when most clustered beads had separated, we found that increasing Monastrol concentration caused an increase in the clustering index with an EC50 of 17.3 μm (Fig. 3, A and B), which is similar to published EC50 values for Monastrol measured using different assays (supplemental Table S1). By contrast, we found that depleting LB3 significantly reduced the clustering index compared with mock-depleted egg extracts (Fig. 3, C–E). The difference between the Monastrol curve and the control depletion is due to the immunodepletion procedure, which impaired spindle formation relative to unmanipulated extract (supplemental Fig. S4A). To show that the reduction of the clustering index caused by LB3 depletion was not simply a result of increased “stickiness” of the beads with LB3 present, time course analyses were performed on egg extracts subjected to either control or LB3 IgG depletion. These analyses showed that the AurA bead clustering indices were similar for both conditions at the beginning of the reaction but differed significantly by 6 min with the difference increasing at later time points (supplemental Fig. S4B). Using the Eg5 inhibitory antibody, we found a similar antagonistic relationship between Eg5 and LB3 in this bead clustering assay (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). To establish further that LB3 antagonizes Eg5 to help in maintaining the overall spindle morphology, we used meiotic spindles formed from sperm chromatin. Because LB3 has been shown to facilitate nuclear envelope assembly (38Lopez-Soler R.I. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Stick R. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and DNA replication (39Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Herrmann H. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) from Xenopus sperm in egg extracts, we limited our studies to meiotic spindles assembled in cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts. We examined whether LB3 could antagonize Eg5 in maintaining sperm spindle lengths by quantifying spindles with equivalent amounts of chromatin based on DAPI staining intensity and found that depleting LB3 caused formation of longer spindles, which could be reversed by the addition of 15 μm Monastrol, a concentration that did not severely inhibit spindle assembly induced by sperm (Fig. 4, A and B). LB3 depletion also caused a significant increase of multipolar spindles and a corresponding decrease of bipolar spindles compared with controls (Fig. 4, A and C). This defect could also be rescued by the addition of 15 μm Monastrol. To analyze the effect of LB3 on individual MT behavior, we used fluorescence speckle microscopy to analyze MT flux in sperm spindles assembled in egg extracts depleted with either control or LB3 IgG (Fig. 4, D and E, and supplemental Movie S6). We found that the average MT flux rate in mock-depleted egg extracts to be 2.021 μm/min (S.D., 0.491; 7 spindles, 23,203 speckles). Depleting LB3 resulted in a slight but statistically significant (p < 0.0001 using two-sample two-sided Student's t test) increase of average MT flux rate to 2.159 μm/min (S.D., 0.513; 6 spindles, 20,666 speckles). The addition of 15 μm Monastrol to mock-depleted egg extracts caused an expected large reduction of flux rate to 1.727 μm/min (S.D., 0.445; 8 spindles, 24,192 speckles). This reduction of flux rate was only reversed slightly (p < 0.01 using two-sample two-sided Student's t test) by depleting LB3 (average flux rate, 1.769 μm/min; S.D., 0.438; 8 spindles, 25,593 speckles). Previous studies have shown that the flux rate decreases near spindle poles (22Yang G. Cameron L.A. Maddox P.S. Salmon E.D. Danuser G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We also observed this phenomenon, but we found that LB3 depletion had no affect on this regional flux rate difference (data not shown). The length and shape of the mitotic spindle are regulated by a multitude of SAFs. For example, the balance of forces generated by motor proteins plays a critical role in spindle morphogenesis. Plus end-directed motor proteins, such as Eg5, slide antiparallel MTs in the spindle to promote spindle elongation, whereas minus end-directed motor proteins such as dynein function to keep spindle poles together. Besides motor proteins, SAFs that regulate MT polymerization dynamics also affect spindle length and morphology. An increase in MT length in the spindle caused by enhanced MT polymerization has been shown to result in elongated spindles. Deciphering how MT-based motors and MT assembly SAFs coordinate with one another in mitosis is critical to understand spindle morphogenesis. Recent studies have shown that LB3 regulates spindle morphogenesis as a component of the spindle matrix (10Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Heidinger J.M. Shumaker D.K. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. Zheng Y. Science. 2006; 311: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 16Zheng Y. Tsai M.Y. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2345-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii J.R. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the spindle matrix contains both motor proteins and MT assembly regulators, probing how LB3 affects both gross spindle morphology and individual MT flux should provide insights regarding how LB3 might coordinate SAF functions as a component of the spindle matrix. By analyzing spindle-like structures formed by AurA beads, we found an antagonistic relationship between LB3 and Eg5. We showed that AurA bead separation is driven by MT flux with a lack of MT depolymerization from the minus ends of MTs. The most likely explanation for this is that the high concentration of AurA stably tethered on the beads caused a hyperphosphorylation of mitotic centromere-associated kinesin which is known to reduce its MT depolymerization activity (40Lan W. Zhang X. Kline-Smith S.L. Rosasco S.E. Barrett-Wilt G.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Walczak C.E. Stukenberg P.T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 273-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Zhang X. Ems-McClung S.C. Walczak C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2752-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The lack of MT depolymerizing activity near AurA beads could explain why the AurA bead spindles cannot reach a steady state as the sperm spindles do. Despite the differences between AurA bead and sperm spindles, we showed that LB3 and Eg5 antagonize each other to maintain spindle length and spindle pole morphology in both spindle assembly assays. However, because LB3 does not directly bind to Eg5, the two proteins must antagonize each other indirectly. Because a fraction of LB3 in mitosis is insoluble and remains associated with membranes and because LB3 is found to surround the spindles (2Civelekoglu-Scholey G. Tao L. Brust-Mascher I. Wollman R. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), one possibility is that LB3 functions in this membrane network that ensheaths the spindle to restrict Eg5-driven MT sliding. LB3 depletion could cause defects in the network. The escaping of MTs through the defective network would lead to spindle elongation and multipolarity. Reduction of MT sliding by inhibiting Eg5 should relieve these gross morphological defects. An alternative possibility is that the soluble pool of LB3 could function throughout the spindle to indirectly inhibit Eg5 activity. The above two possibilities can be differentiated by measuring MT flux because if LB3 functions in a network ensheathing the spindle to restrict Eg5-driven MT movements, only MTs that come into contact with the network would be restricted to move further. Therefore, depletion of LB3 should have a small effect on the overall MT flux rate and there should not be an antagonistic relationship between LB3 and Eg5 as measured by MT flux. On the other hand, if the soluble pool of LB3 indirectly sequesters Eg5 throughout spindles to limit Eg5 activity, the same antagonistic relationship between Eg5 and LB3 would exist for MT flux as those measured for spindle morphology. Our studies of MT flux showed a small but statistically significant increase of MT flux, which is insufficient to antagonize the reduction of MT flux caused by Eg5 inhibition. Therefore, LB3 most likely antagonizes Eg5 in a network to restrict MT sliding driven by Eg5. Unlike the partially open mitosis in Drosophila early embryos, there is no well defined lamin B-containing spindle envelope that surrounds spindle MTs in vertebrate open mitosis. Yet, vertebrate spindles are surrounded by cytoplasmic membranes that contain lamin B (17Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii J.R. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that this membranous lamin B network in vertebrate mitosis functions similarly to the Drosophila spindle envelope to buffer motor activities (2Civelekoglu-Scholey G. Tao L. Brust-Mascher I. Wollman R. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Zheng Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). LB3 could contribute toward the integrity of the membranous spindle matrix that surrounds the spindle to limit excessive MT sliding and spindle pole separation. Proper organization of this membranous spindle matrix could also allow local positioning of SAFs to limit MT sliding. We have shown that LB3 can bind to Nudel (17Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii J.R. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although depletion of LB3 does not affect dynein recruitment (data not shown), the interaction between LB3 and Nudel could allow LB3 to position dynein properly on the matrix to counteract Eg5. Because the isolated spindle matrix also contains proteins such as XMAP215 and Maskin that can promote MT growth, it is possible that LB3 could function in the spindle matrix to facilitate the sequestration of MT polymerization activities. In the absence of LB3, the enhanced MT elongation would lead to increased spindle length, which should be relieved by inhibiting Eg5-mediated MT sliding. However, the increase in MT length and spindle elongation would have a small effect on Eg5-driven MT flux. Our analyses of spindle morphology and MT flux suggest that both the membrane-associated and the dynamic soluble pool of LB3 could function together to antagonize Eg5-driven MT sliding indirectly by sequestering MT assembly activities. In conclusion, by analyzing the effect of Eg5 inhibition and LB3 depletion on the gross spindle morphology and MT flux, we have shown that LB3 indirectly antagonizes Eg5 activity during spindle assembly. Our findings suggest that the membrane-associated LB3 could antagonize Eg5 by functioning in a network to restrain Eg5-driven MT sliding. Alternatively, LB3 could antagonize Eg5 by sequestering activities that promote MT growth. These two functions of LB3 are not mutually exclusive.

Sec61 consists of the core structure that has 10 transmembrane helices separated by nine loops (4Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Among the even-numbered loops (L2, L4, L6, and L8) facing the cytosol, the L8 loop contains a highly conserved, positively charged amino acid that provides a major binding site for the ribosomes (6Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. J. Cell. Biol. 2005; 168: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S. Jossinet F. Gumbart J. Mielke T.

The L6 loop plays a role in protein translocation by an unknown mechanism (6Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. J. Cell. Biol. 2005; 168: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the co-translational translocation mode, the association of the protein-conducting channel and the exit tunnel of the ribosomes allows direct passage of the nascent chains from the ribosomes through the ER membrane (7Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S. Jossinet F. Gumbart J. Mielke T. Berninghausen O. Schulten K. Westhof E. Gilmore R. Mandon E.C. Beckmann R.

Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the post-translational translocation mode, the protein-conducting channel partners with another membrane protein complex, called the tetrameric Sec62/Sec63 complex, consisting of Sec62, Sec63, Sec71, and Sec72 (see Fig. 1A, left panel) (9Deshaies R.J.

Although the components that are required for the post-translational translocation process have been well characterized, the structure of the heptameric post-translocon and how it is assembled remain unknown. To gain structural insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the post-translational translocation, we designed a new approach to efficiently purify the post-translocon from the yeast microsomes. Several lines of evidence based on cysteine labeling and EM analyses of the purified complex have shown that the post-translocon is composed of one copy of each subunit. Negative stain EM of the post-translocon containing Sec63 fused with maltose-binding protein suggested a location of the large cytosolic domain of Sec63 adjacent to the Sec61 channel. Mutagenesis of Sec61 indicated that the channel and the Sec62/63 complexes are assembled into the post-translocon via the sixth cytosolic loop of Sec61. Anti-HA antibody was purchased from Covance (Emeryville, CA). Anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

The YH-4, -5, -6, -7, -8, and -9 strains did not show any growth defects at 30 or 37 °C (data not shown). The yeast strain (YH-2) was grown in 12 liters of YPAD medium at 30 °C for 20 h. The microsomes were prepared as described previously (15Harada Y. Li H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One hundred of A280 in 1% SDS was defined as 2 eq/ml (15Harada Y. Li H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ten ml of microsomes (20,000 eq) were incubated with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0 m NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 3% (w/v) digitonin for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was diluted 3-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA and then incubated with 1 ml of anti-HA gel at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing the beads three times with 3 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% digitonin, and 1 mm MgCl2, the beads were further washed twice with 10 volumes of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% digitonin). The post-translocon was eluted two or three times with Buffer A containing 0.3 mg/ml HA peptide for 30 min at room temperature. The yield of the post-translocon was ∼50 μg/liter of cell culture as judged by SDS-PAGE/silver staining using BSA as a standard. The eluate was diluted 2-fold with Buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% digitonin) and subjected to Q-Sepharose. After washing the beads three times with Buffer B, the post-translocon was eluted with Buffer B containing 1.0 m NaCl. To exchange the buffer, the fraction was run through a Zeba Spin desalting column (Thermo Scientific) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% digitonin. Purified post-translocon was analyzed as described previously (15Harada Y. Li H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, the post-translocon in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% digitonin was mixed with 0.7% digitonin, 0.01% Ponceau S, and 5% glycerol at the final concentrations. The mixture was subjected to BN-PAGE either in imidazole buffer system (16Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar) or in Bis-Tris buffer system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For BN-PAGE analysis of the digitonin-solubilized microsomes, YH-7 was transformed with pZCSEC61-L6 (K273D/R275D/K284D), pZCSEC61-L8 (R406E), or pZCSEC61-L6L8 (R275E/R406E) (6Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. J. Cell. Biol. 2005; 168: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in medium lacking leucine to approximately an absorbance at 600 nm, and the microsomes were solubilized in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5% digitonin, and 10% glycerol). After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% digitonin, and 10% glycerol. The sample was mixed with BN-PAGE sample buffer at a ratio of 25:1 (v/v) (16Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar) and immediately subjected to BN-PAGE. After the BN-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Excess Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 was removed from the membrane by incubation for 5 min in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The membrane was then denatured in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C for 30 min, prior to blocking the membrane with 5% skim milk. The purified post-translocon (5–10 nm) was adjusted to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.7% digitonin, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. The mixture was incubated with 0–1.0% (w/v) of Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. After the addition of BN-PAGE sample buffer (0.01% Ponceau S and 5% glycerol), the mixture was immediately subjected to BN-PAGE in the Bis-Tris buffer system as described above. The gel was analyzed either by silver staining or by Western blotting with anti-HA and biotinylated anti-FLAG antibodies. The purified post-translocon complex (10 pmol of cysteine residues) was incubated in 10% TCA for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was washed once with ice-cold acetone, followed by standing at room temperature until all of the acetone evaporated. The dried pellet was dissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% SDS at a concentration of 0.5 mm of cysteine. The supernatant was incubated with 5 mm tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with 10 mm Alexa Fluor 680 C2 maleimide (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature and further incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). STEM was performed in the Brookhaven National Laboratory STEM user facility (Upton, NY). STEM was operated at 40 kV with a magnification of 125,000 and a scanning step of 10 Å. Tobacco mosaic virus was included during specimen preparation as an internal quality control. We subtracted the background of the STEM images in the Windows-based program PCMASS (17Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar), manually selected 1696 particles from 24 cryo-images of 512 × 512 pixels and measured their masses, and then calculated the means and standard deviations of the masses. The post-translocon particles were visualized by both negative staining and cryo-EM. The negatively stained grids were prepared at a sample concentration of 0.02 mg/ml. Cryo-EM grids of the sample were prepared using the Vitrobot (FEI, Hisbrone, CO) with a specimen chamber humidity of 90% and a temperature of 11 °C. A 4.5-μl sample droplet at 0.05 mg/ml concentration was applied to a quantifoil EM grid and rapidly plunged into liquid ethane after blotting off excess fluid in the Vitrobot. Both the negatively stained grid and the samples embedded in vitreous ice were imaged in the JEOL 2010F electron microscope operating at 200 kV at a magnification of 60,000× and with an underfocus value that varied from 1.0 to 3.5 μm. The images were recorded in low dose conditions (15 e/Å2). The cryo-images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 negative film that was developed for 12 min in full-strength Kodak D-19 developer at 20 °C. The micrographs inspected as without drift and astigmatism were digitized with a Nikon Supercool scanner 8000ED at a step size of 7.3 μm and further binned to 12.7 μm for image processing. This corresponds to a pixel size of 2.12 Å at the sample level. All of the images of the negatively stained particles were acquired by a 4K × 4K pixels CCD camera at the magnification of 60,000. After magnification calibration for the CCD camera, the pixel size of the images is 1.76 Å/pixel. Further particle processing and image analysis were based on 2× binned particle images (3.52 Å/pixel). The software packages EMAN (18Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J. J. Struct Biol. 2007; 157: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) and SPIDER (19Shaikh T.R. Gao H. Baxter W.T. Asturias F.J. Boisset N. Leith A. Frank J. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1941-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) were used for image processing. We manually selected 5590 and 10610 negatively stained particle images from the post-translocon and the MBP-fused post-translocon samples, respectively. We performed reference-free two-dimensional image classification on these images and calculated averaged images based on classification results. Several three-dimensional models were calculated from selected two-dimensional averages based on the common line technique. These models were refined against the raw particle images, and eventually one model was selected, based on the overall consistence between the reprojections and the reference-free two-dimensional averages. The cryo-EM data set of the post-translocon contained 14920 particles. We collected a second cryo-data set containing 19452 particles for the purpose of structure validation. The three-dimensional model derived from the stained data set was used as starting model to refine the two cryo-data sets. The refined three-dimensional maps from two independent data sets were virtually the same. The resolution of the refined maps was estimated by Fourier shell correlation of the two separately calculated maps. The three-dimensional EM maps were low pass filtered to an estimated resolution of 20 Å. Surface rendering of the EM maps and docking of atomic structures were carried out in the University of California, San Francisco Chimera (20Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27950) Google Scholar). Because Sec62 is known to be an essential component for the active post-translocon (21Jermy A.J. Willer M. Davis E. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7899-7906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), to develop an efficient purification strategy for the heptameric post-translational translocon (post-translocon), we tagged the chromosomal copy of Sec62 with triple HA at its C terminus. The post-translocon was immunoprecipitated from the digitonin-solubilized fraction of the microsomes with anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads and eluted with HA peptide. Remarkably, only the seven expected bands, but not any other contaminating bands, were detected in the eluate as shown by the silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The Sec62-HA was associated with the FLAG-tagged Sec63, Sec71, Sec72, Sec61, Sbh1, or Sss1 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that the purified post-translocon contains all seven known subunits. We further purified the post-translocon by Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography as described previously (12Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), although improvement in purity was marginal based on SDS-PAGE, possibly because the first immunoprecipitation step had already resulted in a highly pure preparation (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). The purified post-translocon migrated to ∼350 kDa as single major band in BN-PAGE; the faint and smeared region above the major band might be due to formation of oligomers of the post-translocon (Fig. 1E). The Sec62-HA in the digitonin-solubilized microsome co-migrated with that in the purified post-translocon (Fig. 1F, compare left and right panels), indicating that the post-translocon was intact after the purification steps. Because the subunit stoichiometry of the heptameric post-translocon is not known, we carried out Cys labeling of the purified post-translocon to determine the subunit stoichiometry. Except for Sbh1, the other six subunits all contain Cys residues, ranging in number from 1 to 7. SDS-PAGE of the fluorescently labeled specimen followed by silver staining (Fig. 2, right panel) and fluorescence scanning (Fig. 2, left panel) indicated that all six Cys-containing subunits, i.e. Sec63, Sec61, Sec62-HA, Sec71, Sec72, and Sss1, were properly labeled. We quantified the fluorescence intensity and normalized the intensity by the number of Cys in each subunit. By setting Sec62-HA to 1, the molar ratio for Sec63, Sec61, Sec62-HA, Sec71, Sec72, and Sss1 was ∼1:1:1:1:1:1 (Table 1). Although the copy number of Sbh1 was not examined in our experiment, we suggest that the Sec61 complex, the central pore of the post-translocon, also has a unit molar ratio: i.e. Sec61:Sbh1:Sss1 is 1:1:1, because its bacterial homolog SecYEG complex is composed of one copy of each of SecY, SecE, and SecG (5Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Subunit stoichiometry of the post-transloconSubunitRelative molar ratioaSec62-HA is set to 1.0.

The number of Cys residues of each subunit is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Assuming one copy of each of the seven subunits in the post-translocon, the calculated mass is ∼230 kDa. To provide an independent assessment of the stoichiometry of the complex, we measured the molecular mass of the purified post-translocon by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. 3) (17Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). The mass of the post-translocon, averaged from ∼1700 individual measurements, was found to be 287 kDa, with a standard deviation of 42 kDa. This result is consistent with the unit stoichiometry of the heptameric complex, as suggested by the Cys labeling experiment. The difference of ∼57 kDa between the measured and the calculated masses may be attributed to the digitonin and residual lipid molecules surrounding the hydrophobic membrane-embedded portion of the post-translocon. Based on the demonstration of seven subunits of the purified complex by the silver-stained SDS-PAGE and mass and stoichiometry analyses, we conclude that the digitonin-solubilized, highly purified yeast post-translocon is comprised of one copy of each of the seven subunits. The post-translocon was reported to dissociate into two subcomplexes: the Sec61 heterotrimeric complex and the heterotetrameric Sec62/Sec63 complex, by 1.0% of Triton X-100 treatment (12Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To gain a more complete pattern of subunit interaction in the post-translocon, we treated the highly purified complex with progressively higher concentrations of Triton X-100, ranging from 0.1% to 1%, and then analyzed by BN-PAGE. We found that the amount of the intact complex gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of the detergent, and at 1.0% Triton X-100, the original complex was virtually absent (Fig. 4A, O). Concomitant with the diminution of the original complex, three major bands, corresponding to ∼230, 200, and 140 kDa, gradually appeared. These bands are designated as the L (for large), M (medium), and S (small) subcomplexes, respectively. To investigate the composition of the three subcomplexes, we individually tagged Sec63, Sec71, Sec72, Sec61, Sbh1, and Sss1 with the FLAG epitope and purified each of these FLAG-tagged post-translocons, all containing Sec62-HA as well. The purified and FLAG-tagged complexes were treated with or without 1.0% Triton X-100 and analyzed by BN-PAGE/Western blot with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). The Sec62-HA was found in the original and in the L subcomplex (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Trace amounts of the Sec62-HA were found at ∼80 kDa in the presence of Triton X-100. As shown in Fig. 4C and Table 2, the FLAG-tagged Sec63, Sec71, and Sec72 subunits were found in the original complex and in the L and M subcomplexes; Sec61, Sbh1, and Sss1 subunits were found in the original complex and in the S subcomplex. These results indicate that the L subcomplex lacks the Sec61 complex. Thus, the L subcomplex is the tetrameric Sec62/Sec63 complex containing Sec62, Sec63, Sec71, and Sec72 subunits. The dissociated Sec61 complex corresponds to the S subcomplex. The M subcomplex is derived from the L subcomplex but lacks Sec62-HA, thus containing the Sec63-Sec71-Sec72 heterotrimer.

https://openalex.org/W2024102633,"Pannexins constitute a family of proteins exhibiting predominantly hemichannel activity. Pannexin channels have been suggested to participate in a wide spectrum of biological functions such as propagation of calcium waves, release of IL-1β, and responses to ischemic conditions. At present, the molecular mechanisms regulating pannexin hemichannel activity are essentially unknown. Because cysteines have been shown to constitute key elements in regulating hemichannel properties of the connexin-type we performed site-directed mutagenesis of intracellular cysteine residues of Panx1. Cysteine to serine exchange (Cys → Ser) at the C-terminal position amino acid 346 led to a constitutively leaky hemichannel and subsequently to cell death. Increased channel activity was demonstrated by dye uptake and electrophysiological profiling in injected Xenopus laevis oocytes and transfected N2A cells. Mutations of the remaining intracellular cysteines did not result in major changes of Panx1 channel properties. From these data we conclude that the Cys-346 residue is important for proper functioning of the Panx1 channel."

However, the precise molecular mechanism by which the Lgl carries out its function remains obscure. In the current study, we have identified Ran-binding protein M (RanBPM) as a novel binding partner of Mgl-1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila tumor suppressor protein lethal (2) giant larvae (L(2)gl) by yeast two-hybrid screening. RanBPM seems to act as a scaffolding protein with a modulatory function with respect to Mgl-1. The Mgl-1 and RanBPM association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments. Additionally, expression of RanBPM resulted in inhibition of Mgl-1 degradation, and thereby extended the half-life of Mgl-1. Furthermore, the ability of Mgl-1 activity in cell migration and colony formation assay was enhanced by RanBPM. Taken together, our findings reveal that RanBPM plays a novel role in regulating Mgl-1 stability and contributes to its biological function as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1992800585,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a key membrane protein in the complex network of epithelial ion transporters regulating epithelial permeability. Syntaxins are one of the major determinants in the intracellular trafficking and membrane targeting of secretory proteins. In the present study we demonstrate the biochemical and functional association between CFTR and syntaxin 16 (STX16) that mediates vesicle transport within the early/late endosomes and trans-Golgi network. Immunoprecipitation experiments in rat colon and T84 human colonic epithelial cells indicate that STX16 associates with CFTR. Further analyses using the domain-specific pulldown assay reveal that the helix domain of STX16 directly interacts with the N-terminal region of CFTR. Immunostainings in rat colon and T84 cells show that CFTR and STX16 highly co-localize at the apical and subapical regions of epithelial cells. Interestingly, CFTR-associated chloride current was reduced by the knockdown of STX16 expression in T84 cells. Surface biotinylation and recycling assays indicate that the reduction in CFTR chloride current is due to decreased CFTR expression on the plasma membrane. These results suggest that STX16 mediates recycling of CFTR and constitutes an important component of CFTR trafficking machinery in intestinal epithelial cells."

The engagement of TLRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns promotes dimerization of the receptors, followed by recruitment of TIR domain-containing adaptors and the initiation of downstream signal transduction cascades (6Fitzgerald K.A.

MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) is the universal TIR adapter protein recruited by all TLRs except TLR3, and thus the signaling pathways activated by TLRs are classified into MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways (9Kaisho T.

The IL-1R-associated kinase-MyD88 association triggers hyperphosphorylation of IL-1R-associated kinase, leading to its dissociation from MyD88 and interaction with the downstream adaptor TRAF-6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) (16Burns K.

This results in activation of TAK-1 (transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1), leading to stimulation of IκB kinases (IKKs). IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylate members of the IκB family (17Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), resulting in their polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation (18Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Members of the canonical cytoplasmic IκB family include IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ, and they function to retain Rel subunits of NF-κB in their inactive form in the cytosol. Following degradation of the IκB proteins, NF-κB is released, leading to exposure of a nuclear localization signal and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (19Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, NF-κB binds to a consensus decameric κB-responsive DNA element and induces the up-regulation of a plethora of genes encoding proinflammatory proteins and co-stimulatory molecules (20Moynagh P.N. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4589-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition to this MyD88-dependent pathway, TLR4 can also employ another TIR adaptor, termed TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), to trigger activation of NF-κB in a MyD88-independent pathway (21Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). TLR3 is unique among members of the TLRs in that it exclusively employs TRIF as its receptor proximal adaptor protein. In addition to activation of NF-κB, TRIF can also form a complex with TBK1 (TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase) and IKKi, which induce specific phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors IRF3 (interferon-regulatory factor 3) and IRF7 to induce type I interferons (IFNs) (22Moynagh P.N. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).A striking similarity of insect and vertebrate immunity lies in the conserved role of Toll and TLRs in driving activation of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family in response to a perceived pathogenic challenge. Thus, activation of NF-κB and the subsequent induction of immune response genes is a core defensive mechanism of both fly and mammalian innate immune responses. Moreover, NF-κB fills dual roles in early development and adult immunity in both insects and mammals. In addition, consideration of the pathways leading to the activation of NF-κB factor reveals homology at the level of the intracellular signaling components utilized. Given such conservation, the identification of novel proteins in the NF-κB pathway in the fly has proved valuable in adding to our understanding of the molecular components of the NF-κB signaling system in mammalian cells. In 2000, Cactus, the Drosophila ortholog of IκBα, was employed as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, leading to identification of a novel Cactus-interacting protein termed Cactin (23Lin P. Huang L.H. Steward R. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Drosophila Cactin was shown to be maternally inherited, and its overexpression promoted a ventralized phenotype in the early Drosophila embryo. Given that the NF-κB family member Dorsal is subject to inhibition by Cactus and that Dorsal is an important trigger of ventralization, these studies suggested that Cactin positively regulates Dorsal function in early Drosophila development. More recent studies have confirmed early developmental roles for Cactin in zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans (24Atzei P. Yang F. Collery R. Kennedy B.N. Moynagh P.N. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2010; 10: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Tannoury H. Rodriguez V. Kovacevic I. Ibourk M. Lee M. Cram E.J. Dev. Biol. 2010; 341: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, there are no existing data on its function in higher organisms. In addition, an immune function for Cactin has not yet been investigated. The parallels between the fly and human TLR pathways at the molecular level prompted us to perform the first functional characterization of the human ortholog of Cactin (hCactin).Given that IκBα, the mammalian ortholog of Cactus, is central in control of NF-κB activation and regulation of inflammatory signaling, we were especially interested in exploring the potential of human Cactin to act as a novel regulator of innate immune signaling. We thus cloned hCactin and demonstrated it to be a negative regulator of TLR signaling. Intriguingly, hCactin fails to interact with the cytoplasmic IκB proteins but instead localizes to the nucleus of the cell, where it interacts with IκB-like (IκBL) protein and some other proteins that are encoded by genes in the MHC Class III region of chromosome 6. The strong association of the genes in this genomic region with inflammatory diseases coupled to the inhibitory effects of hCactin on innate immune signaling promotes hCactin as a highly novel and crucially important regulator of immunity-mediated disease.DISCUSSIONThe activation of NF-κB and the subsequent induction of immune response genes is a core defense mechanism of both fly and mammalian innate immune responses. In addition, consideration of the pathways leading to the activation of this ubiquitous transcription factor reveals homology at the level of the intracellular signaling components utilized, albeit not always of precisely interchangeable function. Such a consideration of the similarities or parallels between insect and mammalian innate immunity highlights the significance of novel protein identification in model organisms. In 2000, Lin et al. (23Lin P. Huang L.H. Steward R. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) identified Cactin, a conserved protein that interacts with Drosophila Cactus. Because the mammalian homolog of cactus, IκBα, is central in control of NF-κB activation, the identification of a highly conserved component with the potential to interact with and possibly modify the function of this inhibitory protein was exciting and inspired the presently described studies.The Rel/NF-κB pathway is essential in the early determination of Drosophila embryonic dorsoventral polarity, and Cactus acts as a negative regulator of this pathway. Overexpression of Cactin in a Cactus heterozygous background results in the enhancement of the Cactus haploinsufficient phenotype, strongly increasing both the embryonic lethality and the ventralized phenotype observed. This suggests that Cactin in Drosophila may function in the dorsal-ventral pathway to positively regulate the nuclear targeting of Dorsal. Given this regulation of the NF-κB in Drosophila, it seemed pertinent to initiate functional characterization of hCactin with an analysis of its effect on the NF-κB pathway. Intriguingly, the present studies demonstrate that hCactin acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB. The evidence for this inhibitory role is especially compelling based on the findings from a number of complementary approaches, including overexpression studies and the suppression of endogenous expression of hCactin by two independent modalities, namely siRNA- and shRNA-mediated suppression. Indeed, the prolonged nature of NF-κB in response to LPS and poly(I-C) in cells where hCactin expression is suppressed suggests that hCactin may be an endogenous braking system for NF-κB activation by innate immune stimuli. hCactin appears to exert its inhibitory influence on a wide array of inflammatory stimuli that employ the NF-κB pathway and in a cell type-independent manner. Such inhibitory effects of hCactin contrast with the proposed stimulatory effects of Cactin on Dorsal in Drosophila. Although homology relationships are frequently exploited as an aid in assignation of novel gene function, it is clear that homology need not always correspond to conserved function (32Jensen R.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (INTERACTIONS1002)Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, Drosophila expresses genes encoding members of the TRAF (TNF receptor-associated factor) family and homologues of IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO, and yet genetic studies have failed so far to demonstrate involvement of any of these genes downstream of Toll, unlike in mammalian Toll signaling. Instead, genetic data point to the involvement of the Drosophila equivalent of the mammalian signalosome comprising IKK-β and IKK-γ/NEMO homologues (33Lu Y. Wu L.P. Anderson K.V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Rutschmann S. Jung A.C. Zhou R. Silverman N. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Nat.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) in the Imd pathway. It has therefore been observed that although homologues of the human Toll signaling pathway exist in Drosophila, they need not necessarily occupy an identical functional niche. Indeed, in the present study, we show that the role of hCactin extends beyond regulation of the NF-κB pathway in that it also acts as a strong inhibitor of IRF signaling and the induction of IRF-responsive genes, such as IFNβ.In an effort to gain insight into the mechanistic basis of the inhibitory effects of hCactin on NF-κB, we initially assessed its ability to interact with the cytoplasmic IκB proteins based on their homology to the Cactin-interacting protein Cactus. There was no detectable interaction of hCactin with any of the cytoplasmic IκBs. However, hCactin associates with IκBL, a nucleus-localized member of the IκB family. This interaction with IκBL is likely to be of functional relevance because our findings to date suggest that IκBL mimics the regulatory effects of hCactin on the NF-κB and IRF pathways. The interaction of hCactin with IκBL is especially interesting given that the IκBL gene is encoded by the MHC Class III region of the human genome (31Xie T. Rowen L. Aguado B. Ahearn M.E. Madan A. Qin S. Campbell R.D. Hood L. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2621-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and an earlier study had reported hCactin as a binding partner for other proteins that are encoded by this region of the genome (36Lehner B. Semple J.I. Brown S.E. Counsell D. Campbell R.D. Sanderson C.M. Genomics. 2004; 83: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The latter study had used a high throughput yeast two-hybrid screen to document interaction partners for intracellular proteins encoded by genes in the MHC Class III region of the human genome, and hCactin was identified as an interaction partner for two of these proteins, namely RD RNA-binding protein (RDBP) (also called negative elongation factor subunit E (NELF_E)) and leukocyte-specific transcript 1 protein (LST1) (36Lehner B. Semple J.I. Brown S.E. Counsell D. Campbell R.D. Sanderson C.M. Genomics. 2004; 83: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the LST1 gene is located at a locus that is only one gene removed from the TNF that in turn is only one gene removed from the IKBL gene (31Xie T. Rowen L. Aguado B. Ahearn M.E. Madan A. Qin S. Campbell R.D. Hood L. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2621-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The findings thus propose a model where hCactin is capable of directly interacting with three proteins (LST1, RDBP, and IκBL) that are encoded by genes clustered in the MHC Class III region, whereas it is also capable of functionally targeting TNF that is also encoded by a gene in this cluster region. Thus, hCactin may emerge to be a key regulator of this genomic region and an important modulator of disease states given that the MHC Class III region contains immunity-related proteins that affect susceptibility to numerous immunopathological disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis. More specifically and relevant to the present study, an earlier study aimed to identify non-HLA genes in the chromosome 6p21.3 region that influence the development of rheumatoid arthritis (37Okamoto K. Makino S. Yoshikawa Y. Takaki A. Nagatsuka Y. Ota M. Tamiya G. Kimura A. Bahram S. Inoko H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This effort revealed an HLA-independent susceptibility locus at the telomeric end of the Class III region, which was eventually identified as a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter/enhancer region of the IκBL gene that conferred transcriptional repression on the promoter. Furthermore a single nucleotide polymorphism giving rise to structural alteration at amino acid 224 in a predicted protein kinase C phosphorylation site of IκBL defines a propensity for more extensive and severe disease states in ulcerative colitis (38de la Concha E.G. Fernandez-Arquero M. Lopez-Nava G. Martin E. Allcock R.J. Conejero L. Paredes J.G. Diaz-Rubio M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1491-1495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The interaction of hCactin with IκBL in conjunction with their similar functional properties in the present study clearly implicates hCactin as a potential regulator of immunity-mediated diseases previously associated with genes that are encoded by the MHC Class III region of chromosome 6.In addition to acting as regulators of the NF-κB pathway, it is also interesting to note that hCactin and IκBL demonstrate strong inhibitory effects on IRFs. Although the mechanism underlying their inhibitory effects on NF-κB is somewhat intuitive, given that IκBL belongs to a family of proteins that interact with and inhibit NF-κB, the molecular basis of their modulation of IRFs is less clear. The nuclear localization of hCactin appears to be very important for its function, at least with respect to regulation of NF-κB and IRFs, because a truncation mutant of hCactin that localizes to the cytoplasm fails to replicate the inhibitory effects of nucleus-resident hCactin. The design of this truncation mutant was dictated by the need to remove the two nuclear localization motifs in the N-terminal region but also by the mutant corresponding to that region of Drosophila Cactin that strongly interacts with Cactus. Interestingly, the truncation mutant fails to interact with IκBα, demonstrating that the interaction of Drosophila Cactin with cytoplasmic Cactus is not conserved in humans.It would appear that hCactin exemplifies the capacity of evolution to diversify and functionally expand the core biological processes embodied in a highly conserved protein. By extension, this may translate into multiple roles for hCactin in a number of diseases. Indeed, although the potential role of hCactin in inflammatory-based disorders has been discussed above, it is worth emphasizing that hCactin was first observed as a renal tumor antigen, NY-REN-24 (39Scanlan M.J. Gordan J.D. Williamson B. Stockert E. Bander N.H. Jongeneel V. Gure A.O. Jäger D. Jäger E. Knuth A. Chen Y.T. Old L.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and is expressed in multiple myeloma (40Davies F.E. Dring A.M. Li C. Rawstron A.C. Shammas M.A. O'Connor S.M. Fenton J.A.

Blood. 2003; 102: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This may implicate a role for hCactin in regulating cell transformation, and although such a function remains speculative, it is interesting to note that hCactin negatively regulates the prosurvival transcription factor NF-κB. However, the regulatory effects of hCactin clearly extend beyond the NF-κB pathway. More specifically, hCactin is conserved across a broad phylogenetic range and is also found in primitive organisms, such as C. elegans, in which there is no NF-κB/Rel homologue (41Pujol N. Link E.M. Liu L.X. Kurz C.L. Alloing G. Tan M.W. Ray K.P. Solari R. Johnson C.D. Ewbank J.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and its TLR gene, TOL-1, fails to play a direct role in defense against fungal or bacterial pathogens (41Pujol N. Link E.M. Liu L.X. Kurz C.L. Alloing G. Tan M.W. Ray K.P. Solari R. Johnson C.D. Ewbank J.J. Curr.

Biol. 2003; 13: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although C. elegans has apparently lost Rel-based inducible defenses and is not dependent on a Toll pathway for resistance to pathogenic challenge, it is clear that a homolog of Cactin, displaying striking conservation, has been retained, suggesting some additional targets for Cactin and a core biological function for this protein. The process of evolution and speciation may have permitted the protein to adopt new functions when encountering the increasingly complex biological systems and pathways of higher organisms. Although Cactin was originally identified in the Toll dorsoventral regulatory pathway in Drosophila, as a protein that regulates Dorsal translocation, it is now apparent that this function may have evolved in higher organisms, and the present study strongly promotes hCactin as an important regulator of innate immune signaling. More importantly, it also targets a number of proteins, directly or functionally, that are encoded by the MHC Class III region of the genome and have been strongly associated with an array of diseases. It is thus vitally important to gain an appreciation of the physiological and pathological roles of hCactin. The present study offers the first important step in this process.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the two major long chain bases is called phytosphingosine (PHS). PHS has been shown to cause toxicity in tryptophan auxotrophic strains of yeast because this bioactive ceramide precursor causes diversion of the high affinity tryptophan permease Tat2 to the vacuole rather than the plasma membrane. Loss of the integral membrane protein Rsb1 increased PHS sensitivity, which was suggested to be due to this protein acting as an ATP-dependent long chain base efflux protein. More recent experiments demonstrated that loss of the genes encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins Pdr5 and Yor1 elevated PHS tolerance. This increased resistance was suggested to be due to increased expression of RSB1. Here, we provide an alternative view of PHS resistance influenced by Rsb1 and Pdr5/Yor1. Rsb1 has a seven-transmembrane domain topology more consistent with that of a regulatory protein like a G-protein-coupled receptor rather than a transporter. Importantly, an rsb1Δ cell does not exhibit higher internal levels of PHS compared with isogenic wild-type cells. However, tryptophan transport is increased in pdr5Δ yor1 strains and reduced in rsb1Δ cells. Localization and vacuolar degradation of Tat2 are affected in these genetic backgrounds. Finally, internalization of FM4-64 dye suggests that loss of Pdr5 and Yor1 slows normal endocytic rates. Together, these data argue that Rsb1, Pdr5, and Yor1 regulate the endocytosis of Tat2 and likely other membrane transporter proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2002450828,"Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), which is expressed primarily in myeloid cells, plays a central role in initiating immune responses to viral single-stranded RNA. Despite the great interest in the field of TLR8 research, very little is known in terms of TLR8 biology and its transcriptional regulation. Here, we describe the isolation of the hTLR8 promoter and the characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in its regulation. Reporter gene analysis and ChIP assays demonstrated that the hTLR8 regulation of the basal transcription is regulated via three C/EBP cis-acting elements that required C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ activity. In addition, we observed that R848 stimulation increases TLR8 transcriptional activity via an enhanced binding of C/EBPδ, and not C/EBPβ, to its responsive sites within the TLR8 promoter. Moreover, we showed that IFN-γ also increased TLR8 transcription activity via the binding of STAT1 transcription factor to IFN-γ activated sequence elements on the TLR8 promoter and enhanced TLR8 functionality. These results shed new light on the mechanisms involved during TLR8-mediated innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2062725722,"Although maps of intracellular interactions are increasingly well characterized, little is known about large-scale maps of host-pathogen protein interactions. The investigation of host-pathogen interactions can reveal features of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for the development of drugs and disease prevention strategies. A compilation of experimentally verified interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins and a set of HIV-dependency factors (HDF) allowed insights into the topology and intricate interplay between viral and host proteins on a large scale. We found that targeted and HDF proteins appear predominantly in rich-clubs, groups of human proteins that are strongly intertwined among each other. These assemblies of proteins may serve as an infection gateway, allowing the virus to take control of the human host by reaching protein pathways and diversified cellular functions in a pronounced and focused way. Particular transcription factors and protein kinases facilitate indirect interactions between HDFs and viral proteins. Discerning the entanglement of directly targeted and indirectly interacting proteins may uncover molecular and functional sites that can provide novel perspectives on the progression of HIV infection and highlight new avenues to fight this virus."

CIB constitutes the prototype of a new subfamily of transcriptional regulators. Here, we provide some insights about the functional-structural relationships of the BzdR protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies revealed that BzdR is homodimeric in solution. An electron microscopy three-dimensional reconstruction of the BzdR dimer has been obtained, and the predicted structures of the respective N- and C-terminal domains of each BzdR monomer could be fitted into such a reconstruction. Gel retardation and ultracentrifugation experiments have shown that the binding of BzdR to its cognate promoter is cooperative. Different biochemical approaches revealed that the effector molecule benzoyl-CoA induces conformational changes in BzdR without affecting its oligomeric state. The BzdR-dependent inhibition of the P(N) promoter and its activation in the presence of benzoyl-CoA have been established by in vitro transcription assays. The monomeric BzdR4 and BzdR5 mutant regulators revealed that dimerization of BzdR is essential for DNA binding. Remarkably, a BzdRΔL protein lacking the linker region connecting the N- and C-terminal domains of BzdR is also dimeric and behaves as a super-repressor of the P(N) promoter. These data suggest that the linker region of BzdR is not essential for protein dimerization, but rather it is required to transfer the conformational changes induced by the benzoyl-CoA to the DNA binding domain leading to the release of the repressor. A model of action of the BzdR regulator has been proposed."

However, deleting the variable regions from Env trimers can be problematic, because hydrophobic patches that are normally solvent-inaccessible now become exposed, causing protein misfolding or aggregation, for example. Here, we describe the construction and characterization of recombinant gp140 trimers lacking variable domains 1 and 2 (ΔV1V2).

Further conformational changes in the trimeric complex lead to exposure of the hydrophobic fusion peptides of the gp41 subunits, which are inserted into the target membrane to link the cellular membranes prior to their fusion (15Jacobs A.

The individual Env subunits, gp120 and gp41, have not been successful as vaccine antigens, probably because they mimic inadequately the native Env spike. Hence, gp120 and gp41 immunogens tend to induce antibodies that are nonreactive with the functional Env complex and hence devoid of neutralizing activity against relevant HIV-1 strains. The current generation of soluble Env trimers offer modest improvements over monomeric gp120 in respect to NAb induction but not to an extent that solves the problem (17Earl P.L. Sugiura W.

However, progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of atomic level structural data on the Env trimer. We have previously developed a prototype recombinant trimer construct, SOSIP gp140, that is stabilized by an intermolecular disulfide bond between gp120 and gp41 and a substitution, I559P, in gp41 (21Binley J.M.

Single particle cryo-electron microscopy tomography studies show that SOSIP gp140 is indeed a reasonable mimic of the virion-associated Env spike, and it undergoes similar conformational changes upon CD4 and antibody binding to those occurring within the native spike under the same conditions (27Subramaniam S. Keystone Symposia, HIV Vaccines (X5), Banff, Alberta, Canada, March 21–26, 2010. 2010; Google Scholar). Hence, SOSIP gp140 is a useful lead molecule for vaccine development and structural studies. HIV-1 has evolved many strategies to limit the induction and binding of NAbs, including the shielding of conserved and potentially vulnerable Env domains by both carbohydrates and flexible and sequence-variable loops (8Mascola J.R.

However, deleting V1V2 from soluble trimers, with the same goals, has proven less straightforward. One particular problem with the loop-deleted trimers is that they can become misfolded and/or aggregated (1Bontjer I. Land A. Eggink D. Verkade E. Tuin K. Baldwin C. Pollakis G. Paxton W.A.

A possible explanation is that hydrophobic regions of Env that are normally occluded become solvent-accessible once the V1V2 loops are no longer present (1Bontjer I. Land A. Eggink D. Verkade E. Tuin K. Baldwin C. Pollakis G. Paxton W.A. Braakman I. Berkhout B. Sanders R.W. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To address the adverse effects of V1V2 deletion, we conducted evolution experiments with ΔV1V2 mutants of the HIV-1 strain LAI. Similar gain-of-function studies using evolution have previously been performed with V3-deleted Env (42Laakso M.M. Lee F.H. Haggarty B. Agrawal C. Nolan K.M. Biscone M. Romano J. Jordan A.P. Leslie G.J. Meissner E.G. Su L. Hoxie J.A. Doms R.W. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The goal was to allow the virus to find a way to accommodate the loss of its V1V2 loops by evolving compensatory changes that increase trimer function and hence virus replication (1Bontjer I. Land A. Eggink D. Verkade E. Tuin K. Baldwin C. Pollakis G. Paxton W.A. Braakman I. Berkhout B. Sanders R.W. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We identified several such compensatory changes and proposed that they could be useful for designing improved Env trimer variants for immunogenicity and structural studies. However, the evolution experiments were, of necessity, conducted using an Env that lacked the SOS disulfide bond and the I559P substitutions we use to make stable, cleaved gp140 trimers, because these modifications are incompatible with virus replication (43Sanders R.W. Dankers M.M. Busser E. Caffrey M. Moore J.P. Berkhout B. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Sanders R.W. Busser E. Moore J.P. Lu M. Berkhout B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2004; 20: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we address whether we can use the evolutionary changes that arose in ΔV1V2 HIV-1 LAI to improve the design of soluble Env trimers of heterologous sequences. We found that the forced evolution of ΔV1V2 LAI reduces the exposure of a hydrophobic protein surface, either via substitution of nonpolar amino acids by polar ones or by masking it with an added glycan. Moreover, these strategies can be used for expressing well folded, recombinant soluble ΔV1V2 Env trimers. The full-length molecular clone of HIV-1 LAI (pLAI) was the source of WT and mutant viruses (45Peden K. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The pRS1 plasmid was used to introduce mutations into env, as described previously (43Sanders R.W. Dankers M.M. Busser E. Caffrey M. Moore J.P. Berkhout B. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutant env genes were generated in pRS1 and cloned into pLAI as SalI-BamHI fragments. To facilitate subcloning of V1V2 deletion variants, we introduced two unique restriction sites into pRS1 that had silent mutations, HindIII and BmgBI, at the N- and C-terminal ends of V1V2, respectively. Mutations, deletions, and insertions were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the integrity of all plasmids was verified by sequencing. The pPPI4 vector for expressing gp140 proteins has been described elsewhere (21Binley J.M. Sanders R.W. Clas B. Schuelke N. Master A. Guo Y. Kajumo F. Anselma D.J. Maddon P.J. Olson W.C. Moore J.P.

SupT1 T cells, 293T cells, and 293S GnTI−/− were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), respectively, each supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) as described previously (58Sanders R.W. de Jong E.C.

TZM-bl cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin. SupT1 cells were transfected by electroporation as described elsewhere (59Das A.T. Land A. Braakman I. Klaver B. Berkhout B. Virology. 1999; 263: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with env genes using linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Mr 25,000), as described previously (48Eggink D.

Purif. 2006; 48: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, Env-encoding DNA was diluted in DMEM to 0.1 of the final culture volume and mixed with PEI (0.15 mg/ml final concentration). After incubation for 20 min, the DNA/PEI mixture was added to the cells for 4 h before replacement with normal culture medium containing 0.01% BSA (Sigma) and minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm, Invitrogen). Supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection. Virus produced in SupT1 cells and virus from SupT1 evolution cultures were stored at −80 °C. The virus concentration was quantified by measuring its CA-p24 antigen content by ELISA, essentially as described previously (61Moore J.P. Jarrett R.F. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1988; 4: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These values were used to normalize the amount of virus used in subsequent infection experiments, which were performed by adding 500 pg of CA-p24 to 4 × 105 SupT1 cells in each well of a 96-well plate. Virus production after 21 days was measured using the CA-p24 ELISA. The TZM-bl reporter cell line stably expresses high levels of CD4 and HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and contains the luciferase and β-galactosidase genes under control of the HIV-1 LTR promoter (62Wei X.

The line was obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu, and Tranzyme Inc., Durham, NC. One day prior to infection, TZM-bl cells (17 × 103 cells) were added to a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FCS, MEM nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (both at 100 units/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. A fixed amount of virus (1.0 ng of CA-p24) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with various concentrations of mAbs. The mAb/virus mixture was then added to the TZM-bl cells (70–80% confluency) in the presence of 400 nm saquinavir (Roche Applied Science) and 40 μg/ml DEAE, in a total volume of 200 μl. Two days post-infection, the medium was removed, then the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Glomax luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). All infections were performed in duplicate, and luciferase measurements were also made in duplicate. Uninfected cells were used to correct for background luciferase activity. The infectivity of each mutant without inhibitor was defined as 100%. Nonlinear regression curves were determined, and IC50 values were calculated using Prism software version 5.0c. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the anti-gp120 V3 loop mAb PA-1 (1:20,000 dilution to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml) and HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 dilution) were performed by following established protocols. Luminometric detection of envelope glycoproteins was performed using the Western Lightning ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blue native-PAGE was carried out as described previously (22Sanders R.W. Vesanen M. Schuelke N. Master A. Schiffner L. Kalyanaraman R. Paluch M. Berkhout B. Maddon P.J. Olson W.C. Lu M. Moore J.P. J.

https://openalex.org/W2069061186,"Chronological life span is defined by how long a cell can survive in a non-dividing state. In yeast, it is measured by viability after entry into stationary phase. To date, some factors affecting chronological life span have been identified; however, the molecular details of how these factors regulate chronological life span have not yet been elucidated clearly. Because life span is a complicated phenomenon and is supposedly regulated by many factors, it is necessary to identify new factors affecting chronological life span to understand life span regulation. To this end, we have screened for long-lived mutants and identified Pma1, an essential P-type proton ATPase, as one of the determinants of chronological life span. We show that partial loss of Pma1 activity not only by mutations but also by treatment with the Pma1 inhibitory chemical vanadate resulted in the long-lived phenotype in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These findings suggest a novel way to manipulate chronological life span by modulating Pma1 as a molecular target."

These proteins are both of large importance for normal lymphoid development; however, it is unclear if they act in direct synergy to expand a transient Il-7R+Flt-3+ population or if the collaboration is created through sequential activities. We report here that Flt-3L and Il-7 synergistically stimulated the expansion of primary Il-7R+Flt-3+ progenitor cells and a hematopoietic progenitor cell line ectopically expressing the receptors. The stimulation resulted in a reduced expression of pro-apoptotic genes and also mediated survival of primary progenitor cells in vitro. However, functional analysis of single cells suggested that the anti-apoptotic effect was additive indicating that the synergy observed mainly depends on stimulation of proliferation. Analysis of downstream signaling events suggested that although Il-7 induced Stat-5 phosphorylation, Flt-3L caused activation of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways. Flt-3L could also drive proliferation in synergy with ectopically expressed constitutively active Stat-5. This synergy could be inhibited with either receptor tyrosine kinase or MAPK inhibitors suggesting that Flt-3L and Il-7 act in synergy by activation of independent signaling pathways to expand early hematopoietic progenitors.

However, even though Il-7 stimulates survival and expansion of early B-cell progenitors, ectopic expression of Bcl-2 is insufficient to rescue B-lymphopoiesis in Il-7 receptor-deficient mice (18Maraskovsky E.

Thus, it is established that Flt-3L and Il-7 stimulate lymphopoiesis in a coordinate manner (15Sitnicka E. Brakebusch C. Martensson I.L. Svensson M. Agace W.W. Sigvardsson M. Buza-Vidas N. Bryder D.

It is, however, unclear if this is through a sequential activity of the two cytokines or through a direct functional synergy. By investigating primary mouse bone marrow cells as well as the hematopoietic progenitor cell line BaF3 ectopically expressing both Il-7 and Flt-3L receptors, we suggest that the two cytokines have an additive anti-apoptotic effect while stimulating proliferation in a synergistic manner. The synergy appeared dependent on Stat-5 activation by Il-7 and Flt-3L-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase activation, suggesting that the synergy is mediated by parallel activation of separate signaling pathways. C57BL/6 mice were housed at the Linköping University animal facility in line with Swedish legal regulations. All experiments were conducted with permission from the Linköping ethical committee. BaF3 cells (22Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l-glutamine, with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone), 25 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 μm 2-β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 10% conditioned medium from confluent WEHI-3 cells as a source of interleukin-3. Phoenix-Ampho cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with GlutaMAX (+4.5 g/ld-glucose + pyruvate), 10% FCS, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Primary cells were grown in Opti-MEM, with 10% FCS, 50 μm 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. All cells were kept at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All reagents unless otherwise indicated were purchased from Invitrogen. LY294002 was from Calbiochem, and AG1295 was purchased from Sigma. SL327 was from Tocris Bioscience, and U0126 was from In Vitro. 8–12-Week-old C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed, and BM was harvested from femur, tibia, and crista iliaca. CLP gates were determined with the strategy described previously (23Karsunky H. Inlay M.A. Serwold T. Bhattacharya D. Weissman I.L. Blood. 2008; 111: 5562-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the following PECy5-conjugated antibodies were used for lineage: Gr-1 (RB6–8C5), Mac-1 (M1/70), Ter-119, CD3 (17A2, BD), CD19 (6D5), and B220 (RA3–6B2). The remaining antibodies were Sca-1 FITC (E13–161.7), Kit APC (2B8), and Flt-3 PE (A2F10, eBioscience). Il-7R was detected by biotin conjugate (A7R34, eBioscience) and visualized by streptavidin PECy7. All antibodies unless otherwise indicated were purchased from BioLegend, and clone names are shown in parentheses. Before sorting with FACSAria Special Order SystemTM (BD Biosciences), whole BM was enriched for Kit+ cells by labeling with Kit/CD117 MicroBeads and separation by MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Dead cells were stained with propidium iodide (Invitrogen) and excluded by electronic gating. Negative staining controls were used to distinguish positive and negative populations. BaF3 were transduced in RetroNectin-coated 6-well plates with Il-7R-GFP (24Medina K.L. Pongubala J.M. Reddy K.L. Lancki D.W. Dekoter R. Kieslinger M. Grosschedl R. Singh H. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) retrovirus generated by transient transfection of Phoenix-Ampho packaging cells and sorted for expression of GFP with FACSAria. Stably transduced GFP+ cells were electroporated with a Flt-3 encoding LXSN6 vector backbone and selected with 600 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). After selection, the cells were resorted for expression of GFP and Flt-3 with BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences) to obtain BaF3 Flt-3,Il-7Rα cells. Next, BaF3Flt-3,Il-7Rα cells were stained with Flt-3 PE (A2F10, eBioscience), and Il-7R biotin conjugate (A7R34, eBioscience, visualized by streptavidin PECy7), and double-positive cells were sorted with FACSAria Special Order SystemTM (BD Biosciences). Phoenix-Ampho were transfected at 60–80% confluency with either constitutively active Stat-5A (caStat-5A) pMXs-puro or pMXs-puro viral expression vectors and pGag-Pol and pVSV-G encoding plasmids. 48 h after transfection, 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) was added to the growth medium, and after 1 week of selection, virus supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells were suspended in 1 volume of growth medium plus 1 volume of filtered virus supernatant, after which Polybrene (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 3 μg/ml. Cells were centrifuged for 1.5 h at 25 °C, 1200 × g and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The medium was replenished 18–20 h following infection, and 36 h after infection, cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 10 days. BaF3caStat-5,Flt-3 were produced in the same fashion. An initial infection with caStat-5A pMXs-puro vector and selection with puromycin was followed by a second infection with Flt-3 LXSN6 vector backbone and selection with 600 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) for 10 days. BaF3, BaF3Flt-3,Il-7Rα, and BaF3caStat-5,Flt-3 cells were cytokine deprived for 16 h and then seeded at a density of 10,000 or 50,000 cells/ml and supplemented with 1, 2, 5, or 10 ng/ml of murine recombinant cytokines Flt-3L and Il-7 (both from PeproTech). Cells receiving WEHI-3, or no stimulants, were seeded as controls. Viable cells were counted at 48- or 72-h intervals using trypan blue exclusion. For primary cell in vitro proliferation experiments, CLPs sorted into complete growth media were seeded in 4400 cells in 200 μl of media in 96-well plates with 10 ng/ml of Flt-3L and/or Il-7. Viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion. For quantitative real time PCRs (qPCR), CLPs were seeded 16,000/ml with 10 ng/ml Flt3-L and/or IL-7 and harvested after 24 h. For single cell studies, CLPs were sorted into complete growth media supplemented with cytokines, and cells were then manually plated to achieve a density of one cell/well in Terasaki plates. BaF3Flt-3,Il-7Rα mRNA and primary cell mRNA were extracted using RNeasy® mini kit and RNeasy® micro kit, respectively (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and DNase treatment was included. cDNA was generated by annealing total RNA to random primers (45 min at 40 °C and 5 min at 95 °C) in reaction mixture containing 1× first strand buffer, 7.5 mm DTT, 250 ng of random primer (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mm dNTP (Roche Applied Science), 1 unit/μl RNaseOUT, and 5 units/μl SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase (all reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated). Quantitative real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, 7700 sequence detection system) was performed by mixing 2× TaqMan Universal PCR master mix, 20× hydrolysis probe and primer, RNase-free H2O, and 3 μl of cDNA (all reagents were from Applied Biosystems). The reaction was initiated by holding for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. For primary cells, cDNA corresponding to 250 cells was used for each reaction (Applied Biosystems, 7900 sequence detection system), and the number of cycles increased to 45. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and was normalized to reference gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Nontemplate controls were used for all samples. Relative RNA quantification was calculated using the comparative 2−ΔΔCT method (25Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). The following TaqMan hydrolysis probe and primers (Applied Biosystems) were used: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, Mm00446968_ml; Bcl-XL, Mm00437783_ml; Bcl-2, Mm00477631_ml; Bad, Mm00432042_ml; and Bim, Mm01333921_m1. Cytokine- deprived BaF3Flt-3,Il-7Rα cells stimulated with 2 ng of Flt-3L + 2 ng of Il-7/ml were harvested after 24 and 36 h and stained for viability and apoptosis using annexinV-APC (BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (Invitrogen). Ten thousand events were acquired using FACSCalibur and analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). CLPs were sorted as described above and immediately labeled with CFSE (Invitrogen). A small aliquot of labeled cells was taken immediately after staining to determine the starting intensity of the labeled cells. Remaining cells were then divided into nine individual wells, 8000 cells/well, and stimulated in triplicate with 10 ng/ml Flt-3L, 10 ng/ml Il-7, or 10 ng/ml Flt-3L and Il-7. Equal volume aliquots were then taken from all individual wells after proper resuspension and analyzed with FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) for CFSE intensity after 24, 48, and 70 h of incubation. At 48 and 70 h, samples were also stained with annexinV-APC (BD Biosciences) to investigate the fraction of pro-apoptotic cells under the different stimulation conditions. For protein extraction, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and immediately resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm Na3VO4. Samples were centrifuged 1000 × g for 2 min and supernatant was mixed with 1× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 0.01 m DTT. Samples were heated at 70 °C for 10 min before separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a HybondP PVDF transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk PBS/Tween or 5% BSA TBS/Tween for 1 h at room temperature and next incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or at 8 °C overnight. Following block, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). The following antibodies were used: phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), ERK (p44/p42), and phospho-STAT-5 (Tyr-694) were all from Cell Signaling Technology. Phospho-Foxo3a (Thr-32) was from Upstate Biotechnology, and Foxo3a antibody was from Abcam. Phospho-Akt (Ser-473) was from BIOSOURCE, and Akt antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody was from Millipore. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Although the overall readout of lymphoid development in mice deficient in Flt-3 and Il-7R signaling (15Sitnicka E. Brakebusch C. Martensson I.L. Svensson M. Agace W.W. Sigvardsson M. Buza-Vidas N.

Lyman S.D. Rottapel R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggests a collaborative function of these cytokines (15Sitnicka E. Brakebusch C. Martensson I.L. Svensson M. Agace W.W. Sigvardsson M. Buza-Vidas N. Bryder D. Cilio C.M. Ahlenius H. Maraskovsky E. Peschon J.J. Jacobsen S.E. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it is unclear if they act in a sequential or direct synergistic manner. In the first scenario, the lack of Flt-3 function reduces the number of cells developing into the Il-7-dependent stage resulting in an enhanced phenotype, whereas in the second scenario, the factors act in a synergy at the molecular level on the same cell. To investigate this issue, we sorted Lin−Sca-1lowKitlowFlt-3+Il-7R+ BM cells, known to represent a lymphoid restricted progenitor cell (Fig. 1A) (23Karsunky H. Inlay M.A. Serwold T. Bhattacharya D. Weissman I.L. Blood. 2008; 111: 5562-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and investigated the ability of Flt-3L, Il-7, or both to stimulate growth and expansion of cells in short term in vitro cultures (Fig. 1B). The inclusion of Flt-3L alone did not stimulate expansion, although Il-7 stimulated approximately a 6-fold increase in cell numbers. Inclusion of both cytokines resulted in an increased growth, generating more cells than either of the cytokines alone. Although it is difficult to exclude differentiation and selection of specific subpopulations, these data suggest that the two cytokines are able to act in synergy on the same cells. To investigate this further, we stably transduced the hematopoietic progenitor cell line BaF3 (22Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) with retroviral vectors expressing Flt-3 or the Il-7Rα subunit needed to make use of the endogenously expressed common γ chain to form a functional Il-7 receptor. Double-positive cells were selected through cell sorting based on Il-7R and Flt-3 surface expression (Fig. 2A) allowing us to create a stable system where stage-dependent sequential activities should not pose a complicating factor for the interpretation of the data. To investigate if the transduced receptors could mediate a functional response to the cytokines, we incubated the original BaF3 and the BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells (10,000 cells each per ml in 24-well plates) either with Il-3-containing media or Flt-3L and Il-7 (Fig. 2B). Viable cells, as judged by the ability to exclude trypan blue, were counted after 2, 4, 7, and 9 days of incubation. After 2 days, the number of BaF3 cells incubated with Il-3 had reached a 14.5-fold increase in cell number, a 100-fold increase at 4 days, and 550-fold increase at day 7. Incubation of BaF3 cells with Flt-3L and Il-7 resulted in a reduction to one-fifth of seeded cells at day 2, although no living cells could be detected after 4 or 7 days of incubation. Conducting the same experiment using the BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells resulted in similar expansions upon incubation with Il-3-containing media (22-fold day 2, 72-fold day 4, and 580-fold day 7), although the incubation with Flt-3L and Il-7 resulted in a 5-fold expansion at day 2, 31-fold at day 4, and 315-fold expansion after 7 days of incubation. In the absence of cytokines, the cells stopped growing, and the majority died after 4–5 days (data not shown). Thus, ectopic expression of Flt-3 and Il-7Rα allows for a functional response to the cytokines in vitro. To investigate the individual functions of Flt-3L and Il-7 as well as their ability to act in direct synergy, we incubated BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells with 1 ng of Flt-3L/ml resulting in a 2.7-fold expansion after 2 days and a 3.7-fold expansion at day 4 (Fig. 2C). The addition of 1 ng/ml Il-7 resulted in 2.3- and 11-fold expansion at 2 and 4 days, respectively. Thus, both Flt-3L and Il-7 have the ability to stimulate survival and expansion of BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells. Incubation of the BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells with the combination of 1 ng/ml Flt-3L and 1 ng/ml Il-7 resulted in an almost 6-fold expansion of cell numbers at day 2 and 59-fold increase at day 4 (Fig. 2C). These data reveal that Flt-3L and Il-7 were able to synergistically stimulate the expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells. This functional synergy became even more obvious when the concentrations of individual cytokines were doubled to 2 ng/ml, providing further evidence for the functional synergy. The inclusion of 10 ng/ml of either Flt-3L or Il-7 resulted in an 8.5- and 50-fold increase in cell numbers, respectively, after 4 days of incubation, whereas 5 ng/ml of the cytokines in combination resulted in a 118-fold expansion of cell numbers after 4 days (Fig. 2C). Thus, Flt-3L and Il-7 were able to act in direct synergy to drive expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor population.FIGURE 2Flt-3L and Il-7 exhibit a synergistic proliferative effect on stably transfected BaF3Flt-3+Il-7R+ cells. A, BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells were stained for Flt-3 and Il-7R to distinguish double-positive cells (left panel). Unstained BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R (center panel) and Flt-3 and Il-7R-stained BaF3 (right panel) are displayed as negative controls. B, BaF3 and BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells were cultured with Flt-3L (10 ng/ml) and Il-7 (10 ng/ml), and the proliferative response was evaluated by counting viable cells using trypan blue exclusion at the indicated time points. Cells expanded with Il-3 containing WEHI-3 are included as controls. Error bars represent S.D. of three wells. C, individual and combined effects of Flt-3L and Il-7 on BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion after 2 and 4 days of culture.

Error bars represent S.D. of six wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An expansion of cells could be a result of increased proliferation, but it could also involve anti-apoptotic effects working in conjunction with proliferation to expand a cell population. It has been suggested that both Flt-3L and Il-7 promote cell survival, and to investigate if the stimulation with these factors had any direct effect on apoptosis and apoptosis-related genes in the BaF3 cells, we incubated BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells with and without cytokines for 24 and 36 h. Although the percentage of annexinV-positive cells was around 10% in the cytokine-stimulated cells at both time points, the corresponding figures for the control cells incubated in medium without cytokines were 22 and 33%, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). To investigate differences in the expression of apoptosis-related genes, we performed qPCR of Bcl-2 family member genes. Although the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl was largely unaffected, the expression of Mcl-1 was reduced upon incubation of BaF3Flt-3,Il-7R cells with Flt-3L and Il-7 (supplemental Fig. 1). Flt-3L, Il-7, or Flt-3L/Il-7 stimulation resulted in a reduction in expression of the pro-apoptotic genes Bad and Bim (Fig. 4A). The effect was at the most additive because the reduction obtained with either of the cytokines was comparable with that observed with both factors. This indicates that co-stimulation with Flt-3L and Il-7 reduces apoptosis of BaF3 cells and that this is associated with a reduction in expression of pro-apoptotic genes rather than induction of anti-apoptotic genes. To investigate if the two cytokines had any effect on the expression of Bad in primary cells, we stimulated CLPs with either Flt-3L, Il-7, or both for 24 h and analyzed the mRNA expression of Bad with qPCR (Fig. 4B). Stimulation with either of the two cytokines prevented up-regulation of Bad, an effect not dramatically affected by combining the two cytokines. This indicates that both Flt-3L and Il-7 promote cell survival, and because no apparent synergy could be observed, it appears that the major cause of the functional synergy with regard to cell expansion is increased proliferation. To investigate this further, we incubated CLPs plated at single cell density either with Flt-3L, Il-7, or both in Terasaki plates. After 48 h of incubation, the wells with visible cells were counted, and the clone size was estimated (Fig. 5). Although ∼18% of the wells stimulated with Il-7 contained a detectable cell or a small clone 48 h after plating, the corresponding figure for Flt-3L-stimulated cells was 29%. In the cultures incubated with the combination of the cytokines, more than 60% of the wells contained cells or small colonies. After 72 h of incubation, the percentage of wells with small clones was slightly lower; however, stimulation with either Il-7 or the combination of Il-7 and Flt-3L resulted in the generation of clones with more than 20 cells. However, although only about 3% of the Il-7-stimulated cells had generated clones of this size after 72 h, the combined stimulation generated about 12% of these clones and about 2% of clones containing more than 50 cells. The difference was persistent after 96 and 120 h where the percentage of large clones was higher in the Flt-3L +Il-7-stimulated cells than when Il-7 alone was added. We were unable to detect any clones"

IntroductionComplexin 1, originally identified as synaphin, is a small cytosolic protein that associates with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes, which are essential to drive membrane fusion during neurotransmitter exocytosis (1Li L. Chin L.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 942-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Söllner T.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although complexin 1 is expressed exclusively in neurons, complexin 2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed and presumably functions in other secretory cell systems. Complexins 1 and 2 are highly homologous, each containing 134 amino acids that are 86% identical (3Brose N. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, rat, mouse, and human complexin 2 proteins are 100% identical, although the nucleotide sequences of their mRNAs are considerably different (4McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Recently, two other isoforms, complexins 3 and 4, were identified; however, evidence of their specific function is unclear. Complexin 3 is expressed strongly in retina and certain regions of the brain including the hippocampus and thalamus, whereas complexin 4 is only expressed in retina (5Reim K. Wegmeyer H.

Complexin 1 was originally thought to clamp SNARE complexes at a prefusion step, thereby inhibiting exocytosis (7Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E.

Biol. 2008; 15: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Upon elevation of intracellular Ca2+, complexin 1 was proposed to be displaced from the SNARE complex by synaptotagmin 1, in turn allowing the final stages of neurotransmitter release to commence (7Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that in addition to this clamping activity, complexin 1 also directly facilitates the final stages of exocytosis (9Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. J.

Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Xue et al. conducted a detailed mutational analysis of complexin 1 SNARE binding and secretory function demonstrating that although the central α-helix is essential for SNARE binding, the adjacent accessory α-helix has a negative effect, and the N terminus a positive effect on exocytosis (17Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Maximov et al. reported more recently that complexin 1 functions in neurons by simultaneously suppressing spontaneous vesicle fusion and activating fast Ca2+-stimulated fusion. Further evidence was provided to support that complexin 1 binding controls the force that trans-SNARE complexes apply onto opposing membranes to facilitate their fusion (18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Südhof T.C. Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).The majority of work conducted thus far has utilized complexin 1 in in vitro liposome fusion assays or neuronal systems. Studies on complexin 2 in neural, chromaffin, and mast cells indicate that this isoform also plays a functional role in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (9Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2239-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. Cell. Immunol. 2010; 261: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Cai H.

However, comparably less is understood about complexin 2 in secretory cells which express isoforms of the neuronal SNAREs including SNAP 23 and various VAMPs, syntaxins, synaptotagmins, and/or synaptotagmin-like proteins. Tadokoro et al. demonstrated that knockdown of complexin 2 expression in RBL-2H3 mast cells attenuated Ca2+-dependent degranulation (9Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2239-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and GST-complexin 2 was shown to interact with SNAP 23, syntaxin 3, VAMP 2, and to a lesser extent VAMP 8 in cell lysates (19Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. Cell. Immunol. 2010; 261: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Pancreatic acinar cells are a prototypical model of exocrine secretory cells that respond to elevated intracellular Ca2+ by stimulating exocytosis of digestive enzymes necessary for the assimilation of the diet. These cells contain at least two populations of zymogen secretory granules (ZGs) based on their expressions of VAMP 2 or 8 (22Weng N. Thomas D.D. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9635-9645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further, both VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 differentially modulate Ca2+-stimulated secretion with VAMP 2-containing ZGs mediating the earliest stages and VAMP 8 the later stages of the secretory response. In the present study we examined a potential role for complexin 2 in modulating digestive enzyme secretion in acinar cells. Results indicate that complexin 2 is concentrated along the apical plasma membrane and interacts with SNARE complexes containing VAMP 2 and syntaxins 3 and 4. Use of site-specific and truncation mutants of complexin 2 regulatory domains in permeabilized cells indicates that the molecule has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Ca2+-stimulated secretion, providing molecular evidence of complexin 2 function outside of the nervous system.DISCUSSIONThe current findings establish a role for complexin 2 in acinar secretion and suggest that it interacts preferentially with ternary SNARE complexes containing VAMP 2, syntaxin 3, and syntaxin 4. Similar to the SNARE-clamping effects of complexin 1 in neurons (7Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 35Schaub J.R. Lu X. Doneske B. Shin Y.K. McNew J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), complexin 2 inhibited Ca2+-dependent secretion when introduced into permeabilized acini. Results that complexin 2 was most highly expressed in acinar cytosolic fractions with small amounts present in membranes are consistent with its immunofluorescence localization at the apical plasma membrane and absence on basolateral membranes. Moreover, the apical localization of complexin 2 together with SNARE proteins is clearly in line with a fundamental role for the protein in the secretory pathway of pancreatic acinar cells.Demonstration that complexin 2 interacts with SNARE complexes containing VAMP 2 and syntaxin 4 is in agreement with previous studies showing that GST-VAMP 2 interacts with syntaxin 4 in acini (31Wang C.C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 32Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Cosen-Binker L.I. Binker M.G. Wang C.C. Hong W. Gaisano H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2535-2551PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we reported previously that syntaxin 4 is the primary syntaxin isoform regulating Ca2+-dependent secretion, whereas syntaxin 2 is involved mainly in basal secretion (22Weng N. Thomas D.D. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9635-9645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of syntaxin 4 in acinar secretion remains controversial, as Pickett et al. (37Pickett J.A. Campos-Toimil M. Thomas P. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that syntaxin 2 rather than syntaxin 4 is the major syntaxin for secretion. These results are partially supported by evidence that syntaxin 2 coimmunoprecipitated with VAMP 2 from acinar cell membranes (36Cosen-Binker L.I. Binker M.G. Wang C.C. Hong W. Gaisano H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2535-2551PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, when evaluated in vitro using recombinant proteins, no association of complexin 1 or 2 with SNARE complexes containing syntaxin 4 was found (13Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Malsam J. Seiler F. Schollmeier Y. Rusu P. Krause J.M. Söllner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction with syntaxin 4 seen in acini may involve additional regulatory proteins.The association of GST-complexin 2 with syntaxin 3 is intriguing because this SNARE primarily localizes to ZGs in acini (32Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in ZG-ZG compound exocytosis (38Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Further, syntaxin 3 was shown to coimmunoprecipitate VAMP 8 but not VAMP 2 in acini (36Cosen-Binker L.I. Binker M.G. Wang C.C. Hong W. Gaisano H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2535-2551PubMed Google Scholar). Complexin 2 did not copurify with ZGs, indicating that its association with syntaxin 3 likely occurs transiently during secretory stimulation. These findings together with evidence that complexin 2 localization is clearly present along apical membrane regions independent of VAMP 2 support that complexin 2 also participates in either ternary SNARE complexes independent of VAMP 2 and/or binary complexes involving SNAP 23 and syntaxin 3 or 4 (see below). Because acini express multiple isoforms of syntaxins including 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 within the secretory pathway (31Wang C.C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), more detailed genetic deletion studies will be necessary to delineate fully the precise role of each molecule as well as their potential regulation by complexin 2.Acinar cells express two major isoforms of vesicle SNAREs, VAMP 2 and 8, which localize to ZGs (22Weng N. Thomas D.D. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9635-9645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Wang C.C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our findings that GST-complexin 2 preferentially interacts with SNARE complexes containing VAMP 2 were clearly supported by their colocalization at the apical membrane under basal and stimulated conditions. Acinar secretion proceeds as an initial peak phase within the first minute of stimulation and then declines to a plateau phase over several minutes, which is sustained in the presence of secretagogue (39Singh P. Asada I. Owlia A. Collins T.J. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1988; 254: G217-G223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern of exocytosis was first described using sequential secretory measures in isolated cells (40Fujita-Yoshigaki J. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 204: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and later quantified at the cellular level by membrane capacitance measures and differential interference contrast microscopy (41Chen Y. Warner J.D. Yule D.I. Giovannucci D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1209-C1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Localization of VAMP 2 at the most apical aspects of acini is consistent with our previous report that VAMP 2-positive ZGs mediate the initial secretory response (22Weng N. Thomas D.D. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9635-9645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Results that complexin 2 also localizes to the apical membrane under basal conditions are compatible with the known SNARE-clamping activity of complexins in neurons which allows for the synchronous release of neurotransmitters (7Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 35Schaub J.R. Lu X. Doneske B. Shin Y.K. McNew J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although evidence to support synchronous exocytosis in acini is lacking, it is conceivable that complexin 2 functions analogously outside the nervous system to support the initial rapid peak phase of secretion.Consistent with Xue et al., who characterized complexin 1 function in complexin 1/2 double knock-out neurons (17Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the single mutant R48L and double mutant R48L/R59H of complexin 2 showed reduced SNARE binding and when introduced into permeabilized acini, lost the ability to inhibit Ca2+-stimulated secretion. However, unlike complexin 1 in neurons where the single R59H mutation also reduced SNARE binding and secretory activity, this same mutation in complexin 2 showed only a small statistically nonsignificant reduction in SNARE binding yet significantly enhanced Ca2+-stimulated secretion by 130% of control. Although these results are clearly in line with complexins having both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in exocytosis, they were nonetheless surprising as the central α-helical domain (amino acids 48–70) is thought to be necessary for SNARE binding but not sufficient to modulate secretion (17Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Südhof T.C. Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–29) is thought to be essential to stimulate secretion, we removed this domain and the first 12 residues of the inhibitory domain of complexin 2 (complexin 241–134), which in neurons retains normal SNARE binding but fails to modulate secretion (17Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Südhof T.C. Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, in acini the complexin 241–134 truncation lost all SNARE binding and correspondingly all secretory activity.Explanations for these differences in complexin SNARE binding and secretory activity in acini versus neurons are uncertain. Unlike studies conducted in complexin 1/2-deficient neurons (17Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Südhof T.C. Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the current experiments were performed in cells that express endogenous complexin 2. Thus, complexin 2 constructs added to lysates or permeabilized cells must compete with endogenous protein for SNARE binding. Although complexin 241–134 contains the minimal SNARE binding domain, its affinity for the SNARE complex may be diminished compared with the endogenous WT protein.The stimulatory effect of the R59H mutant remains enigmatic as this mutation is within the SNARE binding region and outside the stimulatory domain. Although compelling evidence demonstrates a stimulatory role for the N-terminal domain in neurons (17Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Südhof T.C. Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), Malsam et al. reported that the C-terminal half of complexin 1 was necessary to stimulate liposome fusion in vitro (21Malsam J. Seiler F. Schollmeier Y. Rusu P. Krause J.M. Söllner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This suggests that complexins may have more structurally diverse effects on membrane fusion depending on the experimental approach. For example, it is important to consider that the stimulatory effects of complexin 1 in neurons are based largely on the concerted interactions of both complexin 1 and synaptotagmin 1 with the ternary SNARE complex during the final stages of membrane fusion (18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Südhof T.C. Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Liposome fusion studies by Malsam et al. (21Malsam J. Seiler F. Schollmeier Y. Rusu P. Krause J.M. Söllner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) did not include synaptotagmin in the fusion reactions. Notwithstanding the obvious differences in SNARE isoform expression between neural and exocrine tissues, the calcium sensor(s) that drives exocytosis in acini as well as the accessory proteins that promote vesicle docking and priming are largely unknown. These uncertainties create considerable ambiguity when comparing acini with other secretory systems.Our results that VAMP 2 accumulates along the plasma membrane and within the actin terminal web under basal conditions suggest that significant numbers of VAMP 2-positive ZGs are both docked at the plasma membrane and tethered to the subapical actin filaments. Indeed, Braun et al. previously demonstrated that disruption of actin filaments abolished the apical accumulation of VAMP 2-positive ZGs in acini (33Braun J.E. Fritz B.A. Wong S.M. Lowe A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5328-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complexin 2 was localized primarily inside the actin filaments and along the plasma membrane and showed clear colocalization with VAMP 2 particularly with CCK-8 stimulation. However, significant amounts of complexin 2 were also juxtaposed to VAMP 2 in apical regions. These results support that complexin 2 not only colocalized in ternary SNARE complexes containing VAMP 2, but also occupied adjacent membrane regions. Although we saw no interaction with VAMP 8 in biochemical assays and detected very sparse localization of VAMP 8 on the plasma membrane under basal conditions, we cannot fully rule out a complexin 2 association with an additional ternary SNARE complex. Evidence that complexins also bind with lower affinity to t-SNARE complexes composed of SNAP 25 and syntaxin in vitro (4McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 8Yoon T.Y. Lu X. Diao J. Lee S.M. Ha T. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Tokumaru H. Umayahara K. Pellegrini L.L. Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Abe T. Cell. 2001; 104: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) creates the additional possibility that these intermediates exist in intact cells. Thus, it is possible that complexin 2 associates with SNAP 23 and syntaxin 3 or 4 on the plasma membrane prior to ternary SNARE formation. The lack of availability of affinity-purified complexin 2 polyclonal antibodies for fluorophore conjugation precluded our ability to study its colocalization with polyclonal antibodies to VAMP 8, SNAP 23, and syntaxin 2, 3, or 4.ZG exocytosis is a highly regulated process integral to the robust secretory capacity of the pancreas. Secretion is absolutely dependent on elevated Ca2+ but is also modulated by a variety of additional cellular messengers (42Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 361-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its essential role in secretion, aberrant alterations in Ca2+ signaling have been shown to precipitate the onset of experimental pancreatitis in rodents (43Sutton R. Criddle D. Raraty M.G. Tepikin A. Neoptolemos J.P. Petersen O.H. Pancreatology. 2003; 3: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These alterations include a complete inhibition of apical secretion, redirected ZG exocytosis at the basolateral membrane, and the mixing of proteolytic zymogens with lysosomal enzymes (44Saluja A.K. Lerch M.M. Phillips P.A. Dudeja V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 249-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The current study uncovers a unique regulatory mechanism governing Ca2+-dependent secretion in acini and paves the way for future studies focused on better understanding the specific role of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion events in normal and disease states. IntroductionComplexin 1, originally identified as synaphin, is a small cytosolic protein that associates with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes, which are essential to drive membrane fusion during neurotransmitter exocytosis (1Li L. Chin L.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 942-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Söllner T.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although complexin 1 is expressed exclusively in neurons, complexin 2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed and presumably functions in other secretory cell systems. Complexins 1 and 2 are highly homologous, each containing 134 amino acids that are 86% identical (3Brose N. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, rat, mouse, and human complexin 2 proteins are 100% identical, although the nucleotide sequences of their mRNAs are considerably different (4McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Recently, two other isoforms, complexins 3 and 4, were identified; however, evidence of their specific function is unclear. Complexin 3 is expressed strongly in retina and certain regions of the brain including the hippocampus and thalamus, whereas complexin 4 is only expressed in retina (5Reim K. Wegmeyer H.

Complexin 1 was originally thought to clamp SNARE complexes at a prefusion step, thereby inhibiting exocytosis (7Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E.

Upon elevation of intracellular Ca2+, complexin 1 was proposed to be displaced from the SNARE complex by synaptotagmin 1, in turn allowing the final stages of neurotransmitter release to commence (7Giraudo C.G.

Xue et al. conducted a detailed mutational analysis of complexin 1 SNARE binding and secretory function demonstrating that although the central α-helix is essential for SNARE binding, the adjacent accessory α-helix has a negative effect, and the N terminus a positive effect on exocytosis (17Xue M.

Maximov et al. reported more recently that complexin 1 functions in neurons by simultaneously suppressing spontaneous vesicle fusion and activating fast Ca2+-stimulated fusion. Further evidence was provided to support that complexin 1 binding controls the force that trans-SNARE complexes apply onto opposing membranes to facilitate their fusion (18Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X.

Studies on complexin 2 in neural, chromaffin, and mast cells indicate that this isoform also plays a functional role in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (9Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. J.

However, comparably less is understood about complexin 2 in secretory cells which express isoforms of the neuronal SNAREs including SNAP 23 and various VAMPs, syntaxins, synaptotagmins, and/or synaptotagmin-like proteins. Tadokoro et al. demonstrated that knockdown of complexin 2 expression in RBL-2H3 mast cells attenuated Ca2+-dependent degranulation (9Tadokoro S. Nakanishi M. Hirashima N. J.

These cells contain at least two populations of zymogen secretory granules (ZGs) based on their expressions of VAMP 2 or 8 (22Weng N. Thomas D.D. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9635-9645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further, both VAMP 2 and VAMP 8 differentially modulate Ca2+-stimulated secretion with VAMP 2-containing ZGs mediating the earliest stages and VAMP 8 the later stages of the secretory response. In the present study we examined a potential role for complexin 2 in modulating digestive enzyme secretion in acinar cells. Results indicate that complexin 2 is concentrated along the apical plasma membrane and interacts with SNARE complexes containing VAMP 2 and syntaxins 3 and 4. Use of site-specific and truncation mutants of complexin 2 regulatory domains in permeabilized cells indicates that the molecule has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Ca2+-stimulated secretion, providing molecular evidence of complexin 2 function outside of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1989291464,"Streptococcus pneumoniae are commensals of the human nasopharynx with the capacity to invade mucosal respiratory cells. PspC, a pneumococcal surface protein, interacts with the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) to promote bacterial adherence to and invasion into epithelial cells. Internalization of pneumococci requires the coordinated action of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and the retrograde machinery of pIgR. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of Src protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in pneumococcal invasion via pIgR. Pharmacological inhibitors of PTKs and MAPKs and genetic interference with Src PTK and FAK functions caused a significant reduction of pIgR-mediated pneumococcal invasion but did not influence bacterial adhesion to host cells. Furthermore, pneumococcal ingestion by host cells induces activation of ERK1/2 and JNK. In agreement with activated JNK, its target molecule and DNA-binding protein c-Jun was phosphorylated. We also show that functionally active Src PTK is essential for activation of ERK1/2 upon pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, these data illustrate the importance of a coordinated signaling between Src PTKs, ERK1/2, and JNK during PspC-pIgR-mediated uptake of pneumococci by host epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047006960,"Eukaryotic mRNAs are generally considered monocistronic and encode only one protein. Although dicistronic mRNAs encoding two proteins were found in fungi, plants, and animals, polycistronic mRNAs encoding more than two proteins have remained elusive so far in any eukaryote. Here we demonstrate that a single mRNA from silkworm encodes the precursor of an insect cytokine paralytic peptide (PP) and two new cytokine precursor-like proteins, uENF1 and uENF2. RT-PCR analysis showed that this mRNA is widely conserved in moths. Western blot analyses and reporter assays using its modified mRNAs, created by replacing each one of the three ORFs with the firefly luciferase ORF, showed that all three proteins were translated from this mRNA in cell lines, larval tissues, and cell-free systems. Insertion experiments using the <i>Renilla</i> luciferase ORF or a stem loop ruled out the possible involvement of internal ribosome entry site in the three protein translation. On the other hand, systematic mutation analysis of the translation initiation sequence of the 5′-proximal <i>uENF1</i> ORF suggested that the context-dependent leaky-scanning mechanism is involved in translation of the downstream <i>uENF2</i> and <i>PP</i> ORFs. <i>In vitro</i>, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative mature form of uENF1 stimulated spreading of hemocytes as did the synthetic PP, whereas that of uENF2 antagonized the stimulating activities of PP and the uENF1 peptide, suggesting that the three proteins control cellular immunity interactively. Thus, eukaryotes have a cellular tricistronic mRNA that encodes three functionally related proteins as in an operon."
https://openalex.org/W2057985370,"Wind setdown is the drop in water level caused by wind stress acting on the surface of a body of water for an extended period of time. As the wind blows, water recedes from the upwind shore and exposes terrain that was formerly underwater. Previous researchers have suggested wind setdown as a possible hydrodynamic explanation for Moses crossing the Red Sea, as described in Exodus 14.This study analyzes the hydrodynamic mechanism proposed by earlier studies, focusing on the time needed to reach a steady-state solution. In addition, the authors investigate a site in the eastern Nile delta, where the ancient Pelusiac branch of the Nile once flowed into a coastal lagoon then known as the Lake of Tanis. We conduct a satellite and modeling survey to analyze this location, using geological evidence of the ancient bathymetry and a historical description of a strong wind event in 1882. A suite of model experiments are performed to demonstrate a new hydrodynamic mechanism that can cause an angular body of water to divide under wind stress, and to test the behavior of our study location and reconstructed topography.Under a uniform 28 m/s easterly wind forcing in the reconstructed model basin, the ocean model produces an area of exposed mud flats where the river mouth opens into the lake. This land bridge is 3-4 km long and 5 km wide, and it remains open for 4 hours. Model results indicate that navigation in shallow-water harbors can be significantly curtailed by wind setdown when strong winds blow offshore."
https://openalex.org/W2082313967,"Because T cell differentiation leads to an expanded repertoire of chemokine receptors, a subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors, we hypothesized that the repertoire of G proteins might be altered in parallel. We analyzed the abundance of mRNA and/or protein of six G protein α-subunits in human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets from blood. Although most G protein α-subunits were similarly expressed in all subsets, the abundance of Gα(o), a protein not previously described in hematopoietic cells, was much higher in memory versus naive cells. Consistent with these data, activation of naive CD4(+) T cells in vitro significantly increased the abundance of Gα(o) in cells stimulated under nonpolarizing or T(H)17 (but not T(H)1 or T(H)2)-polarizing conditions. In functional studies, the use of a chimeric G protein α-subunit, Gα(qo5), demonstrated that chemokine receptors could couple to Gα(o)-containing G proteins. We also found that Gα(i1), another α-subunit not described previously in leukocytes, was expressed in naive T cells but virtually absent from memory subsets. Corresponding to their patterns of expression, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gα(o) in memory (but not naive) and Gα(i1) in naive (but not memory) CD4(+) T cells inhibited chemokine-dependent migration. Moreover, although even in Gα(o)- and Gα(i1)-expressing cells mRNAs of these α-subunits were much less abundant than Gα(i2) or Gα(i3), knockdown of any of these subunits impaired chemokine receptor-mediated migration similarly. Together, our data reveal a change in the repertoire of Gα(i/o) subunits during T cell differentiation and suggest functional equivalence among Gα(i/o) subunits irrespective of their relative abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2029218934,"Protein-protein interactions and/or signaling activities at focal adhesions, where integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix occurs, are critical for the regulation of adhesion-dependent cellular functions. Although the phosphorylation and activities of focal adhesion molecules have been intensively studied, the effects of the O-GlcNAc modification of their Ser/Thr residues on cellular functions have been largely unexplored. We investigated the effects of O-GlcNAc modification on actin reorganization and morphology of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells after glucosamine (GlcN) treatment. We found that paxillin, a key adaptor molecule in focal adhesions, could be modified by O-GlcNAc in INS-1 cells treated with GlcN and in pancreatic islets from mice treated with streptozotocin. Ser-84/85 in human paxillin appeared to be modified by O-GlcNAc, which was inversely correlated to Ser-85 phosphorylation (Ser-83 in rat paxillin). Integrin-mediated adhesion signaling inhibited the GlcN treatment-enhanced O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin. Adherent INS-1 cells treated with GlcN showed restricted protrusions, whereas untreated cells showed active protrusions for multiple-elongated morphologies. Upon GlcN treatment, expression of a triple mutation (S83A/S84A/S85A) resulted in no further restriction of protrusions. Together these observations suggest that murine pancreatic β cells may have restricted actin organization upon GlcN treatment by virtue of the O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin, which can be antagonized by a persistent cell adhesion process."
https://openalex.org/W2024595074,"We previously reported the identification of small serine/threonine kinase (SSTK) that is expressed in postmeiotic germ cells, associates with HSP90, and is indispensable for male fertility. Sperm from SSTK-null mice cannot fertilize eggs in vitro and are incapable of fusing with eggs that lack zona pellucida. Here, using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we have discovered a novel SSTK-interacting protein (SIP) that is expressed exclusively in testis. The gene encoding SIP is restricted to mammals and encodes a 125-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted tetratricopeptide repeat domain. SIP is co-localized with SSTK in the cytoplasm of spermatids as they undergo restructuring and chromatin condensation, but unlike SSTK, is not retained in the mature sperm. SIP binds to SSTK with high affinity (Kd ∼10 nm), and the proteins associate with each other when co-expressed in cells. In vitro, SIP inhibited SSTK kinase activity, whereas the presence of SIP in cells resulted in enzymatic activation of SSTK without affecting Akt or MAPK activity. SIP was found to be associated with cellular HSP70, and analyses with purified proteins revealed that SIP directly bound HSP70. Importantly, SSTK recruited SIP onto HSP90, and treatment of cells with the specific HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, completely abolished SSTK catalytic activity.

To identify potential regulators of SSTK activity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and discovered a novel male germ cell-specific protein that localizes and binds with SSTK. This SSTK-interacting protein (SIP) is limited to mammals and possesses a predicted single TPR domain. SIP directly binds to HSP70, is found associated with HSP70 and HSP90 in cells, and facilitates HSP90-dependent enzymatic activation of SSTK. Accordingly, we have designated SIP as a cochaperone that assists in the conformational maturation of SSTK. These findings are the first demonstration of a germ cell-specific cochaperone and protein kinase that requires the HSP90 machinery for catalytic activation. [32P]ATP and enhanced chemiluminescence kit were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. MAP4K4 was purchased from Invitrogen, and histone 2A and GSK-3 fusion protein were obtained from Upstate Biotech Millipore (Lake Placid, NY) and Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), respectively. Purified HSP70 and antibodies against HSP90, HSP70, and Myc were purchased from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). Myc (9E-10), HA and GFP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was purchased from Sigma. Frozen surgical samples of normal human testicular tissue and human sperm were obtained from the Ontario Tumor Bank (Ontario, Canada). All reagents were of analytical grade. Cloning of SIP was performed with the Matchmaker GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech) by nutritional complementation. Bait construct was generated by subcloning of the complete coding region of SSTK into pGBKT7 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The construct was verified by sequencing, and expression of SSTK-GAL4 DB fusion protein in yeast was confirmed by Western blotting. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 was transformed to Trp prototrophy with pGBKT7-SSTK bait construct by the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method as recommended by the supplier. S. cerevisiae strain Y187 pretransformed to Leu prototrophy with pGADT7 that carried testicular cDNA library (about 3.5 million independent clones from the adult human testis) served as the prey strain. Haploid bait and prey yeast strains were mated in 2× YPDA medium (Clontech), and resulting diploids were selected under medium stringency conditions on synthetic dropout −His/−Leu/−Trp agar plates followed by selection under high stringency conditions on −Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp dropout plates and assayed for the activation of the MEL1 gene that encodes secreted α-galactosidase. Protein-protein interaction in yeast was confirmed by switching bait and prey plasmids and remating strains. Strain AH109 transformed with pGBKT7 vector served as negative control. Prey plasmids were isolated from MEL1-positive Ade/His/Leu/Trp prototrophs as described (25Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and rescued by transformation into Escherichia coli DH5α. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli clones with the plasmid mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA inserts were subjected to restriction analysis and sequenced. Mice were handled and sacrificed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee (Center for Biologics and Evaluation Research, Food and Drug Administration). Proteins from mouse tissues and sperm were extracted in lysis buffer containing SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described earlier (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against peptides corresponding to residues 1–51 and 218–273 of mouse SIP and SSTK, respectively, were generated and purified with protein G agarose. Rabbit antibodies against residues 80–124 of mouse SIP were produced and purified using peptide antigen immobilized on AminoLink gel from Thermo Scientific. Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry were performed as described previously (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SSTKs and EGF receptor were expressed by baculoviral infection in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (26Fan Y.X. Wong L. Ding J. Spiridonov N.A. Johnson R.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1588-1596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and HA-tagged SIP-glutathione S-transferase (SIP-GST) was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified as described in Fan et al. (27Fan Y.X. Wong L. Deb T.B. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38143-38150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SIP-GST binding was assessed by incubating 300 nm HSP70 or lysate from 5 × 106 cells (1 ml) with 5 μg of SIP-GST bound to 5 μl of glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed four times and analyzed by Western blotting. Transient expression of cDNA constructs in 293T cells was carried out as described earlier (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When required, the cells were treated with 1 μm 17-AAG overnight and prior to cell harvest. Kinase reactions were performed as described earlier (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was carried out in the kinase buffer that contained 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 60 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and protein/peptide substrate at room temperature for 30 min. Histone 2A, GSK-3-GST, Gab1 627Y peptide (27Fan Y.X. Wong L. Deb T.B. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38143-38150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or myelin basic protein was used as substrate for SSTK, Akt, EGF receptor, and MAP4K4, respectively. In some assays, reactions were terminated by acidification and transferred to P30 filtermats, and phosphorylation was quantified with a 1450 MicroBeta TriLux liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Alternatively, reactions were terminated with Laemmli sample buffer, resolved in SDS-PAGE gels, and developed by autoradiography. The dissociation constant for the SSTK and SIP interaction (Kd) was estimated by fitting the experimental titration data to the equation for a 1:1 binary complexA=A0−(A0−A∞)[SIP]Kd+[SIP](Eq. 1) where A is SSTK activity in the presence of a defined amount of SIP, and A0 and A∞ are the activities in the absence of SIP or in the presence of saturating SIP, respectively. To identify proteins that bind and regulate SSTK function, a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult human testicular cDNA library by nutritional complementation was performed using the full-length coding sequence of human SSTK as the bait. Screening of ∼17 × 106 clones resulted in isolation of ∼200 clones that grew under medium stringency conditions on His/Leu/Trp-deficient medium and 17 clones that grew stably under the high stringency conditions, expressing the Ade+/His+/Leu+/Trp+ and Mel1+ phenotype. Of these 17 clones, 10 clones contained the complete coding sequence of a novel gene, which encodes SIP. Human SIP undergoes extensive alternative splicing, and we cloned two splice variants of SIP that carry the same open reading frame but utilize different non-coding exons in the 5′-untranslated regions (Fig. 1A). The sequences were submitted to GenBankTM (accession numbers AY048672 and AY048673). Yet another splice variant (accession number BC014605) was later submitted to GenBank by a different research group (Fig. 1A). SIP from different mammalian species encode short (124–126 residues) and divergent polypeptides with gain or loss of amino acids occurring at exon-intron junctions (Fig. 1B). The predicted molecular mass and pI of human SIP are 13.7 kDa and 9.18, respectively, and the TPRpred software tool (28Karpenahalli M.R. Lupas A.N. Söding J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) predicted the presence of a single TPR domain (residues 64–97). The gene is situated on chromosome 1 at location 1q22 and chromosome 3 at location 3F1 in the human and murine genome, respectively. No orthologue of SIP was found in non-mammalian vertebrates, invertebrates, and lower organisms. To facilitate the study of SIP, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against residues 1–51 and 80–124 of murine SIP, respectively, were generated. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizes mouse, but not human SIP, and the polyclonal antibody recognizes SIP from both species (data not shown). Western blot analysis of mouse tissues with the mAb detected the ∼14-kDa SIP in testis, but not in other tissues, and no signal was detected using a control mAb (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the polyclonal antibody detected SIP in human testis lysate (Fig. 2B). Notably, SIP was not detected in sperm lysate from human (Fig. 2B) and mouse (data not shown). However, probing of the same human sperm lysate with an anti-SSTK mAb confirmed the presence of SSTK (Fig. 2B). Hence, SIP is expressed in testis and, unlike SSTK, is absent from mature sperm. These results are consistent with evidence from the human Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database in that most of the SIP expressed sequence tags originated from either testis or testicular tumors, with a few from other organs. To determine the cell types where SIP is expressed in testis and localization of SIP in relation to SSTK, immunohistochemical staining was performed with antibodies against SIP and SSTK on adjacent serial sections from adult mouse testis (Fig. 3). SIP was localized in the inner luminal layer of the seminiferous tubules in the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids (developmental steps 9 through 14) that undergo restructuring of the cytoplasm and chromatin condensation (upper panel). It should be noted that the staining of SIP was also detected in sperm in lumen of the seminiferous tubules. However, because SIP is absent from ejaculated sperm (Fig. 2B), we consider that this staining is associated with the residual bodies that are eventually lost from sperm. Immunostaining for SSTK revealed a similar expression pattern, and strong staining was observed in elongated spermatids and luminal sperm (middle panel). Similar to SIP, expression of SSTK peaked in elongated spermatids approximately at developmental steps 11–12. The specificity of the immunoreactivity with the SIP and SSTK antibodies was confirmed using control antibody (Fig. 3, bottom panel). These immunohistochemical studies revealed co-localization of SSTK and SIP in testis. To confirm the interaction between SIP and SSTK, we expressed and purified a SIP-GST fusion protein in E. coli. Myc epitope-tagged SSTK or the kinase-inactive K41M or D139N mutants were expressed in Sf9 cells via baculovirus-mediated infection, and cell lysates were baited with SIP-GST immobilized on glutathione agarose (Fig. 4A). Wild type and D139N were found to bind to SIP-GST, whereas K41M SSTK did not. No SSTK binding was detected when GST replaced SIP-GST (data not shown). Next, SSTK was purified from Sf9 cells (26Fan Y.X. Wong L. Ding J. Spiridonov N.A. Johnson R.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1588-1596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and used to evaluate the effect of SIP on SSTK enzymatic activity. The addition of SIP-GST resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of SSTK catalytic activity, although it did not completely inhibit the kinase even at saturating concentrations (Fig. 4B). The dissociation constant for the SIP-SSTK complex (Kd) calculated from the kinase inhibition data was 9.7 ± 1.6 nm. SIP-GST had no significant effect on the kinase activities of the serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP4K4 or on the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (Fig. 4B). The in vivo association between SSTK and SIP could not be confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using testis lysate as both SSTK and SIP required SDS for their extraction and were not soluble in non-ionic detergents. Therefore, we utilized SIP- and SSTK-null 293T cells to ectopically express these proteins and further study their association and function. All attempts using various buffers and detergents to extract soluble SIP from 293T or other cell lines were unsuccessful. However, a fusion protein of SIP and green fluorescent protein (SIP-GFP) was found to be soluble in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. SIP-GFP and Myc-SSTK were co-expressed in 293T cells, and association between SIP and SSTK was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Anti-GFP antibody detected SIP-GFP in the immunoprecipitate of Myc-SSTK (Fig. 4C, upper panel), and in the reverse experiment, SSTK was detected in the immunoprecipitate of SIP-GFP (Fig. 4D, upper panel). In both C and D, immunoprecipitations using control antibodies confirmed the specificity of the GFP and Myc immunoprecipitations, respectively. These results demonstrate that SIP can directly interact with the kinase in cells. To further study the effects of SIP on SSTK kinase activity, Myc-SSTK was expressed in 293T cells in the presence or absence of SIP-GFP. Myc-SSTK was immunoprecipitated, and in vitro kinase reactions were carried out with [32P]ATP and histone 2A (H2A) as substrates. The kinase reaction mixtures were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed. As expected, H2A was phosphorylated by SSTK and not by the kinase-inactive K41M mutant (M) (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Importantly, when SIP-GFP was co-expressed with SSTK, the level of phosphorylation of H2A by SSTK increased significantly when compared with the GFP control. The results demonstrate that SIP mediates activation of SSTK. To test whether the effect of SIP is specific to SSTK, SIP was co-expressed with the serine/threonine kinase Akt in cells. HA-Akt was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA mAb, and kinase activity was measured using GSK-3-GST fusion protein as substrate. Akt phosphorylated GSK-3-GST, but the presence of SIP did not influence this phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Similar experiments were performed assessing the effect of SIP on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) activity, and like Akt, MAPK activity was not affected by SIP (Fig. 5C). Taken together, the results indicate that SIP specifically activates SSTK. Our observation that SIP inhibits SSTK in vitro but mediates the activation of the kinase in cells indicates that other proteins are involved in the cellular activation of SSTK. It is known that SSTK associates with HSP70 (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and therefore, we tested whether SIP itself associates with HSP70. SIP-GFP was expressed in 293T cells, and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of HSP70. HSP70 was detected in immunoprecipitates of lysates from cells expressing SIP-GFP but not from control cells expressing GFP (Fig. 6A). In the absence of SSTK, HSP70 antibody detected two bands in the immunoprecipitates, and in the presence of SSTK, the intensity of the lower band of HSP70 decreased, whereas the upper band increased significantly. HSP70 is known to undergo phosphorylation (29Melling C.W. Thorp D.B. Milne K.J. Noble E.G. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the SIP-associated HSP70 doublet bands may represent differentially phosphorylated HSP70. To determine whether SIP can directly bind HSP70, we performed binding assays using purified HSP70. Pure recombinant HSP70 was found to directly bind to SIP-GST but not to GST (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that SIP directly engages HSP70 and associates with HSP70 in cells. Like HSP70, we have previously demonstrated that HSP90 can be detected in anti-SSTK immunoprecipitates (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HSP90 was detected in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from cells expressing SIP-GFP, but not from control cells expressing GFP (Fig. 7A), and co-expression of SSTK significantly increased the level of HSP90 in the SIP-GFP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7A). However, in contrast to our findings using purified HSP70, analogous binding experiments performed similar to those in Fig. 6B, but using purified HSP90, were not able to detect any direct binding between SIP and HSP90 (data not shown). Nevertheless, association of HSP90 with SSTK and SIP in cells, and the fact that SIP facilitates the enzymatic activation of SSTK, suggested that SIP and the HSP90 chaperone machinery work together in the functional maturation of SSTK. The ATPase activity of HSP90 is required for chaperone function and the maturation of client kinases. As shown in Fig. 7B, treatment of cells with the highly specific HSP90 ATPase inhibitor, 17-AAG, completely abolished the catalytic activity of SSTK as assessed by the phosphorylation of H2A, and this effect was independent of the presence of SIP. Interestingly, 17-AAG treatment did not lead to degradation of SSTK or SIP but blocked association between SIP and SSTK (Fig. 7B). We also tested whether purified HSP90 could activate SSTK in vitro in the presence of HSP70 and SIP using standard methodology (30Rajapandi T. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22597-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the conditions of the reconstitution resulted in enzymatic inactivation of SSTK, and exhaustive attempts to rescue SSTK activity were not successful (data not shown). However, using purified proteins, we were able to demonstrate that SSTK associates with HSP90 in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1). Together, the results demonstrate that SSTK can recruit SIP to HSP90 and that HSP90 is required for SSTK to possess kinase activity in cells. SIP is a highly conserved protein in human and other mammals and was not identified in non-mammalian vertebrates, invertebrates, and lower organisms. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that SIP is expressed only in testis, and this finding is supported by the human EST database. Similar to SSTK, immunohistochemical localization demonstrated the presence of SIP in the inner luminal layer of the seminiferous tubules within the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids. However, unlike SSTK, SIP was not detected in ejaculated sperm, suggesting that SIP is no longer needed after kinase maturation and activation. SSTK consists solely of a 273-amino acid residue protein kinase domain, and SIP binding to SSTK in vitro resulted in decreased kinase activity. Conversely, co-expression of SSTK and SIP in cells resulted in catalytic activation of the kinase and implicated other proteins in this process of cellular enzymatic activation. Molecular chaperones such as the HSPs aid in the native folding, stabilization, and signaling of client proteins. HSP90 is a constitutively and ubiquitously expressed protein that is shown to be required for the maturation of diverse client proteins, including steroid receptors, transcription factors, and a variety of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (18Wandinger S.K. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). HSP90 interacts with its client proteins in an ATP-dependent manner that is dependent on other chaperones and cochaperones (18Wandinger S.K. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 32Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). In the case of the steroid hormone receptors, HSP70 and cochaperones act in conjunction to assemble the functional client-HSP90 machinery (33Pratt W.B. Morishima Y. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22885-22889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that SSTK associates with HSPs (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and here, we demonstrate that HSP90 is absolutely required for SSTK catalytic activity. Cochaperones are proteins that are not clients of HSP70 or HSP90 and may be loosely defined as proteins that are involved in the function of other chaperones (21Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Accordingly, our interpretation that SIP is a cochaperone that facilitates the HSP-mediated enzymatic activation of SSTK is based upon the following lines of evidence. (i) SIP binds with high affinity to the HSP90-associated SSTK and co-localizes with the kinase in the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids, and SIP-SSTK expression peaks at the same developmental steps 11–12; (ii) SIP directly engages HSP70; (iii) SIP associates with SSTK, HSP70, and HSP90 in cells; (iv) expression of SSTK results in the recruitment of SIP to HSP90; and (v) the presence of SIP results in a specific catalytic activation of SSTK that requires HSP90 function. TPR domains are characterized by two antiparallel α-helices, are often found in tandem arrays, and are involved in protein-protein interactions (34Blatch G.L. Lässle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). They are commonly present in proteins that control cell cycle and transcription and in cochaperones that facilitate the maturation of clients by HSPs. TPRpred (28Karpenahalli M.R. Lupas A.N. Söding J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) predicted that SIP possesses a single TPR domain encoded within its third exon. A modeling analysis of residues 64–97 in SIP supported the idea that this region adopted a helix-turn-helix structure that strongly resembles the consensus TPR fold in consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) (supplemental Fig. S2) (35Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure. 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). SIP contains conserved hydrophobic core residues at positions Tyr-70, Leu-73, Leu-90, and Pro-97 that are essential for the structural integrity of a TPR fold (35Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure. 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This putative TPR domain may mediate the binding to HSP70 and/or to SSTK. The protein kinase-HSP90 cochaperone Cdc37 lacks a TPR, and thus, SIP may represent the first HSP cochaperone involved in kinase activation that contains a TPR domain. In contrast to HSP90, SIP was not strictly required for SSTK enzymatic activity. SSTK possessed detectable kinase activity, albeit significantly lower, when expressed in the absence of SIP. Activation of protein kinases involves a conformational change from an “off” state that has minimal activity to an “on” state that is maximally active (36Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar), and SIP appears to help HSP90 increase the proportion of SSTK in the on conformation. The precise mechanism and the nature of the molecular interactions that occur between SIP and the client SSTK and HSPs, and how SIP exactly mediates the HSP90-dependent activation of SSTK are likely to be quite complicated. The K41M mutation in the N-lobe of SSTK blocked binding of SIP but does not affect association of the kinase with HSPs (7Spiridonov N.A. Wong L. Zerfas P.M. Starost M.F. Pack S.D. Paweletz C.P. Johnson G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4250-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that SIP and HSPs bind to different regions of SSTK. One striking finding was that 17-AAG completely blocked the co-immunoprecipitation of SIP and kinase, implying that stalling of the HSP90 ATPase cycle results in a collapse of the SIP-SSTK complex on the HSP machinery. Consistent with our data, SIP may bind to HSP70 first and be recruited to HSP90-bound SSTK, where it engages SSTK and facilitates the conformational activation of the kinase. Association of SIP with HSP90 was significantly increased by co-expression of SSTK, demonstrating a recruitment of SIP to HSP90 by the kinase. However, we could find no evidence for HSP90 binding directly to SIP, and thus, this recruitment likely involves HSP70 and SSTK. It is important to note that in addition to SIP, HSP70, and HSP90, other factors may be involved and/or required for SSTK activation. Nevertheless, SIP appears to play a critical role in the ordered assembly of SSTK and the HSP70-HSP90 machinery, and this function appears to be specific. For example, HSP90 is involved in the maturation of Akt, but SIP does not influence Akt enzymatic activity. Genetic deletion of the genes that encode the testis isoform of HSP70 (37Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Mori C. Nakamura N. Poorman-Allen P. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and the chaperone calmegin (38Ikawa M. Wada I. Kominami K. Watanabe D. Toshimori K. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Nature. 1997; 387: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) resulted in male sterility. The testis HSP70-null male mice are infertile due to meiotic arrest in spermatocytes (17Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 37Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Mori C. Nakamura N. Poorman-Allen P. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 37888-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and HSP70 may be essential in the later stages of spermatogenesis that involve SIP and SSTK. To our knowledge, SIP represents the first demonstration of a germ cell-specific cochaperone for a protein kinase that requires the HSP90 machinery for activation, and in addition to Cdc37, is only the second cochaperone identified that plays a role in protein kinase maturation. It will be interesting and important to determine whether SIP, like SSTK, is strictly required for male fertility or whether SIP functions to increase male fertility.
