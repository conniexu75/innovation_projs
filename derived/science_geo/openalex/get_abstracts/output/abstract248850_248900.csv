https://openalex.org/W2083201436,"The assembly of nanoparticles of two different materials into a binary nanoparticle superlattice is a promising way of synthesizing a large variety of materials (metamaterials) with precisely controlled chemical composition and tight placement of the components. In theory only a few stable binary superlattice structures can assemble from hard spheres, potentially limiting this approach. But all is not lost because at the nanometre scale there are additional forces (electrostatic, van der Waals and dipolar) that can stabilize binary nanoparticulate structures. Shevchenko et al. now report the synthesis of a dozen novel structures from various combinations of metal, semiconductor, magnetic and dielectric nanoparticles. This demonstrates the potential of self-assembly in designing families of novel materials and metamaterials with programmable physical and chemical properties. Assembly of small building blocks such as atoms, molecules and nanoparticles into macroscopic structures—that is, ‘bottom up’ assembly—is a theme that runs through chemistry, biology and material science. Bacteria1, macromolecules2 and nanoparticles3 can self-assemble, generating ordered structures with a precision that challenges current lithographic techniques. The assembly of nanoparticles of two different materials into a binary nanoparticle superlattice (BNSL)3,4,5,6,7 can provide a general and inexpensive path to a large variety of materials (metamaterials) with precisely controlled chemical composition and tight placement of the components. Maximization of the nanoparticle packing density has been proposed as the driving force for BNSL formation3,8,9, and only a few BNSL structures have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable. Recently, colloidal crystals with micrometre-scale lattice spacings have been grown from oppositely charged polymethyl methacrylate spheres10,11. Here we demonstrate formation of more than 15 different BNSL structures, using combinations of semiconducting, metallic and magnetic nanoparticle building blocks. At least ten of these colloidal crystalline structures have not been reported previously. We demonstrate that electrical charges on sterically stabilized nanoparticles determine BNSL stoichiometry; additional contributions from entropic, van der Waals, steric and dipolar forces stabilize the variety of BNSL structures."

https://openalex.org/W2049607688,"Social networks evolve over time, driven by the shared activities and affiliations of their members, by similarity of individuals' attributes, and by the closure of short network cycles. We analyzed a dynamic social network comprising 43,553 students, faculty, and staff at a large university, in which interactions between individuals are inferred from time-stamped e-mail headers recorded over one academic year and are matched with affiliations and attributes. We found that network evolution is dominated by a combination of effects arising from network topology itself and the organizational structure in which the network is embedded. In the absence of global perturbations, average network properties appear to approach an equilibrium state, whereas individual properties are unstable."

Here, we show that the nuclear-localized growth-repressing DELLA proteins of Arabidopsis integrate responses to independent hormonal and environmental signals of adverse conditions. The growth restraint conferred by DELLA proteins is beneficial and promotes survival. We propose that DELLAs permit flexible and appropriate modulation of plant growth in response to changes in natural environments."

https://openalex.org/W2153903774,"Since the mass mortality of the urchin Diadema antillarum in 1983, parrotfishes have become the dominant grazer on Caribbean reefs. The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8%. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2091990846,"Gamma-rays from radioactive 26Al (half life ~7.2 10^5 yr) provide a 'snapshot' view of ongoing nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy. The Galaxy is relatively transparent to such gamma-rays, and emission has been found concentrated along the plane of the Galaxy. This led to the conclusion1 that massive stars throughout the Galaxy dominate the production of 26Al. On the other hand, meteoritic data show locally-produced 26Al, perhaps from spallation reactions in the protosolar disk. Furthermore, prominent gamma-ray emission from the Cygnus region suggests that a substantial fraction of Galactic 26Al could originate in localized star-forming regions. Here we report high spectral resolution measurements of 26Al emission at 1808.65 keV, which demonstrate that the 26Al source regions corotate with the Galaxy, supporting its Galaxy-wide origin. We determine a present-day equilibrium mass of 2.8 (+/-0.8) M_sol of 26Al. We use this to estimate that the frequency of core collapse (i.e. type Ib/c and type II) supernovae to be 1.9(+/- 1.1) events per century."
https://openalex.org/W2101139153,"Modern felid species descend from relatively recent (&lt;11 million years ago) divergence and speciation events that produced successful predatory carnivores worldwide but that have confounded taxonomic classifications. A highly resolved molecular phylogeny with divergence dates for all living cat species, derived from autosomal, X-linked, Y-linked, and mitochondrial gene segments (22,789 base pairs) and 16 fossil calibrations define eight principal lineages produced through at least 10 intercontinental migrations facilitated by sea-level fluctuations. A ghost lineage analysis indicates that available felid fossils underestimate (i.e., unrepresented basal branch length) first occurrence by an average of 76%, revealing a low representation of felid lineages in paleontological remains. The phylogenetic performance of distinct gene classes showed that Y-chromosome segments are appreciably more informative than mitochondrial DNA, X-linked, or autosomal genes in resolving the rapid Felidae species radiation."

https://openalex.org/W1987194328,"The pathophysiology of depression remains enigmatic, although abnormalities in serotonin signaling have been implicated. We have found that the serotonin 1B receptor [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT 1B ) receptor] interacts with p11. p11 increases localization of 5-HT 1B receptors at the cell surface. p11 is increased in rodent brains by antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy, but decreased in an animal model of depression and in brain tissue from depressed patients. Overexpression of p11 increases 5-HT 1B receptor function in cells and recapitulates certain behaviors seen after antidepressant treatment in mice. p11 knockout mice exhibit a depression-like phenotype and have reduced responsiveness to 5-HT 1B receptor agonists and reduced behavioral reactions to an antidepressant."
https://openalex.org/W2088824594,"The cell lineages that form the transporting tissues (xylem and phloem) and the intervening pluripotent procambial tissue originate from stem cells near the root tip. We demonstrate that in Arabidopsis, cytokinin phytohormones negatively regulate protoxylem specification. AHP6, an inhibitory pseudophosphotransfer protein, counteracts cytokinin signaling, allowing protoxylem formation. Conversely, cytokinin signaling negatively regulates the spatial domain of AHP6 expression. Thus, by controlling the identity of cell lineages, the reciprocal interaction of cytokinin signaling and its spatially specific modulator regulates proliferation and differentiation of cell lineages during vascular development, demonstrating a previously unrecognized regulatory circuit underlying meristem organization."

https://openalex.org/W2131602339,"Nitrogen oxides in the lower troposphere catalyze the photochemical production of ozone (O 3 ) pollution during the day but react to form nitric acid, oxidize hydrocarbons, and remove O 3 at night. A key nocturnal reaction is the heterogeneous hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide, N 2 O 5 . We report aircraft measurements of NO 3 and N 2 O 5 , which show that the N 2 O 5 uptake coefficient, g(N 2 O 5 ), on aerosol particles is highly variable and depends strongly on aerosol composition, particularly sulfate content. The results have implications for the quantification of regional-scale O 3 production and suggest a stronger interaction between anthropogenic sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1972069400,"Helicases are a ubiquitous class of enzymes involved in nearly all aspects of DNA and RNA metabolism. Despite recent progress in understanding their mechanism of action, limited resolution has left inaccessible the detailed mechanisms by which these enzymes couple the rearrangement of nucleic acid structures to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Observing individual mechanistic cycles of these motor proteins is central to understanding their cellular functions. Here we follow in real time, at a resolution of two base pairs and 20 ms, the RNA translocation and unwinding cycles of a hepatitis C virus helicase (NS3) monomer. NS3 is a representative superfamily-2 helicase essential for viral replication, and therefore a potentially important drug target. We show that the cyclic movement of NS3 is coordinated by ATP in discrete steps of 11 +/- 3 base pairs, and that actual unwinding occurs in rapid smaller substeps of 3.6 +/- 1.3 base pairs, also triggered by ATP binding, indicating that NS3 might move like an inchworm. This ATP-coupling mechanism is likely to be applicable to other non-hexameric helicases involved in many essential cellular functions. The assay developed here should be useful in investigating a broad range of nucleic acid translocation motors."
https://openalex.org/W2103489555,"Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin switch region are a hallmark feature of B-cell malignancies. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which primary B cells acquire or guard against these lesions. Here we find that translocations between c-myc and the IgH locus (Igh) are induced in primary B cells within hours of expression of the catalytically active form of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme that deaminates cytosine to produce uracil in DNA. Translocation also requires uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), which removes uracil from DNA to create abasic sites that are then processed to double-strand breaks. The pathway that mediates aberrant joining of c-myc and Igh differs from intrachromosomal repair during immunoglobulin class switch recombination in that it does not require histone H2AX, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) or the non-homologous end-joining protein Ku80. In addition, translocations are inhibited by the tumour suppressors ATM, Nbs1, p19 (Arf) and p53, which is consistent with activation of DNA damage- and oncogenic stress-induced checkpoints during physiological class switching. Finally, we demonstrate that accumulation of AID-dependent, IgH-associated chromosomal lesions is not sufficient to enhance c-myc-Igh translocations. Our findings reveal a pathway for surveillance and protection against AID-dependent DNA damage, leading to chromosomal translocations."
https://openalex.org/W2125343301,"Attine ants engage in a quadripartite symbiosis with fungi they cultivate for food, specialized garden parasites, and parasite-inhibiting bacteria. Molecular phylogenetic evidence supports an ancient host-pathogen association between the ant-cultivar mutualism and the garden parasite. Here we show that ants rear the antibiotic-producing bacteria in elaborate cuticular crypts, supported by unique exocrine glands, and that these structures have been highly modified across the ants' evolutionary history. This specialized structural evolution, together with the absence of these bacteria and modifications in other ant genera that do not grow fungus, indicate that the bacteria have an ancient and coevolved association with the ants, their fungal cultivar, and the garden parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2114080614,"We present data from a study of early conifer regeneration and fuel loads after the 2002 Biscuit Fire, Oregon, USA, with and without postfire logging. Natural conifer regeneration was abundant after the high-severity fire. Postfire logging reduced median regeneration density by 71%, significantly increased downed woody fuels, and thus increased short-term fire risk. Additional reduction of fuels is necessary for effective mitigation of fire risk. Postfire logging can be counterproductive to the goals of forest regenration and fuel reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2068873501,"On the cover, a solitary bee forages for pollen as a protein-source for her brood alongside a sterile ‘eusocial’ worker honey bee. The social biology of these two females is different, but the evolutionary origin of their behaviour is identical. A eusocial lifestyle involves sterile workers that care for younger siblings. One explanation of how this behaviour arose invokes selection on maternal reproductive traits, and experiments in the honey bee confirm this as a possibility. Intriguingly, differences in worker bee behaviour can be explained by variation in reproductive characteristics. Strains selected to prefer pollen-foraging over nectar-foraging have workers with high, typically unexpressed, reproductive potential. Unselected bees with a high reproductive potential also prefer to collect pollen. This means that maternal traits can act as an evolutionary bridgehead between the solitary estate and worker-containing insect societies. A fundamental goal of sociobiology is to explain how complex social behaviour evolves1, especially in social insects, the exemplars of social living. Although still the subject of much controversy2, recent theoretical explanations have focused on the evolutionary origins of worker behaviour (assistance from daughters that remain in the nest and help their mother to reproduce) through expression of maternal care behaviour towards siblings3,4. A key prediction of this evolutionary model is that traits involved in maternal care have been co-opted through heterochronous expression of maternal genes5 to result in sib-care, the hallmark of highly evolved social life in insects6. A coupling of maternal behaviour to reproductive status evolved in solitary insects, and was a ready substrate for the evolution of worker-containing societies3,4,7,8. Here we show that division of foraging labour among worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) is linked to the reproductive status of facultatively sterile females. We thereby identify the evolutionary origin of a widely expressed social-insect behavioural syndrome1,5,7,9, and provide a direct demonstration of how variation in maternal reproductive traits gives rise to complex social behaviour in non-reproductive helpers."

https://openalex.org/W2163069612,"Direct stimulation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors exerts a protective function in animal models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, it is not known whether endocannabinoids are up-regulated during IBDs in animals or humans, nor whether pharmacological elevation of endocannabinoid levels can be exploited therapeutically in these disorders. In this study we addressed these questions. Colon inflammation was induced in mice and rats with 2,4-dinitrobenzene- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acids (DNBS and TNBS), respectively. DNBS-treated mice were treated chronically (for 3 or 7 days) with inhibitors of anandamide enzymatic hydrolysis (N-arachidonoyl-serotonin, AA-5-HT) or reuptake (VDM11), 10 or 5 mg/kg, s.c., or with 5-amino-salicilic acid (5-ASA, 1.4 mg/kg, i.r.). Endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) were quantified in mouse colon, or in rat colon mucosa and submucosa, and in bioptic samples from the colon of patients with untreated ulcerative colitis, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A strong elevation of anandamide, but not 2-AG, levels was found in the colon of DNBS-treated mice, in the colon submucosa of TNBS-treated rats, and in the biopsies of patients with ulcerative colitis. VDM-11 significantly elevated anandamide levels in the colon of DNBS-treated mice and concomitantly abolished inflammation, whereas AA-5-HT did not affect endocannabinoid levels and was significantly less efficacious at attenuating colitis. 5-ASA also increased anandamide levels and abolished colitis. Thus, anandamide is elevated in the inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis, as well as in animal models of IBDs, to control inflammation, and elevation of its levels with inhibitors of its cellular reuptake might be used in the treatment of IBDs."
https://openalex.org/W2139875839,"DNA gyrase is a molecular machine that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to introduce essential negative supercoils into DNA. The directionality of supercoiling is ensured by chiral wrapping of the DNA around a specialized domain of the enzyme before strand passage. Here we observe the activity of gyrase in real time by tracking the rotation of a submicrometre bead attached to the side of a stretched DNA molecule. In the presence of gyrase and ATP, we observe bursts of rotation corresponding to the processive, stepwise introduction of negative supercoils in strict multiples of two. Changes in DNA tension have no detectable effect on supercoiling velocity, but the enzyme becomes markedly less processive as tension is increased over a range of only a few tenths of piconewtons. This behaviour is quantitatively explained by a simple mechanochemical model in which processivity depends on a kinetic competition between dissociation and rapid, tension-sensitive DNA wrapping. In a high-resolution variant of our assay, we directly detect rotational pauses corresponding to two kinetic substeps: an ATP-independent step at the end of the reaction cycle, and an ATP-binding step in the middle of the cycle, subsequent to DNA wrapping."
https://openalex.org/W1970406868,"Xanthohumol (XN), the principal flavonoid of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.) and a constituent of beer, has been suggested to have potential cancer chemopreventive activities. We have observed that most cancer chemopreventive agents show antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo, a concept we termed ""angioprevention."" Here we show for the first time that XN can inhibit growth of a vascular tumor in vivo. Histopathology and in vivo angiogenesis assays indicated that tumor angiogenesis inhibition was involved. Further, we show the mechanisms for its inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo and related endothelial cell activities in vitro. XN repressed both the NF-kappaB and Akt pathways in endothelial cells, indicating that components of these pathways are major targets in the molecular mechanism of XN. Moreover, using in vitro analyses, we show that XN interferes with several points in the angiogenic process, including inhibition of endothelial cell invasion and migration, growth, and formation of a network of tubular-like structures. Our results suggest that XN can be added to the expanding list of antiangiogenic chemopreventive drugs whose potential in cancer prevention and therapy should be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2141948084,"It is currently unclear whether observed pelagic ecosystem responses to ocean warming, such as a mid-1970s change in the eastern North Pacific, depart from typical ocean variability. We report variations in planktonic foraminifera from varved sediments off southern California spanning the past 1400 years. Increasing abundances of tropical/subtropical species throughout the 20th century reflect a warming trend superimposed on decadal-scale fluctuations. Decreasing abundances of temperate/subpolar species in the late 20th century indicate a deep, penetrative warming not observed in previous centuries. These results imply that 20th-century warming, apparently anthropogenic, has already affected lower trophic levels of the California Current."

https://openalex.org/W2015941759,"The origin of the substantial magnetic fields that are found in galaxies and on even larger scales, such as in clusters of galaxies, is yet unclear. If the second-order couplings between photons and electrons are considered, then cosmological density fluctuations, which explain the large-scale structure of the universe, can also produce magnetic fields on cosmological scales before the epoch of recombination. By evaluating the power spectrum of these cosmological magnetic fields on a range of scales, we show here that magnetic fields of 10 –18.1 gauss are generated at a 1-megaparsec scale and can be even stronger at smaller scales (10 –14.1 gauss at 10 kiloparsecs). These fields are large enough to seed magnetic fields in galaxies and may therefore have affected primordial star formation in the early universe."
https://openalex.org/W2106470271,"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], consisting of LDL and the unique constituent apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which contains multiple repeats resembling plasminogen kringle 4, is considered a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms for the atherogenicity of Lp(a) are not completely understood. Here, we define a novel function of Lp(a) in promoting inflammatory cell recruitment that may contribute to its atherogenicity. Through its apo(a) moiety Lp(a) specifically interacts with the beta2-integrin Mac-1, thereby promoting the adhesion of monocytes and their transendothelial migration in a Mac-1-dependent manner. Interestingly, the interaction between Mac-1 and Lp(a) was strengthened in the presence of proatherogenic homocysteine and was blocked by plasminogen/angiostatin kringle 4. Through its interaction with Mac-1, Lp(a) induced activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB, as well as the NFkappaB-related expression of prothrombotic tissue factor. In atherosclerotic coronary arteries Lp(a) was found to be localized in close proximity to Mac-1 on infiltrating mononuclear cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Lp(a), via its apo(a) moiety, is a ligand for the beta2-integrin Mac-1, thereby facilitating inflammatory cell recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques. These observations suggest a novel mechanism for the atherogenic properties of Lp(a)."

https://openalex.org/W1983043323,"Recently, the neurotoxicity of dopamine (DA) quinone formation by auto-oxidation of DA has focused on dopaminergic neuron-specific oxidative stress. In the present study, we examined DA quinone formation in methamphetamine (METH)-induced dopaminergic neuronal cell death using METH-treated dopaminergic cultured CATH.a cells and METH-injected mouse brain. In CATH.a cells, METH treatment dose-dependently increased the levels of quinoprotein (protein-bound quinone) and the expression of quinone reductase in parallel with neurotoxicity. A similar increase in quinoprotein levels was seen in the striatum of METH (4 mg/kg X4, i.p., 2 h interval)-injected BALB/c mice, coinciding with reduction of DA transporters. Furthermore, pretreatment of CATH.a cells with quinone reductase inducer, butylated hydroxyanisole, significantly and dose-dependently blocked METH-induced elevation of quinoprotein, and ameliorated METH-induced cell death. We also showed the protective effect of tyrosinase, which rapidly oxidizes DA and DA quinone to form stable melanin, against METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo using tyrosinase null mice. Our results indicate that DA quinone formation plays an important role, as a dopaminergic neuron-specific neurotoxic factor, in METH-induced neurotoxicity, which is regulated by quinone formation-related molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1984933995,"The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has neurotrophic as well as anti-apoptotic properties and is involved in learning and memory processes. Its specific G protein-coupled receptor PAC1 is expressed in several central nervous system (CNS) regions, including the hippocampal formation. Here we examined the effect of PAC1 receptor activation on alpha-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the production of secreted APP (APPsalpha). Stimulation of endogenously expressed PAC1 receptors with PACAP in human neuroblastoma cells increased APPsalpha secretion, which was completely inhibited by the PAC1 receptor specific antagonist PACAP-(6-38). In HEK cells stably overexpressing functional PAC1 receptors, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 strongly stimulated alpha-secretase cleavage of APP. The PACAP-induced APPsalpha production was dose dependent and saturable. This increase of alpha-secretase activity was completely abolished by hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitors, including a preferential ADAM 10 inhibitor. By using several specific protein kinase inhibitors, we show that the MAP-kinase pathway [including extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2] and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediate the PACAP-induced alpha-secretase activation. Our findings provide evidence for a role of the neuropeptide PACAP in stimulation of the nonamyloidogenic pathway, which might be related to its neuroprotective properties."

https://openalex.org/W2067895272,"We present two quantum calculations of the infrared spectrum of protonated methane (CH5+) using full-dimensional, ab initio-based potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. The calculated spectra compare well with a low-resolution experimental spectrum except below 1000 cm(-1), where the experimental spectrum shows no absorption. The present calculations find substantial absorption features below 1000 cm(-1), in qualitative agreement with earlier classical calculations of the spectrum. The major spectral bands are analyzed in terms of the molecular motions. Of particular interest is an intense feature at 200 cm(-1), which is due to an isomerization mode that connects two equivalent minima. Very recent high-resolution jet-cooled spectra in the CH stretch region (2825 to 3050 cm(-1)) are also reported, and assignments of the band origins are made, based on the present quantum calculations."

NPFs include members of the WASP/Scar family of proteins (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar, 8Gouin E. Welch M.D. Cossart P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Several WASP/Scar family proteins are regulated by small GTPases and thus serve to link Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly to upstream signals. The region of WASP/Scar family proteins that binds and activates the Arp2/3 complex is called a VCA domain and is usually located at the C terminus. A canonical VCA domain is composed of three sequences motifs: one or two V (verprolin homology) sequences (also known as WASP homology 2 or WH2 domains) that bind actin monomers; a C (central or connecting) sequence that is essential for nucleation and has been shown to interact with the Arp2/3 complex; and an A (acidic) sequence that also binds to the Arp2/3 complex and contributes the majority of the binding energy (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).Although the molecular determinants for activation of the Arp2/3 complex have been worked out in some detail, the mechanism of actin nucleation itself is not well understood. The slowest step in spontaneous actin assembly is the formation of a dimer. Conventional actin dimers are extremely unstable and assemble with an equilibrium constant on the order of 4 m (9Sept D. McCammon J.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 667-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). On the basis of this fact, Kelleher et al. (10Kelleher J.F. Atkinson S.J. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) proposed that the two actin-related subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, Arp2 and Arp3, overcome the kinetic barrier to nucleation by mimicking a conventional actin dimer. In the crystal structure of the complex, Arp2 and Arp3 are in the proper orientation to form an actin-like dimer, but they are separated by a large gap (11Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) so that formation of a nucleation-competent dimer would require a significant conformational change (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). Goley et al. (12Goley E.D. Rodenbusch S.E. Martin A.C. Welch M.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to demonstrate that binding of a VCA domain from WASP induces a conformational change in the complex. The authors (12Goley E.D. Rodenbusch S.E. Martin A.C. Welch M.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) also showed that point mutations in the C region that abolish nucleation-promoting activity also abolish the ability to induce the conformational change; they did not test the effect of monomeric actin but found, surprisingly, that filamentous actin had no detectable effect on the conformation of the complex. This result indicates that either (i) filamentous actin does not induce a conformational change in the complex or (ii) that the actin-induced conformational change is different from that induced by VCA and that the fluorescent probes are not positioned to detect it. Electron microscopy studies also support the idea that VCA peptides induce a significant conformational change in the Arp2/3 complex (13Rodal A.A. Sokolova O. Robins D.B. Daugherty K.M.

Volkmann N. Hanein D. Welch M.D. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and, consistent with the ability to drive conformational rearrangements, the VCA peptide makes contact with multiple subunits of the Arp2/3 complex (p21, Arp3, Arp2 and p40) (15Zalevsky J. Lempert L. Kranitz H. Mullins R.D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1903-1913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Lastly, mathematical modeling of Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation indicates the presence of a slow, first-order activation step following interaction with monomeric and filamentous actin and a VCA domain (15Zalevsky J. Lempert L. Kranitz H. Mullins R.D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1903-1913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This activation step may correspond to a slow conformational rearrangement in the complex.Previous studies also revealed that actin monomers bound to the VCA domain play an important role in activation of the Arp2/3 complex. In an earlier study (6Dayel M.J. Mullins R.D. PLoS Biol. 2004. 2004; : 2/E91Google Scholar) we showed that the Arp2 subunit of the complex hydrolyzes ATP during or soon after filament nucleation and that the factors required for dendritic nucleation are also required for ATP hydrolysis. We demonstrated a requirement for monomeric actin by showing that a non-polymerizing, latrunculin-bound actin monomer could substitute for a polymerizable monomer. Marchand et al. (7Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of monomeric actin by showing that removal of the actin-binding WH2 sequence from a WASP-family VCA domain greatly decreases the efficiency of Arp2/3 activation. These authors (7Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) also found evidence that the truncated CA domain retained weak monomer binding activity and thus could not conclude that the residual nucleation-promoting activity was monomer-independent.Here we report a structural and biochemical analysis of the molecular requirements of Arp2/3 activation. By NMR spectroscopy we found that the WH2-actin complex is similar to the previously described ciboulot D1-actin complex (16Hertzog M. van Heijenoort C. Didry D. Gaudier M. Coutant J. Gigant B. Didelot G. Preat T. Knossow M. Guittet E. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 117: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This result supports the proposal that the two domains are evolutionarily related (17Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the C domain also binds monomeric actin and that monomer binding plays a role in activating the Arp2/3 complex. This result, together with the previous observation that the C domain binds the Arp2/3 complex, suggests a simple model in which the C domain acts as a “docking ring” that correctly positions an actin monomer onto the actin-related subunits of the complex. To test this model we determined the affinity of the C domain for actin and the Arp2/3 complex, both alone and in combination. We found that the C domain binds much more tightly to actin than to the Arp2/3 complex and that binding of the two is mutually exclusive. In addition, chemical cross-linking revealed that the C domain does not bind Arp2 or Arp3 but contacts the p40 subunit. From these observations, we propose a multistep model for Arp2/3 activation in which the C-domain interacts sequentially with the Arp2/3 complex and the WH2-bound actin monomer. In this model the C domain first binds the Arp2/3 complex and induces a long-lived conformational change. Next, the C domain dissociates and binds an actin monomer, positioning it in the optimal orientation to interact with the “primed” complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction and Protein Purification—All Scar1 and N-WASP plasmids were constructed by PCR using full-length human Scar1 (gift of Laura Machesky) and rat N-WASP (gift of Wendell Lim). All clones were verified by sequencing. Proteins were expressed in BL21 (pLysS) cells as C-terminal His6, N-terminal GST fusions, or both, where indicated in the text. For uniform labeling with 15N and 2H, BL21 (pLysS) cells freshly transformed with Scar1 VC or VCA expression plasmids were grown in either Silantes [15N, 2H]-or[15N]OD2 medium (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA). For residue-specific labeling, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing uniformly labeled 15N amino acid (lysine, arginine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Expression of all proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After expression for 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and disrupted by microfluidization, and supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 45 min. His6-tagged proteins were isolated under either native or denaturing conditions on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. GST fusions were bound to glutathione-agarose beads and cleaved off the column using either thrombin or PreScission protease. All proteins were further purified by chromatography on MonoQ resin (Amersham Biosciences) and verified for molecular weight using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Tag-free peptides were obtained from Synpep Corp. (Alameda, CA) and were >95% pure. Arp2/3 and actin were purified from Acanthamoeba castellani (6Dayel M.J. Mullins R.D. PLoS Biol. 2004. 2004; : 2/E91Google Scholar, 18MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and the actin was pyrene-labeled as described (19Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Fluorescent Labeling—Purified proteins were exchanged into HEK buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) using a NAP-5 column and incubated with a 4-7-fold molar excess of Alexa-488 C5 maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C. Samples were spun at 65,000 rpm, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a G-25 column to remove unreacted dye. MALDI-TOF was used to monitor percent labeling.Actin Polymerization—All pyrene actin polymerization assays were performed with Acanthamoeba actin (6% pyrene labeled) in 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Ca2+-actin was converted to Mg2+-actin prior to each polymerization reaction by a 2-min incubation with 50 μm MgCl2, 200 μm EGTA. Fluorescence studies were conducted on a K2 Multifrequency Fluorometer (ISS Inc., Champagne, IL). Data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).Polarization Anisotropy—Fluorescence studies were conducted on a K2 Multifrequency Fluorometer at 25 °C. The samples contained KMEH buffer (10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2). For anisotropy measurements, fixed concentrations of Alexa-488-labeled Scar1 VCA, CA, or C peptides were mixed with various concentrations of either the Arp2/3 complex, latrunculin-stabilized actin, or both, and the data were fitted to a single site-binding isotherm to determine Kd. Alexa-488 was excited with polarized light at 493 nm, and the emitted light was detected at 525 nm. Affinities of unlabeled peptides for either the Arp2/3 complex or actin were determined by competition with Alexa-488-labeled wild-type Scar1 VCA, CA, or C peptides. Anisotropy data were fit to a full solution of the equilibrium competition binding equation using KaleidaGraph (7Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).Cross-linking—Proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) at 25 °C to facilitate cross-linking. The indicated protein concentrations were mixed with freshly prepared 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were methanol/chloroform-precipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with monospecific antibodies against the Arp2/3 complex subunits or by fluorescence imaging of the Alexa-488-labeled C domain.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on Bruker DRX 500- or 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance z axis gradient CryoProbe. Unbound [15N]VCA, residue specific 15N-labeled VC, and [15N, 2H]VC samples each contained 400 μm protein in 90% H2O, 10% D2O with modified G-actin buffer (buffer A: 50 mm d6-Na-HEPES (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), pH 7.5, 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). For studies of actin-bound peptides, 5 ml of ∼50 μm G-actin was exchanged into 2 mm d6-Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 μm ATP by Nap-5 chromatography and immediately lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was then resuspended in a solution containing 300 μl of 400 μm peptide in buffer A containing 600 μm latrunculin B (Calbiochem). Samples were spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min resulting in a final actin concentration of 500 μm. Assignments of residues in VC were obtained using a combination of [15N, 1H]HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence), [15N, 1H]-TROSY-HSQC (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy), three-dimensional [15N, 1H]NOESY-HSQC, and three-dimensional [15N, 1H]TROSY-NOESY-HSQC experiments (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) (20Riek R.

NOESY mixing times were 80 and 120 ms. Data were processed using NMRPipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). To understand the role of monomeric actin in activating the complex, we sought to define the minimal actin-binding region of the human Scar1 VCA peptide. Using fluorescence polarization anisotropy, we measured the affinities of C-terminal truncation mutants of VCA for monomeric actin (Table 1). Removal of the A domain of Scar1 (VC) or the A domain together with the last five residues of the C domain (VCΔ5, residues 489-538) had no effect on actin binding. Removal of both the A and C sequences (isolated WH2 domain), however, decreased the affinity by 10-fold (3.1 μm versus 0.35 μm, respectively). Therefore, we define the optimal actin-binding region of the human Scar1 VCA domain as VCΔ5.TABLE 1Affinitiies and activities for all Scar1 VCA mutationsConstructKd for actinaAffinities were measured by competition with Alexa-488 Scar1 VCA or Alexa-488 Scar1 C using fluorescence polarization anisotropy.

Open table in a new tab We then used NMR spectroscopy to determine the identity and secondary structure of 15N-labeled residues in Scar1 VC bound to an unlabeled actin monomer. VC was used instead of VCΔ5 because of its higher solubility. First, we used [15N, 1H]TROSY-HSQC spectra to look for structural differences between free Scar1 VC and Scar1 VC bound to monomeric actin. Based on chemical shift dispersion, we found that 29 residues in Scar1 VC bind actin (Fig. 2, A and B, supplemental Fig. S1). Changes in the chemical shift of a number of residues became maximal at equimolar amounts of actin and Scar1 VC, consistent with formation of a 1:1 complex.FIGURE 2Residues of the VC peptide perturbed upon actin binding and secondary structure of the bound peptide. A, alignment of human Scar1, WASP, and N-WASP VCA regions. Structural information is displayed above the alignments in B-D. Actin-binding residues were determined by line broadening and NOEs. Secondary structure was determined by the presence and strength of amide-amide NOEs. The helix designates residues with strong amide-amide NOEs, and the dashes denote weak amide-amide NOEs. Arp2/3-interacting residues were determined by line-broadening experiments (24Panchal S.C. Kaiser D.A. Torres E. Pollard T.D. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct.

Because of the high correlation time of the actin-VC complex, 100% deuteration of the VC peptide was required to reduce the relaxation time and produce NOEs with sharp line widths, limiting information available to amide-amide intra- and inter-residue amide-Hα NOEs. A combination of TROSY pulse sequences, 100% deuteration, buffer optimization (23Kelly A.E. Ou H.D. Withers R. Dotsch V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 12013-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and use of a cryoprobe enabled us to acquire high quality NOESY spectra at protein concentrations of 150-400 μm. From the observed NOEs we determined direct connectivity of a number of residues. Consistent with previous reports (7Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Panchal S.C. Kaiser D.A. Torres E. Pollard T.D. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the VC domain by itself is unfolded and that about 40% of the VC peptide adopts a helical conformation upon binding actin.We assigned the NOESY spectra and determined which residues of Scar1 VC contact actin by using residue-specific labeling strategies. Seven separate isotope-labeled samples of Scar1 VC were prepared, each with a different 15N-labeled amino acid: alanine, valine, isoleucine, lysine, arginine, leucine, and glycine. The HSQC spectra of each labeled peptide alone and in complex with actin revealed that many residues undergo significant chemical shift changes and line broadening upon binding actin (Fig. 2D, supplemental Fig. S2). Such changes in the NMR spectra indicate the involvement of these amino acids in the binding interface. We correlated chemical shifts in the bound state with NOEs to partially assign the VC peptide. The entire WH2 domain (residues 498-522) was assigned using sequential NOEs and residue labeling. The presence of strong amide-amide NOEs indicates that the WH2 domain is helical. The intensity of the NOEs decreases dramatically at a position immediately C-terminal to the highly conserved Gly-512 and completely disappears at the C-terminal end of the canonical WH2 domain (Val-514), indicating that this region is either dynamic or in an ordered yet nonhelical conformation (Fig. 2A). We observed two inter-residue amide-aliphatic NOEs between actin and Scar1 VC, one at residue Leu-502 and another at Arg-518. Both residues are highly conserved and are required for actin binding. As NOEs are short-range dipole-dipole interactions limited to distances of up to 5-7 Å, our data indicate that these residues in Scar1 VC are in direct contact with the actin monomer (Fig. 2A).Consistent with our binding data shown in Table 1, a number of residues in the C domain undergo actin-induced chemical shift changes and line broadening (Fig. 2A). In addition, spectra of the isolated C domain show chemical shift changes and decreases in peak intensity upon binding actin (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Unlike in the WH2 region, we detected no amide-amide NOEs in the NOESY spectra of the C domain, either alone or attached to the WH2 domain (Fig. 2A). This does not exclude the possibility that the C domain is helical upon binding to actin, as a number of mechanisms such as dynamics can significantly weaken NOE cross-peaks. In fact, our mutagenesis data (see below) as well as previous studies (24Panchal S.C. Kaiser D.A. Torres E. Pollard T.D. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Eadie J.S. Kim S.W. Allen P.G. Hutchinson L.M. Kantor J.D. Zetter B.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2006190060,"NAADP is a second messenger that releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Surprisingly, it has been recently shown that extracellular application of NAADP is capable of inducing intracellular Ca2+ release. This is particularly important since the only mammalian enzymes known to catalyze the synthesis of this second messenger are located extracellularly. In the present manuscript, we have investigated whether mammalian cells possess a transport system capable of transporting this highly charged molecule into cells. Indeed, in RBL-2H3 cells, a rat basophilic cell line, and in SK-N-BE cells, a neuroblastoma cell line, [32P]NAADP is efficiently transported inside cells. NAADP transport is Na+ and Ca2+ dependent, is partially blocked by dipyridamole, but is unaffected by nitrobenzylthioinosine. RBL-2H3 cells also transport [32P]cADPR, but the differences in the pharmacological profile suggest that NAADP transport proceeds by a novel mechanism. Lastly, extracellular application of NAADP, but not NADP, induced a raise in intracellular Ca2+. This is the first demonstration that NAADP is transported into cells and highlights the possibility that, alongside a second messenger, NAADP might also act as an autocrine/paracrine signal."

https://openalex.org/W2041647049,"Numerous studies have demonstrated that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of channels are involved in regulated Ca2+ entry. Additionally, most Ca2+-permeable channels are themselves regulated by Ca2+, often in complex ways. In the current study, we have investigated the regulation of TRPC7, a channel known to be potentially activated by both store-operated mechanisms and non-store-operated mechanisms involving diacylglycerols. Surprisingly, we found that activation of TRPC7 channels by diacylglycerol was blocked by the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin. The structurally related channel, TRPC3, was similarly inhibited. This effect depended on extracellular calcium and on the driving force for Ca2+ entry. The inhibition is not due to calcium entry through store-operated channels but rather results from calcium entry through TRPC7 channels themselves. The effect of thapsigargin was prevented by inhibition of calmodulin and was mimicked by pharmacological disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results suggest the presence of a novel mechanism involving negative regulation of TRPC channels by calcium entering through the channels. Under physiological conditions, this negative feedback by calcium is attenuated by the presence of closely associated SERCA pumps."

The x-ray flux from M82 is modulated, with a peak-to-peak amplitude corresponding to an isotropic luminosity of 2.4 _ 1040 erg s‐1 in M82 and a period of 62.0 � 2.5 days, which we interpret as the orbital period of the ULX binary. This orbital period implies that the mass-donor star must be a giant or supergiant. Large mass-transfer rates, sufficient to fuel the ULX, are expected for a giant-phase mass donor in an x-ray binary. The giant phase has a short lifetime, indicating that we see the ULX in M82 in a brief and unusual period of its evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2127496165,"Numerous data support passage of maternal cells into the fetus during pregnancy in both human and animal models. However, functional benefits of maternal microchimerism in utero are unknown. The current study attempted to take advantage of this route for prenatal delivery of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Naglu) enzyme into the enzyme-deficient mouse model of Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS III B). Enzymatically sufficient mononuclear cells from human umbilical cord blood (MNC hUCB) were intravenously administered into heterozygote females modeling MPS III B on the 5th day of pregnancy during blastocyst implantation. The major findings were 1) administered MNC hUCB cells transmigrated and diffused into the embryos (E12.5); 2) some transmigrated cells expressed CD34 and CD117 antigens; 3) transmigrated cells were found in both the maternal and embryonic parts of placentas; 4) transmigrated cells corrected Naglu enzyme activity in all embryos; 5) administered MNC hUCB cells were extensively distributed in the organs and the blood of heterozygote mothers at one week after transplantation. Results indicate that prenatal delivery of Naglu enzyme by MNC hUCB cell administration into mothers of enzyme-deficient embryos is possible and may present a significant opportunity for new biotechnologies to treat many inherited disorders."
