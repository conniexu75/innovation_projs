Upon ligand stimulation, receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinase receptors, form complexes with common-partner Smad, and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of target genes together with other transcription factors. Polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2/core binding factor (PEBP2/CBF) is a transcription factor complex composed of α and β subunits. The α subunits of PEBP2/CBF, which contain the highly conserved Runt domain, play essential roles in hematopoiesis and osteogenesis. Here we show that three mammalian α subunits of PEBP2/CBF form complexes with R-Smads that act in TGF-β/activin pathways as well as those acting in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways. Among them, PEBP2αC/CBFA3/AML2 forms a complex with Smad3 and stimulates transcription of the germline Ig Cα promoter in a cooperative manner, for which binding of both factors to their specific binding sites is essential. PEBP2 may thus be a nuclear target of TGF-β/BMP signaling. Smads are signal transducers for members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily.

Smads are classified into three subgroups, i.e.receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads. Smad2 and Smad3 are R-Smads that transmit TGF-β/activin signals, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 act as R-Smads mediating BMP signals. Smad4 is the only Co-Smad identified in mammals. Upon ligand stimulation, R-Smads are phosphorylated by the serine/threonine kinase receptors, form complexes with Co-Smad, and translocate into the nucleus, where they cooperatively regulate the transcription of target genes with other transcription factors, including Xenopus FAST1 and its mammalian homologues (3Chen X.

In addition, TGF-β directs class switching to IgA in splenic B cells (8Coffman R.L. Lebman D.A. Shrader B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 9Sonoda E.

BMPs play important roles in early embryogenesis and in the induction of bone formation in vivo(10Hogan B.L. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). It is thus important to identify and classify transcription factors that serve as nuclear targets of TGF-β/BMP signals and regulate these biological events. Polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2/core binding factor (PEBP2/CBF) is a transcription factor complex composed of α and β subunits (11Ito Y. Bae S.-C. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators. Birkäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 107-132Crossref Google Scholar,12Speck N.A. Stacy T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 337-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Three mammalian α subunits have been identified, termed PEBP2αA/CBFA1/AML3 (referred to as αA in this report), PEBP2αB/CBFA2/AML1 (αB), and PEBP2αC/CBFA3/AML2 (αC), whereas only a single β subunit (PEBP2β/CBFB) with several spliced variants is present in mammals. The α subunits of PEBP2, which contain the highly conserved Runt domain, are responsible for binding to DNA and transcription activity. In contrast, the β subunit does not bind to DNA by itself, but it enhances the DNA binding activity of the α subunits by interacting via the Runt domain. PEBP2/CBF plays critical roles in growth and differentiation of cells in certain specific tissues, i.e. αA in bone formation (13Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormalities of the PEBP2 genes are linked to human diseases. Mutations in one allele of the humanPEBP2αA/CBFA1 gene cause human cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (19Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S. Lindhout D. Cole W.G.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 337-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PEBP2 has been shown to interact with several transcription factors and co-activators and support context-dependent transcription of target genes (21Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S. Speck N.A. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 840-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Kim W.-Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.-J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y.

Because BMPs and αA play critical roles in bone formation, and TGF-β and αC in transcription of germline Ig α transcripts required for IgA class switching, we examined the functional cooperation between the PEBP2α subunits and Smads. Our findings suggest that PEBP2α subunits and R-Smads cooperate to synergistically activate transcription in both the TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, thereby regulating the function of cells in specific tissues upon activation by TGF-β-like factors. FLAG-pcDEF3 and 6Myc-pcDEF3 containing six tandem copies of the Myc-epitope tag were previously described (24Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-i. Kawabata M. Miyazono K.

The constructions of constitutively active forms of TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I(TD)) and BMP-type IB receptor (BMPR-IB(QD)), TβR-II, wild-type (WT) Smads, and Smad3(DE) were reported (24Imamura T.

For construction of the isolated Ig Cα/TGF-β-responsive element (TβRE) promoter reporter construct ((TβRE)3-Lux) and its mutants, three tandemly repeated TβREs (WT or mutant versions) of the Ig Cα promoter were fused to the heterologous c-Fos (30Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and luciferase reporters. All of the polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A20.3 B lymphoma cells (18Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J.

P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (32Ogawa E.

For transient transfection, cells were transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). COS7 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs for PEBP2α subunits, Smads and constitutively active forms of type I receptors. Cells were then washed, scraped, and solubilized (25Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed as described (25Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A GST pull-down assay was performed as described previously (22Kim W.-Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.-J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). GST-fusion proteins containing the full-length Smad3 or the Mad homology (MH)1 or MH2 domain of Smad3 were expressed and purified as described (32Ogawa E. Inuzuka M. Maruyama M. Satake M. Naito-Fujimoto M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. Virology. 1993; 194: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).In vitro transcription and translation of C-terminal deletion constructs of αC were done using the TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST-Smad3 (full-length), Smad3 (MH1), Smad3 (MH2), or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose was mixed with αC proteins in 500 μl of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h and washed vigorously three times with 1 ml of the same buffer. After boiling in the SDS-sample buffer, they were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. A20.3 B lymphocytes were transfected with the germline Ig Cα promoter (18Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar) together with the expression constructs for αC, Smads, and TβR-I(TD). P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells were transfected with WT or mutant versions of (TβRE)3-Lux together with αC, Smads, and TβR-I(TD). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) using Lumat LB 9507 (EG&G Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with respect to the Renilla luciferase activity. EMSA was performed as described (27Kanno T. Kanno Y. Chen L.F. Ogawa E. Kim W.Y. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, COS7 cells were transfected with a mixture of expression plasmids encoding TβR-I, TβR-II, Smads, αC, and β2. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, mixed in vitro in combinations as indicated if necessary, and used for EMSA with a 32P-labeled TβRE. We first tested complex formation between αA and R-Smads activated by BMPs. αA interacted with Smad1 and Smad5, which were activated by, BMPR-IB(QD), a constitutively active form of BMPR-IB (Fig.1 A). Smad4 was co-immunoprecipitated with R-Smads activated by the receptors. Importantly, αA also interacted with Smad2 and Smad3 activated by TβR-I(TD), an active TβR-I. We therefore examined whether the other PEBP2α subunits associate with different R-Smads. Smad3 activated by TβR-I(TD) formed complexes not only with αA but also with αB and αC (Fig. 1 B). Smad1 activated by BMPR-IB(QD) also formed complexes with αA, αB, and αC. Other R-Smads, i.e. Smad2 activated by TβR-I(TD) and Smad5 activated by BMPR-IB(QD), also interacted with all three α subunits (data not shown). αB and αC formed complexes with Smad1 and Smad3 equally well, whereas αA associated more strongly with Smad1 and Smad5 than with Smad3 (Fig. 1, A andB). These results indicate that all three mammalian PEBP2α subunits can form complexes with R-Smads. Because αC is predominantly induced by TGF-β in B lymphocytes and is critical for the induction of the promoter for germline Ig Cα transcripts upon TGF-β stimulation (18Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar), complex formation between αC and Smad3 was studied in detail. The αC/Smad3 complex was observed in the presence and absence of TβR-I(TD) (Fig.2 A), and Smad4 interacted with Smad3 upon stimulation by TβR-I(TD). The mode of interaction between αC and Smad3 was studied by GST pull-down assays using deletion constructs of these proteins. When a series of C-terminally truncated constructs of αC was examined, deletion of a C-terminal region (αC (1–283; see Fig. 2 B)) corresponding to a part of the transcriptional activation domain (AD) identified in αB (27Kanno T. Kanno Y. Chen L.F. Ogawa E. Kim W.Y. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a reduction of association with GST-Smad3, and interaction became undetectable by deletion of transcriptional AD (αC (1–234)) (Fig.2 B). Smads have highly conserved MH1 and MH2 domains in their N- and C-terminal regions, respectively (1Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). A GST pull-down assay revealed that the MH2 domain bound to αC (Fig. 2 C). In addition, the MH1 domain weakly interacted with αC, but the exact location in αC where MH1 interacts could not be determined unequivocally because of the weakness of the interaction. We next studied the functional consequence of R-Smad/PEBP2α interaction using the mouse Ig Cα promoter. The promoter for mouse germline Ig Cα transcripts has been shown to contain a TGF-β-responsive element, TβRE (34Lin Y.C. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar), in which two PEBP2α binding sites have recently been identified (18Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar). The human germline Ig Cα promoter was also shown to contain PEBP2α binding sites in its TβRE (35Xie X.Q. Pardali E. Holm M. Sideras P. Grundstrom T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, two potential Smad binding motifs (36Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 37Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) are found in the TβRE (Fig.3 A). Moreover, an additional PEBP2α binding site and one Smad binding motif are observed between the TβRE and the transcription initiation site. To determine the functional importance of these binding motifs, nucleotide mutations were introduced into the promoter, and a transcriptional response assay was performed using A20.3 B lymphocytes. As previously reported (18Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar), TGF-β activates the promoter, which is further enhanced by the presence of αC. Mutations in the Smad binding motifs in the TβRE (TβRE-mS) and those in the PEBP2α binding sites (TβRE-mP) result in dramatic decreases in transcriptional activity (Fig. 3 B). A complete loss of response was observed in the mSP mutant with mutations in all PEBP2α and Smad binding motifs, indicating that both of these binding motifs are essential for transcriptional activation. A dominant negative form of Smad3, Smad3(DE), which prevents the activation of both Smad2 and Smad3 by TβR-I(TD) (26Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), inhibited the transcription induced by TβR-I(TD) and αC (Fig. 3 C). This finding suggests that transcription may be induced by the endogenous R-Smads activated by TβR-I(TD). Moreover, co-transfection of Smad3 with αC strongly induced transcription from the Ig Cα promoter (Fig. 3 D) but not from the Ig Cα promoter containing mutations in the TβRE, as shown in Fig. 3 A(data not shown). Interestingly, Smad2 did not significantly induce the transcription, probably because Smad2 is unable to bind to the Smad binding motifs (36Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 37Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To further study the roles of αC and Smad3/4 in activating transcription, three tandemly repeated TβREs (WT or mutant versions) of the Ig Cα promoter were fused to the heterologous c-Fos promoter, and transcriptional activity was determined using transfected P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, which have very low levels of endogenous PEBP2α activity (32Ogawa E. Inuzuka M. Maruyama M. Satake M. Naito-Fujimoto M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. Virology. 1993; 194: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 33Bae S.-C. Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Oka H. Satake M. Shigesada K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3242-3252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the results obtained with the natural Ig Cα promoter using A20.3 B lymphocytes, transcriptional activity of (TβRE-WT)3-Lux was mildly induced by Smad3 and -4, whereas the addition of Smad3/4 and αC in cells activated by TβR-I(TD) greatly induced transcription (Fig.4 A). In contrast, mutant versions of (TβRE)3-Lux, i.e.(TβRE-mP)3-Lux and (TβRE-mS)3-Lux, which have mutations in the two PEBP2 binding sites and two Smad binding motifs, respectively, did not respond to TβR-I(TD), Smad3/4, or αC, indicating that both of these binding motifs are essential for transcriptional activation by the Smad3/αC complex. To determine the domain(s) in αC critical in the transcriptional activation in concert with Smads, a series of C-terminal deletions of αC was tested for transcription activity. αC mutants containing the transcriptional AD increased transcriptional activation in the presence of TβR-I(TD) and Smad3/4; however, deletion of one-half of the AD resulted in a significant decrease in transcriptional response; complete loss of response was obtained with the mutants lacking the entire AD (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates that the physical interaction between Smad3 and αC may be critical for the transcriptional activation through TβRE (see Fig. 2 B). The formation of DNA-binding complexes containing αC and Smad3 on the germline Cα TβRE DNA was studied by EMSA. The β subunit of PEBP2 (β2 isoform) was included in this assay to enhance the DNA binding of PEBP2. Smad3 activated by TβR-I(TD) and αC independently formed DNA-binding complexes, which could be detected as slowly migrating complexes in EMSA (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3, and B, lanes 3 and4). In the presence of activated Smad3 and αC/β2, a more slowly migrating complex was formed both in vitro andin vivo (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and13, and B, lane 5). These complexes were super-shifted in the presence of corresponding antibodies to the epitope tags or an antibody to the β subunit, indicating that αC/β2 and Smad3 can concomitantly bind to DNA as a multimeric Smad3/αC/β2 complex. Mutations in the Smad binding motifs S1 or S2 resulted in the decrease or loss, respectively, of Smad3 and Smad3/αC/β2 bindings, but the binding of αC/β2 still remained (Fig. 5 B). When the PEBP2α sites were mutated, a mutation in P2, but not in P1, disrupted the bindings of αC/β2 and Smad3/αC/β2, but binding of Smad3 was still detected. The Smad binding motifs and PEBP2α binding sites thus appear to be specific and sufficient for the binding of corresponding proteins, but both are required for the binding of the Smad3/αC/β2 complex to the TβRE and for activation of the promoter by αC and Smad3. The findings shown in the present study revealed that PEBP2α subunits and R-Smads specific for both TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways form complexes together with Smad4 and that the complex formation appears to be critical for efficient transcriptional activation of target genes, including the germline Ig Cα promoter. Our findings suggest that PEBP2 may function as a nuclear target of TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways and that the biological effects of TGF-β/BMP may be regulated by cooperation between Smads and PEBP2. Smads have been reported to interact with various DNA-binding proteins as well as the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP and co-repressor TGIF (40Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H.

Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Because members of the TGF-β superfamily have pleiotropic functions, interaction with various transcription factors may be required for Smads to exhibit specific effects in certain cell types. Many of these interacting partners, including c-Jun and the vitamin D receptor (6Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 42Yanagisawa J.

Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PEBP2 is conspicuous compared with these factors, because all three mammalian α subunits of PEBP2 interact with all R-Smads tested in the present study. Recently, SIP1 has been shown to interact with all R-Smads; in contrast to the PEBP2 α subunits, however, SIP1 is a transcriptional repressor, and interaction with R-Smads may lead to relief of repression of target genes by SIP1 (44Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol.

Analysis by C-terminal deletion of αC revealed that the C-terminal region, including the transcriptional AD of αC, is required for efficient interaction with the MH2 domain of Smad3. PEBP2 is a context-dependent transcription factor, requiring interacting partners for transcriptional activation, including Ets-1 (21Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S. Speck N.A. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 840-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Kim W.-Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.-J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the germline Ig Cα promoter, both PEBP2 and Smad binding sites are essential for transcriptional activation. In contrast, FAST1 binds to the Mix.2 gene promoter with high affinity, and therefore direct binding of Smads to DNA may be less important than in the Ig Cα promoter (39Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, in certain other promoters to which PEBP2 binds with a high affinity together with other transcription factors, direct DNA binding of Smads may not be critical for cooperative transcriptional activation by PEBP2 and Smads. Our present study revealed that PEBP2α subunits interact with R-Smads activated by TGF-β/activin, as well as with those activated by BMPs, and that functional cooperation between αC and Smad3 is required for transcription driven by the germline Cα promoter. Germline Ig α transcripts are required for IgA class switching (45Stavnezer J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because members of the TGF-β superfamily exhibit a wide variety of biological effects, it will be very important to examine whether PEBP2 is involved in these biological events as a nuclear target of Smads.

We demonstrate here, using the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro binding assay, that the c-Cbl RING finger domain interacts with UbcH7, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). UbcH7 interacted with the wild-type c-Cbl RING finger domain but not with a RING finger domain that lacks the amino acids that are deleted in 70Z-Cbl, an oncogenic mutant of c-Cbl. The in vitro interaction was enhanced by sequences on both the N- and C-terminal sides of the RING finger. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that c-Cbl and UbcH7 synergistically promote the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In contrast, 70Z-Cbl markedly reduced the ligand-induced, UbcH7-mediated ubiquitination of the EGFR. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, significantly prolonged the ligand-induced phosphorylation of both the EGFR and c-Cbl. Thus, c-Cbl plays an essential role in the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR by a mechanism that involves an interaction of the RING finger domain with UbcH7. This mechanism participates in the down-regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors and loss of this function, as occurs in the naturally occurring 70Z-Cbl isoform, probably contributes to oncogenic transformation. c-Cbl plays a negative regulatory role in tyrosine kinase signaling by an as yet undefined mechanism.

The exact role of c-Cbl in these signaling pathways is not fully elucidated, however. Recent reports have indicated that in several instances c-Cbl exerts a negative regulatory function on receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (1Ota Y. Samelson L.E.

Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which c-Cbl exerts this negative regulatory function remains to be demonstrated. The functional domains of c-Cbl include a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)1 domain, a RING finger domain, a proline-rich region, and a leucine zipper. In addition, several tyrosine residues can be phosphorylated to generate SH2 binding motifs (for review, see Refs. 10Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P. Rao N. Band H. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 189-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 11Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 359-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PTB and RING finger domains are evolutionarily conserved (10Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P. Rao N. Band H. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 189-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 359-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andDrosophila Cbl (D-Cbl), which lacks both the proline-rich region and the leucine zipper, can still function as a negative regulator in EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling (12Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernández B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Hime G.R. Dhungat M.P. Ng A. Bowtell D.D.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is therefore most likely that the negative regulatory function of c-Cbl is dependent upon the PTB and/or RING finger domains. Indeed, previous studies have indicated that the PTB domain plays an essential role in c-Cbl-dependent negative regulation of tyrosine kinases (6Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J. Barnett L. Bertoncello I. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It is, however, likely that the RING finger domain is also involved in negative regulation since deletion of 17 amino acids that overlap the N-terminal boundary of the c-Cbl RING finger domain (amino acids 366–382), as occurs in the 70Z/3 mouse pre-B lymphoma cell line, is sufficient for transformation (14Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Andoniou et al. (14Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) tested a number of deletion mutants of c-Cbl for their transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells and suggested that a truncation that disrupts the RING finger domain is sufficient to activate c-Cbl's tumorigenic potential, although it is not enough to give it full transforming potential. While it is known that the PTB domain interacts with phosphotyrosine residues and is involved in the binding of c-Cbl to tyrosine kinases as well as to tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor molecules (15Lupher Jr., M.L.

Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the function of the c-Cbl RING finger domain is not known at present. Here we provide evidence that the c-Cbl RING finger domain associates with the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 7 (UbcH7) (17Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and that their interaction plays a critical role in the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR in cells. c-Cbl recruits ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) via its RING finger domain, allowing ubiquitination of phosphorylated substrates and thereby inducing their degradation via the proteasome pathway. Moreover, the oncogenic 70Z-Cbl fails to bind UbcH7, and exerts a dominant negative effect on ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR, suggesting a possible explanation for its transforming potential. The following c-Cbl mutants were prepared by the PCR technique using the clone of hemagglutinin-tagged human c-Cbl in pGEM-4Z, kindly provided by Dr. W. Langdon (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Western Australia) as template: RING (codon 374–430), RING-A (codon 358–430, lacks residues 366–382), RING-B (codon 358–430), RING-C (codon 358–445), RING-D (codon 358–472), RING-E (codon 358–472, lacks 366–382), and RING-F (codon 374–472) (see Fig. 1 A). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were created by cloning the PCR fragments containing additional EcoRI andSalI sites into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia colistrain NM522 (Stratagene), and GST fusion proteins were purified with GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To create Myc-tagged UbcH7 (codon 2–154), the PCR products were subcloned into pCS-MT+ (18Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) in-frame. The resulting fusion proteins contained a Myc tag at the N terminus. The coding sequences were transferred to a pcDNA3 expression vector using HindIII/XbaI sites. To identify a clone interacting with the c-Cbl RING finger domain, a two-hybrid screen was performed as described previously (19Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding the c-Cbl RING finger domain or the deletion mutant of the RING finger domain lacking 17 amino acids were created by PCR, then subcloned into the pBTM116 vector as fusions to the LexA DNA-binding domain (RING/BD and RING-A/BD, respectively; see Fig. 1 A). Human MDM2 (20Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) and UbcH5 (21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The sequence encoding the MDM2-RING finger domain (codon 424–496) was subcloned into pBTM (MDM2-RING/BD). Full-length UbcH5 (codon 1–148) was subcloned into the pACT vector as a fusion to GAL4 DNA-activating domain (UbcH5/AD). 293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium, α-modification containing 10% fetal calf serum. To obtain the stable transformants of c-Cbl, the Myc-tagged version of full-length c-Cbl cDNA (codon 2–906) was subcloned into the pcDNA3/Zeo expression vector. The plasmid was introduced into 293 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and stable transformants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml Zeosin. The cell line stably expressing Myc-c-Cbl was maintained in minimal essential medium, α-modification containing 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-EGF receptor, anti-c-Cbl, and anti-UbcH7 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and the mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody was purchased from CHEMICON. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Tyr(P)99), anti-GST antibody, and the mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (22Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To increase the immunoblot sensitivity with anti-ubiquitin antibody, the membrane was treated at 100 °C before probing with antibody as previously reported (23Swerdlow P.S. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For reprobing, immunoblots were stripped with buffer containing 0.2m glycine and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.8. Untransfected 293 cells were serum-starved, then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 1 min to induce phosphorylation. EGF-treated and untreated cells were lysed in 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the EGFR was immunoprecipitated from 1.5 mg of lysate. The immune complexes on agarose beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and with reaction buffer two times. Cell extracts of untransfected 293 cells or 293 cells that overexpressed c-Cbl or 70Z-Cbl were prepared by resuspending pelleted cells in 2 volumes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm MG132, and protease inhibitors as described above, and sonicating for two cycles of 30 s. The reaction mixture (150 μl) contained the immunoprecipitates, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 25 μmMG132, 7.5 μg of GST-ubiquitin, and 300 μg of cell extracts. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed with 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 in phosphate-buffered saline three times, then prepared for Western blotting and analyzed for the presence of GST-ubiquitin linked to the EGFR. MG132 (N-Cbz-Leu-Leu-Leu-AL) was purchased from Sigma and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before use. Throughout the experiments, the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in cell culture media was kept 0.1% in both treated and control cultures. To identify proteins that bind to the c-Cbl RING finger domain we screened several yeast two-hybrid libraries using that protein fragment as bait. In several experiments, this led to the cloning of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH7. Three cDNAs were isolated, each containing the complete coding sequence but differing in the length of the 5′-untranslated region. Using the yeast two-hybrid procedure, we found that, in yeast, UbcH7 interacts with the c-Cbl RING finger domain but not with the 70Z 17-amino acid deletion mutant of the c-Cbl RING finger domain (RING-A) (Fig.1 B). Recent studies have demonstrated that the RING finger domain-containing protein MDM2 (24Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 198-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) cooperates specifically with another ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UbcH5, to ubiquitinate the tumor suppressor protein p53 (25Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). To determine the relative specificity of such RING-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme interactions, we tested the ability of the MDM2 RING finger to interact with UbcH7 and, reciprocally, the ability of the c-Cbl RING finger to interact with UbcH5. Neither interaction could be detected (Fig. 1 B), thereby demonstrating that these RING finger domains interact with E2 molecules in a specific manner. The c-Cbl RING finger domain encompasses amino acids 380 to 425, and c-Cbl constructs encoding only the N-terminal 1–436 amino acids or with deletions of either of Tyr368 or Tyr371 have tumorigenic potential (14Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the interaction of the c-Cbl RING finger domain with UbcH7 in vitro and to analyze the role of specific c-Cbl sequences in the interaction, we generated several RING finger constructs that fused GST to the RING finger domain and adjacent regions (illustrated in Fig. 1 A). Myc epitope-tagged UbcH7 (Myc-UbcH7) was expressed in 293 cells and the cells were either stimulated with EGF or left untreated. The cells were then lysed and cell extracts were incubated in vitro with the GST-RING fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the RING-D (codon 358–472) fusion protein efficiently associated with UbcH7 regardless of EGF stimulation. However, the short RING finger region (374–430), or other constructs lacking adjoining regions of the RING finger domain did not interact well with UbcH7 in vitro, indicating that both the N- and C-terminal proximal regions are necessary for high affinity interaction with UbcH7 (Fig.1 C). The requirement for these N- and C-terminal adjacent regions for detection of the RING-UbcH7 interaction by in vitro binding but not for the yeast two-hybrid may be due to a higher sensitivity of the latter assay. It has recently become evident that c-Cbl regulates the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (26Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Miyake S. Mullane-Robinson K.P. Lill N.L. Douillard P. Band H. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (29Wang Y. Yeung Y.G. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Lee P.S.W. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.-G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which c-Cbl does this has not been clarified. Our yeast two-hybrid assays andin vitro binding results suggested that c-Cbl recruits UbcH7 through its RING finger. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) play an essential role in the ubiquitination of proteins (for review, see Refs.31Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 32Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that c-Cbl could on the one hand bind to the receptor and on the other hand serve as a docking protein for UbcH7, thereby acting as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) to mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the phosphorylated receptor. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of overexpression of UbcH7 and c-Cbl on the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR (Fig. 2 A). Myc-tagged c-Cbl, 70Z-Cbl (the oncogenic mutant c-Cbl lacking 17 amino acids at the boundary of the RING finger domain), or UbcH7 were expressed in 293 cells, and the cells were stimulated with EGF for various times. As hypothesized, overexpression of either Myc-UbcH7 or Myc-c-Cbl clearly enhanced the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the endogenous EGFR. Interestingly, and in contrast with wild-type c-Cbl, overexpression of Myc-70Z-Cbl did not enhance the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR, suggesting that 70Z-Cbl lacks the ability to promote ubiquitination of the EGFR, and further supporting the role of the c-Cbl RING finger domain and UbcH7 in the ubiquitination of the EFGR. To determine whether c-Cbl and UbcH7 had additive effects, we created a stably transformed 293 cell line that overexpresses c-Cbl (293-Cbl). Although 293 cells express endogenous c-Cbl, ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR was enhanced in c-Cbl transformants compared with parental 293 cells (data not shown), as we had observed in the transiently transfected cells (Fig. 2 A). Expression of UbcH7 in 293-Cbl cells resulted in greatly enhanced ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR (Fig. 2 B). These data indicated that both the RING finger containing c-Cbl and UbcH7 participate in the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR in cells. To further confirm the role of a c-Cbl·UbcH7 complex in the ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR, we examined the effect of exogenous UbcH7 on the in vitro ubiquitination of activated EGFR (Fig. 3). Assays were performed using extracts from untransfected 293 cells, c-Cbl overexpressing 293 cells, or 70Z-Cbl overexpressing 293 cells. The c-Cbl cell extract, but not the 70Z-Cbl cell extract, enhanced the ubiquitination of phosphorylated EGFR relative to that obtained with parental 293 cell extracts (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 2, 4, and6). The addition of exogenous UbcH7 significantly increased the ubiquitination of activated-EGFR in the assay with the extracts of the c-Cbl-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3, upper andmiddle panel, lanes 4 and 5) but not in the assays with extracts of the parental 293 cells (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3) or those of the 70Z-Cbl-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3, upper panel,lanes 6 and 7). These findings clearly demonstrate that c-Cbl and UbcH7 together promote the ubiquitination of the EGFR via a mechanism that requires an intact c-Cbl RING finger domain. Given the fact that c-Cbl binds stably to the activated EGFR, we sought to demonstrate that UbcH7 was also present in the EGFR·c-Cbl complex isolated from cells stimulated with EGF. We were unable, however, to isolate complexes that contained UbcH7 in addition to the EGFR and c-Cbl (data not shown), suggesting that the association of UbcH7 with the c-Cbl-EGFR complex is not sufficiently long lived to be detected in this manner. The transfection and in vitroubiquitination experiments indicated that 70Z-Cbl, which lacks 17 amino acids at the N-terminal boundary of the RING finger, is unable to enhance ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR (Fig. 2 A). Wild type c-Cbl may act as a docking protein, binding to the activated EGFR through its PTB domain and in turn allowing the binding of UbcH7 to its RING finger, thereby bringing the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme to its substrate. We therefore hypothesized that 70Z-Cbl, which lacks residues that are necessary for the Cbl-UbcH7 interaction but is still capable of binding to the activated EGFR (5Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Bowtell D.D. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1561-1567PubMed Google Scholar), would prevent the binding of the c-Cbl·UbcH7 complex to the activated EGFR. According to this hypothesis, overexpression of 70Z-Cbl should not only fail to induce ubiquitination but also prevent the c-Cbl-UbcH7-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of overexpressing 70Z-Cbl on UbcH7-mediated ubiquitination of the EGFR. Myc-tagged UbcH7 was expressed in 293 cells with or without 70Z-Cbl, and the cells were stimulated with EGF for various periods of time. UbcH7 again clearly enhanced ubiquitination of the EGFR (Fig.4, upper panel, comparelanes 1 and 3), and as predicted, the co-expression of the 70Z-Cbl protein inhibited the UbcH7-mediated ubiquitination of the EGFR in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, both c-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors through their PTB domain (16Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) but only c-Cbl, with an intact RING finger, can bring ubiquitin to the complex. Ubiquitination of cellular proteins leads to their degradation by the proteasome system, and it has been suggested that this system is involved in ligand-mediated down-regulation of cell surface receptors (for review, see Ref. 31Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether inhibition of ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation would prolong the duration of the ligand-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR. Cells stably expressing c-Cbl (293-Cbl) were preincubated with or without a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and the cells were stimulated with EGF for various time periods (Fig.5). In MG132-treated cells, the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins was clearly sustained for a longer period of time (Fig.5 A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR antibody revealed that the duration of the presence of the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was extended when the cells were treated with MG132 (Fig.5 B). Moreover, the ligand-induced phosphorylation of c-Cbl as well as its association with the EGFR were also prolonged in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 5 C). Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of 70Z-Cbl enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR after stimulation, that tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z-Cbl in response to EGF stimulation was markedly enhanced compared with wild-type c-Cbl, and that the binding of 70Z-Cbl to the activated EGFR was also enhanced (5Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Bowtell D.D. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1561-1567PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation has similar effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and downstream signaling as does overexpression of 70Z-Cbl. These results suggest that ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor could be an integral part of the mechanism of down-regulation of signaling after activation of the EGFR, and that some or all of 70Z-Cbl's transforming activity may be due to the inability of the defective RING finger to interact with UbcH7, resulting in the dominant negative effect of 70Z-Cbl on the ubiquitination of EGFR. We interpret our results to show that c-Cbl, in addition to functioning as an adaptor protein and a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and participates in the down-regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors by mediating their ubiquitination. We show here that this function is dependent on the integrity of the RING finger of c-Cbl and its interaction with UbcH7. Ubiquitination and the consequent degradation of the ubiquitinated protein by the proteasome or lysosomal pathways plays an important role in the control of numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction (34Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 35Hicke L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 9: 107-112Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is widely assumed that the E2 and E3 classes of ubiquitinating enzymes play a major role in mediating substrate recognition, and E3s are considered to be largely responsible for target specificity (for review, see Ref. 31Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms by which substrates are selected by the ubiquitin-conjugating apparatus are still poorly understood, some E3 proteins may function simply as docking proteins that bind to both a specific substrate protein and a specific E2 (for review, see Ref. 32Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Recent reports from several laboratories (25Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H.

In many cases, the target recognition and E2-binding functions are performed by different subunits of a multimolecular complex (38Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 39Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C.

Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is now apparent that in some of cases, the domain in the target recognition subunit that binds the RING finger-containing subunit is a SOCS box (38Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 41Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This motif, named suppressor of cytokine signaling, was first identified in the SOCS/JAB proteins that down-regulate the activity of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by binding to phosphorylated JAK (19Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A.

Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Our present data suggest that in contrast with these multimeric ubiquitin ligases, c-Cbl performs both the docking functions of such E3 ligase complexes, combining both the substrate targeting function (PTB domain) and the E2-binding RING domain in a single molecule with multiple protein recognition domains (Fig. 6B). Very recently, Miyake et al. (27Miyake S. Mullane-Robinson K.P. Lill N.L. Douillard P. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) reported that a point mutation (G306E) that inactivates the PTB domain of c-Cbl abrogated the ability of c-Cbl to enhance the ligand-induced ubiquitination of platelet-derived growth factor receptor. However, G306E-Cbl can still associate with the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor via its C terminus region, suggesting that the interaction of the PTB domain with the receptor (or another target protein) somehow promotes the interaction of UbcH7 with c-Cbl and/or induces the transfer of ubiquitin from UbcH7 to the receptor. Given the fact that c-Cbl also functions as a major cellular adaptor protein, such a mechanism could prevent the nonspecific ubiquitination of proteins that bind to other domains of c-Cbl. It also suggests a possible explanation of our inability to detect a stable EGFR·c-Cbl·UbcH7 complex. Since the EGFR must be polyubiquitinated, the E2 protein must disengage from the complex as soon as it has transferred its ubiquitin in order to allow the next ubiquitinated E2 to bind to the RING finger. It would therefore not be expected to remain associated during the isolation of the c-Cbl·EGFR complex. Since c-Cbl binds to a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including non-receptor tyrosine kinases, it may also function as an E3 for other signaling molecules. Wang et al. (44Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Langdon W.Y. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have shown that c-Cbl is transiently ubiquitinated after colony-stimulating factor-1 stimulation, but that it is not degraded, in contrast to the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor. We also failed to see any reduction of the level of c-Cbl protein after EGF stimulation in this study (Fig. 5 C). Thus, c-Cbl may target the ubiquitinating system to the activated receptors, thereby inducing their degradation, but escape from proteasomal degradation itself. The targeting of the EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases for ubiquitination and proteolysis is only one of several mechanisms that contribute to the rapid down-regulation of signaling by the receptor. As recently discussed (45Leevers S.J. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E10-E11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two additional independent mechanisms exist in Drosophila to terminate signaling by the EGFR. In one, activation of the EGFR induces expression of the transmembrane protein Kekkon1, which binds directly to the activated receptor and apparently interferes with EGFR activation (46Ghiglione C. Carraway III, K.L. Amundadottir L.T. Boswell R.E. Perrimon N. Duffy J.B. Cell. 1999; 96: 847-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The other mechanism involves the induction of Sprouty, a protein that binds the downstream signaling molecules Drk and Gap, thereby blocking Ras-related signaling (47Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results suggest that c-Cbl exerts its negative regulatory function on EGFR (and probably on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor), at least in part, via the ligand-induced RING finger-dependent recruitment of UbcH7 into complexes with the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor proteins, leading to their subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, a naturally occurring oncogenic mutant in which the RING finger domain has been partially deleted (70Z-Cbl) functions as a dominant negative form of c-Cbl for EGF-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor, suggesting that the loss of the RING finger-mediated UbcH7 binding may be an important determinant in the oncogenic properties of 70Z-Cbl (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, v-Cbl also contains the PTB domain but lacks the RING finger, suggesting that its oncogenic activity too could be related to the inhibition of the ubiquitination of receptor(s). Given that the v-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl transformed phenotypes differ, further work will be necessary to understand the possible role of the RING finger deletion in v-Cbl-induced transformation. We thank W. Y. Langdon for the gift of human c-Cbl cDNA, D. Finley for the gift of the plasmid encoding the GST-ubiquitin, and the members of our laboratories for many helpful discussions."

In most normal, nonexposed cells, p53 is a latent factor. Induction in response to stress involves nuclear accumulation (as a result of escape from mdm-2-mediated degradation and nuclear export) and conversion to an active form with high affinity for specific DNA sequences. Activation requires post-translational modifications at both the N and C terminus of the protein, including changes in phosphorylation, acetylation, and binding to heterologous proteins (1Liu L.

Activated p53 controls several sets of genes to prevent the proliferation of cells under stress conditions. Genes transactivated by p53 include inhibitors of cell cycle progression in G1 and G2 (p21waf-1 ,14-3-3ς, GADD 45), regulators of apoptosis (APO1-Fas/CD95, Bax-1, KILLER/DR5), and genes involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (such as PIG-3, PIG-6, and PIG-12) that may play a role in induction of apoptosis (6Polyak K.

Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The structure of the DNA-binding domain consists of two β-sheets supporting a loop-sheet-helix motif (that interacts with the major groove of DNA) and a loop-helix motif (L2/L3, that interacts with the minor groove). L2/L3 is stabilized by tetrahedric coordination of zinc by residues Cys176, His179, Cys238, and Cys242 (13Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P.

Folded and unfolded forms of human wild-type p53 are distinguishable by their reactivity with the conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies PAb1620 (folded form, often termed “wild-type” conformation) and PAb240 (unfolded form, often termed “mutant” conformation).The folding of the DNA-binding domain is sensitive to metal substitution and to oxido-reduction in vitro and in intact cells. Removal of zinc by chelation reversibly alters p53 conformation, with loss of DNA binding capacity (5Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore,metals such as copper, cadmium, or mercury induce p53 to adopt a PAb240+ phenotype in vitro (17Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1739-1742PubMed Google Scholar;18Hainaut P.

These observations raise the possibility that exposure to toxic metals and perturbation of the physiological metal supply may affect p53 functionin vivo.Metals such as cadmium, chromium, nickel, and arsenic are classified in group 1 of the International Agency for Research on Cancer categories of carcinogens (carcinogenic to humans; for reviews, see Refs. 19Beyersmann D.

Smoking, together with occupation, are the major sources of human exposure. Cadmium is absorbed by inhalation and ingestion and has a very long biological half-life (>25 years). Epidemiological studies have identified lung, prostate, and, to a lesser extent, kidney and stomach as primary targets for cadmium-induced tumorigenesis (21International Agency for Cancer Research IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risks Hum. 1993; 58: 119-237PubMed Google Scholar). In exposed industrial workers, cadmium accumulates in the kidneys (100–400 μg/g, wet weight) and liver (20–100 μg/g, wet weight), at levels that are 5–9 times higher than those of unexposed workers (25Ellis K.J.

The kidneys and liver express high levels of metallothioneins, a class of stress response proteins that bind and detoxify cadmium.The mechanisms of cadmium carcinogenesis are poorly understood.In vitro, at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mmol, cadmium is cytotoxic and induces radical-dependent DNA damage (27Coogan T.P.

Health Perspect. 1994; 102 Suppl. 3: 341-342PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with other carcinogenic metals, cadmium is a weak mutagen (29Rossman T.G. Roy N.K. Lin W.C. IARC Sci. Publ. 1992; 118: 367-375PubMed Google Scholar). At lower concentrations (1–100 μmol), cadmium binds to proteins, decreases DNA repair (30Dally H. Hartwig A.

Thus, cadmium carcinogenicity may involve multiple factors, including up-regulation of mitogenic signals and interference with DNA repair (for a review, see Ref. 19Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).In this study, we have examined the effects of cadmium on p53 protein conformation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. Using the breast carcinoma MCF7 cell line, which expresses high levels of wild-type p53, we show that cadmium at subtoxic concentrations (10–30 μm) perturbs the folding of p53, disrupts DNA binding, impairs p53 induction by DNA-damaging agents, inhibits transactivation of a reporter gene and of target genes such as p21waf-1 , and prevents cell cycle arrest in response to γ-irradiation. Based on these results, we propose that cadmium may inactivate wild-type p53 by altering metal-dependent folding and that this effect may contribute to cadmium carcinogenesis.DISCUSSIONZinc is essential for correct folding of wild-type p53. The DNA-binding domain contains a tetrahedrally coordinated zinc that stabilizes two loops at the DNA-binding surface of the protein (13Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies have shown that metal chelation abolishes binding of p53 to specific DNA (12Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 17Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1739-1742PubMed Google Scholar, 37Verhaegh G.W.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5361-5364PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, metal chelation increases oxidation of cysteines in p53, indicating that zinc binding is not purely structural but also controls the sensitivity of p53 to oxidation-reduction (17Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1739-1742PubMed Google Scholar, 49Delphin C. Cahen P. Lawrence J.J. Baudier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Reduction of cysteines stimulates p53 DNA-binding (5Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar, 50Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and Ref-1, a protein that regulates the redox state of several transcription factors, is a potent activator of p53 (51Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In vitro, the conformation and DNA-binding capacity of p53 are altered by incubation with metals chemically close to zinc, such as cadmium and copper, but not with cobalt, magnesium, manganese, or iron (17Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1739-1742PubMed Google Scholar, 52Coffer A.I. Knowles P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that specific metals and redox factors may affect the fine tuning of p53 and participate in the physiological control of p53 functions (5Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 16Verhaegh G.W. Richard M.J. Hainaut P. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).We show here that sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 in vitro is decreased by cadmium in a dose-dependent manner. In MCF7 cells, transient exposure (4 h) to cadmium at 20 μm and above induced a change in p53 conformation (to the unfolded, PAb240+ form) with loss of DNA binding and transcriptional activity. These results are consistent with this idea that cadmium perturbs the folding of p53 in a direct or indirect manner.In the neuroblastoma cell line HT4, cadmium at concentrations up to 100 μm, equal to or greater than those used here, has been shown to induce disruption of intracellular sulfhydryl homostasis and depletion of pools of GSH. These effects were accompanied by an increase in protein thiolation and ubiquitination (40Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Extensive oxidative stress induced by cadmium may perhaps inactivate p53 by oxidation, a phenomenon that has been observed in cultured cells exposed to nitric oxide (14Calmels S. Hainaut P. Ohshima H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3365-3369PubMed Google Scholar), to hydrogen peroxide (53Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and to glutathione-depleting agents (54Russo T. Zambrano N. Esposito F. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Fiscella M. Jackman J. O'Connor P.M. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29386-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).On the other hand, cadmium easily substitutes for zinc in several zinc-dependent DNA-binding proteins and inhibits many enzymes containing essential dithiols (55Simons Jr., S.S. Chakraborti P.K. Cavanaugh A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1938-1945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, with the zinc-inducible transcription factor MTF-1, cadmium at 6 μm partially abrogates activation of DNA binding by the addition of 30 μm zinc and totally inactivates it at 60 μm (56Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L.-A. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). MTF-1 contains six Cys2-His2 zinc fingers, which are thought to bind cadmium with high affinity (56Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L.-A. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cadmium differs from zinc in that it has a higher affinity for thiols and has a larger atomic radius. The binding affinity of cadmium to cysteine thiolate clusters in zinc finger proteins is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of zinc (22Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 24Thiesen H.J. Bach C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 57Predki P.F. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5842-5846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we found that the effect of cadmium on p53 was not reversed by the addition of excess ZnCl2 (up to 25-fold) to cadmium-treated MCF7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, although our data do not provide a formal proof that cadmium can displace zinc from native p53, our results are consistent with the idea that cadmium perturbs the metal-dependent folding of the DNA-binding domain.In MCF7 cells, cadmium exerts complex, biphasic effects on p53 protein levels and DNA binding activity. At low concentrations (up to 10 μm), cadmium alone induces a small (2–3-fold) but reproducible accumulation of p53 protein, correlated with slightly enhanced DNA binding activity (2.28 ± 0.26-fold). This effect may be due to p53 protein stabilization by low levels of oxidative DNA-damage induced by cadmium. However, increasing the concentration of cadmium does not result in higher levels of p53 protein activation. In contrast, it significantly decreases p53 DNA binding activity (at 20 μm) and protein levels (at 40 μm). Furthermore, inhibition of p53 activity correlates with a change in protein conformation, with loss of PAb1620 reactivity (wild type-specific) and acquisition of the PAb240-positive phenotype (Fig.3 C). Along with the observation that cadmium does not prevent p53 localization in the nucleus (Fig. 3 B), these data indicate that cadmium inhibits p53 by turning it into an inactive, “mutant-like,” form.Cadmium at 30 μm induces total inhibition of p53 protein activation in response to DNA-damaging agents such as Act D, methylmethane sulfonate, or H2O2. This inhibition resulted in a loss of transcriptional activation of several p53 target genes including p21waf-1 . Moreover, cadmium at noncytotoxic concentrations (10 μm) is sufficient to significantly reduce (by about 40%) the extent of p53 induction by DNA-damaging agents and therefore to perturb the response of p53 to DNA damage.The apparent contradiction between the effects of cadmium at 10 and 30 μm may be resolved by considering that cadmium has two opposite effects on p53, with first protein stabilization as a result of generation of DNA damage by low doses of cadmium and, second, direct inhibition of p53 protein by metal substitution and conformational modifications at higher doses of cadmium. The level of p53 DNA binding activity detected in the presence of cadmium would thus depend upon a subtle balance between these two mechanisms.Inhibition of p53 DNA binding activity by cadmium has important functional consequences in cultured cells. First, cadmium reduces p53-dependent transactivation of reporter or endogenous target genes. Second, cadmium prevents the cell cycle arrest induced by low doses of γ-irradiation in MCF7 cells, suggesting that cadmium can effectively suppress p53 protein function. Cells exposed to cadmium thus behave in a manner analogous to p53-deficient cells that retain the capacity to proliferate after exposure to DNA-damaging agents. A similar hypothesis has been proposed in the case of excess production of nitric oxide, which also induces conformational and functional changes in wild-type p53 (14Calmels S. Hainaut P. Ohshima H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3365-3369PubMed Google Scholar). Impairment of p53 function by cadmium may contribute to decrease the cell capacity to respond to the DNA damage induced by other carcinogens, thereby increasing the likelihood of acquiring mutations leading to cancer.Cadmium is highly toxic in most biological systems and has a very long biological half-life (about 25 years in humans (20Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to consider whether the concentrations of cadmium used in our experiments are compatible with those that occur in target cells of exposed organisms. After exposure to cadmium, most of the intracellular pool of cadmium is bound to MTs, a class of inducible, metal-binding proteins that sequester cadmium and protect cells from its toxic effect. However, experiments with MT-I and -II knockout mice showed that cadmium also accumulates to high levels in the absence of MT. In MT-deficient mice, CdCl2 injected subcutaneously at 30 μg/kg accumulates in liver cells within 3–6 h at up to 20–25 μg/g of fresh tissue (58Zheng H. Liu J. Choo K.H. Michalska A.E. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 136: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These levels may correspond to intracellular concentrations 3–10-fold higher than those used in the present study. Although this dose of cadmium was toxic in MT-deficient mice, it produced only mild hepatotoxicity in control mice. Concentrations of cadmium of up to 25 μm are well tolerated in many cultured cell lines (30Dally H. Hartwig A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects reported here are compatible with concentrations of cadmium that are not lethal and can occur in biological systems after acute or chronic exposure.Alteration of p53 protein conformation by cadmium was described previously, using in vitro translated p53, with concentrations of CdCl2 of 50–100 μm (17Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1739-1742PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, we show that much lower concentrations of cadmium (10–30 μm) are able to alter p53 conformation and function in intact cells. This is the first report that a metal compound can inactivate p53 at doses compatible with biological effects.In 1995, Zheng et al. (58Zheng H. Liu J. Choo K.H. Michalska A.E. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 136: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that cadmium could increase p53 mRNA levels in liver cells of mice injected with CdCl2. We did not observe such an effect in cultured MCF7 cells. It is important to note that induction of p53 mRNA was observed as a late event (after 6–12 h) in mice receiving a high, hepatotoxic dose of cadmium. Therefore, it is possible that elevated p53 mRNA may represent a response to cell damage rather than a direct effect of cadmium on p53 gene expression.The mechanism of p53 inactivation described here may account for some of the unexplained properties of cadmium as a carcinogen. Indeed, cadmium is a weak genotoxic agent compared with metals such as copper, iron, nickel, and chromium. Therefore, mechanisms other than direct genotoxicity have been proposed to explain cadmium carcinogenesis (59Reid T.M. Feig D.I. Loeb L.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102 Suppl. 3: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to cadmium enhances the persistence of DNA lesions induced by mutagens such as benzo(a)pyrene and methylmethane sulfonate in human cells, suggesting that cadmium may inhibit DNA repair. Recently, Dally and Hartwig (30Dally H. Hartwig A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) have shown that cadmium, as well as nickel, inhibits the repair of DNA damage after irradiation. These authors propose that cadmium may either inactivate repair enzymes directly, for example by reaction with a histidine or cysteine residue, or compete with and displace essential metal ions, a hypothesis compatible with the results presented here. Inhibition of p53 function may explain the persistence of DNA lesions in cells exposed to both carcinogens and cadmium. According to this model, cadmium would not act as a conventional mutagen but rather as an indirect carcinogen that sensitizes cells to the genotoxic effects of other carcinogens by switching off essential components of cell cycle control and DNA repair pathways involving p53.Cadmium exerts complex effects on the growth and survival of normal and cancer cells. The metal was shown to induce apoptosis or necrosis in some cells and tissues and to reduce the growth and metastasis of human lung carcinoma xenograft in nude mice (60Prise K.M. Gillies N.E. Whelan A. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Michael B.D. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1995; 67: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, cadmium was shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging metals such as chromium (61Shimada H. Shiao Y.H. Shibata M. Waalkes M.P. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1998; 54: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the sensitivity to cadmium may vary from one cell type to another and that some cancer cells may be hypersensitive to cadmium. The cytotoxic impact of cadmium may be related to the cellular level of metallothioneins, which is frequently deregulated in cancer cells (62Waalkes M.P. Diwan B.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).It would be naive to suggest that effects on p53 alone can explain all of the cadmium carcinogenicity. Indeed, it is likely that cadmium substitutes for zinc and alters the function of a number of other cellular proteins. For example, Cd2+ (as well as a number of other metal ions) has been shown to alter the nucleotide selectivity of human DNA polymerase β in vitro (63Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12762-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, factors such as competition between metals and interactions with metallothioneins should also be considered. However, we believe that our observations represent a important step in the understanding of the carcinogenic potential of cadmium. Moreover, these observations also provide a model system for determining how essential metals such as zinc or metal chelators may be used in preventive approaches to reduce cadmium carcinogenesis. The p53 protein is a tumor-suppressive transcription factor activated in response to multiple signals including radiation, genotoxic chemicals, hypoxia, depletion of ribonucleotides, and poisoning of the mitotic spindle. In most normal, nonexposed cells, p53 is a latent factor. Induction in response to stress involves nuclear accumulation (as a result of escape from mdm-2-mediated degradation and nuclear export) and conversion to an active form with high affinity for specific DNA sequences. Activation requires post-translational modifications at both the N and C terminus of the protein, including changes in phosphorylation, acetylation, and binding to heterologous proteins (1Liu L.

Activated p53 controls several sets of genes to prevent the proliferation of cells under stress conditions. Genes transactivated by p53 include inhibitors of cell cycle progression in G1 and G2 (p21waf-1 ,14-3-3ς, GADD 45), regulators of apoptosis (APO1-Fas/CD95, Bax-1, KILLER/DR5), and genes involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (such as PIG-3, PIG-6, and PIG-12) that may play a role in induction of apoptosis (6Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev."
https://openalex.org/W1990180927,"Abstract Metalloprotease disintegrins (a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) and metalloprotease, disintegrin,cysteine-rich proteins (MDC)) are a family of membrane-anchored glycoproteins that function in diverse biological processes, including fertilization, neurogenesis, myogenesis, and ectodomain processing of cytokines and other proteins. The cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs often include putative signaling motifs, such as proline-rich SH3 ligand domains, suggesting that interactions with cytoplasmic proteins may affect metalloprotease disintegrin function. Here we report that two SH3 domain-containing proteins, endophilin I (SH3GL2, SH3p4) and a novel SH3 domain- andphox homology (PX) domain-containing protein, termed SH3PX1, can interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the metalloprotease disintegrins MDC9 and MDC15. These interactions were initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen and then confirmed using bacterial fusion proteins and co-immunoprecipitations from eukaryotic cells expressing both binding partners. SH3PX1 and endophilin I both preferentially bind the precursor but not the processed form of MDC9 and MDC15 in COS-7 cells. Since rat endophilin I is thought to play a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and SH3PX1 has sequence similarity to sorting nexins in yeast, we propose that endophilin I and SH3PX1 may have a role in regulating the function of MDC9 and MDC15 by influencing their intracellular processing, transport, or final subcellular localization."

Crabtree J.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The epithelial cytokine/chemokine response may be particularly important in the early stages of H. pylori-induced inflammation, wherein the epithelium represents the crucial first barrier of defense against pathogen infection. Inflammatory mediators produced from infiltrated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear phagocytes could directly damage the surface epithelial layer leading to loss of microvilli, irregularity of the luminal border, and vacuolation (2Goodwin C.S.

The inflammatory response and gastric diseases are more common in patients infected with H. pylori strains carrying thecagA gene (cytotoxin-associated gene A). These strains also produce the toxin VacA (vacuolating toxin A), which is responsible for cytopathic effects (7Telford J.L. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli Tecce M.F.

Science. 1995; 267: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The analysis of the genomic region containing the cagA gene revealed a 40-kilobase DNA region that is present only in H. pylori strains inducing the production of the active form of the toxin and severe gastroduodenal diseases. The 40-kilobase region represents a pathogenicity island and codes for approximately 30 genes (9Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl.

Comparison of the genes encoded from the pathogenicity island with genes in other species suggests that the cag region encodes a specialized secretion system that exports or allows surface expression of proteins that interact with epithelial cells (10Covacci A. Rappuoli R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Knockouts of certaincag genes suppressed or reduced the production of IL-8 in epithelial cells (11Atherton J.C. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), affected activation of the immediate early response transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (12Glocker E. Lange C.

The inflammatory reaction requires de novo synthesis of defined proteins, which include chemokines attracting macrophages and inflammatory cytokines that serve to amplify and spread the primary pathogenic signal. The mechanism by which these proteins are newly synthesized involves an inducible transcriptional initiation of their respective genes. This is governed by several transcription factors playing a role in regulating immune response genes including the early response transcription factor AP-1 (14Karin M. Liu Z.G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the nature of the H. pylori-induced proinflammatory signals and the intracellular signals directing the activation of immediate early response transcription factors. Previous results showed that infection of epithelial cells with H. pylori induced the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (15Keates S. Hitti Y.S. Upton M. Kelly C.P.

In line with the known immunostimulatory function of NF-κB and AP-1 (18Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) epithelial cells infected with H. pylori produced increased amounts of numerous proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (11Atherton J.C. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The activation of the early response transcription factor AP-1 and the signaling pathways involved in the production of cytokines/chemokines in H. pylori-colonized gastric cells have not been studied so far. A common mechanism by which eucaryotic cells respond to extracellular signals involves the activation of AP-1 and a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) that consecutively activate their members by phosphorylation. MAPK cascades or modules are composed of a MAPK, a MAPK kinase, or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK), and a MAPK kinase kinase or MEK kinase (MAPK kinase kinase kinase or MEKK) (20Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Subfamiles of MAPKs, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) are activated by multiple environmental stresses and target the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2, which are components of AP-1 (14Karin M. Liu Z.G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun occur by c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) in N-terminally located transactivation domains and results in increased transcriptional activity (21Kallunki T. Su B.

Numerous MAPK kinase kinases in addition to MEKK1 have recently been identified and are all able to activate the JNK pathway (24Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F.

Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Similar to PAK, the MEK kinases 1 and 4 have also been shown to interact with Rac and Cdc42 (38Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Despite the potential for extensive cross-talk, it is generally observed that individual MAPKs are activated in response to distinct sets of environmental stimuli. Here we show that colonization of gastric cells by H. pyloriinduces the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor by a distinct SAPK cascade involving JNK, MKK4, PAK, and Rho-GTPases but not p38 kinase. Activation of AP-1 and NF-κB is substantially reduced in cells colonized by certain cag mutant strains. The identification of H. pylori-specific signaling pathways to inflammatory cytokine production casts a light on ways for drug intervention. Gastric epithelial cells (AGS) and HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 4 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were seeded in tissue culture plates for 48 h prior to infection. 16 h before infection, the medium was replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented either with 0.1% fetal calf serum (AGS cells) or 5% fetal calf serum (HeLa cells). H. pyloristrains were cultured for 48–72 h on agar plates containing 10% horse serum in a microaerophilic atmosphere (generated by Campy Gen, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) at 37 °C. For the infection the bacteria were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, diluted corresponding to the multiplicity of infection (MOI) as indicated and incubated together with the epithelial cell monolayer for different periods of time. Infection with H. pylori was routinely monitored by light microscopy. Stimulation of the cells with 100 nmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) was performed for the indicated periods of time. In the experiments using 10 ng/ml Toxin B (F. Hofmann and K. Aktories, Freiburg, Germany), the cells were preincubated for 15 min before the bacteria were added. Different H. pylori strains were used for colonization of human epithelial cell lines. The isogenicP12 strains, wild type,cagA*− (mutation of cagA with a probable polar effect), and vacA − (39Schmitt W. Haas R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and the isogenic G27 strains, wild type,cagF −, and cagI − (9Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar) have been described previously. For cultivation the bacteria were resuspended in brain heart infusion (Difco, Detroit, MI) medium, and 103 bacteria were seeded per plate. For stock culturesH. pylori was resuspended in brain heart infusion and additionally supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20% glycerol and maintained at −70 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared by using a nonionic detergent method as described previously (40Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for the detection of AP-1 activity in nuclear extracts was performed using oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 binding site: 5′-GATCTTCTAGACCGGATGAGTCATAGCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTATGACTCATCCGGTCTAGAAGATC-3′. The AP-1 DNA-binding oligonucleotide was labeled using T4 kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. DNA binding reactions were performed using a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 ng of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, and 10% glycerol. Supershift analysis was performed using c-Jun (sc-45) and ATF2 (sc-187) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) that were preincubated together with nuclear extracts before the32P-labeled oligonucleotide was added. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for the detection of NF-κB were performed with an Igκ oligo probe as described previously (41Naumann M. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB recognition site was labeled using the large fragment DNA polymerase (Klenow; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The DNA binding reactions were performed with 20 μl of binding buffer (2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.4, 60 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 30 °C. Supershift analysis was performed using anti-p50, anti-p65, and anti-c-Rel antibodies as described previously (40Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For competition experiments cold oligonucleotides were used. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel using 12.5 mm Tris, 12.5 mmboric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. The gels were dried and exposed to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech TM film at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. Quantitation of gel shift assays was performed by scanning the autoradiographs and densitometric analysis using the software program TINA (Raytest, Isotopen Messgeräte GmbH, München, Germany). The fold activity against the control is indicated below the gel shifts. IL-8 secretion was assayed from 100-μl supernatants of H. pylori-colonized AGS cells or HeLa cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen, Torreyana, CA). Transactivating activity of AP-1 was measured in AGS or HeLa cells at 50–70% confluence after cotransfection of the pSV-β-galactosidase construct (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany), 1 μg of a luciferase expression plasmid containing three repeats of the AP-1 binding site as an enhancer element and dominant negative expression constructs: DNPAK2(K278R), DNPAK1(K299R), or DNPAK1(H83L, H86L, K299R), DNMKK4 (K116R, DNJNKK), GFPDNRac1(T17N), and GFPDNCdc42(T17N) using cationic liposomes (DAC-30, Eurogentec, Sart Tilman, Belgium). 16 h after transfection cells were infected with H. pylori strains, treated with 100 nm PMA, preincubated with Toxin B, or left untreated. Luciferase assays were performed 3–4 h after treatment as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The results were recorded on a Wallac 409 β-counter (Berthold-Wallac, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The data represent the means ± S.D. calculated from more than three independent experiments as fold induction compared with the control. A portion of the cell lysates that was normalized for equivalent β-galactosidase activity was used for the luciferase assay. Activities varied <10% between transfection experiments. Immunoblots below the graphs indicate the expression of the dominant negative expression constructs DNMKK4, DNPAK1(Myc-tag), GFPDNRac1, and GFPDNCdc42 using the antibodies anti-MKK4 sc-837 (Santa Cruz), anti-Myc 14851A (Pharmingen), and anti-GFP sc-8334 (Santa Cruz), respectively. To analyze the kinase activity of JNK and p38, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 4 μm aprotinin. For PAK, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2,5% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 4 μm aprotinin. For immunoprecipitation RIPA buffer lysed cells were disrupted and incubated with anti-JNK1 (sc-474, Santa Cruz) antibody, and anti-αPAK (sc-881, Santa Cruz) antibody detecting PAK1 and partially PAK2 as described previously (42Naumann M. Rudel T. Wieland B. Bartsch C. Meyer T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were recovered and washed, and immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro kinase reactions using substrates (1 μg of GST-c-Jun (Santa Cruz) for JNK; 1 μg of GST-ATF2 (Santa Cruz) for p38; 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for PAK). The samples were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and dried, and substrate phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography (42Naumann M. Rudel T. Wieland B. Bartsch C. Meyer T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the in vitro kinase activity was performed by scanning the autoradiographs and densitometric analysis using the software program TINA. The fold activity against the control is indicated below the gels. Equal amounts of each sample were used for immunoblot analysis, as described previously (41Naumann M. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using anti-JNK or anti-PAK antibodies to indicate equivalent protein amounts in all lanes. H. pylori colonization of epithelial cells suggests the induction of intracellular signal transduction pathways that modulate cellular transcription factors. Therefore, we investigated whether H. pylori infection induces the transcription factor AP-1, which coordinately induces inflammatory cytokine/chemokine gene expression together with NF-κB. Subconfluent monolayers of AGS cells or HeLa cells were infected with different H. pylori strains. At different time points post-challenge, nuclear protein extracts were prepared and analyzed for the levels of cellular AP-1 DNA binding activity by using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the AP-1 DNA-binding site. As shown in Fig. 1 an enhanced binding of AP-1 was observed in AGS cells within 45 min post infection with the P12 and G27 wild type strains (Fig. 1,A, lanes 1–4, and B, lanes 1–4). The DNA binding activity induced to similar extents by bothH. pylori strains was further increased within 180 min (Fig.1, A, lanes 5 and 6, and B,lanes 5 and 6), indicating that members of the c-Jun/c-Fos family were activated. Whether c-Jun or ATF2 represent components that bind to the AP-1 binding site was analyzed in a supershift assay. Nuclear extracts from H. pylori-colonized AGS cells, preincubated with an anti-c-Jun antibody before addition of32P-labeled oligonucleotide, revealed a significantly reduced DNA binding activity of AP-1, whereas the anti-ATF2 antibody did not affect AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1 D,lanes 5–7). Further, the specificity of the AP-1 DNA-binding capability induced by H. pylori was determined using nonlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide for competition (Fig.1 D, lanes 1–4). H. pylori(G27)-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity was slightly weaker than AP-1 activation in response to PMA, which induces AP-1 within 30 min (Fig. 1, B, lanes 3–6 versus C, lanes 3–6). In contrast to wild type strains, AP-1 activity was reduced by isogenic H. pylori strains carrying mutations in certain cag genes localized in the pathogenicity island (Fig. 1, A, lanes 4–6 versus lanes 14–16, and B,lanes 4–6 versus lanes 9–11 or lanes 14–16). An isogenic mutant of wild type vacuolating cytotoxin-producingH. pylori (P12) strain carrying a knockout of thevacA gene does not affect AP-1 activation (Fig.1 A, lanes 4–6 versus lanes 9–11). The activation of AP-1 in wild type H. pylori-colonized gastric cells was inducible at a MOI of 100, whereas the isogeniccag mutant strains showed a strongly reduced AP-1 activity in the following order: cagA*−,cagF −, cagI −. This indicates highly specific H. pylori-induced signaling, and the critical role of cag gene expression in the downstream activation of AP-1. A similar activation of AP-1 was obtained with allH. pylori strains used in colonized HeLa cells (data not shown). Coordinate activation of proinflammatory cytokines involves the activity of the immediate early transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB. We observed enhanced binding of NF-κB using the Igκ binding site inH. pylori (P12 and G27)-colonized AGS cells within 45 min at a MOI of 50 (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast to wild type and vacA − strains, NF-κB activation was reduced by isogenic H. pylori strains carrying mutations in certain cag genes. PMA-treated cells exhibit strong NF-κB activation within 10 min (Fig. 2 C). The components that bind to the NF-κB binding site were analyzed in a supershift assay, which revealed a supershift and significantly reduced DNA binding activity of NF-κB using anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies, whereas the anti-c-Rel antibody did not affect NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 D, lanes 1–4). Similar activation of NF-κB was obtained in H. pylori-colonized HeLa cells (data not shown). The specificity of the DNA binding activity was examined by adding nonlabeled double-stranded Igκ oligonucleotide for competition (Fig. 2 D, lanes 4–6). Consistent with previous data (15Keates S. Hitti Y.S. Upton M. Kelly C.P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 17Sharma S.A. Tummuru M.K.R. Blaser M.J. Kerr L.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2401-2407PubMed Google Scholar) we observed activation of NF-κB in AGS cells colonized with H. pyloriwild type and weak NF-κB activation in cells colonized with the isogenic cag mutants. This indicates a highly specificH. pylori-induced signaling leading to downstream activation of NF-κB. Generally, the integrity of the cagpathogenicity island seems to be a prerequiste for an efficient activation of the immediate early response transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. To demonstrate that AP-1 and NF-κB activation actually lead to increased proinflammatory cytokine release, we analyzed the IL-8 release by AGS cells and HeLa cells in response to H. pyloriwild type and the isogenic cagA*− strain.H. pylori (P12) induces IL-8 release in both cell lines within 6 h, whereas IL-8 secretion was reduced by 50% in cells colonized with the cagA*− strain (data not shown). The reduced IL-8 release fromcagA*− infected AGS cells corroborates the observation that cag mutant strains (16Münzenmaier A. Lange C. Glocker E. Covacci A. Moran A. Bereswill S. Baeuerle P.A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6140-6147PubMed Google Scholar) induce weak activation of transcription factors. The dimeric sequence specific enhancer factor AP-1 becomes activated through phosphorylation of c-Jun by members of the stress activated MAPK (SAPK) family in response to environmental stress (14Karin M. Liu Z.G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the SAPK/JNK and/or p38 are involved in the signaling leading to H. pylori-induced AP-1 activation. Cellular extracts from H. pylori-colonized epithelial cells were used at different time points post infection for immunoprecipitation of the endogenous kinases, and in vitrokinase assays using appropriate substrates were performed. Wild type H. pylori strains at a MOI of 50 induce severalfold JNK1 activation (c-Jun substrate phosphorylation) in subconfluent monolayers of AGS cells (Fig.3) and HeLa cells (data not shown) within 30 min after infection (Fig. 3, A, lanes 1–3, and B, lanes 1–3). The immunoblots, probed with an anti-JNK1 antibody, in the lower panels of Fig. 3 is to demonstrate similar JNK protein amounts in all lanes. The immediate JNK1 induction was followed by a sustained JNK1 kinase activation for at least 90 min (Fig. 3, A, lanes 4 and5, and B, lanes 4 and 5). The activation of JNK1 in response to H. pylori was delayed compared with the JNK1 induction in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 3, compareA and B, lanes 1–5 with C,lanes 1–4) but showed a similar potential to induce JNK1 activity. To test whether cellular JNK1 activation is at variance in epithelial cells colonized with different H. pylori strains, we compared JNK1 kinase activity in AGS cells and HeLa cells colonized eithe"

Dimerization of synaptotagmin (Syt) I, a putative low affinity Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release, is thought to be important for expression of function during exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. However, little is known about the self-dimerization properties of other isoforms. In this study, we demonstrate that a subclass of synaptotagmins (III, V, VI, and X) (Ibata, K., Fukuda, M., and Mikoshiba, K. (1998) J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis of these cysteine residues and co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly indicate that the first cysteine residue is essential for the stable homodimer formation of Syt III, V, or VI, and heterodimer formation between Syts III, V, VI, and X. We also show that native Syt III from mouse brain forms a β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimer. Our results suggest that the cysteine-based heterodimerization between Syt III and Syt V, VI, or X, which have different biochemical properties, may modulate the proposed function of Syt III as a putative high affinity Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release.

Self-dimerization of Syt I occurs through a Ca2+-independent multimerization, which is probably mediated by a region just downstream of the transmembrane region (31Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or through a Ca2+-dependent dimerization mediated by the C2B domain (26Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J.

Although only the latter interaction has been well studied, the former one is also important for bridging the two molecules before Ca2+ ions enter through Ca2+ channels to achieve efficient Ca2+-dependent dimerization via the C2B domain within a very short period of synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<300 μs), the fusion of synaptic vesicle to presynaptic plasma membrane. However, it remains undetermined whether other isoforms (Syts III–XI and Srg1) also show Ca2+-independent interactions and whether they are important for the function of Syts III–XI and Srg1. In this study, we cloned cDNAs covering the full coding region of mouse Syts I–XI and examined their Ca2+-independent dimerization properties by expressing T7-tagged Syts I–XI in COS-7 cells. We identified a novel conserved cysteine motif in the N-terminal domain present only in the previously described subclass of synaptotagmins (Syts III, V, VI, and X), which is characterized by a lack of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate binding activity (32Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This cysteine motif was shown to be essential for the stable homo- and heterodimer formation through disulfide bonds of Syts III, V, VI, and X by site-directed mutagenesis. On the basis of these results, we discuss the role of cysteine-based heterodimerization properties of Syts III, V, VI, and X. ExTaq and AmpliTaq DNA polymerases were obtained from Takara Biomedicals and Perkin-Elmer, respectively. All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. Solutions were made in deionized water. cDNAs encoding the open reading frame of synaptotagmin isoforms (Syts IV, VI, VII, IX, and XI) were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from mouse cerebellum cDNAs (10Fukuda M.

The PCR products, purified from an agarose gel by a MicroSpin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by 1-butanol extraction and ethanol precipitation, were directly inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Both strands were completely sequenced by the ThermoSequenase premixed cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Hitachi SQ-5500 DNA sequencer. Since the previously reported amino acid sequences of Syts V, VIII, and X were partial (16Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C.

First 5′- or 3′-RACE reactions were carried out using the adapter primer 1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and one of the following primers designed on the basis of rat or mouse sequences (16Li C.

Second RACE reactions were also carried out using the internal adapter primer 2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) and one of the following primers: Syt V, 5′-AGCAGGCTCACAGAGATA-3′ (antisense, amino acids 49–55); Syt VIII, 5′-AGTCCACATCTGGTTGA-3′ (antisense, amino acids 97–103); or the same Syt X primer used in the first reaction. Both PCRs were carried out for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The first and second PCR products were purified from an agarose gel by a MicroSpin column and were directly inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Both strands of the cDNA inserts were randomly sequenced as described above until a cDNA clone including the putative initiation methionine or stop codon was obtained (data not shown). cDNAs encoding the C termini of Syts V and VIII or the N terminus of Syt X were also amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse cerebellum cDNAs using the following sets of primers designed on the basis of rat or mouse sequences (16Li C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2638-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar): Syt V, 5′-CGGGATCCGGGAGGAGAAGTAACAGCAA-3′ (sense; amino acids 213–219) and 5′-GGAATTCTCATCGTTTCTCCAGCAGAG-3′ (antisense; amino acids 486–491); Syt VIII, 5′-CGGATCCGGGGACCAACAGTGGGGTCGA-3′ (sense; amino acids 110–116) and 5′-GGAATTCTCAGGAGCGAGGCCTAAGCA-3′ (antisense; amino acid resides 390–395); and Syt X, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAGTTTCCGCAAGGAGGACG-3′ (sense; amino acids 1–8) and 5′-GGAATTCCATCTCGTTCCAATGGTCTC-3′ (antisense; amino acids 478–484). The putative initiation codon of the mouse Syt V cDNA (GGGCGATG) closely corresponded to the Kozak sequence (CC(A/G)CCATG(G)) (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Although we could not obtain the in-frame stop codon preceding the putative initiation codon, the first methionine presented in Fig. 3 is most likely to be the initiation methionine because this position matches well those of Syts III, VI, and X, the same subclass of synaptotagmins. Sequence analysis of the 5′-RACE products of Syt VIII showed that there are two forms of cDNA. The major, longer form contains a putative retained intron just upstream of the transmembrane region (data not shown) because it was identical to the genome sequence previously reported (16Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and did not contain any apparent open reading frame. In the second, shorter form, there are three methionine residues just after the 5′-in-frame stop codon, each of which did not correspond well to the Kozak sequence (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). However, expression of Syt VIII proteins from 1, 100, or 118 to 1291 base pairs in COS-7 cells and comparison of their size indicated that the first methionine presented in Fig. 3 is the initiation methionine (data not shown). When compared with previously described rat or mouse sequences, amino acid substitutions were found in mouse Syt IV (Q70K, T85A, and G220D), Syt VI (Q38R, P44S, F77L, N90K, I105T, E222D, S471N, C496S, and A498V), Syt VII (P100T and I218V), Syt IX (P8L, E14K, L36V, P94R, L104S, E133Q, and T347A), Syt X (V93L, T95V, D164E, M191V, V196I, S263F, and M362I), and Syt XI (E74K, S85P, H86R, V96I, R107K, I118M, G188D, I357V, and V421I). These changes are probably not due to PCR-induced errors because they were all found in two independent PCR products of each synaptotagmin. Since we cloned the cDNAs of mouse synaptotagmin isoforms (Syts V–VII and IX-XI) by PCR using primers derived from rat sequences, about 20 nucleotide sequences (5 or 6 amino acids) at the N or C terminus reported in this paper originated from rat sequences. Mouse cDNA clones of Syts I–III were as described previously (10Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Full-length synaptotagmin isoforms (Syts V–VIII and X) were constructed using the appropriate restriction enzyme sites on the pGEM-T Easy vector. Addition of the FLAG tag to the N terminus of each synaptotagmin isoform was done by PCR with primers encoding the FLAG tag sequence (in italics below) following the Kozak sequence (underlined below). In the case of FLAG-tagged Syt IX, for example, the FLAG-Syt IX cDNA fragment was amplified by primer FLAG-Syt IX (5′-CCACCATGG ACTACAAGGACGATGACGACAAGGGATCCATGTTCCCGGAACCC-3′) and the SP6 primer using pGEM-T-Syt IX as a template. Purified PCR products were inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector and verified by DNA sequencing as described above. The full-length synaptotagmin inserts with FLAG tags were then excised from the pGEM-T Easy vector byNotI digestion and subcloned into the NotI site of pEF-BOS (10Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5332Crossref Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) (pEF-FLAG-Syts I–XI). Construction of pEF-T7-Syts I–XI was also performed by the same procedures using a primer with a T7 tag sequence (in italics; 5′-CCACCATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATGGGTCGCGGATCC-3′) in the 5′-flanking region. FLAG-tagged Syt III mutants (C10A, C21A, C33A, C10A/C21A, C10A/C33A, C21A/C33A, and C10A/C21A/C33A) were essentially produced by two-step PCR techniques as described previously (13Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using the following pairs of oligonucleotides: primer A (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCTGGGGACTACGAAGATG-3′) or mutagenic primer B carrying the C10A mutation (5′-CGGATCCATGTCTGGGGACTACGAAGATGACCTCGCTCGG-3′) and mutagenic primer C carrying the C21A mutation (5′-CGAATTCTTGACACCTATCATTGGTATCAGCATCTCGGACCCGTGCAGCGA-3′) or mutagenic primer D carrying the C33A mutation (5′-CGAATTCTTGAGCCCTATCA-3′) (left half); and primer E (5′-CGAATTCAACGAACTGCGGA-3′) and primer F (5′-CGAATTCTCCAGGATGTCCCTCCAGA-3′) (right half)). The right and left halves of the N terminus of Syt III were separately amplified; and the two resulting PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI (underlined above), ligated to each other, and reamplified by primers A (or B) and F. The PCR fragment obtained encoding the mutant N-terminal domain of Syt III was digested with BamHI, substituted for the BamHI insert of wild-type pGEM-T-FLAG-Syt III, and verified by DNA sequencing. Other plasmids encoding mutant Syts V (C9A), VI (C12A), and X (C13A) were similarly constructed by PCR using mutagenic primers. Five micrograms of pEF-T7-Syt (or pEF-BOS as a control) and pEF-FLAG-Syt were cotransfected into COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) by the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and homogenized in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A. After solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h, the supernatants (400 μl) were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. After incubation with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose (wet volume 10 μl; Novagen) at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting as described below. Balb/c mice were immunized with 50 μg of the purified Syt III C2A domain fused to glutathione S-transferase (13Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) by intraperitoneal injection with the RIBI adjuvant at intervals of 21 days. Antisera were collected after the fourth booster injection. After preabsorption by the glutathione S-transferase-Syt VI C2A domain fusion protein to remove the cross-reactive component, anti-Syt III IgG was affinity-purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity of the anti-Syt III antibody was checked by probing extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with individual synaptotagmins (Syts I–XI) (data not shown). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting. Blots were blocked with 1% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibody. After the primary antibody incubation, the membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (M2) against the FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMG) antibody and monoclonal antibody against Syt I (SYA148) were from Novagen and Stressgen Biotech Corp., respectively. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the mouse synaptotagmin family were performed using the PILEUP program of the GCG software package (Version 8.1) using default parameters (window size = 12 and gap length weight = 4). To understand the phylogenetic relationship between synaptotagmin family proteins, we cloned the mouse synaptotagmin I–XI cDNAs by PCR on the basis of previously described rat sequences. Since only the partial amino acid sequences of Syts V, VIII, and X have been reported, we first determined the nucleotide sequences of the N termini of Syts V and VIII or the C terminus of Syt X using the 5′- or 3′-RACE reaction, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The predicted amino acid sequences of mouse Syts V, VIII, and X showed that these synaptotagmins consist of 491, 398, and 523 amino acids, respectively (data not shown). Although the sequence similarities among the synaptotagmin family proteins were quite low especially at the N-terminal domain, Syts V and X were highly homologous to Syts III and VI throughout the entire protein, including the N terminus, transmembrane region, C2 domains, and C terminus. Syt V had 43.4, 55.5, and 55.1% identities to Syts III, VI, and X, respectively; and Syt X had 44.7, 55.1, and 60% identities to Syts III, V, and VI at the amino acid level, respectively, indicating that these synaptotagmins constitute a subfamily. This finding was make clearer when a phylogenetic tree of mouse synaptotagmin was constructed (Fig.1). According to this phylogenetic tree, the synaptotagmin family can be classified into at least four distinct groups: Syts IV and IX; Syts III, V, VI, and X; Syts I, II, and IX; and others (Syt VII or VIII). To examine whether the SDS-resistant homodimerization properties observed in Syt I or II on SDS-PAGE (10Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Except for Syts IV, IX, and XI, we could easily detect the minor immunoreactive bands corresponding to the dimer positions predicted from the cDNA sequences in addition to the major monomer bands (Fig. 2 A). The dimer band of Syt III was difficult to see on 10% polyacrylamide gel, but could be detected on 7.5% gel (data not shown). Surprisingly, in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, the majority of the Syt III, V, VI, and X immunoreactive bands were shifted to dimer positions (Fig.2 B, lanes 3, 5, 6, and10), whereas β-mercaptoethanol had almost no effect on other isoforms' dimerization properties. This result indicates that certain cysteine residues are involved in the homodimerization of Syt III, V, VI, or X through a disulfide bond. Sequence alignment of Syts III, V, VI, and X revealed seven conserved cysteine residues among these isoforms: three cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain, one cysteine residue within the transmembrane region, one cysteine residue just downstream of the transmembrane region, and two cysteine residues within the C2 domains (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Among these cysteine residues, we initially focused on the N-terminal cysteine residues that probably reside in the intravesicular region (4Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) because there are no cysteine residues in the N-terminal domains of the other isoforms (Fig. 3, asterisks), and some of the cysteine residues around the transmembrane region are thought to be palmitoylated (36Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 37Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and are therefore unlikely to participate in disulfide bond formation. Two cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are also unlikely to be involved in disulfide bond formation because the cytoplasmic domain of Syts III and VI did not show β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive dimers (data not shown). Furthermore, these N-terminal cysteine residues are also conserved in electric ray synaptotagmin (p65-c), a homologue of mouse Syts III, V, VI, and X, suggesting that these are at least retained in vertebrate evolution (38Wendland B. Miller K.G. Schilling J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 993-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To identify the cysteine residues responsible for homodimerization of Syt III, N-terminal cysteine residues (at positions 10, 21, and 33) were replaced individually or in combination with alanine residues (Fig.4 A). The C10A single, C10A/C21A double, and C10A/C21A/C33A triple substitutions abolished the β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimerization, whereas the C21A and C33A single and C21A/C33A and C10A/C33A double mutations had almost no effect (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates that the first cysteine at position 10 is essential for the intermolecular disulfide bridge to form a stable homodimer of Syt III, but that the C10A/C33A mutant was artificially modified probably at Cys-21 due to the replacement of the first and third cysteines with alanines. Since the cysteine at position 10 of Syt III is also conserved in Syts V, VI, and X, as described above, it will be interesting to see whether the corresponding cysteine residues are involved in heterodimerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X. To further explore the processes of heterodimerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X, we introduced two different tags, the T7 and FLAG tags, into the N terminus of each synaptotagmin and evaluated their association by immunoprecipitation (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Briefly, T7- and FLAG-tagged synaptotagmins were coexpressed in COS-7 cells, and T7-tagged synaptotagmins were immunoprecipitated by anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose. Then, the coprecipitated FLAG-tagged synaptotagmins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A(lanes 6–10), FLAG-Syt III was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with T7-Syts V, VI, and X as well as T7-Syt III. In contrast, when FLAG-Syt III and T7-Syt III, V, VI, or X were separately expressed in COS-7 cells and mixed 1 h before immunoprecipitation, we could not detect the association of FLAG-Syt III with any of the T7-tagged synaptotagmins (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–5). These results indicate that the cysteine-based homo- and heterodimerization only occurred in the living cells. In the next set of experiments, we examined the possible involvement of cysteine residues in the heterodimerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X using mutant FLAG-Syt III carrying cysteine-to-alanine mutations. Substitution of the first cysteine residue (C10A, C10A/C21A, C10A/C33A, or C10A/C21A/C33A) almost completely abolished the stable dimerization with Syt III, V, VI, or X (Fig. 5 A (lanes 11–15) and data not shown), indicating that the disulfide bond mediated by the cysteine at position 10 of Syt III is crucial for the stable homo- and heterodimerization of Syt III and Syt V, VI, or X. Since a small amount of Syts V and X still associated with Syt III C10A (Fig. 5 A,lanes 12 and 14), the second and third cysteine residues may also partly contribute to the heterodimerization. To further determine whether the N-terminal cysteine motif (especially the first cysteine residue) of Syt V, VI, or X is also responsible for homo- and heterodimerization, we produced mutant Syts V (C9A), VI (C12A), and X (C13A) by site-directed mutagenesis. Except for the homodimerization of Syt X, these mutants did not essentially interact with wild-type Syt III, V, VI, or X, indicating that the first cysteine residue of Syts III, V, VI, and X is the site of the major intermolecular disulfide bond, but that the second and third cysteine residues of Syt X also partly participate in intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Finally, we examined the β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimerization of native Syt III to rule out the possibility that the cysteine-based dimerization of Syt III observed in COS-7 cells is an artifact due to the ectopic or overexpression of Syt III. Using a specific antibody against Syt I or III, we confirmed that native Syt III from mouse adult brain also forms a β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimer, whereas Syt I does not show such dimerization properties (Fig.6). In a previous study, we identified a subclass of synaptotagmins (Syts III, V, VI, and X) based on the inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate binding properties of the C2B domain (32Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first found that this class of synaptotagmins form β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homo- and heterodimers through the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal cysteine residues (at amino acids 10, 21, and 33 of Syt III), whereas the homodimerization of other isoforms is independent of the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (Figs.2 B and 6). The disulfide bond-based dimerization properties of Syts III, V, VI and X are apparently different from the multimerization of Syt I, which is probably mediated by the predicted amphipathic α-helix region just downstream of the transmembrane region (31Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree of synaptotagmins I–XI also demonstrated that Syts III, V, VI, and X form a small branch (Fig. 1). In addition, genomic sequences around the C2A domains of Syts I–III and VIII indicate that the genomic organization of Syt III (positions of exon-intron boundaries) is different from that of Syts I, II, and VIII (16Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 39Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). 2M. Fukuda, unpublished observations. These results also support the idea that Syts III, V, VI, and X form a distinct class of synaptotagmins. Systematic substitutions of these cysteine residues with alanines in Syt III indicated that the first cysteine residue is crucial for homodimerization and is also important for heterodimerization with Syt V, VI, or X. The second and third cysteine residues may also be involved in heterodimerization with Syt V or X. Therefore, Syts III, V, VI, and X can form hetero-oligomers of various combinations through these cysteine residues by disulfide bonds. These disulfide bonds facilitate easy dimerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X within the cell (Fig. 5), but probably restrict the stable heterodimer with other isoforms. What is the function of cysteine-based dimerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X in brain? In the accompanying paper (44Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we show that one alternatively spliced variant of Syt VI (named Syt VIΔTM) that lacks the conserved N-terminal domain did not interact with full-length Syt VI even when both proteins were coexpressed in COS-7 cells. Therefore, the main function of the cysteine-based dimerization is to tether the two molecules by the N terminus in the resting state and to allow them to efficiently bind each other at the C2B domain (26Sugita S.

The second function of the cysteine-based dimerization is to produce a variety of sets of synaptotagmins of different biochemical natures, which may confer more diverse functions from a limited number of synaptotagmin isoforms. In previous reports, the C2 domains of Syts III, V, VI, and X were shown to have some distinct biochemical properties, including Ca2+-dependent phospholipid or syntaxin binding (16Li C. Ullrich B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Among Syts III, V, VI, and X, Syt III is suggested to function as a high affinity Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release because it has a relatively higher affinity for Sr2+ (41Li C. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since all these synaptotagmins are expressed in brain (Syts III, V, and X are neuronal types, and Syt VI is ubiquitous) (11Mizuta M. Inagaki N. Nemoto Y. Matsukura S. Takahashi M. Seino S. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 2638-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), these isoforms may hetero-oligomerize via disulfide bonding, and Syts V, VI, and X may modulate the Ca2+-sensing function of Syt III. In addition, the expression of Syt X mRNA in adult brain is known to be regulated by depolarization (17Babity J.M. Armstrong J.N. Plumier J.C. Currie R.W. Robertson H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2638-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible that the heterodimer between Syts III and X occurs only after some kind of synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, we first identified, by sequence comparison and mutational analysis, the evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues responsible for intermolecular disulfide bonding at the N terminus of Syts III, V, VI, and X. Our findings suggest that hetero-oligomerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X may produce a variety of Ca2+ sensors that function in neurotransmitter release with different biochemical natures.

The receptor contains four putative ligand-binding domains, generally referred to as clusters I, II, III, and IV. In this study, soluble recombinant receptor fragments, representing each of the four individual clusters, were used to map the binding sites of a set of structurally and functionally distinct ligands. Using surface plasmon resonance, we studied the binding of these fragments to methylamine-activated α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, pro-urokinase-type plasminogen activator, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, t-PA·plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complexes, lipoprotein lipase, apolipoprotein E, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, lactoferrin, the light chain of blood coagulation factor VIII, and the intracellular chaperone receptor-associated protein (RAP). No binding of the cluster I fragment to any of the tested ligands was observed. The cluster III fragment only bound to the anti-LRP monoclonal antibody α<sub>2</sub>MRα3 and weakly to RAP. Except for t-PA, we found that each of the ligands tested binds both to cluster II and to cluster IV. The affinity rate constants of ligand binding to clusters II and IV and to LRP were measured, showing that clusters II and IV display only minor differences in ligand-binding kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subdomains C3–C7 of cluster II are essential for binding of ligands and that this segment partially overlaps with a RAP-binding site on cluster II. Finally, we show that one RAP molecule can bind to different clusters simultaneously, supporting a model in which RAP binding to LRP induces a conformational change in the receptor that is incompatible with ligand binding."

A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with sufficient CTD kinase I to cause a complete shift of βGalyCTD to the hyperphosphorylated form as observed on a stained gel. A duplicate blank reaction was done without kinase, and both reactions were desalted into PBS using Quick Spin Protein Columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The AminoLink Plus Immobilization kit (Pierce) was used to make 250 μl each of phospho-CTD and CTD matrix (pH 10 coupling protocol). The yeast strain, DY6, (a leu2 trp1 ura3–52 prb1–1122 pep4–3 prc1–407) was grown at 30 °C in minimal medium to an A 600 of 1 to 2. Cells were collected and disrupted by glass beads using a protocol (39Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1994; (et al., Section 13.13.4, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar) modified for a mini bead beater and substituting a protease inhibitor mix from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (catalog 1206 8934). The only other modification was the direct recovery of the extract from the disruption tube by centrifugation (15,000 RCF for 1 min) followed by pipette removal of as much supernatant from the beads as was possible. Prior to affinity chromatography, extracts were thawed and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 RCF for 30 s. The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 3 mm PMSF) and reclarified by centrifugation. Equal amounts of on-put (2.5 ml) were loaded onto paired 250-μl columns containing identical amounts of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated βGalyCTD. Each column was washed five times with 400-μl column equilibration buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm PMSF) and eluted with sequential steps consisting of 1 column volume of 110, 125, 140, 160, 190, 220, 250, 300, 350, 425, 500, 600, 700, 850, 1000, 1000, and 1000 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, with 1 mm PMSF. Initial gel analysis using silver staining revealed a 21-kDa protein eluting specifically from the phospho-CTD column at 1 m NaCl. The corresponding high salt fractions from both columns were brought to 0.1% SDS, concentrated, and desalted with Microcon 10 units (Amicon) and separated on a 4–15% SDS precast gel (Bio-Rad). Following a protocol from HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University, the gel containing the 21-kDa band was briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, after which the 21-kDa band was excised and destained for 3 h in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol. The band was frozen and sent to the biotechnology facility at Yale for in-gel trypsinization and MALDI-MS analysis. Fusion proteins were expressed using plasmids created by ligating ESS1 polymerase chain reaction fragments into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the polylinker of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers CGGGATCCATGATCATTGTGGTACTTATTCC and GGAATTCCTAACCTACCGCTTGATCAC were used to amplify the 190-amino acid version of Ess1 (GenBankTM 1015652) from genomic yeast DNA. The construct sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction fragments for the fusion protein containing the WW domain (GSTEss1WW) and isomerase domain (GSTEss1ISO) were amplified from pGEX2TK-GSTEss1 using the primers CGGGATCCATGATCATTGTGGTACTTATTCC/GGAATTCCTAGTTGGTGCCCTCAGGCTC (WW) and CGGGATCCGACCATCCAGTGCGTGTAAGATGC/GGAATTCCTAACCTACCGCTTGATCAC (ISO) inserted into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced. Protein expression and glutathione purification were according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, XY-058-00-01) with minor modification. BL21 cells containing the expression plasmids were grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and the fusion proteins were purified by batch adsorption. Complete elution of GSTEss1 or GSTEss1WW required an overnight incubation with modified elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm glutathione, and 100 mm NaCl brought to pH 8.5–9 with NaOH). The fusion proteins were desalted into PBS using Quick Spin Protein Columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and quantitated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with IgG as a standard. The AminoLink Plus Immobilization kit (Pierce) was used to make both the GSTEss1 (∼2 mg/ml of matrix) and control beads (neutral coupling conditions). For the binding assay, GSTyCTD was phosphorylated essentially as described (32Morris D.P. Lee J.M. Sterner D.E. Brickey W.J. Greenleaf A.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using 10 μm GSTyCTD and approximately 150 nm CTD kinase I. The reaction was desalted into PBS using Quick Spin Protein Columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 80 μl of this solution was added to 20 μl of control beads or GSTEss1 beads in PBS. Mixes were incubated at room temperature with inversion until the times indicated when both samples were spun (500 RCF for 10 s) to pellet the beads and an aliquot of the supernatants removed to 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and heated. Beads were then resuspended and the incubation continued until the next time point. Samples (10 μl) were run on a 4–15% SDS precast gel (Bio-Rad). Duplicate 4–15% SDS precast gels (Bio-Rad) of the fusion proteins were run for staining and electroblotting to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was incubated in blocking/renaturation buffer (BRB = PBS + 0.2% Tween + 3% dry milk + 10 mm NaF + PMSF + 2 mm DTT) overnight with rocking (this and subsequent steps at 4 °C). The blot was probed with fully shifted phospho-βGalyCTD (∼400,000 cpm) in 10 ml of BRB without DTT for 3 h and then rinsed 5 × 12 min with PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-Tw), dried, and analyzed by PhosphorImager. An extract of frozen yeast representing 20 ml of culture (grown toA 600 = 1.2) was prepared according to method 2 of Ref. 33Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar to minimize phosphatase and protease activity; final volume = 400 μl in SDS sample buffer. Aliquots of extract (1 and 5 μl) were run with prestained standards in five repeated sample sets on a 4–15% SDS precast gel (Bio-Rad) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose (NC); all standards were completely transferred out of gel. The NC was incubated in BRB overnight with rocking (this and subsequent steps at 4 °C) and then cut into strips each containing one sample set. For the far-Western analysis, strips were incubated separately with 6 nm fusion protein probe in BRB without DTT for 1 h. After rinsing 5 × 12 min with PBS-Tw, they were reacted together with affinity-purified rabbit anti-GST IgG. 2A. L. Greenleaf, unpublished data. After rinsing 5 × 12 min with PBS-Tw, the strips were incubated with 2° antibody (affinity-purified, alkaline phosphatase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch)) in BRB without DTT for 1 h, then rinsed 5 × 12 min with PBS-Tw and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. The strips were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase color reagent substrates (Bio-Rad, 170-6432) at room temperature. For the Western, one strip was reacted with affinity-purified rabbit anti-yeast phospho-CTD IgG (prepared essentially as in Ref. 33Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h, then washed 5 × 12 min with PBS-Tw prior to addition of the 2° antibody and treatment as for the far-Western analyses. Yeast CTD kinase I can quantitatively convert fusion protein substrates containing the CTD to a hyperphosphorylated form, with the accompanying characteristic decrease in electrophoretic mobility (31Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that bind specifically to the hyperphosphorylated CTD, βGalyCTD was hyperphosphorylated and cross-linked to agarose beads. Total yeast extracts were loaded in parallel onto this and an identical column prepared with unphosphorylated βGalyCTD and eluted using a step gradient of NaCl. While many proteins eluted from both columns, a protein of about 21 kDa appeared to elute only from the phospho-CTD column at 1 m NaCl (Fig.1 A). This protein band was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsinization followed by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis of the tryptic fragments (Fig. 1 B). Data base searches using the masses of the fragments gave an unambiguous identification of the protein as Ess1. To confirm the ability of Ess1 to bind the phosphorylated CTD, a GSTEss1 fusion protein was purified and linked to agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 2, GSTEss1 beads were able to specifically deplete hyperphosphorylated GST-yCTD fusion protein from a solution containing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GSTyCTD. In addition to the unphosphorylated fusion protein, some forms of phosphorylated GSTyCTD were not effectively adsorbed, including a partially shifted intermediate clearly visible in Fig. 2. Extending the incubation an additional 30 min did not result in significant depletion of the remaining unbound material (data not shown). This may suggest that not all phosphorylations create a recognition site for Ess1. The hyperphosphorylated CTD produced by CTD kinase I can also be used as an effective radiolabeled probe to identify phospho-CTD-binding proteins in blots of cellular extracts. Preliminary far-Western analysis of proteolyzed Ess1 suggested the WW domain could bind the phospho-CTD. 3D. P. Morris, unpublished observation. To test this hypothesis we created expression constructs for GST fusion proteins containing only the WW (GSTEss1WW) or isomerase (GSTEss1ISO) domains. Far-Western analysis of the fusion proteins (Fig.3) shows similar association of the hyperphosphorylated CTD probe with GSTEss1 (lanes 1–3) and GSTEss1WW (lanes 4–6) but no association with GSTEss1ISO (lanes 7–9). Clearly, under these conditions the phosphorylated CTD appears to associate only with fusion proteins including the WW domain. As a control to demonstrate specificity, totalEscherichia coli proteins were run in lane 10 of Fig. 3. There should be no natural phospho-CTD-binding proteins inE. coli, and indeed far-Western analysis reveals no phospho-CTD-binding proteins. To demonstrate that in vivo hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II from yeast can associate with Ess1 and to determine whether the WW domain could mediate this interaction, we analyzed total cellular extracts of asynchronously grown yeast by far-Western using the fusion proteins as probes (Fig. 4). In these experiments a protein of >200 kDa was the dominant interacting species, bound equivalently by GSTEss1 (lanes 5and 6) and GSTEss1WW (lanes 8 and 9). This protein is almost certainly the hyperphosphorylated form of the largest subunit of RNA Pol II (subunit IIo), as it has an identical electrophoretic mobility to IIo detected using affinity-purified anti-phospho-CTD polyclonal antibodies (lanes 11 and12). Note that neither the control lanes probed with GST (lanes 2 and 3) nor the lanes probed with GSTEss1ISO (lanes 14 and 15) gave any detectable signal. Our results effectively demonstrate that the phosphorylated CTD binds directly to Ess1 and that it is the WW domain that mediates this binding. Although a direct association between the phospho-CTD and the human Pin1 has not been demonstrated, Albertet al., have recently shown that beads containing Pin1 can precipitate a fraction of the hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol II from HeLa cell extracts (34Albert A. Lavoie S. Vincent M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2493-2500PubMed Google Scholar). Given our results with Ess1, this finding strongly suggests that Pin1 also interacts directly with the phosphorylated CTD. Also recently, it has been shown that the WW and not the isomerase domain of Pin1 is responsible for Pin1 binding to proteins containing mitosis-specific phospho-epitopes (29Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Further, the WW domain of Ess1 was also able to bind most of these mammalian proteins. At present, the connection between Ess1/Pin1 association with the phospho-CTD and with mitotic regulatory proteins remains to be determined. It has been demonstrated that isomerase activity of both Pin1 (27Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and Ess1 (21Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) has a strong preference for proline bonds in which the proline is preceded by an acidic residue (Glu, phospho-Ser, and phospho-Thr). These functional similarities, the conservation of amino acid sequence and domain organization, and the ability of Pin1 to substitute for Ess1 in yeast all indicate a very high level of functional conservation between these two proteins. Beyond the preference of the isomerase domain for an acidic residue prior to proline, the specificity requirements for the domains of Ess1/Pin1 are not well understood. The initial report examining the specificity of Pin1 found that its ability to bind peptides could be used as a basis for designing efficient isomerase substrates (26Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This seemed to suggest the peptide binding site and prolyl isomerase site were the same; however, our study and the study mentioned above (29Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) strongly suggest it was the specificity of the WW domain that was responsible for peptide binding. Relevant to our work, a sequence found to be a preferred binding site, YpSP, represents a sequence potentially present in the phosphorylated CTD repeats. Peptide substrates with this sequence were also the best isomerase substrates. While the binding sites of the WW and isomerase domains are clearly distinct, they may still have similar recognition determinants. WW domain associations with Pol II are not limited to the phosphorylated CTD. It has been shown that several WW domains, including one found in the mouse ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4, one found in human YAP (35Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24105-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and at least one found in yeast Rsp5 (36Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), can associate with the unphosphorylated CTD. In agreement with our results, it has also been shown that the WW domain of Ess1 fails to interact with the unphosphorylated CTD (35Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24105-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two studies have looked at the sequence requirements for peptide binding to the WW domain of human YAP, and both identified a sequence present in the CTD, PxY, as the most important for the binding site motif (37Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The earlier and more thorough study found the position prior to proline was best occupied by another proline but was tolerant of Leu, Ser, Val, or Ala (37Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sequence SPxY is present in the CTD sequence, probably explaining the ability of human YAP to bind the unphosphorylated CTD. Previous work has revealed a direct physical connection between 3′-end processing and the CTD. Mammalian cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) can be eluted from either a phosphorylated or an unphosphorylated CTD column, and the CstF p50 and p77 components have been shown to bind directly to the unphosphorylated CTD (19McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Recently, both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated CTD have been found to be potent stimulators of the 3′ cleavage reaction (20Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A functional link between Ess1 and 3′-end processing was established by the isolation of mutations causing a 3′-end formation defect which mapped to the isomerase domain of Ess1 (21Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that Ess1 stably associates with the phosphorylated CTD immediately suggests a mechanistic explanation for these observations: phospho-CTD binding by the WW domain localizes Ess1 to elongating Pol II, where it is positioned to isomerize pSP bonds present in the phospho-CTD. In addition, the separation of the binding and isomerase activities of Ess1 into independent domains creates the potential for processive isomerase function. Changes in CTD structure resulting from the activity of Ess1 would be expected to affect 3′-end formation by altering interactions between the CTD and cleavage/polyadenylation components. Involvement of CTD kinase I in this process is consistent with the finding that a suppressor of CTDK-I deficiency-caused cold sensitivity contains several regions homologous to components of the 3′-end processing machinery in yeast and mammals. 4D. Skaar and A. L. Greenleaf, manuscript in preparation. The possibility that Ess1 reconfigures the phosphorylated CTD though processive isomerization of its proline residues certainly adds an unexpected twist to the investigation of eukaryotic pre-mRNA transcription and 3′-end formation."

In both mammals and yeast, a non-sterol isoprenoid signal positively regulates the rate of HMGR degradation. To define more precisely the molecule that serves as the source of this signal, we have conducted both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the mevalonate pathway in yeast. We now demonstrate that farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is the source of the positive signal for Hmg2p degradation in yeast. This FPP-derived signal does not act by altering the endoplasmic reticulum degradation machinery in general. Rather, the FPP-derived signal specifically modulates Hmg2p stability. In mammalian cells, an FPP-derived molecule also serves as a positive signal for HMGR degradation.

The mevalonate pathway is modulated in large part by feedback control of the amount of HMGR protein (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar), and a significant portion of HMGR feedback control occurs through regulation of HMGR degradation (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L.

When there is abundant synthesis of pathway products, HMGR degradation is fast, and steady-state levels of the protein tend to be low. Conversely, when synthesis of pathway products is reduced, for instance when a patient is given the HMGR inhibitor lovastatin, HMGR degradation is slowed, and steady-state levels of the protein tend to increase. However, neither the identity of the mevalonate-derived signal nor the mechanism by which this signal is coupled to HMGR degradation is known.In order to discover and understand the mechanisms of HMGR-regulated degradation, we have been studying the process in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol.

Our earlier work has shown that the yeast HMGR isozyme Hmg2p is degraded in a regulated manner with many similarities to the analogous process in mammals. Through the use of genetic selections and screens, we have been able to identify genes required for the degradation of Hmg2p, calledHRD genes (11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and genes required for normal regulation of Hmg2p degradation. 2S. Cronin and R. Hampton, manuscript in preparation.2S. Cronin and R. Hampton, manuscript in preparation.Concurrently with these screens, we have been studying the nature of the mevalonate-derived signals that control Hmg2p stability. Hmg2p degradation is regulated by an unknown signal from the mevalonate pathway (Fig. 1 a). Inhibiting early pathway enzymes, such as HMGR itself or HMG-CoA synthase, decreases the rate of Hmg2p degradation (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These early pathway blocks decrease the availability of a downstream signal for degradation. Conversely, inhibiting the enzyme squalene synthase, which is downstream of HMGR, stimulates degradation and ubiquitination of Hmg2p (12Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the degradation-enhancing effect of squalene synthase inhibition is abolished by simultaneous inhibition of HMG-CoA synthase or HMGR.These pharmacological studies imply that the signal for Hmg2p degradation is a pathway molecule between mevalonate and squalene (Fig.1 a). The most reasonable candidate for this signal is farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or an off-pathway FPP derivative. The idea that FPP, or a derivative, is a positive signal for Hmg2p degradation is particularly interesting since there is accumulating evidence fromin vitro and in vivo studies that farnesol, an FPP-derivative, is a signal for regulation of mammalian HMGR stability (13Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1997; 345: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).We have now tested the hypothesis that FPP provides a molecular signal for control of Hmg2p stability using unique genetic opportunities available in yeast. In conjunction with pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we have constructed yeast strains that allowed either overexpression or down-regulation of specific mevalonate pathway genes (Fig. 1 b). Our results indicated that FPP was indeed a source of a signal for Hmg2p degradation in yeast, demonstrating that there is striking conservation for this mode of HMGR regulation among eukaryotes.DISCUSSIONHMGR degradation is regulated by signals generated downstream in the mevalonate pathway. The identity of these signals and the mechanism by which they control HMGR degradation is currently not known. To understand better the nature of this regulatory mechanism, we have examined the regulated degradation of the yeast HMGR isozyme Hmg2p through genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the mevalonate pathway.The results detailed in this work strongly implicated the mevalonate pathway product FPP as the source of the positive signal for Hmg2p degradation. ZA addition or squalene synthase down-regulation, both predicted to increase FPP levels in the cell, increased Hmg2p degradation. Conversely, addition of lovastatin, FPP synthase down-regulation, or squalene synthase overexpression, all predicted to decrease FPP levels in the cell, stabilized Hmg2p. Identical Hmg2p steady-state levels in degradation-deficient strains containing either normal or down-regulated squalene synthase levels indicated that FPP levels affected only Hmg2p degradation.Utility of the MET3 PromoterIn order to examine the molecular signals for Hmg2p degradation, we required a way to manipulate the mevalonate pathway at any enzymatic step. Drugs that inhibit some of the pathway enzymes are available, such as lovastatin and ZA. However, there are no currently available drugs that inhibit enzymes between HMGR and squalene synthase. Furthermore, because the products of the mevalonate pathway are essential for yeast viability, null alleles of mevalonate pathway genes result in cell death. Therefore, we required a way to alter the level or activity of mevalonate pathway enzymes in a controllable, yet viable, manner.To accomplish this, we manipulated the levels of key mevalonate pathway enzymes by placing them under the control of a regulated promoter. We chose the MET3 promoter (22Cherest H. Nguyen N.T. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 34: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which can be repressed by incubation of cells in high concentrations of methionine (>0.5 mm) (23Mountain H.A. Byström A.S. Larsen J.T. Korch C. Yeast. 1991; 7: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In all cases, the conditional alleles were similar to null alleles in that cells carrying the conditional alleles, when continuously incubated in methionine, were unable to grow after a few doublings. However, unlike cells with null alleles, cells carrying the conditional alleles could be induced to grow by transferring them to media containing no methionine. This type of genetic manipulation provided a facile way to alter the expression of target genes and could be used, in theory, to create regulated alleles of any yeast gene.FPP as the Source of the Signal for Hmg2p DegradationManipulation of FPP levels by both pharmacological and genetic means resulted in the expected changes to Hmg2p degradation consistent with FPP, or a derivative, as a positive signal for Hmg2p degradation. The idea that intracellular levels of FPP, or a derivative, serve to modulate Hmg2p degradation in yeast paralleled similar observations in mammalian cells. It has been proposed that degradation of mammalian HMGR is regulated by the intracellular levels of farnesol, a derivative of FPP (13Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

It may also be the case that farnesol is the positive signal for Hmg2p degradation in yeast, and we are currently in the process of examining whether FPP or farnesol regulates Hmg2p degradation.One way to distinguish between FPP and farnesol as the regulatory signal would be by elimination of the pyrophosphatase activity required to convert FPP to farnesol (17Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, two pyrophosphatases,LPP1 and DPP1, that appear to convert FPP to farnesol in vitro have been described (39Faulkner A. Chen X. Rush J. Horazdovsky B. Waechter C.J. Carman G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14831-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Null alleles of the genes encoding these enzymes have been made in yeast, and the cells are viable. We examined Hmg2p degradation in these strains and found that the absence of Lpp1p and Dpp1p had no effect on Hmg2p regulated degradation.4 This could mean that either FPP, not farnesol, is the signal for HMGR degradation in yeast or that these enzymes are not solely responsible for the conversion of FPP to farnesol in vivo. In either case, it is apparent that FPP serves as the source of a signal for HMGR degradation in both mammals and yeast.In mammalian cells, there is an additional sterol signal that acts to modulate HMGR degradation. The addition of sterols to mammalian cells results in increased degradation of HMGR (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this downstream signal from sterols does not accelerate HMGR degradation in the absence of the upstream FPP-derived signal (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that sterols provide an additional positive signal for HMGR degradation that works only in conjunction with the FPP-derived signal. In this study, our results demonstrated that no other pathway product downstream of FPP was required for Hmg2p degradation in yeast. That is inhibition of squalene epoxidase activity or down-regulation of squalene epoxidase had no stabilizing effect on Hmg2p degradation. However, yeast may contain abundant stores of sterols, and so the existence of other signals cannot be ruled out by these negative results. We are further exploring, by both genetic and pharmacological means, whether an additional signal downstream of squalene can act in conjunction with FPP to hasten Hmg2p degradation.Mechanisms by Which FPP Regulates Hmg2p DegradationThe identification of FPP, or a derivative, as the positive signal for HMGR degradation in yeast leads to several models for regulation of Hmg2p degradation. The simplest model for the regulatory mechanism is that the FPP-derived signal acts as an allosteric regulator and physically binds to the transmembrane domain of Hmg2p, altering its susceptibility to degradation. Alternatively, the FPP-derived molecule could modify or interact with a separate effector protein that alters Hmg2p stability. The effector could act to promote or prevent Hmg2p degradation, as either of these possibilities have precedent in cellular degradation (40Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 41Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the FPP-derived signal directly affects the structure of the ER membrane. By this model, the Hmg2p transmembrane domain would respond to the altered membrane by becoming increasingly susceptible to degradation. In this regard, it is interesting that the distance from the ER surface of key residues in the Hmg2p transmembrane is critical in regulation of Hmg2p stability.3We are currently exploring the mechanism by which FPP acts to regulate Hmg2p degradation. It is clear that both yeast and mammalian cells measure FPP production as a means to control HMGR degradation. This conservation in signaling strategy, together with the similar location and machinery required for HMGR degradation, indicates that the mechanism for regulation of HMGR degradation may also be conserved among eukaryotes.A final and important note should be made regarding a recent study on a fascinating side effect of the HMGR inhibitor lovastatin. It has been demonstrated that the closed β-lactone ring form of this particular statin can directly inhibit the proteasome (29Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). At first thought, it might be reasonable to conclude that this action is responsible for the stabilizing effects of lovastatin on Hmg2p, which is degraded by the proteasome (11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, several observations show quite clearly that all actions of lovastatin we have observed were due to altered signal production and not proteasome inhibition. Degradation of 6Myc-Hmg2p, which is proteasome-dependent, is unaffected by doses of lovastatin that slow Hmg2p degradation (Ref. 11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar and Fig. 7). Furthermore, the pathway inhibitor L659,699, which inhibits HMG-CoA synthase but contains no lactone moiety, is equally effective at stabilizing Hmg2p as lovastatin (12Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Third, genetic manipulations of HMG-CoA synthase (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), or FPP synthase (this work), which slow production of the degradation signals but do not involve drugs, have identical actions to lovastatin on Hmg2p degradation but not 6Myc-Hmg2p degradation. Finally, lovastatin decreases ubiquitination of Hmg2p (Ref. 12Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and this study), an effect opposite of that observed when the proteasome is compromised or inhibited (11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Although proteasome inhibition by the closed ring form of lovastatin is interesting and perhaps important clinically, it plays no obvious or important role in the actions of this drug on regulating Hmg2p stability in yeast and is most likely not involved in mammalian HMGR degradation, for similar reasons. The mevalonate pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of numerous essential molecules including prenyl groups, coenzyme Q, dolichol, and sterols such as cholesterol (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR)1 is a key enzyme of the pathway and is rate-determining for cholesterol synthesis in mammals (2Siperstein M.D. Fagan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 602-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dietschy J.M. Brown M.S. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 508-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mevalonate pathway is modulated in large part by feedback control of the amount of HMGR protein (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar), and a significant portion of HMGR feedback control occurs through regulation of HMGR degradation (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

HMGR is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, and its degradation occurs without exit from the ER (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Lecureux L.W. Wattenberg B.W. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The non-catalytic, N-terminal transmembrane anchor of HMGR is both necessary and sufficient for regulated degradation (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When there is abundant synthesis of pathway products, HMGR degradation is fast, and steady-state levels of the protein tend to be low. Conversely, when synthesis of pathway products is reduced, for instance when a patient is given the HMGR inhibitor lovastatin, HMGR degradation is slowed, and steady-state levels of the protein tend to increase. However, neither the identity of the mevalonate-derived signal nor the mechanism by which this signal is coupled to HMGR degradation is known. In order to discover and understand the mechanisms of HMGR-regulated degradation, we have been studying the process in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our earlier work has shown that the yeast HMGR isozyme Hmg2p is degraded in a regulated manner with many similarities to the analogous process in mammals. Through the use of genetic selections and screens, we have been able to identify genes required for the degradation of Hmg2p, calledHRD genes (11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and genes required for normal regulation of Hmg2p degradation. 2S. Cronin and R. Hampton, manuscript in preparation.2S. Cronin and R. Hampton, manuscript in preparation. Concurrently with these screens, we have been studying the nature of the mevalonate-derived signals that control Hmg2p stability. Hmg2p degradation is regulated by an unknown signal from the mevalonate pathway (Fig. 1 a). Inhibiting early pathway enzymes, such as HMGR itself or HMG-CoA synthase, decreases the rate of Hmg2p degradation (6Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These early pathway blocks decrease the availability of a downstream signal for degradation. Conversely, inhibiting the enzyme squalene synthase, which is downstream of HMGR, stimulates degradation and ubiquitination of Hmg2p (12Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the degradation-enhancing effect of squalene synthase inhibition is abolished by simultaneous inhibition of HMG-CoA synthase or HMGR. These pharmacological studies imply that the signal for Hmg2p degradation is a pathway molecule between mevalonate and squalene (Fig.1 a). The most reasonable candidate for this signal is farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or an off-pathway FPP derivative. The idea that FPP, or a derivative, is a positive signal for Hmg2p degradation is particularly interesting since there is accumulating evidence fromin vitro and in vivo studies that farnesol, an FPP-derivative, is a signal for regulation of mammalian HMGR stability (13Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

We have now tested the hypothesis that FPP provides a molecular signal for control of Hmg2p stability using unique genetic opportunities available in yeast. In conjunction with pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we have constructed yeast strains that allowed either overexpression or down-regulation of specific mevalonate pathway genes (Fig. 1 b). Our results indicated that FPP was indeed a source of a signal for Hmg2p degradation in yeast, demonstrating that there is striking conservation for this mode of HMGR regulation among eukaryotes. DISCUSSIONHMGR degradation is regulated by signals generated downstream in the mevalonate pathway. The identity of these signals and the mechanism by which they control HMGR degradation is currently not known. To understand better the nature of this regulatory mechanism, we have examined the regulated degradation of the yeast HMGR isozyme Hmg2p through genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the mevalonate pathway.The results detailed in this work strongly implicated the mevalonate pathway product FPP as the source of the positive signal for Hmg2p degradation. ZA addition or squalene synthase down-regulation, both predicted to increase FPP levels in the cell, increased Hmg2p degradation. Conversely, addition of lovastatin, FPP synthase down-regulation, or squalene synthase overexpression, all predicted to decrease FPP levels in the cell, stabilized Hmg2p. Identical Hmg2p steady-state levels in degradation-deficient strains containing either normal or down-regulated squalene synthase levels indicated that FPP levels affected only Hmg2p degradation.Utility of the MET3 PromoterIn order to examine the molecular signals for Hmg2p degradation, we required a way to manipulate the mevalonate pathway at any enzymatic step. Drugs that inhibit some of the pathway enzymes are available, such as lovastatin and ZA. However, there are no currently available drugs that inhibit enzymes between HMGR and squalene synthase. Furthermore, because the products of the mevalonate pathway are essential for yeast viability, null alleles of mevalonate pathway genes result in cell death. Therefore, we required a way to alter the level or activity of mevalonate pathway enzymes in a controllable, yet viable, manner.To accomplish this, we manipulated the levels of key mevalonate pathway enzymes by placing them under the control of a regulated promoter. We chose the MET3 promoter (22Cherest H. Nguyen N.T. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 34: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which can be repressed by incubation of cells in high concentrations of methionine (>0.5 mm) (23Mountain H.A. Byström A.S. Larsen J.T. Korch C. Yeast. 1991; 7: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In all cases, the conditional alleles were similar to null alleles in that cells carrying the conditional alleles, when continuously incubated in methionine, were unable to grow after a few doublings. However, unlike cells with null alleles, cells carrying the conditional alleles could be induced to grow by transferring them to media containing no methionine.

We found that Raf-1 does contribute to Ras activation of ERK5 but in a manner that does not correlate with Raf-1 catalytic activity. A clue to the mechanism of action of Raf-1 on ERK5 comes from the observation that endogenous Raf-1 binds to endogenous ERK5, suggesting the involvement of regulatory protein-protein interactions. This interaction is specific because Raf-1 binds only to ERK5 and not ERK2 or SAPK. Finally, we demonstrate the ERK5/MEK5 pathway is required for Raf-dependent cellular transformation and that a constitutively active form of MEK5, MEK5DD, synergizes with Raf to transform NIH 3T3 cells.

Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, unlike ERK1 and ERK2, ERK5 is not detectably stimulated by Raf-1 or its activated mutants. These findings initially suggested that Ras activates ERK5 by a Raf-independent mechanism. Many studies imply that Ras function is mediated by a convergence of Raf-dependent and Raf-independent signaling events (2Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Barsagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 3White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The observation that the activity of the ERK5 catalytic domain is increased by Ras but not Raf-1 raises the possibility that ERK5 might contribute to Raf-independent signaling by Ras.To address the possibility that ERK5 is regulated by a Raf-independent Ras effector pathway, we tested the capacities of a panel of Ras effector domain mutations to activate the catalytic domain of ERK5. These mutations uncouple the association of Ras with its multiple downstream partners (3White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We found that all Ras effector domain mutants were defective in activating ERK5. We were surprised to find that Raf-1 complemented all of the mutants, including those that do not bind or activate Raf-1. The ability of Raf-1 to restore activation of the ERK5 catalytic domain by the Ras effector domain mutants did not correlate with the ability of Raf-1 to activate the ERK1,2 MAP kinase cascade. This finding suggests that Raf-1 and Ras coordinate to regulate ERK5 by a mechanism distinct from that of Raf-1 in ERK1,2 activation. To test for a possible role of complex formation between ERK5 and Raf-1, we examined their interactions in vitro and in intact cells. Not only do recombinant ERK5 and Raf-1 bind in vitro, endogenous ERK5 and Raf-1 associate as detected by co-immunoprecipitation. An important role for coordinated ERK5 regulation is suggested by our observation that dominant negative mutants of both ERK5 and its upstream regulator MEK5 inhibit Raf-dependent cellular transformation.DISCUSSIONWe previously demonstrated that oncogenic Ras activates the catalytic domain of ERK5 (ERK5kin) (1English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In an attempt to delineate the molecular players downstream of Ras we uncovered a role of Raf-1 in the activation of ERK5. Ras mutants with a partial loss of function were incapable of activating ERK5kin. However, the addition of Raf-1 to these mutants restored the activation by Ras. The ability of Raf-1 to restore activation did not correlate with Raf-1 catalytic activity, suggesting a novel mechanism of action of Raf-1 in activation of ERK5kin. In addition, Raf-1 is apparently not a MEK5 kinase (7English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Together these findings imply that the ERK5 pathway is distinct from the ERK1/2 pathways in its regulation downstream of Ras and Raf-1.Further evidence for a role for Raf-1 in the regulation of ERK5 was the finding that Raf-1 and ERK5 interact. Raf-1 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-ERK5 from 293 cells and bound to GST-ERK5 in vitro. More significantly, in the presence of MEK5DD, Raf-1 and ERK5 endogenous to 293 cells co-immunoprecipitated. The specificity of the interaction is supported by the lack of detectable binding of Raf-1 to ERK2 or SAPK. This specificity is consistent with the work of Wang et al.(15Wang S. Ghosh R.N. Chellappan S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) who saw no Raf-1 binding to three other MAP kinase family members. Thus, ERK5 is a novel Raf-1 partner that may participate in mediating Raf-1 responses in cells.We have been unable to show that Raf-1 is sufficient to activate ERK5 or MEK5 under conditions in which MEK1 and ERK2 are activated (1English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, our previous work in combination with the experiments described above suggests that although Raf-1 is not likely to be a MEK5 kinase, it plays a role in the activation of this MAP kinase module. Perhaps the function of Raf-1 is to cause the formation of functional ERK5 complexes. The proper formation of multi-protein complexes is an essential part of the regulation of numerous signaling pathways (14Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K.

The importance of protein associations in the actions of serine/threonine kinases has been amply demonstrated by the necessity of proteins such as Ste5p, a scaffold for the MAP kinase cascade in the yeast pheromone response pathway, for the functioning of the cascades that they support.The effector pathway(s) mediating Ras regulation of ERK5 remains to be determined. Our results suggest that Raf-1 participates in ERK5 activation together with a novel Ras-dependent signaling event. The Ras effector mutants used in this study discriminate among PI 3-kinase, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, and Raf-1 family members. However, there are likely to be other uncharacterized Ras partners that will associate with one or more of these mutants. The observation that all three mutants cooperated with Raf-1 to activate ERK5 suggests that an uncharacterized Ras partner(s) may be involved. Consistent with this perception, we found that overexpression of Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator or expression of activated variants of PI 3-kinase failed to cooperate with Raf-1 to activate ERK5 (not shown). A similar genetic argument for the presence of a novel Ras effector pathway was made using a myoblast differentiation model system (11Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The ability of Raf-1 to enhance activation of ERK5 by Ras effector domain mutants suggests that the MEK5/ERK5 cascade is involved in Raf-1 signaling. Using active and inhibitory forms of MEK5 and kinase-dead ERK5, we observed a functional interaction of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway in Raf-dependent transformation of fibroblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a role for the MEK5/ERK5 pathway in cellular transformation. Previously, we and others demonstrated that MEK5 does not activate ERK2 (5Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 7English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MEK5DD significantly activates ERK5kin in cells but does not activate ERK2. 2J. M. English, G. Pearson, and M. H. Cobb, unpublished observation. Thus, the synergy of MEK5DD and Raf-1 in cell transformation is not because of enhanced ERK2 activation by MEK5DD either directly or through autocrine pathways. Therefore, the MEK5/ERK5 pathway is required for Raf-1 transformation of fibroblasts via a mechanism independent of the best characterized Raf-1 effector pathway.In conclusion, we demonstrate that although Raf-1 does not appear to be a direct activator of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway, there is an intimate relationship between Raf-1 and the MEK5/ERK5 MAP kinase module. Our future work will be directed toward determining the mechanism of regulation of this pathway and investigating the importance of Raf-1-ERK5 binding for their functions. We have recently demonstrated that Ras contributes to activation of the newly discovered MAP1kinase family member, ERK5 (1English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, unlike ERK1 and ERK2, ERK5 is not detectably stimulated by Raf-1 or its activated mutants. These findings initially suggested that Ras activates ERK5 by a Raf-independent mechanism. Many studies imply that Ras function is mediated by a convergence of Raf-dependent and Raf-independent signaling events (2Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Barsagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 3White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The observation that the activity of the ERK5 catalytic domain is increased by Ras but not Raf-1 raises the possibility that ERK5 might contribute to Raf-independent signaling by Ras. To address the possibility that ERK5 is regulated by a Raf-independent Ras effector pathway, we tested the capacities of a panel of Ras effector domain mutations to activate the catalytic domain of ERK5. These mutations uncouple the association of Ras with its multiple downstream partners (3White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We found that all Ras effector domain mutants were defective in activating ERK5. We were surprised to find that Raf-1 complemented all of the mutants, including those that do not bind or activate Raf-1. The ability of Raf-1 to restore activation of the ERK5 catalytic domain by the Ras effector domain mutants did not correlate with the ability of Raf-1 to activate the ERK1,2 MAP kinase cascade. This finding suggests that Raf-1 and Ras coordinate to regulate ERK5 by a mechanism distinct from that of Raf-1 in ERK1,2 activation. To test for a possible role of complex formation between ERK5 and Raf-1, we examined their interactions in vitro and in intact cells. Not only do recombinant ERK5 and Raf-1 bind in vitro, endogenous ERK5 and Raf-1 associate as detected by co-immunoprecipitation. An important role for coordinated ERK5 regulation is suggested by our observation that dominant negative mutants of both ERK5 and its upstream regulator MEK5 inhibit Raf-dependent cellular transformation. DISCUSSIONWe previously demonstrated that oncogenic Ras activates the catalytic domain of ERK5 (ERK5kin) (1English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In an attempt to delineate the molecular players downstream of Ras we uncovered a role of Raf-1 in the activation of ERK5. Ras mutants with a partial loss of function were incapable of activating ERK5kin. However, the addition of Raf-1 to these mutants restored the activation by Ras. The ability of Raf-1 to restore activation did not correlate with Raf-1 catalytic activity, suggesting a novel mechanism of action of Raf-1 in activation of ERK5kin. In addition, Raf-1 is apparently not a MEK5 kinase (7English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Together these findings imply that the ERK5 pathway is distinct from the ERK1/2 pathways in its regulation downstream of Ras and Raf-1.Further evidence for a role for Raf-1 in the regulation of ERK5 was the finding that Raf-1 and ERK5 interact. Raf-1 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-ERK5 from 293 cells and bound to GST-ERK5 in vitro. More significantly, in the presence of MEK5DD, Raf-1 and ERK5 endogenous to 293 cells co-immunoprecipitated. The specificity of the interaction is supported by the lack of detectable binding of Raf-1 to ERK2 or SAPK. This specificity is consistent with the work of Wang et al.(15Wang S. Ghosh R.N. Chellappan S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) who saw no Raf-1 binding to three other MAP kinase family members. Thus, ERK5 is a novel Raf-1 partner that may participate in mediating Raf-1 responses in cells.We have been unable to show that Raf-1 is sufficient to activate ERK5 or MEK5 under conditions in which MEK1 and ERK2 are activated (1English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, our previous work in combination with the experiments described above suggests that although Raf-1 is not likely to be a MEK5 kinase, it plays a role in the activation of this MAP kinase module. Perhaps the function of Raf-1 is to cause the formation of functional ERK5 complexes. The proper formation of multi-protein complexes is an essential part of the regulation of numerous signaling pathways (14Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K.

Here, we investigated the presence of PEDF receptors on retinoblastoma Y-79 and CG cells. PEDF radiolabeled with l25I remained biologically active and was used for radioligand binding analysis. The binding was saturable and specific to a single class of receptors on both cells and with similar affinities (K d = 1.7–3.6 nm, B max = 0.5–2.7 × 105 sites/Y-79 cell; and K d = 3.2 nm, B max = 1.1 × 103 sites/CG cell). A polyclonal antiserum to PEDF, previously shown to block the PEDF neurotrophic activity, prevented the125I-PEDF binding. We designed two peptides from a region previously shown to confer the neurotrophic property to human PEDF, synthetic peptides 34-mer (positions 44–77) and 44-mer (positions 78–121). Only peptide 44-mer competed for the binding to Y-79 cell receptors (EC50 = 5 nm) and exhibited neuronal differentiating activity. PEDF affinity column chromatography of membrane proteins from both cell types revealed a PEDF-binding protein of ∼80 kDa.

Addition of PEDF at nanomolar concentrations to the media of human retinoblastoma Y-79 and Weri cells induces a neuronal phenotype, which is accompanied by the expression of the neuronal markers neuronal-specific enolase and 200-kDa neurofilament (2Steele F.R.

It promotes the survival and differentiation of developing spinal motor neurons (7Houenou L. D'Costa A. Li T. Turgeon V. Enyadike C. Alberdi E. Becerra S.P. J. Comp.

PEDF can also protect developing primary hippocampal neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity (9DeCoster M.A. Schabelman E. Tombran-Tink J. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci.

In addition, it delays the death of photoreceptors in mouse models of inherited retinal degenerations (retinitis pigmentosa) (10Becerra S.P. Alberdi E. Martinez A. Montuenga L. Cayoutte M. Gravel C.

Previous studies have suggested important roles for certain serine proteases and serpins in the development and/or pathology of the nervous system, e.g. thrombin, urokinase, and their inhibitors protease nexin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (20Gurwitz D.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Given these studies, we had previously attempted to determine the inhibitory capacity of PEDF against serine proteases. First, an inhibitory activity against proteases, among others thrombin, could not be demonstrated for PEDF (24Becerra S.P. Palmer I. Kumar A. Steele F. Shiloach J. Notario V. Chader G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23148-23156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol.

Second, PEDF, like the noninhibitory serpins ovalbumin, angiotensinogen, and maspin, lacks the serpin S → R conformational change upon cleavage of its serpin-exposed loop (25Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 26Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Third, structure-function studies demonstrated that the serpin reactive loop located toward the carboxyl end of the polypeptide is dispensable, whereas a region toward the amino end (BA, amino acid positions 44–121) confers the neurotrophic activity to the PEDF polypeptide (26Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations indicate that the mechanism of action for the neurotrophic activity of PEDF is independent of protease inhibition. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the binding properties of PEDF to cells for mechanistic studies. Because the binding of PEDF to its receptor is presumably the first step in the mediation of its physiological effects, basic physicochemical parameters of such binding were established. We have used cultures of human retinoblastoma cells and rat CG cells because they respond to PEDF stimuli, and we used a biologically active form of 125I-PEDF to define the basic physicochemical parameters of such binding. We have used PEDF purified from bovine eyes (12Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Wu Y.Q. Becerra S.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1984-1993PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant human PEDF (26Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), synthetic peptides derived from BA, and a polyclonal antiserum to PEDF, Ab-rPEDF (12Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), to further investigate the specificity of the binding. Finally, PEDF affinity column chromatography was used to isolate a PEDF-binding protein from retinoblastoma and CG cell membranes. We describe here that PEDF exhibits a saturable and specific binding to target cells for neurotrophic activity and demonstrate for the first time a PEDF-binding protein with characteristics of a PEDF receptor. Minimum Eagle's medium (withoutl-glutamine), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium,l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, HEPES, fetal bovine serum, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.144 g/liter KH2PO4, 9 g/liter NaCl, 0.795 g/liter Na2HPO4·H2O, pH 7.4) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. ITS mix containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenium was purchased from Collaborative Research. 3M EmphazeTM activated biosupport medium and BupHTM citrate-carbonate buffer, pH 9.0, were from Pierce. CHAPS detergent was from Calbiochem, polyethylenimine was from Sigma, and GF/C glass microfiber filters were from Whatman. Native PEDF was purified from the interphotoreceptor matrix or vitreous of fresh bovine eyes, as described previously (12Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Wu Y.Q. Becerra S.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1984-1993PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant PEDF was synthesized by baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells containing the expression vector pMA-PEDF with a full-length human PEDF cDNA, and the recombinant PEDF protein was purified from the conditioned media (26Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides 34-mer and 44-mer were designed from amino acid positions 44–77 (DPFFKVPVNKLAAAVSNFGYDLYRVRSSMSPTTN) and 78–121 (VLLSPLSVATALSALSLGAEQRTESIIHRALYYDLISSPDIHGT) of the human PEDF sequence (GenBankTM accession number U29953), respectively, and prepared by Biosynthesis, Inc., followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification (>90% purity) and amino-terminal sequence determination. The resulting peptides were soluble in aqueous solutions. rPEDF-BH is the recombinant human PEDF (positions 44–121) prepared from Escherichia coli, as described before (24Becerra S.P. Palmer I. Kumar A. Steele F. Shiloach J. Notario V. Chader G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23148-23156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled PEDF was prepared from either the native bovine or recombinant human PEDF protein with 125I using an immobilized form of N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (sodium salt), the IodobeadsTM iodination reagent (Pierce) by Lofstrand Laboratories and analyzed as described previously (16Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The125I-PEDF sample contained >90% trichloroacetic-precipitable counts, with a specific activity ranging between 6–7 × 107 dpm/μg and a concentration of 6–7 × 105 dpm/μg. Human retinoblastoma Y-79 and Weri cells were cultured in suspension in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 until the appropriate number of cells was available. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice, resuspended in PBS, and then counted. For binding assays and membrane protein isolation, cells were cultured overnight at 1.25 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free medium consisting of minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics as above. CG cells were prepared from 8-day old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups and cultured in monolayers in chemically defined media, as described previously (4Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). BHK, COS-7, and NIH3T3 were cultured in cell monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as above. Human Y-79 retinoblastoma cells were cultured and treated for neurite outgrowth as described before (24Becerra S.P. Palmer I. Kumar A. Steele F. Shiloach J. Notario V. Chader G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23148-23156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ml of Y-79 cell culture (1.25 × 105cells/ml) in serum-free medium as above plus 0.1% ITS were treated with 25 μl of a solution containing PEDF protein in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% BSA. After 7 days of treatment, the cells were attached to poly-d-lysine-coated plates. The differentiation state of the cells was monitored by light microscopy at intervals after attachment. Human retinoblastoma Y-79 and Weri cell cultures (6 × l05cells/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min before the addition of125I-PEDF at concentrations as indicated. The binding reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 90 min, unless otherwise indicated. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, immediately followed by filtration under vacuum through Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. Finally, the filters were washed with 10 ml of the ice-cold 1% BSA in PBS. BHK, COS-7, NIH3T3, and CG cells were cultured in 24-well plates, the first three to 90% confluency and the latter containing 5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were washed with 0.5 ml of 0.1% BSA in culturing medium (binding buffer) three times before the addition of 125I-PEDF in binding buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 90 min, unless indicated, the unbound PEDF was washed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer three times, and then the cells were lysed by incubation with 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH at room temperature for 30 min. Filters and cell lysates were placed in scintillation vials, mixed with 5 ml of Bio-Safe II liquid scintillation solution (Research Products International Corp.), incubated at room temperature overnight, and then mixed by extensive vortexing before determining the radioactivity using a β-counter (Beckman, model LS3801). Alternatively, bound and free radioligand were separated by centrifugation of cell suspensions followed by three washes with 1% BSA in PBS, and the bound radioactivity was determined in the cell pellets using a gamma counter (Wallac) or after SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of bound radioactivity in the presence of saturating concentrations of unlabeled ligand, unless otherwise indicated, and specific binding as bound radioactivity minus nonspecific binding. Data were analyzed using the Minitab statistical program and Microsoft Excel 97 for linear regression, as well as GraphPad Prism, version 3.0, for nonlinear regression and Scatchard analyses. Human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells (25 × 106) were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 100 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 15 min, cells were disrupted by sonication with two bursts, in 5 s pulses at 4 °C. The suspension was fractionated by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The plasma membranes in the supernatant were separated by centrifugation at 83,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The particulate extracts were resuspended in 0.1 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% CHAPS) at 4 °C. The suspension was mixed by gentle pipetting, and the soluble proteins were fractionated by centrifugation at 175,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was extracted a second time with solubilization buffer by the same procedure. The first and second extracts were combined and constituted the detergent-soluble membrane fraction. About 50 μg of protein was obtained from 25 × 106 Y-79 cells. Membranes from rat CG cells were prepared as above and with the following modifications. The homogenization buffer was 72 ml of 0.32m sucrose in Tris-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, for 360 × 106 cells at days in vitro (DIV) 7 and 8. The plasma membranes in the homogenized cell suspension were fractionated by centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Integral membrane proteins were fractionated with Triton X-114, as described previously (27Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the particulate membrane extract was resuspended in 18 ml of 1% Triton X-114 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernantant was warmed to 32 °C for 10 min, and then the detergent and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation. The detergent phase was mixed with an equal volume of Tris-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and separated as described above. The detergent phase was diluted in cold 10 mm Tris acetic acid, pH 8, and 1 mmEDTA, and the detergent was removed by chromatography through a 2-ml Calbiosorb adsorbent column. Elution was performed with the dilution buffer, and fractions of 2 ml were collected in tubes containing 0.2 ml of 5% CHAPS. Fractions containing protein were pooled and constituted the detergent-soluble membrane fraction. About 700–900 μg of solubilized membrane protein were obtained from 360 × 106 CG cells. Recombinant human PEDF at 2 mg/ml was dialyzed against coupling buffer containing 0.6 m sodium citrate, 0.1m sodium carbonate, pH 9.0. A total of 5.5 ml of dialysate or of coupling buffer was transferred to a tube containing 0.25 g of dry UltralinkTM biosupport medium, and the manufacturer's instructions were followed. The coupling reaction was performed by incubation with gentle rotation at 25 °C for 3 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min at 25 °C, and the amount of uncoupled protein was determined from the supernatant. The amount of uncoupled protein ranged between 0.4 and 6.5% of the total protein added to the mixture. To block the remaining active groups in the coupled beads, 10 column volumes of 3m of ethanolamine, pH 9, were added, and the mixture was rotated for 3 h at 25 °C. The quenching solution was removed after centrifugation and the beads were washed with 15 ml of PBS, followed with 5 ml of 1 m NaCl. Finally, the beads were washed with 30 ml of PBS and stored in 0.05% sodium azide/PBS at 4 °C. The PEDF affinity resin contained about 1–6 mg of PEDF per ml of resin. PEDF affinity and control resins were packed in Polyprep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) to yield a 0.25-ml settled bed volume and equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% CHAPS). Detergent-soluble membrane proteins from 25 × 106 Y-79 cells were applied to the control column to absorb UltralinkTM-binding proteins. The flow-through and the first 7-column volume wash with the binding buffer were pooled and mixed with PEDF affinity beads (1.8 mg of PEDF/ml of beads) at a volume ratio of 7:1, and the mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 16 h. The resin was transferred into a column and washed with 12 column volumes of binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 14 column volumes of low pH buffer (10 mm glycine, pH 2.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.25% CHAPS) followed by 14 column volumes of 1 m NaCl in low pH buffer, 14 column volumes in high pH buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 11.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaC12, and 0.25% CHAPS), and finally with 1 m NaCl in high pH buffer. Proteins from each elution were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Detergent-soluble membrane extract from 360 × 106 CG cells was applied to a control resin column (0.5 ml) preequilibrated with 100 mm Tris-acetic acid, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% CHAPS. The flow-through was mixed with 1 ml of PEDF beads (6 mg of PEDF/ml of UltralinkTM) and incubated with gentle rotation at 4 °C for 16 h. The PEDF affinity resin was transferred into a column and washed with 20 column volumes of 150 mm NaCl in binding buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 6 column volumes of low pH buffer (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% CHAPS) followed by 6 column volumes of the same buffer at pH 11. Eluted proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centricon-30 (Amicon), following the manufacturer's protocol. Before we could investigate the binding characteristics of a ligand to target cells, it was necessary to analyze its structural and biological properties. PEDF was chemically modified by iodination with 125I and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Fig.1 shows that 125I-PEDF migrated as a single band corresponding to a 50-kDa protein, identical to that of unlabeled PEDF. Immunochemical analysis showed that the specific antibody to PEDF, Ab-rPEDF (12Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), recognized the radiolabeled protein on Western transfers or by immunoprecipitation, indicating that the chemical modification had not altered its main antigenic sites (data not shown). The radiolabeled protein was assayed for neurite outgrowth in human retinoblastoma Y-79 cell cultures (Fig. 1). We found that 125I-PEDF, prepared from either native bovine or recombinant human PEDF protein, induced the typical morphological differentiation on retinoblastoma Y-79 cells as previously demonstrated for their unlabeled counterparts (12Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Wu Y.Q. Becerra S.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus,125I-PEDF had the structural characteristics of the unlabeled protein and was obtained in a biologically active form. The binding of 125I-PEDF to human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells was characterized in detail. The binding reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C to avoid degradation of the ligand. PEDF (0.2–5 nm) was added to the cell cultures in defined media that had been conditioned for 16 h, to obtain conditions identical to those in the biological assay. A time course of 4.6 nm125I-PEDF binding to Y-79 cells indicated that specific binding was attained as early as 15 min after incubation and was maintained through the next 75 min (Fig.2 A). The free and bound radioligand did not undergo major degradation and had an identical migration pattern by SDS-PAGE, even after incubation for 16 h, but the binding signal decreased in the presence of an excess of unlabeled PEDF, confirming the specificity of 125I-PEDF binding to Y-79 cells (Fig. 2 B). The specific binding augmented linearly with increasing concentrations of 125I-PEDF in the range of 0–1 nm, representing ∼4% of the total radioactivity added to the cells (Fig. 2 C). The amount of nonspecific binding was similar in the presence of an excess of unlabeled PEDF or without cells. We then analyzed the PEDF binding profile to Y-79 cells to determine its physicochemical parameters. Binding was performed with a given amount of radioligand and increasing concentrations of unlabeled PEDF. Fig. 2 D shows that Y-79 cells exhibited a saturable and specific binding of PEDF. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of binding sites (B max = 271,200 sites per Y-79 cell) with an apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of 3.55 nm. A second and third experiment performed with different batches of Y-79 cells revealed similar kinetics, with K d = 1.7–3 nmand B max = 45,500–97,000 sites per Y-79 cell (data not shown). We have previously shown that a rabbit polyclonal antiserum developed against recombinant human PEDF, Ab-rPEDF, reacts in a specific, sensitive, and linear fashion with bovine PEDF, and when preincubated with PEDF, it blocks its inducing-neurotrophic activity on human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells (12Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of Ab-rPEDF on the l25I-PEDF binding to receptors on Y-79 cells, the radioligand was preincubated with an excess of Ab-rPEDF before adding it to the cells binding reaction mixtures. We found that in the presence of Ab-rPEDF the125I-PEDF binding decreased to nonspecific binding levels (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that Ab-rPEDF blocked the PEDF neurotrophic activity by preventing the binding of PEDF to receptors on Y-79 cells. To determine whether serpins can compete for the 125I-PEDF binding to Y-79 cells, we chose ovalbumin because it does not have inhibitory activity against proteases, which could interfere in the assay. In addition, it shares the lack of S → Rconformational change upon cleavage of the serpin-exposed loop with PEDF (25Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol.

We have shown that a subclass of synaptotagmins (III, V, VI, and X) forms homo- and heterodimers through an evolutionarily conserved cysteine motif at their N termini (Fukuda, M., Kanno, E., and Mikoshiba, K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31421–31427). In this study, we identified a novel alternatively spliced variant of synaptotagmin (Syt) VI that lacks the N-terminal 85 amino acids including the transmembrane region (thus designated as Syt VIΔTM). Because it lacks the cysteine motif responsible for self-dimerization, Syt VIΔTM could not associate with Syt VI even in the presence of Ca2+. Despite lacking the transmembrane region, Syt VIΔTM can associate with the plasma membrane through the C-terminal 29 amino acids. In adult mouse brain, two closely comigrating bands at M r ∼50,000, which closely corresponded to the molecular weight of recombinant Syt VIΔTM, were detected by anti-Syt VI antibody. These immunoreactive bands were found in both soluble and membrane fractions of mouse brain, indicating that they are membrane-associated proteins (Syt VIΔTM), but not transmembrane proteins (Syt VI). Expression of Syt VI and Syt VIΔTM in PC12 or COS-7 cells indicated that the two molecules have a distinct subcellular distribution: Syt VIΔTM is present in the cytosol or is associated with the plasma membrane or internal membrane structures, whereas Syt VI is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi-like perinuclear compartment. These results suggest that Syt VI and Syt VIΔTM may play distinct roles in vesicular trafficking.

It is also unknown whether synaptotagmin mRNAs are alternatively spliced because only a single isoform of synaptotagmins has been reported in rat or mouse to date. In the accompanying article (48Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we cloned mouse Syt I–XI cDNAs and found that Syts III, V, VI, and X form stable homo- and/or heterodimers via a conserved cysteine motif at the N terminus through disulfide bonds. In this study, we have identified a novel alternatively spliced variant of Syt VI (designated as Syt VIΔTM) that lacks the N-terminal domain including the transmembrane region (amino acids 1–85), which falls outside the classical synaptotagmin category described above (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 2Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because it lacks the conserved cysteine motif at the N terminus, Syt VIΔTM did not interact with Syts III, V, VI, and X even in the presence of Ca2+. Expression of Syt VI and Syt VIΔTM in PC12 or COS-7 cells indicated that the two molecules show distinct subcellular distribution: Syt VI is mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or Golgi-like perinuclear compartment, whereas Syt VIΔTM is localized to the plasma membrane, internal membrane structures, and cytosolic fraction. On the basis of these results, we discuss the functional differences between these two Syt VI proteins and a possible role for Syt VI in constitutive vesicle traffic, especially ER-to-Golgi or Golgi-to-ER vesicle transport. ExTaq and AmpliTaq DNA polymerases were obtained from Takara Biomedicals and Perkin-Elmer, respectively. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (M2) against the FLAG peptide were purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody and anti-His6 antibody were from Novagen and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. Solutions were made in deionized water. Alternatively spliced variants of Syt VI were screened by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from mouse cerebellum cDNAs (8Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using two sets of primers designed on the basis of rat sequences (14Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W.

Reactions were carried out in the presence of Perfect Match PCR Enhancer (Stratagene) for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. For the N-terminal half of Syt VI, a second reaction was run to highlight the difference in size between three splice variants using internal sense (5′-CGGGATCCATGAGCGGAGTTTGGGGGGCCG-3′, amino acids 1–8) and antisense (5′-TGATCTTCACAGCTGCCT-3′, amino acids 129–135) primers. The cycling conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. The PCR products, purified from an agarose gel by a MicroSpin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), were directly inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Both strands were completely sequenced by the ThermoSequenase premixed cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Hitachi SQ-5500 DNA sequencer. pEF-T7-Syt VI and pEF-FLAG-Syt VI were prepared as described previously (27Mizushima S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar), and hexahistidine residues, respectively. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing as described above. Glass-bottomed dishes (35-mm dish; Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) were coated with collagen type IV (Becton Dickinson Labware). PC12 cells were cultured on these dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection was done using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of various pEF-T7 (or FLAG)-Syt constructs into COS-7 cells was carried out by the DEAE-dextran method, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation following immunoblotting as described (48Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with pEF-Syt constructs (5 × 105cells/10-cm dish) were harvested 3 days after transfection and homogenized in 1 ml of 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer with 10 strokes at 900–1000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to precipitate membrane fractions. Equal proportions of supernatant and membrane fractions were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (48Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of adult mouse olfactory bulb was similarly performed. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the purified Syt VI C2A domain fused to glutathione S-transferase (amino acids 151–281) (29Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) by subcutaneous injection with RIBI adjuvant at intervals of 28 days. Antisera were collected after the third booster injection. Crude IgG fractions were obtained by adding an equal amount of saturated ammonium sulfate following centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (GRX-220 high speed refrigerated centrifuge, TOMY, Saitama, Japan). The precipitates were dissolved in a minimum volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then extensively dialyzed against PBS for 1 night. Since this crude IgG weakly recognized Syts I–III, V, IX, and X expressed in COS-7 cells (48Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the cross-reactive component was removed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose (wet volume 1 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled to the glutathioneS-transferase-Syt I–III, V, IX, and X C2A domain fusion proteins (>1 mg each) (30Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Then, the anti-Syt VI antibody was affinity-purified by exposure to antigen bound to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a reference. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (48Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, PC12 cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for 20 min at room temperature, followed by washing with 0.1 m glycine. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and immediately washed with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) three times for 5 min. The cells were incubated in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-BiP (Grp78, 1:200 dilution; Stressgen Biotech Corp.) and anti-TGN38 (1:500 dilution; Transduction Laboratories) mouse monoclonal antibodies and/or anti-Syt VI polyclonal antibody (0.38 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were washed out with blocking solution three times for 5 min; and then the cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, anti-Alexa 488 rabbit or anti-Alexa 568 mouse (Molecular Probes, Inc.), for 1 h at room temperature. After washing out the secondary antibodies with blocking solution five times for 5 min, immunoreactivity was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (TE300, Nikon) attached to a laser confocal scanner unit (CSU 10, Yokogawa Electric Corp.) and a HiSCA CCD camera (C6790, Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were pseudo-colored and superimposed using Adobe Photoshop software (Version 4.0). To date, 12 isoforms of synaptotagmin (Syts I-XI and Srg1) have been reported in rat and mouse (6Perin M.S.

Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but no splice variants have yet been described. To examine whether synaptotagmin genes produce splice variants, we divided the coding region of synaptotagmins into two parts (from the N terminus to the end of the C2A domain and from the C2A domain to the C terminus) and amplified them separately by reverse transcriptase-PCR using custom-designed oligonucleotides. The PCR products were purified from an agarose gel, subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, and completely sequenced. We obtained several cDNAs containing insertions or deletions as compared with the original sequences previously reported (Fig. 1) (data not shown). Among them, Syt VI has at least four splice variants, one major (∼85%) and three minor, in adult mouse cerebellum (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of the four splice variants indicated that the longest PCR products (Fig. 1,asterisk) contained 47-base pair insertions just upstream of the transmembrane region of Syt VI (Fig.2 A, arrowhead). However, since the content of this isoform was quite low and the insertion might be an unspliced intron, we did not examine this form of Syt VI further. The second longest Syt VI cDNA corresponds to the rat Syt VI previously described (14Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), and the two shorter forms were produced by alternative splicing around the transmembrane region, which resulted in a frameshift of the protein translation (Fig.2 A). We therefore designated the middle and shortest Syt VI splice variants as Syt VIΔTM1 and Syt VIΔTM2, respectively. Syt VIΔTM2 was generated by the splicing out of 83 base pairs from Syt VI, and Syt VIΔTM1 included another exon containing 66 base pairs at the same position. This frameshift generated new 5′-in-frame stop codons in the Syt VIΔTM1 and Syt VIΔTM2 cDNAs (Fig.2 A, asterisk). However, the sequence around the putative first methionine residue of Syt VIΔTM1 and Syt VIΔTM2 (methionine at position 86 of Syt VI) did not correspond well to the Kozak sequence (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar).Figure 2Schematic representation of the synaptotagmin VI variants generated by alternative splicing. A, sequence analysis of the Syt VI, Syt VIΔTM1, and Syt VIΔTM2 PCR products obtained from Fig. 1. The nucleotide sequences of the region of difference between Syt VI, Syt VIΔTM1, and Syt VIΔTM2 areboxed. Because of the frameshift, Syt VIΔTM1 and Syt VIΔTM2 proteins were translated from just after the transmembrane region of Syt VI (methionine at position 86; compare top and bottom amino acid sequences). The transmembrane region (TM), predicted first methionine residues (circled), and in-frame stop codon preceding the first methionine (asterisk) are indicated. Nucleotide sequences shown by lowercase lettersindicate the 5′-untranslated region. The arrowhead indicates the position of 47-base pair insertions in the longest Syt VI splice variant (see Fig. 1, asterisk). B, schematic representations of Syt VI-His and Syt VIΔTM-His: transmembrane region (TM; open box), two C2 domains (hatched boxes), and His6 tag (black boxes).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate whether Syt VIΔTM1 and Syt VIΔTM2 cDNAs are translated into proteins, we expressed C-terminal His6-tagged Syt VI, Syt VIΔTM1, or Syt VIΔTM2 (Fig.2 B) in COS-7 cells. Total cell homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-His6antibody. Two immunoreactive bands (apparent M r= 60,000 and 50,000) were detected in the cells transfected with pEF-Syt VI-His; one band (apparent M r = 50,000) was detected in the cells transfected with pEF-Syt VIΔTM1-His or pEF-Syt VIΔTM2-His; but no bands were seen in control cells (Fig.3). The apparentM r values of the two bands were almost identical to the calculated M r values of 58,300 (Syt VI-His) and 49,400 (Syt VIΔTM-His), respectively. This result indicates that the Syt VIΔTM1 and Syt VIΔTM2 cDNAs are indeed translated into the same protein (hereafter simply designated as Syt VIΔTM protein), and Syt VI cDNA is most likely to have alternative initiation of translation, which produces the two proteins (Syt VI and Syt VIΔTM), although we could not completely rule out the possibility that the M r 50,000 band seen in Fig.3 (lane 2) was a degradation product of Syt VI-His. We initially thought that Syt VIΔTM protein would be present in the cytosol because it lacks the transmembrane region as well as putative palmitoylation sites (cysteines at positions 68 and 84 of Syt VI) (31Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,32Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular fractionation of COS-7 cells transiently expressing pEF-Syt VI-His or pEF-Syt VIΔTM2-His indicated that both proteins were membrane-associated, although small amounts of Syt VIΔTM protein (<5%) were present in the soluble fraction (Fig.4 A). The membrane-associated Syt VIΔTM protein was easily released from the membrane by incubation with buffer containing 1 m NaCl, whereas Syt VI protein was tightly associated with the membrane fractions even in the presence of 1 m NaCl (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, Syt VIΔTM protein derived from pEF-Syt VI-His was also sensitive to NaCl concentration (Fig. 4 B, lower panel,arrowhead). Thus, we concluded that Syt VI is an integral membrane protein, whereas Syt VIΔTM is a peripheral membrane protein. To delineate which region of Syt VIΔTM is responsible for the membrane association, we produced five deletion mutants of Syt VIΔTM (Fig. 5 A). Deletion of the N-terminal region up to 137 amino acids (Syt VIΔN1–N4) had almost no effect on the membrane association, but deletion of only 29 amino acids at the C terminus (Syt VIΔC1) resulted in reduced membrane association (>60% of the protein present in the soluble fraction) (Fig. 5 B). About 40% of Syt VIΔC1 protein probably associates with phospholipids through the two C2 domains that are thought to bind negatively charged phospholipids (8Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S.

Because Syt VIΔTM lacks this cysteine residue, it could not form an SDS-resistant homodimer (Figs. 3 and4 A) or a β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimer (Fig.6).

Cell-free reactions utilizing cellular membranes of mycobacteria as the enzyme source indicated that ManN inhibited the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol mannosides, early precursors to LAM. A selection strategy was devised to screen a Mycobacterium tuberculosisgenomic library in Mycobacterium smegmatis for clones conferring conditional resistance to ManN, with the rationale that overexpression of the gene(s) encoding a target of ManN would impart a ManN-resistant phenotype under these conditions.

Partially purified recombinant PimB protein from Escherichia coli or membranes from M. smegmatis overexpressing the pimB gene were used in cell-free assays to show that PimB catalyzes the formation of triacylphosphatidylinositol dimannoside from GDP-mannose and triacylphosphatidylinositol monomannoside.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this regard, knowledge of the genetics and biochemistry of key biochemical pathways in mycobacteria will provide a basis for the rational design of new drugs (2Young D.B. Duncan K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 641-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mycobacterial cell wall (reviewed in Ref. 3Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) is the site of action of many of the first-line antimycobacterial agents (4Chopra I. Brennan P. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1998; 78: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and it contains numerous components that are presumed to be required for cell viability or survival in the host and are thus attractive drug targets. One of these is lipoarabinomannan (LAM),1 a key lipoglycan of the cell wall that is anchored in the mycobacterial plasma membrane and/or the outer leaflet of the pseudo-outer membrane (3Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). LAM has been implicated in various immunomodulatory effects, including the down-regulation of cell-mediated immunity (5Chan J. Fan X. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chatterjee D. Roberts A.D. Lowell K. Brennan P.J. Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kaplan G.

In addition, mannose “caps” on the LAM of M. tuberculosis (10Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to mediate attachment to macrophages and to aid in the initial phagocytosis of this intracellular pathogen (11Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 152: 4070-4079Google Scholar). Although little is known about the biosynthesis of LAM, structural similarities have suggested that the early precursors are phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) and certain phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) (12Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 1969; 176: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that transfer Man from GDP-Man to the 2-position of themyo-inositol ring of PI to form phosphatidylinositol monomannoside (PIM1) and then to the 6-position to form phosphatidylinositol dimannoside (PIM2) (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M.

From here, it has been proposed that PIM2 is further glycosylated with Man to form LM, which is characterized by a linear α(1→6)-linked mannan backbone punctuated by α(1→2)-linked mannopyranose side chains, and LM is further glycosylated with arabinan to form LAM (13Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PIM intermediates between PIM2 and larger LM-like molecules are most likely PIM3–PIM5 on the basis of their structures (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and these PIMs are a subset of the so-called higher PIMs (PIM3–PIM6) that all lack the branched configuration of LM (i.e. the α(1→2)-linked Man side chains) (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PIM6 appears to be a terminal product because it contains linear α(1→2)-linked Man, which is not found in LM or LAM (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Besra et al. (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have used a cell-free assay to show that PIM2 (or PIM3) may be extended by the addition of Man residues from an alkali-stable polyprenol-based mannolipid (polyprenolmannose (PPM)) (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to form “linear LM” containing only α(1→6)-linked Man. These authors also suggest that this linear LM is then further mannosylated to form mature, branched LM (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then PIM5 would also have to be a terminal product because it contains α(1→2)-linked Man (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Further evidence that PIM2 is the biosynthetic precursor to LAM comes from the location of the acyl functions elaborating these molecules. The PIMs can vary in the extent of acylation, from the lyso form with only C16:0 palmitate on the 1-position of the glycerol to the multiply acylated forms. The latter are composed of the predominant diacyl form containing C16:0 palmitate and C19:0 tuberculostearate fatty acids esterified to the 1- and 2-positions of the glycerol, respectively, as well as the triacyl and tetraacyl forms that contain additional palmitate moieties on specific Man residues (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several studies (20Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 493-500Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) indicate that the triacyl form 2Variations in nomenclature exist in the literature. For example, triacyl-PIM1 has been called “monoacyl-PIM1” to highlight only the additional acyl function on Man (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). of PIM1 serves as the substrate for the subsequent mannosylation step leading to triacyl-PIM2, and Khooet al. (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have confirmed that it is the triacyl form of PIM2 that is the predominant structural feature found within LM and LAM. The above structural and biosynthetic studies have established that PIM2 is an intermediate in the LAM biosynthetic pathway and provided the tools needed to initiate our analysis of the genetics of LAM biosynthesis. In this report, we describe the biochemical and genetic characterization of the pimB gene fromM. tuberculosis. Evidence is presented that PimB is the α-d-mannose-α(1→6)-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-monomannoside transferase responsible for the formation of triacyl-PIM2from GDP-Man and triacyl-PIM1. Mycobacterium smegmatis strain mc2155 (22Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Kieser T. Mustafa S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) was propagated in Middlebrook 7H11 broth or agar medium (Difco). Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue and XL2-Blue (both from Stratagene) and TB1 (New England Biolabs, Inc.) were grown in LB broth or agar medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) that was supplemented with 20 mmglucose for strain TB1. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C except when noted, and all broth cultures were aerated by shaking. Media for the propagation of recombinant E. coli or M. smegmatis strains contained 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, or 100 μg/ml ampicillin (all antibiotics were from Sigma). M. smegmatis cells utilized in growth curve, whole-cell labeling, or cell-free experiments were grown in glycerol alanine salts medium (23Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. Armstrong E.L. Boyle R.W. J. Lipid. Res. 1975; 16: 308-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, d-mannosamine (ManN) (ICN) was used at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, a concentration that was empirically determined to completely inhibit the growth of freshly diluted (A 600 nm = 0.010–0.030) cells grown overnight in 7H11 broth. When necessary, cultures were centrifuged every 18–24 h, and fresh ManN and glycerol alanine salts medium were added because ManN has been shown to be relatively unstable due to nonenzymatic modifications of the amino sugar in vitro (24Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For growth assays with d-glucosamine (GlcN) and ManN, the empirically determined concentration of 0.2 mg/ml GlcN was used in addition to 5 mg/ml ManN. All assays were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The incorporation of GDP-[14C]Man into membrane lipids was assayed according to Besra et al. (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using membranes isolated as described previously (25Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E. Mikušová K. Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Inamine J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11919-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15–20 g of cells were broken in a French pressure cell and centrifuged at 27,000 × g, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g. The pelleted membrane fraction was suspended in Buffer A (50 mm MOPS and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.9); and the protein concentration, determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), was adjusted to 20 mg/ml. Prior to the addition of 0.25 μCi of GDP-[14C]Man (321.4 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), membranes (2 mg of protein) were preincubated for 10 min with varying concentrations of ManN and, in some cases, amphomycin (100 μg/ml). Reactions were stopped by the consecutive additions of H2O, CH3OH, and CHCl3 to give a final ratio of 1:2:4 and extracted for 15 min. The lipids were Folch-washed five times with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1) (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dried before reconstituting in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) for analysis by TLC. The total cpm of radiolabel incorporated into the extracted lipids was measured by scintillation counting of 10% of the labeled material. Another 10% of the labeled material was subjected to TLC analysis in CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6) (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) on aluminum-backed plates of Silica Gel 60 F254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing thin-layer chromatograms to x-ray film at −70 °C for 4–5 days. Relevant portions of the TLC plate were scraped off, dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH, and analyzed by scintillation counting. All assays were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Triacyl-[14C]PIM1was purified from a scaled-up cell-free reaction by TLC as described above. The dry preparation was suspended by sonication in Buffer A containing 100 mm CHAPS. Reaction mixtures contained 1000 cpm [14C]PIM1, 62.5 μm ATP, 10 μm GDP-Man, and either mycobacterial membranes (2 mg) or partially purified recombinant protein (0.5 mg). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1), and analyzed by TLC autoradiography as described above. All assays were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The initial characterization of the mannolipids affected by ManN was carried out by subjecting the mannolipids to mild acid (in 0.5 n HCl) or mild alkali (in 0.1 n NaOH) hydrolysis as described previously (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The presence of Man was demonstrated by hydrolyzing the [14C]Man-labeled lipids with 2.0 mtrifluoroacetic acid, followed by TLC analysis of the aqueous phase of the Folch wash in comparison with sugar standards (28Mikušová K. Slayden R.A. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For structural analyses, nonradioactive mannolipids were synthesized in vitro as described above using unlabeled GDP-Man and isolated by preparative TLC using the radiolabeled mannolipids as markers. Following autoradiography, the relevant regions of the TLC plate were scraped off and extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), and the organic phase of the Folch wash (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1)) was collected and dried under nitrogen. Mannolipids were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) (14Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (, and references cited therein): 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) either directly in negative ion mode or as perdeuteroacetyl derivatives (100 μl of pyridine-d 6/acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) for 2 h) in positive ion mode. Samples were redissolved in CH3OH for loading onto the probe tip coated with triethanolamine or m-nitrobenzyl alcohol as matrix for negative and positive ion modes, respectively. FAB mass spectra were acquired on an Autospec orthogonal acceleration-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) fitted with a cesium ion gun operating at 26 kV. Collision-induced desorption (CID) MS-MS was performed by introducing argon gas to the collision cell to a reading of ∼1.2 × 10−6 millibars on the time of flight ion gauge. The source accelerating voltage was at 8 kV, and the laboratory frame collision energy was maintained at 800 eV, with a push-out frequency of 56 kHz for orthogonal sampling. A 1-s integration time per spectrum was chosen for the time of flight analyzer with a 0.1-s interscan delay. Individual spectra were summed for data processing. The effect of ManN on PIM/LM/LAM synthesis in M. smegmatis was determined by the whole-cell radiolabeling procedure described by Mikušováet al. (28Mikušová K. Slayden R.A. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures (100 ml) were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 nm = 0.20–0.40) prior to the addition of 1 μCi/ml d-[14C]glucose (296 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in the presence or absence of 5 mg/ml ManN and then incubated for 8 h. In certain experiments, the radiolabel was [14C]ManN (55 mCi/mmol; ICN). Cells were then harvested and washed, and the cell pellets were delipidated with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) to provide the extractable lipids containing the PIMs (29Deng L. Mikušová K. Robuck K.G. Scherman M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that were analyzed by TLC autoradiography as described above. The delipidated cell pellet was then subjected to 50% aqueous ethanol reflux, followed by partitioning between hot phenol and water (12Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous phase, containing the LM/LAM population, was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 13.5% gels (28Mikušová K. Slayden R.A. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with periodic acid and silver nitrate or blotted onto nitrocellulose and autoradiographed. A genomic library ofM. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was screened for cosmid clones conferring ManN resistance in the presence of exogenous GlcN (defined as the ability of the bacteria to grow, as determined by growth curve experiments, in the presence of 5 mg/ml ManN and 0.2 mg/ml GlcN). The library (generated by Dr. Aimee E. Belanger) was constructed by cloning 35–40-kilobase pair partial Sau3AI fragments of chromosomal DNA into the shuttle cosmid pYUB18 (30Belisle J.T. Pascopella L. Inamine J.M. Brennan P.J. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6991-6997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Following electroporation of M. smegmatis (31Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), the cells were diluted to a lowA 600 nm (0.010–0.030) and subjected to passage in 7H11 broth prior to plating on 7H11 agar while maintaining continuous selection with kanamycin, ManN, and GlcN. M. smegmatis transformed with pYUB18 alone was utilized as a control during the selection procedure. To ensure that ManN resistance (in the presence of GlcN) was conferred by the cosmid, putative ManN-resistant cosmids were electroduced to E. coli (32Baulard A. Jordan C. Mercenier A. Locht C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and purified with QIAGEN columns, and the phenotype was retested after electroporating into M. smegmatis. DNA sequencing was performed by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University) using an ABI Prism 377 Automated DNA Sequencer. DNA sequence comparisons were done by BLAST analysis (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Alignments of deduced amino acid sequences were performed using the MULTALIGN program. Standard PCR strategies (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Active recombinant PimB protein was partially purified using the pMAL fusion protein system (New England Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pimB gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XmnI site of pMAL-c2 to generate pMAL:pimB2, encoding a maltose-binding protein (MalE)-PimB fusion protein. E. coli TB1(pMAL:pimB2) was grown at 37 °C toA 600 ∼ 0.5 and then induced by the addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside with incubation at room temperature for 10–12 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in Buffer A, and frozen at −20 °C overnight. Cells were broken in a French pressure cell and centrifuged at 27,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto an amylose resin column, and the fusion protein eluted with Buffer A and maltose was concentrated 8-fold. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, followed by Western blotting using a ProTran membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) with anti-MalE antibodies (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Aliquots (∼500 μg of protein) either were used directly in the cell-free assay with [14C]PIM1 as the substrate or were first incubated at room temperature for 12–16 h with Factor Xa to cleave MalE from PimB. ManN (2-deoxy-2-amino-d-mannose) inhibits the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors in Trypanosoma by chain termination, forming ManN-Man-GlcN-PI that cannot be further mannosylated at the 2-position of ManN (36Ralton J.E.

This mode of action suggested that ManN might be a useful tool to study PIM biosynthesis in mycobacteria, and so it was applied to the cell-free system of Besraet al. (15Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B.

Dose-response curves showed decreasing incorporation of radiolabel from GDP-[14C]Man into total mannolipids with increasing ManN concentration, and TLC autoradiography (Fig.1 A), followed by scintillation counting of the relevant bands, indicated that ManN inhibited the synthesis of two mannolipids (designated mannolipid-1 and -2) as well as the higher PIMs (Fig. 1 B). ManN did not inhibit the synthesis of the PPMs (mannosyl-1-phosphoryldecaprenol (decaprenolphosphorylmannose (DPM), C50-P-Man) or mannosyl-1-phosphorylheptaprenol (heptaprenolphosphorylmannose (HPM), C35-P-Man)), which are the lipid carriers of Man that are involved in certain aspects of LAM biosynthesis (15Besra G.S.

Unlike the situation in trypanosomes, there was no evidence for the incorporation of ManN into any of these products when [14C]ManN was used in whole-cell radiolabeling experiments (see below). Mannolipid-1 and -2 were mild acid-stable and mild alkali-labile, indicating that they are members of the PIM family as opposed to PPMs. Both were also shown to contain the hexose Man by TLC analysis of the trifluoroacetic acid-hydrolyzed sugars in comparison with sugar standards. The chemical identities of mannolipid-1 and -2 were further determined by mass spectrometry. Direct FAB-MS analysis (Fig.2) of the isolated mannolipid-1 in negative ion mode afforded a major [M − H]− molecular ion at m/z 1251, whereas mannolipid-2 gave a molecular ion at m/z 1413, corresponding to a difference of one hexose increment from that of mannolipid-1.

https://openalex.org/W1975709396,"The signaling pathway for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) release in RAW 264.7 macrophages involves the protein kinase C and p38 activation pathways (Chen, C. C., Wang, J. K., and Lin, S. B. (1998) J. Immunol. 161, 6206–6214; Chen, C. C., and Wang, J. K. (1999) Mol. Pharmacol. 55, 481–488). In this study, the role of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was investigated. The PKA inhibitors, KT-5720 and H8, reduced LPS-induced NO release and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. The direct PKA activator, Bt2cAMP, caused concentration-dependent NO release and iNOS expression, as confirmed by immunofluorescence studies. The intracellular cAMP concentration did not increase until after 6 h of LPS treatment. Two cAMP-elevating agents, forskolin and cholera toxin, potentiated the LPS-induced NO release and iNOS expression. Stimulation of cells with LPS or Bt2cAMP for periods of 10 min to 24 h caused nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in the nuclei, as shown by detection of NF-κB-specific DNA-protein binding. The PKA inhibitor, H8, inhibited the NF-κB activation induced by 6- or 12-h treatment with LPS but not that induced after 1, 3, or 24 h. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, NS-398 and indomethacin, attenuated LPS-induced NO release, iNOS expression, and NF-κB DNA-protein complex formation. LPS induced COX-2 expression in a time-dependent manner, and prostaglandin E2production was induced in parallel. These results suggest that 6 h of treatment with LPS increases intracellular cAMP levels via COX-2 induction and prostaglandin E2 production, resulting in PKA activation, NF-κB activation, iNOS expression, and NO production. The signaling pathway for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) release in RAW 264.7 macrophages involves the protein kinase C and p38 activation pathways (Chen, C. C., Wang, J.

Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). NO and its metabolites mediate a number of host defense functions mediated by activated macrophages, including antimicrobial and tumoricidal activity, implicated in the pathogenesis of tissue damage associated with acute and chronic inflammation (2MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 3Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Macrophages generate NO from the guanidino moiety of l-arginine via a reaction catalyzed by the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (4Leone A.M. Palmer R.M. Knowles R.G. Francis P.L. Ashton D.S. Moncada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23790-23795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). iNOS has been identified in a wide variety of cell types including macrophages, mesangial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, chondrocytes, osteoclasts, and hepatocytes and can be induced by many immune stimuli (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in NO formation in iNOS-expressing cells usually correlate with similar changes in iNOS mRNA levels, indicating that a major part of iNOS regulation occurs at the transcription level. The promoter region of the iNOS gene contains several binding sites for transcriptional factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1, as well as for various members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein, and Stat families of transcriptional factors (6Lowenstein C.L. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Synder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Of these, the proteins of the NF-κB family appear to be essential for the enhanced iNOS gene expression seen in macrophages exposed to the active component of endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (7Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by binding to IκB but is released by signal induction and translocates to the nucleus, activating the responsive gene (8Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In macrophages, iNOS induction by LPS requires initiation of gene expression and de novo protein synthesis over a period of several hours (9Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The intracellular signaling pathways by which LPS causes iNOS expression in macrophages involve a series of events resulting in the transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane through the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where iNOS gene expression is up-regulated. Previous studies have shown that LPS first binds to LPS-binding protein and then to membrane CD14 and that it also activates phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine-PLC by tyrosine phosphorylation, thus causing PKC activation (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation also causes p38 activation (11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation processes result in stimulation of NF-κB DNA-protein binding and the initiation of iNOS expression and NO release (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An increase in intracellular cAMP levels is an important intracellular signaling mechanism involved in the regulation of gene expression. Certainin vitro studies have shown that an increase in cAMP levels causes iNOS induction (12Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Pulaski J.T. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nusing R.M. Klein T. Pfeilschifter J. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Hirokawa K. O'Shaughnessy K. Moore K. Ramrakha P. Wilkens M.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas in other studies, increased cAMP levels caused a reduction in iNOS (15Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Sigh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Mustafa S.B. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5073-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the intracellular signaling pathway for the LPS-induced increase in cAMP levels and its involvement in LPS-stimulated NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The results show that, after 6 h of treatment, LPS can increase cAMP levels by induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and formation of prostaglandin E2(PGE2), resulting in the activation of PKA and NF-κB, iNOS expression, and NO production. The PKA activation pathway explored in this study had a delayed onset (6 h), whereas the previously reported PKC and p38 activation pathways have rapid onsets (10 min) (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe effects of cAMP on iNOS expression have been of increasing interest since the first report that cAMP-elevating agents induced iNOS in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and that this induction was synergistic with that elicited by inflammatory cytokines (17Koide M. Kawahara Y. Nakayama I. Tsuda T. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24959-24966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar effects have also been seen in renal mesangial cells (13Nusing R.M. Klein T. Pfeilschifter J. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Klein T. Ullrich V. Pfeilschifter J. Nusing R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and brown adipocytes (19Nisoli E. Tonello C. Briscini L. Carruba M.O. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although cAMP alone does not induce iNOS in unstimulated cardiac myocytes, it augments iNOS induction in interleukin-1β-stimulated cells (20Oddis C.V. Simmons R.L. Hattler B.G. Finkel M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C429-C434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3 fibroblasts, different signaling pathways, including elevation of cAMP, lead to the induction of iNOS by NF-κB mediation (21Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Forstermann V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6039-6044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, elevation of cellular cAMP levels has been shown to down-regulate iNOS in LPS- or cytokine-activated astrocytes, hepatocytes, or Kuffer cells (15Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Sigh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Mustafa S.B. Olson M.S. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In RAW 264.7 macrophages, NF-κB/Rel is positively regulated by the cAMP cascade, thus helping to initiate iNOS gene expression in response to LPS stimulation, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase attenuates LPS-induced activation of iNOS gene expression (12Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Pulaski J.T. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that, in inducing iNOS expression in these cells, LPS acts by increasing cAMP levels. In the present study, the PKA inhibitors, KT-5720 and H8, inhibited LPS-induced NO release and iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the LPS effect is indeed related to the cAMP-PKA activation pathway. The cAMP analogue, Bt2cAMP, also increased NO release and iNOS expression; immunofluorescence staining also demonstrated iNOS expression in the cytoplasm. LPS caused a time-dependent increase in cAMP levels that was maximal with 6-h treatment and then declined. In J774 macrophages, the increase in cAMP levels occurs after 6 h of treatment with LPS (23Okada R. Nagao S. Harada Y. Xavier R.M. Nakamura M. Ishida T. Tanigawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 201-208Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and PKA is involved in the LPS-induced activation of junB and NF-κB (24Fujihara M. Muroi M. Mutio Y. Ito N. Sazuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14898-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), activation of NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complex formation was seen after 10-min to 24-h treatment with LPS, and a similar time course of activation of this complex was seen using Bt2cAMP (Fig. 7 B). In contrast with the inhibition seen using PKC or p38 inhibitors (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), when cells were pretreated for 30 min with H8, the NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complex formation seen after 1 h of LPS treatment was unaffected (Fig. 8 A). However, the complex formation seen after 6 h of LPS treatment was inhibited by H8, thus correlating with the maximal cAMP level seen after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 4 A). Thus, in contrast with the PKC and p38 activation pathways, which are rapid (10 min) (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the cAMP-PKA activation pathway is a delayed event in LPS-induced NF-κB activation. cAMP may modulate NF-κB activation and iNOS transcription via cAMP-dependent PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (25Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 4: 197-210Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In RAW cells, the rapid activation of NF-κB by PKC and p38 pathways, together with the delayed activation of NF-κB by the cAMP-PKA pathway, contributes to the LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO release.Because the cAMP-PKA activation pathway is a much delayed event (6 h) in LPS-induced NF-κB activation, the mechanism involved in LPS-induced increase in cAMP levels was further explored. Both NS-398 and indomethacin had an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NO release, iNOS expression, and NF-κB activation, indicating the involvement of COX-2 expression in LPS-stimulated NO release. When the effect of various periods of LPS treatment was studied, no COX-2 expression was seen in unstimulated cells or after 1 h of treatment, but COX-2 expression was seen after 3 h of treatment and continued to increase to 24 h. COX is a key enzyme in prostanoid synthesis, as it catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2, which is then metabolized by one or more terminal synthases to a variety of active prostanoids (26Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). It possesses both fatty acid cyclooxygenase activity and PG hydroperoxidase activity (converting PGG2 to PGH2). COX-2 is a COX isoform that is induced in a number of cells by proinflammatory stimuli and is thought to contribute to the generation of prostanoids at sites of inflammation (27Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dewitt D. Smith W.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); it is considered to be responsible for high production of PGs (29Otto J.C. Smith W.L. Cell. Signal. 1995; 12: 139-156Google Scholar). PGE2 production following LPS treatment was also measured, and the increases after 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h of treatment were, respectively, 2-, 11-, 45-, 85-, and 134-fold of basal levels, paralleling the increase in COX-2 expression. PGE2 acts via receptor-mediated generation of cAMP and activation of PKA (30Fournier T. Riches D.W.H. Winston B.W. Rose D.M. Young S.K. Noble P.W. Lake F.R. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2123-2133PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in a study on the effects of interleukin-1β on human bronchial smooth muscle cells (31Schmidlin F. Scherrer D. Daeffler L. Bertrand C. Landry Y. Gies J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1009-1015PubMed Google Scholar), in the present study, induction of PGE2 synthesis precedes the increase in cAMP, and PGE2 acts as an autocrine factor for adenylate cyclase activation. LPS-induced tumor cell killing in EC4 cells is also because of increased levels of cAMP, and this effect is inhibited by indomethacin (32Onodera S. Chem. Pharm. Bull. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 39: 991-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In peritoneal macrophages, LPS is reported to act via PGE2 to increase cAMP levels (33Raddassi K. Petit J.F. Lemaire G. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 149: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In summary, in RAW 264.7 cells, LPS increases iNOS expression via a prostanoid- and cAMP-dependent pathway, and this is followed by PKA activation of NF-κB. The increase in PGE2is because of COX-2 expression. This effect has a more delayed onset (6 h) compared with those involving the PKC and p38 activation pathways (10 min). A schematic representation of the signaling pathway for the LPS-induced NO release in RAW cells is shown in Fig.11. Nitric oxide (NO)1 has been identified as an important signaling molecule involved in regulating a wide range of biological activities in the neural, vascular, and immune systems (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar).

Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Synder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Of these, the proteins of the NF-κB family appear to be essential for the enhanced iNOS gene expression seen in macrophages exposed to the active component of endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (7Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by binding to IκB but is released by signal induction and translocates to the nucleus, activating the responsive gene (8Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In macrophages, iNOS induction by LPS requires initiation of gene expression and de novo protein synthesis over a period of several hours (9Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways by which LPS causes iNOS expression in macrophages involve a series of events resulting in the transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane through the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where iNOS gene expression is up-regulated. Previous studies have shown that LPS first binds to LPS-binding protein and then to membrane CD14 and that it also activates phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine-PLC by tyrosine phosphorylation, thus causing PKC activation (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation also causes p38 activation (11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation processes result in stimulation of NF-κB DNA-protein binding and the initiation of iNOS expression and NO release (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An increase in intracellular cAMP levels is an important intracellular signaling mechanism involved in the regulation of gene expression. Certainin vitro studies have shown that an increase in cAMP levels causes iNOS induction (12Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Pulaski J.T. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nusing R.M. Klein T. Pfeilschifter J. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Hirokawa K. O'Shaughnessy K. Moore K. Ramrakha P. Wilkens M.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas in other studies, increased cAMP levels caused a reduction in iNOS (15Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Sigh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Mustafa S.B. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5073-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the intracellular signaling pathway for the LPS-induced increase in cAMP levels and its involvement in LPS-stimulated NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The results show that, after 6 h of treatment, LPS can increase cAMP levels by induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and formation of prostaglandin E2(PGE2), resulting in the activation of PKA and NF-κB, iNOS expression, and NO production. The PKA activation pathway explored in this study had a delayed onset (6 h), whereas the previously reported PKC and p38 activation pathways have rapid onsets (10 min) (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe effects of cAMP on iNOS expression have been of increasing interest since the first report that cAMP-elevating agents induced iNOS in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and that this induction was synergistic with that elicited by inflammatory cytokines (17Koide M. Kawahara Y. Nakayama I. Tsuda T. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24959-24966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar effects have also been seen in renal mesangial cells (13Nusing R.M. Klein T. Pfeilschifter J. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Klein T. Ullrich V. Pfeilschifter J. Nusing R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and brown adipocytes (19Nisoli E. Tonello C. Briscini L. Carruba M.O. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although cAMP alone does not induce iNOS in unstimulated cardiac myocytes, it augments iNOS induction in interleukin-1β-stimulated cells (20Oddis C.V. Simmons R.L. Hattler B.G. Finkel M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C429-C434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3 fibroblasts, different signaling pathways, including elevation of cAMP, lead to the induction of iNOS by NF-κB mediation (21Kleinert H. Euchenhofer C. Ihrig-Biedert I. Forstermann V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6039-6044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, elevation of cellular cAMP levels has been shown to down-regulate iNOS in LPS- or cytokine-activated astrocytes, hepatocytes, or Kuffer cells (15Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T. Sigh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7786-7791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Mustafa S.B. Olson M.S. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In RAW 264.7 macrophages, NF-κB/Rel is positively regulated by the cAMP cascade, thus helping to initiate iNOS gene expression in response to LPS stimulation, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase attenuates LPS-induced activation of iNOS gene expression (12Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Pulaski J.T. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that, in inducing iNOS expression in these cells, LPS acts by increasing cAMP levels. In the present study, the PKA inhibitors, KT-5720 and H8, inhibited LPS-induced NO release and iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the LPS effect is indeed related to the cAMP-PKA activation pathway. The cAMP analogue, Bt2cAMP, also increased NO release and iNOS expression; immunofluorescence staining also demonstrated iNOS expression in the cytoplasm. LPS caused a time-dependent increase in cAMP levels that was maximal with 6-h treatment and then declined. In J774 macrophages, the increase in cAMP levels occurs after 6 h of treatment with LPS (23Okada R. Nagao S. Harada Y. Xavier R.M. Nakamura M. Ishida T. Tanigawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 201-208Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and PKA is involved in the LPS-induced activation of junB and NF-κB (24Fujihara M. Muroi M. Mutio Y. Ito N. Sazuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14898-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), activation of NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complex formation was seen after 10-min to 24-h treatment with LPS, and a similar time course of activation of this complex was seen using Bt2cAMP (Fig. 7 B). In contrast with the inhibition seen using PKC or p38 inhibitors (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), when cells were pretreated for 30 min with H8, the NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complex formation seen after 1 h of LPS treatment was unaffected (Fig. 8 A). However, the complex formation seen after 6 h of LPS treatment was inhibited by H8, thus correlating with the maximal cAMP level seen after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 4 A). Thus, in contrast with the PKC and p38 activation pathways, which are rapid (10 min) (10Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the cAMP-PKA activation pathway is a delayed event in LPS-induced NF-κB activation. cAMP may modulate NF-κB activation and iNOS transcription via cAMP-dependent PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (25Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 4: 197-210Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In RAW cells, the rapid activation of NF-κB by PKC and p38 pathways, together with the delayed activation of NF-κB by the cAMP-PKA pathway, contributes to the LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO release.Because the cAMP-PKA activation pathway is a much delayed event (6 h) in LPS-induced NF-κB activation, the mechanism involved in LPS-induced increase in cAMP levels was further explored. Both NS-398 and indomethacin had an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NO release, iNOS expression, and NF-κB activation, indicating the involvement of COX-2 expression in LPS-stimulated NO release. When the effect of various periods of LPS treatment was studied, no COX-2 expression was seen in unstimulated cells or after 1 h of treatment, but COX-2 expression was seen after 3 h of treatment and continued to increase to 24 h. COX is a key enzyme in prostanoid synthesis, as it catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2, which is then metabolized by one or more terminal synthases to a variety of active prostanoids (26Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). It possesses both fatty acid cyclooxygenase activity and PG hydroperoxidase activity (converting PGG2 to PGH2). COX-2 is a COX isoform that is induced in a number of cells by proinflammatory stimuli and is thought to contribute to the generation of prostanoids at sites of inflammation (27Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dewitt D. Smith W.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); it is considered to be responsible for high production of PGs (29Otto J.C. Smith W.L. Cell. Signal. 1995; 12: 139-156Google Scholar). PGE2 production following LPS treatment was also measured, and the increases after 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h of treatment were, respectively, 2-, 11-, 45-, 85-, and 134-fold of basal levels, paralleling the increase in COX-2 expression. PGE2 acts via receptor-mediated generation of cAMP and activation of PKA (30Fournier T. Riches D.W.H. Winston B.W. Rose D.M. Young S.K. Noble P.W. Lake F.R. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2123-2133PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in a study on the effects of interleukin-1β on human bronchial smooth muscle cells (31Schmidlin F. Scherrer D. Daeffler L. Bertrand C. Landry Y. Gies J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1009-1015PubMed Google Scholar), in the present study, induction of PGE2 synthesis precedes the increase in cAMP, and PGE2 acts as an autocrine factor for adenylate cyclase activation. LPS-induced tumor cell killing in EC4 cells is also because of increased levels of cAMP, and this effect is inhibited by indomethacin (32Onodera S. Chem. Pharm. Bull. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 39: 991-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In peritoneal macrophages, LPS is reported to act via PGE2 to increase cAMP levels (33Raddassi K. Petit J.F. Lemaire G. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 149: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In summary, in RAW 264.7 cells, LPS increases iNOS expression via a prostanoid- and cAMP-dependent pathway, and this is followed by PKA activation of NF-κB. The increase in PGE2is because of COX-2 expression. This effect has a more delayed onset (6 h) compared with those involving the PKC and p38 activation pathways (10 min).

This interaction is obligatory to relieve the inhibition of strong, force-generating actin-myosin interactions. We have determined intersite distances in the N-terminal domain of cardiac TnC (cTnC) by fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements and found negligible increases in these distances when the single regulatory site is saturated with Ca2+. However, in the presence of bound cardiac TnI (cTnI), activator Ca2+induces significant increases in the distances and a substantial opening of the N-domain. This open conformation within the cTnC·cTnI complex has properties favorable for the Ca2+-induced interaction with an additional segment of cTnI. Thus, the binding of cTnI to cTnC is a prerequisite to achieve a Ca2+-induced open N-domain similar to that previously observed in fsTnC with no bound fsTnI. This role of cardiac TnI has not been previously recognized.

Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Troponin is a heterotrimer. The subunit TnC1 binds Ca2+, TnI binds actin and inhibits actomyosin ATPase in relaxed muscle, and troponin T anchors the three-subunit complex to tropomyosin on the actin filament. These proteins form the thin filament. Strong force-generating interactions between myosin and actin are initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory sites located in the N-terminal regulatory domain of TnC. The binding of activator Ca2+ to TnC weakens or breaks the interaction between TnI and actin, thus releasing the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase and initiating force generation. The crystal structure of TnC from avian fast skeletal muscle TnC shows a dumbbell-shaped molecule with the N- and C-terminal segments folded into two globular domains connected by a long α-helical central helix (2Herzberg O.

The five helices in the N-domain are labeled the N-helix and helices A–D, starting from the N terminus (Fig. 1). The four helices in the C-domain are labeled helices E–H, starting from the C-terminal end of the central helix. The N-domain of fast skeletal TnC has two Ca2+-specific sites (sites I and II), which bind Ca2+ with a low affinity (K a ∼ 105m−1) and the C-domain has two high affinity Ca2+ sites (K a ∼ 107m−1), which also bind Mg2+ competitively (K a ∼ 103m−1). The two sites in the N-domain are the regulatory sites. Site I consists of the helix A-loop-helix B and site II the helix C-loop-helix D motif. Sites III and IV in the C-domain are believed to play a structural role and are occupied by Mg2+ under physiological conditions in relaxed muscle. Site I in cardiac TnC is inactive in chelating Ca2+due to substitutions of two critical amino acids and an insertion in the binding loop; saturation of site II by Ca2+ is sufficient to trigger contraction in cardiac muscle (4Putkey J.A. Liu W. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14881-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of fsTnC contains two bound Ca2+ ions in the C-domain and no bound cation in the N-domain. Based on the structure of the C-domain, an early computer model (5Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (the HMJ model) suggests that Ca2+ binding to the regulatory sites induces reorientations of the B and C helices relative to the A and D helices, thus exposing a hydrophobic patch located in the B helix (see Fig. 1). The exposed hydrophobic patch in this open conformation becomes available for the Ca2+-dependent interaction with TnI. This model also has been used to interpret functional and drug binding properties of cardiac TnC. Two types of spectroscopic studies have been reported to verify the HMJ model for fsTnC. A recent solution NMR study of the recombinant N-terminal fragment of fsTnC provides evidence for a Ca2+-induced open conformation in which the B and C helices move away from the A and D helices (6Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We recently reported a fluorescence resonance energy transfer study of recombinant full-length fsTnC mutants in which the distributions of the distances between specific sites were determined (7She M. Xing J. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated large Ca2+-induced increases in the mean distances between residues 22 and 52 and between residues 90 and 52, indicating an open N-domain conformation in the holo-fsTnC state. The FRET data also showed a decrease in the half-width of the distributions of the distances in the presence of activator Ca2+, suggesting that the calcium-loaded open domain is highly constrained. The constrained conformation may be an important structural feature that allows a segment of fsTnI to interact with the exposed hydrophobic pocket in the B helix (7She M. Xing J. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequences of cardiac TnC and fsTnC are about 70% identical. Most of the amino acid substitutions are in the N-domain including site I. Do these differences require a different mechanism for Ca2+activation of cardiac muscle? In a preliminary FRET study (8Gong Z. Xing J. Chandra M. Dong W,-J. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A51Google Scholar), we showed that the N-domain of cTnC experienced a significant Ca2+-induced closed ⇄ open transition only in the presence of bound cTnI. This was the first demonstration that bound cTnI is required for Ca2+-induced opening of the N-domain conformation of cTnC. We report here details of this transition in cTnC observed with the complex cTnC·cTnI and with cTnC in the presence of fragments of cTnI. The results provide insights into the structural consequence of the binding of activator Ca2+ to cTnC and to cTnC in its complex with cTnI. A cDNA encoding full-length TnC of chicken slow muscle was isolated from a λgt10 cDNA library derived from embryonic chicken breast muscle cells (9Lin Z.Y. Dechesne C.A. Eldrige J. Peterson B.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 986-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The sequence of this clone is identical to the sequence of the cDNA for cardiac TnC, and this clone was used for construction and expression of recombinant cTnC and cTnC mutants. The clone was first subcloned into a pAlter vector (Promega), and the pAlter mutagenesis kit was used to generate a cysteineless double mutant C35S/C84S. It was necessary to remove the two endogenous cysteines in order to obtain mutants with single cysteine in desired locations. This full-length double mutant was cleaved with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pET-3d vector (Novagen). This pET-3d plasmid containing the complete coding sequence of the TnC double mutant was used as a template to generate three single-tryptophan mutants containing the initial double mutations. These mutants were used to generate three final mutants each containing a single tryptophan and a single cysteine at desired locations: 1) F12W/N51C/C35S/C84S (12W/51C), 2) F20W/N51C/C35S/C84S (20W/51C), and 3) F20W/S89C/C35S/C84S (20W/89C). The locations of the two tryptophans and the two cysteines are indicated in the NMR structure shown in Fig.1 A. The sequences of the cDNA clones were verified by sequence analysis. To express cTnC and cTnC mutants, the appropriate pET-3d plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and expressed under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Subsequent steps and purification of expressed proteins were as described before for skeletal TnC (10She M. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A tryptophanless cTnI mutant (W192C) and the N- and C-terminal fragments of cTnI were generated and characterized using the same method described previously (11Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 6745-6753Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The identity of the expressed proteins was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. The single cysteine in cTnC mutants was labeled with the fluorescence probe 1,5-IAEDANS under denatured conditions (11Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 6745-6753Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the labeled protein was subsequently renatured. The degree of labeling was found to be >95%. Peptides with sequences corresponding to segments of the C-terminal half of cTnI were synthesized as C-terminal amides using solid-state synthesis, by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a PerSeptive 9050 peptide synthesizer, withO-pentafluorophenyl ester amino acids activated with 1-hydroxyl-7-azabenzotriazole. Synthesized peptides were purified by reverse phase-HPLC, the purity of the products was checked by analytical reverse phase-HPLC, and the identity of the peptides was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. Myofibrillar ATPase assay was carried out with freshly prepared myofibrils from a rat heart. Endogenous cTnC was extracted at 4 °C from the myofibrils by a method slightly modified from that of Morimoto and Ohtsuki (12Moritmoto S Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 101: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The extraction solution containing CDTA included both pepstatin (1 μg/ml) and leupeptin (5 μg/ml), and the washing solution also included both pepstatin and leupeptin at 0.5 mg/ml. Reconstitution of cTnC-depleted myofibrils was done by incubation of the myofibrils (∼1 mg/ml) with exogenous cTnC (∼2–3 mg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by at least three washings. The ATPase activity was determined from measurement of the release of inorganic phosphate (4Putkey J.A. Liu W. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14881-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a total volume of 1 ml. The assay mixture also included 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin. The Ca2+-activated activity was determined at pCa 4. The binary complex cTnC·cTnI was prepared from cTnC mutants and the tryptophanless cTnI mutant, following our previous procedure (13Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19229-19235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the AEDANS-labeled cTnC was incubated with a large excess of cTnI in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS at pH 7.2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm Ca2+, and 6 murea. The solution was then dialyzed against the same buffer containing 3 m urea and 1 m KCl. The urea and KCl concentrations were subsequently reduced stepwise by changing the dialysate to the final solution containing 50 mm MOPS at pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1m KCl. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20 ± 0.1 °C on an ISS PC1 photon-counting spectrofluorometer, using a band pass of 3 nm on both the excitation and emission sides. Emission spectra were corrected for variation of the detector system with wavelength. The quantum yield of tryptophan in proteins was determined by the comparative method as in previous work (14She M. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1042-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For Ca2+ titration, the tryptophan was excited at 295 nm and the emission was detected at 331 nm. A standard Ca2+ solution (Orion) was used in Ca2+titration experiments (13Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19229-19235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). EGTA was used to control the level of free Ca2+ , which was calculated using known stability constants of the chelator for cations and proton (15Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity decay and anisotropy decay were measured at 20 ± 0.1 °C in the time domain with either a PRA 3000 single-photon lifetime spectrometer equipped with a rhodamine 6G dye laser cavity dumped and synchronously pumped by a mode-locked argon ion laser (14She M. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1042-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or an IBH 5000 photon-counting lifetime system equipped with a very stable flash lamp operated at 40 kHz in 0.5 atm of hydrogen. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm and the emission wavelength was 333 nm for tryptophan and the corresponding wavelengths for the acceptor were 330 and 480 nm, respectively. For FRET studies, the donor was the single tryptophan and the acceptor was the extrinsic fluorophore AEDANS covalently linked to the cysteine. The intensity decay data of the donor collected from the donor-alone and donor-acceptor samples were used to calculate the distribution of the intersite distances as in our previous work (7She M. Xing J. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All measurements, both steady-state and time-resolved, were made in 50 mmMOPS at pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Mg2+, unless stated otherwise. Since the main concern of this work is on the biochemical states of the regulatory N-domain of cTnC, cTnC, and cTnC·cTnI samples studied in these solution conditions are referred to as in the apo state. When Ca2+ was present, it was at pCa 4; cTnC and cTnC·cTnI at this pCa are referred to as in the holo state. The three single-tryptophan cTnC mutants were tested for their ability to confer Ca2+activation in myofibrillar ATPase and to bind Ca2+ in the N-domain. These results are shown in TableI. All three mutants showed Ca2+-activated ATPase activities comparable to control. Ca2+ titration was carried out on two mutants (20W/51C and 20W/89C) that showed adequate changes in tryptophan fluorescence during the titration (titration curves not shown). Also carried out were the Ca2+ titration of the two cTnC mutants complexed with cTnI. A single binding constant was recovered in all four sets of titration data. These binding constants are very close to those which we previously reported (13Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Rosenfeld S.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19229-19235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for isolated cTnC and the complex cTnC·cTnI and indicate that the mutations had little or no adverse effects on the functions of the cTnC mutants.Table ICharacterization of cTnC mutantsProteinRelative ATPase activityK a × 10−5pCa0.5m −1Control100cTnC(12W/51C)103cTnC(20W/51C)834.715.56cTnC(20W/89C)955.985.7820W/51C + cTnI19.76.2920W/89C + cTnI18.66.27The specific ATPase activity of control myofibrils was 58 and 161 nmol of Pi/min/mg of fibril protein in the presence of Mg2+and Ca2+ (pCa 4), respectively.

The single-tryptophan cTnC mutants were studied by the steady-state and time-resolved methods. These results are summarized in TableII. The single tryptophan in one mutant was Trp12 and the tryptophan in the other two mutants was Trp20. Trp12 showed a moderately high quantum, which was insensitive to the binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory site. Its intensity decay was biexponential, and the weighted mean lifetime increased slightly in the holo state. In the apo-cTnC·cTnI complex, its quantum yield increased 30% with a negligible effect on the mean lifetime. Ca2+ binding did not affect the quantum yield much, but increased the mean lifetime by 0.5 ns.Table IITryptophan fluorescence properties of cTnC mutantsMutantStateλmaxQLifetimeτ1τ2〈τ〉nmns12W/51CApo331.60.282.47 (0.58)4.60 (0.42)3.69Holo331.60.292.57 (0.50)4.71 (0.50)3.9512W/51C + cTnIApo332.80.372.23 (0.51)4.83 (0.49)3.99Holo331.00.352.96 (0.69)5.83 (0.31)4.2420W/51CApo331.00.344.41 (1.0)4.41Holo331.30.292.43 (0.16)4.33 (0.84)4.1620W/51C + cTnIApo330.10.334.39 (1.0)4.39Holo329.20.383.03 (0.49)5.36 (0.51)4.5420W/89CApo331.30.354.43 (1.0)4.43Holo331.00.302.91 (0.42)4.87 (0.58)4.2920W/89C + cTnIApo330.30.304.41 (1.0)4.41Holo328.60.393.52 (0.71)6.07 (0.29)4.58Protein concentration was 1–2 μm.

As expected, the properties of Trp20 were very similar in both mutants, indicating that mutations N51C and C89S had negligible effects on the tertiary structural environment of Trp20. In the apo state of both isolated mutants and the cTnC·cTnI complexes, Trp20 had a very similar and high quantum yield (0.34–0.35) and its intensity decay was single-exponential. The binding of activator Ca2+ to the regulatory site reduced the quantum yield 15–20% and resulted in a biexponential intensity decay with a mean lifetime slightly shorter than the single lifetime in the apo state. Formation of an apo complex with cTnI did not change the quantum yield or the intensity decay pattern, but in the holo complex the quantum yield increased about 15% with a mean lifetime of the two decay components increasing slightly. These results suggested that cTnI did not perturb the local environment of Trp20 in the apo complex, but Ca2+ binding to the complex shifted the Trp20 environment to a slightly less accessible environment. The high quantum yield, the single exponential intensity decay in the apo state, and the effect of Ca2+ on the spectral characteristics parallel those previously reported for the equivalent Trp22 in fast skeletal TnC (14She M. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1042-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Molecular graphics and other results suggested that Trp22 is highly inaccessible to solvent in the apo state and becomes partially exposed in the holo state (10She M. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14She M. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1042-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Trp20 in cTnC appears to have structural environments similar to those of Trp22 in fsTnC in the two biochemical states. Fig.2 shows the steady-state emission spectra of the cTnC mutants (panels A–C) and these mutants in the presence of cTnI (panels A′–C′). The major band in the 330-nm region is the donor emission, and the other band in the 480-nm region is the sensitized acceptor emission. In the absence of bound cTnI, Ca2+ induced small to negligible increases in the donor intensity and small reciprocal decreases in the acceptor intensity (changes from curve 1 tocurve 2) for all three samples. These changes suggested small to negligible decreases in energy transfer for the three donor-acceptor pairs. By contrast, Ca2+ induced a considerably larger enhancement of the donor emission and decrease of the sensitized acceptor fluorescence for the two mutants 12W/51C and 20W/51C bound to cTnI (panels A′ andB′). These changes suggested significant decreases in energy transfer and, therefore, increases in the two distances induced by Ca2+ within the cTnC·cTnI complex. The Ca2+effect on the third mutant 20W/89C complexed with cTnI (panel C′) was less pronounced than on the other samples. These steady-state spectra were used to calculate the intersite separations (r) for the three distances (TableIII).Table IIIIntersite distances in cTnC mutantsDistanceStaterr̄hwχR2Distance changeNMR distanceÅÅÅÅÅTrp20–Cys51Apo cTnC15.915.72.81.03(16.5)(2.37)Holo cTnC16.716.52.11.05+0.816.0(15.7)(2.16)Apo complex17.215.43.51.17(18.0)(12.3)Holo complex21.121.93.31.05+6.521.4(18.0)(9.89)Trp12–Cys51Apo cTnC19.418.94.71.09(21.0)(3.11)Holo cTnC20.921.04.71.01+2.121.6(19.0)(2.78)Apo complex19.819.32.91.03(22.0)(14.1)Holo complex25.525.85.11.17+6.529.1(22.0)(12.7)Trp20–Cys89Apo cTnC19.619.48.31.19Holo cTnC18.118.68.41.06−0.818.3Apo complex18.919.26.61.01(8.0)3.36Holo complex20.721.64.30.97+2.418.7(6.0)(4.21)The three indicated distances were determined with both isolated cTnC mutants and the complex (cTnC mutant)-cTnI in both the apo and holo states. r is the inter-site distance determined by the steady-state intensity method, r̄ is the mean inter-site distance recovered from the distribution of the distances, and hw is the half-width of the distribution.

Time-resolved data are needed to recover the distribution of the distances for each donor-acceptor pair. The intensity decay curves of the tryptophan in the isolated mutants are shown in Fig.3 (panels A–C); the corresponding decay curves of the mutants complexed with cTnI are shown in the adjacent panels (A′–C′). These data were quantified and displayed in Fig. 4 as a distribution of the distances for each donor-acceptor pair. The transition of cTnC from the apo state to the holo state (Fig. 4,curves 1 to 2) was accompanied by a very small shift of the distribution toward longer distances for the distance Trp20–Cys51. The distributions for apo-cTnC (curve 1) and the apo-cTnC·cTnI complex (curve 3) were very similar. However, the transition of the complex from the apo state (curve 3) to the holo state (curve 4) was accompanied by a large shift of the distribution with the mean distance (- r) increasing by 6.5 Å. For the distance Trp12–Cys51, Ca2+ induced a small increase in - r (2.1 Å) in unbound cTnC and a larger increase (6.5 Å) in the complex. These distributions were relatively narrow with values of the half-width in the range of 2.1–3.5 Å for the distance Trp20–Cys51 and 3–5 Å for the distance Trp12–Cys51. The observed increases in the mean values of the two distances are comparable to those detected with isolated apo skeletal TnC. These results provide direct evidence for a Ca2+-induced opening of the regulatory N-domain of cTnC only when it is bound to cTnI. The distance parameters and other relevant information are listed in TableIII. The distance derived from the steady state measurements (r) are in excellent agreement with the mean distance (- r) derived from the distributions. Also listed in the table are the separations of the Cα carbon atoms between the donor and acceptor residues from the NMR structure.Figure 4Area-normalized distribution of inte"

Specific activation of the AT2 receptor during 4-day treatment induced two major morphological changes. The first was characterized by increased elongation of neurites. The second change was cell migration from the edge of the microexplant toward the periphery. Western blot analyses and indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed an increase in the expression of neuron-specific βIII-tubulin, as well as an increase in expression of the microtubule-associated proteins tau and MAP2. These effects were demonstrated by co-incubation of Ang II with 1 μm DUP 753 (AT1 receptor antagonist) or with 10 nm CGP 42112 (AT2 receptor agonist) but abolished when Ang II was co-incubated with 1 μm PD 123319 (AT2 receptor antagonist), indicating that differentiation occurs through AT2 receptor activation and that the AT1 receptor inhibits the AT2 effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Ang II is involved in cerebellum development for both neurite outgrowth and cell migration, two important processes in the organization of the various layers of the cerebellum.

The second change was cell migration from the edge of the microexplant toward the periphery. Western blot analyses and indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed an increase in the expression of neuron-specific βIII-tubulin, as well as an increase in expression of the microtubule-associated proteins tau and MAP2. These effects were demonstrated by co-incubation of Ang II with 1 μm DUP 753 (AT1 receptor antagonist) or with 10 nm CGP 42112 (AT2 receptor agonist) but abolished when Ang II was co-incubated with 1 μm PD 123319 (AT2 receptor antagonist), indicating that differentiation occurs through AT2 receptor activation and that the AT1 receptor inhibits the AT2 effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Ang II is involved in cerebellum development for both neurite outgrowth and cell migration, two important processes in the organization of the various layers of the cerebellum. angiotensin II 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid glial fibrillary acidic protein microtubule-associated protein A large number of studies indicate that the hormone angiotensin II (Ang II)1 and its receptors are present in the brain (1Lenkei Z. Palkovits M. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 18: 383-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson A. Washburn D. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 54: 169-192Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As in the periphery, the AT1 receptor exhibits a high affinity for the nonpeptidic antagonist DUP 753 (Losartan), whereas the AT2 receptor has a high affinity for the antagonist PD 123319 and the agonist CGP 42112 (1Lenkei Z. Palkovits M. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 18: 383-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson A. Washburn D. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 54: 169-192Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the AT1 receptors are detected in areas involved in the regulation of blood pressure, hydromineral balance, and thirst, no central function has yet been attributed to the AT2 receptor. This receptor is highly expressed in the inferior olive, locus coeruleus, thalamic nuclei, medial geniculate nuclei, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum (3Tsutsumi K. Saavedra J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R209-R216PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jöhren O. Inagami T. Saavedra J. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2549-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Lenkei Z. Palkovits M. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 373: 322-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although several studies have been conducted on the short term effect of AT2 receptor activation on intracellular events, a few studies focused on the physiological function of the AT2receptor. One well described function is its antagonistic action on cellular growth induced by neurotrophic factors (nerve growth factor) (6Tsuzuki S. Eguchi S. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Meffert S. Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Bottari S.P. Unger T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) or by the AT1 receptor of Ang II (8Stoll M. Steckelings M. Paul M. Bottari S. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nakajima M. Hutchinson H. Fujinaga M. Hayashida W. Morishita R. Zhang L. Horiuchi M. Pratt R. Dzau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another function recently described for the AT2 receptor is a role in programmed cell death (11Tanaka M. Ohnishi J. Ozawa Y. Sugimoto M. Usuki S. Naruse M. Murakami K. Miyazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Pratt R. Dzau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the expression of the AT1 receptor either remains stable or increases with development in rats, the expression and density of the AT2 receptor decrease dramatically with maturation from fetal to neonatal to adult, both at the periphery and in several brain nuclei (13Millan M.A. Jacobowitz D.M.

This high and transient expression of the AT2 receptor in fetal tissues suggests that it may play a specific role during development and cellular differentiation (7Meffert S. Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Bottari S.P. Unger T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Tanaka M. Ohnishi J. Ozawa Y. Sugimoto M. Usuki S. Naruse M. Murakami K.

Indeed, in a previous study, using neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid NG108–15 cells, we have shown that a 3-day treatment with Ang II or CGP 42112 induced neurite outgrowth characterized by an increase in the level of polymerized tubulin and in the association of the microtubule-associated protein MAP2c with microtubules (18Laflamme L. De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed in PC12W cells, with a decrease in another microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B (7Meffert S. Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Bottari S.P. Unger T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and an increase in the association of MAP2 with microtubules (19Stroth U. Meffert S. Gallinat S. Unger T. Mol. Brain. Res. 1998; 53: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well as with an increase in the neurofilament middle subunit NF-M (20Gallinat S. Csikos T. Meffert S. Herdegen T. Stoll M. Unger T. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 9: 29-32Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Neuronal development and differentiation of the cerebellum involve several steps including proliferation (in the ventricular zone), migration (through the ventricular zone to the cortical zone), and finally either neurite extension or apoptosis, once the cells have reached their specific location (21Cambray-Deakin M. Morgan A. Burgoyne R. Dev. Brain Res. 1987; 37: 197-207Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Komuro H. Rakic P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 15: 1478-1490Crossref Google Scholar). Each of these steps is controlled by several local environmental cues, such as components of the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules (23Rocamora N. Garcia-Ladona F. Palacios J. Mengod G. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 17: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24Goldowitz D. Hamre K. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that the molecular identity of all of the regulators is yet to be determined. In particular, despite the studies conducted on neuronal cell lines (see above), so far there have been no studies on the long term effect of Ang II on either neuronal differentiation or neuronal development of specific brain areas. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the AT1 and AT2 receptors on neurite outgrowth and on the pattern of expression of tubulin as well as of tau and MAP2, two important microtubule-associated proteins, in primary cultures of neonatal rat cerebellar neurons. The cerebellum was chosen for several reasons: 1) Ang II as well as both AT1 and AT2 receptors are present throughout cerebellar development (3Tsutsumi K. Saavedra J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R209-R216PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsutsumi K. Strömberg C. Viswanathan M. Saavedra J.M.

Häuser W. Saavedra J. Brain Res. 1998; 793: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Ang II in this brain structure (26Jöhren O. Häuser W. Saavedra J. Brain Res. 1998; 793: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Erdmann B. Fuxe K. Ganten D. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 2) Differentiation of cerebellar granule cells occurs mostly during the postnatal period (21Cambray-Deakin M. Morgan A. Burgoyne R. Dev. Brain Res. 1987; 37: 197-207Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Burgoyne R. Cambray-Deakin M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2311-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), implicating both cell migration from the molecular layer to the Purkinje cell layer and neurite elongation (22Komuro H. Rakic P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 15: 1478-1490Crossref Google Scholar). 3) The juvenile and adult forms of tau and MAP2 are differentially expressed during maturation of this brain area and may serve as markers of the state of neuronal maturation (29Binder L.I. Kim H. Caceres A. Payne M.R. Rebhun L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5613-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30Burgoyne R. Cumming R. Neuroscience. 1984; 11: 157-167Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The chemicals used in the present study were obtained from the following sources. Angiotensin II was from Bachem (Marina Delphen, CA); glutamine, neurobasal medium, and B27 supplement were from Life Technologies, Inc. CGP 42112, DUP 753, and PD 123319 were synthesized at Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), and anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin and enhanced chemiluminescence detection system were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; anti-GFAP, anti-neurofilament NE-14, anti-βIII-tubulin, and the monoclonal antibody HM-2, which recognizes all MAP2 isoforms, were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal tau antibody 5E2 was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Kosik (Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and tau 1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Lester Binder (Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL). Ang II was iodinated in the laboratory of Dr. Gaetan Guillemette (Department of Pharmacology, University of Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada). Vectashield mounting medium was from Vector Laboratories (Berlingame, CA). All other chemicals were of A grade purity. Primary cultures of mixed cerebellar cells were prepared from the methodology described by Moonenet al. (31Moonen G. Neale E. Macdonald R. Gibbs W. Nelson P. Brain Res. 1982; 281: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cerebelli (10–12/culture) from Long Evans rats at postnatal day 3 were isolated and mechanically dissociated in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mm glutamine. The suspension was centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was suspended in the same medium and plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm Petri dish, precoated with poly-l-lysine. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, at 37 °C. 24 h after plating, cells were treated for 4 consecutive days without (control cells) or with CGP 42112, the AT2 receptor agonist (10 nm), or with Ang II (100 nm) alone or in the presence of DUP 753, an AT1 receptor antagonist (1 μm), or PD 123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist (1 μm) and were used on the 6th day. Ang II binding studies were conducted on cells cultured for 6 days according to the methodology previously described (18Laflamme L. De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Density of Ang II receptor subtypes were identified as total binding sensitivity toward the AT1 and AT2 receptor analogs. Preparations enriched in microtubules were obtained from cells cultured for 6 days in 35-mm Petri dishes as described by Solomon (32Solomon F. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with slight modifications described previously (18Laflamme L. De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The cells were pretreated with 1 μm Taxol (Sigma) for 2 h before extraction of microtubules. At this concentration Taxol stabilizes microtubules without promoting polymerization. The culture medium was then aspirated and replaced by PM2G buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 2 mglycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.04 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 6.9) containing Taxol (1 μm). After collection and centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min at 37 °C), the cell pellet was extracted with PM2G buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μm Taxol (15 min incubation at 37 °C). After centrifugation, the resulting pellet (containing microtubules) was solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer (Tris buffer 62.5 mm, pH 6.8 containing 2% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. For total cell extracts, cells grown in 35-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with HBS buffer 13. mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmNaHCo3, 5 mm HEPES, scraped, and solubilized as described above. Heat-stable cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (33Smith C. Anderton B. Davis D. Gallo J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped in HBS, immediately boiled for 5 min, and centrifugated (20,000 × g for 20 min). Supernatants containing MAPs were diluted 1:1 in 2× sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Brain preparations enriched in MAPs were also obtained from postnatal day 13 and adult rats. Samples from equivalent number of cells were compared in each experiment. Samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Membranes were blocked with 1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS buffer (pH 7.5). After washing with TBS-Tween 20 (0.05%), membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-β-tubulin (1:500), anti-βIII-tubulin (1:400), tau 1 antibody (1:1000), 5E2 antibody (1:1000), or HM-2 antibody (1:500), diluted in TBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) plus bovine serum albumin (0.1%). After washing with TBS-Tween 20, detection was accomplished using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Immunoreactivity was quantified by densitometry with ImageQuant software and expressed as arbitrary units. The anti-GFAP antibody was used as glial marker, whereas NE-14 and anti-βIII-tubulin antibodies were used as neuronal markers. Cells were washed twice with HBS, then fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Cells were then rehydrated and incubated with anti-βIII-tubulin (1:40), anti-GFAP (1:20), and NE-14 (1:20) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated (1 h at room temperature) with an anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:30). After washing, slides were mounted in Vectashield and examined on a Nikon DM 400 microscope equipped for epifluorescence using a B-1E fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Nikon, Melville, NY). To determine cell migration, nuclear DNA staining was performed using propidium iodine as described previously (34Johnson J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 243-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were washed twice with HBS buffer, fixed with methanol (10 min at −20 °C), rehydrated (for 10 min), and incubated with propidium iodine (1 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing, slides were examined using a G-2A orange range filter set. To quantify cell migration, 12 consecutive rings (multiple of approximately 50 μm), beginning at the edge of the microexplant, were drawn. The distances traveled by the cells were defined as the percentage of cells located in a precise ring over the total number of cells from the first to the last ring. The percentage of cells that had exhibited migration was calculated as the total number of cells located from the second (first stage of migration) to the last ring, over the total number of cells. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using Studentt test, and p values were obtained from Dunnett's tables. n indicates the number of experiments, each performed in triplicate. As reported previously, cerebellar cells survive and differentiate when cultured as microexplants in conditioned serum-free medium. 24 h after seeding, small clusters of cells exhibited short processes, which increased in number and length as the culture period progressed. After 6 days, cells exhibit several long radially oriented neurites extended from the microexplant. Indirect immunofluorescence studies, using neuronal and glial markers indicated that the cell cultures were composed of approximately 50% neurons and 50% glial cells (Fig. 1). Co-incubation of Ang II with AT1 or AT2 receptor analogs indicated that the cell cultures contained both AT1 and AT2receptor subtypes (Fig. 2).Figure 2Angiotensin II binding in cerebellar microexplant cultures. After 6 days in culture, [125I]Sar1-Ile8-Ang II bindingTot was determined as described (18Laflamme L. De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding (NS) was determined after incubation in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled Ang II. Binding in the presence of 1 μm DUP 753 (DUP) or CGP 42112 (CGP) indicates proportion of AT1 and AT2 receptors. Results are expressed as fmol/mg membrane proteins. Results are the means ± S.E. of three experiments, each in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Four-day treatment of cerebellar microexplant cultures with 100 nm Ang II induced important morphological changes. Two major modifications were observed. The first involved an increase in length of processes that exhibited several arborizations, and second, a marked cell migration was observed from the edge of the microexplant toward the periphery (Fig. 3,B compared with A). These effects were more pronounced in cells treated with Ang II and DUP 753 (1 μm), a specific AT1 receptor antagonist (Fig.3 C) or in cells treated with 10 nm of CGP 42112, the AT2 receptor agonist (Fig. 3 E). Moreover, incubation with Ang II and PD 123319 (1 μm), a specific antagonist of the AT2 receptor, blocked the AT2receptor-mediated effect (Fig. 3 D). Alone, DUP 753 and PD 123319 did not affect cell morphology compared with control cells, whereas PD 123319 abolished the effect of CGP 42112 (data not shown). Two protocols were used to quantify the morphological changes induced by Ang II treatment. Because process elongation involves an increase in the polymerization of tubulin, we measured the level of tubulin incorporated into cytoskeletal fractions from control, Ang II-treated, and Ang II/analog-treated cells. As shown in Fig.4, Ang II alone did not significantly modify the level of polymerized tubulin. However, specific stimulation of the AT2 receptor through either incubation of CGP 42112 or co-incubation with Ang II and DUP 753 increased the level of polymerized tubulin by 1.67 ± 0.15- and 1.40 ± 0.18-fold, respectively (n = 3). On the other hand, stimulation of the AT1 receptor by co-incubating Ang II with PD 123319 abolished the AT2 receptor-mediating effect (Fig.4 A). However, when incubated alone, DUP 753 or PD 123319 did not modify the basal level of polymerized tubulin, whereas PD 123319 abolished the effect of CGP 42112 (Fig. 4 B). By comparison, Ang II and/or analogs did not change the total level of tubulin content (Fig. 4 C). To evaluate whether process elongation affected neurons or glial cells, the effect of Ang II and analogs was verified on immunofluorescence of βIII-tubulin, an isoform specifically localized in neurons (35Ferreira A. Caceres A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 516-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, AT2 receptor activation clearly increased the level of βIII-tubulin labeling associated with neurons. After 4 days of treatment with CGP 42112 (Fig. 5 E) or Ang II plus DUP 753 (Fig. 5 C), the cells had a well developed network of neurites with several varicosities. In these conditions, processes appeared thicker, suggesting that AT2receptor activation increased fasciculation. Again, morphological observations were correlated with Western blot analyses (Fig.6) and confirmed that AT2receptor activation increased the level of βIII-tubulin incorporated into microtubules (Fig. 6, A and B), an effect abolished by the addition of PD 123319 but without any effect on the total level of βIII-tubulin in cells (Fig. 6 C).Figure 5Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of the effect of Ang II on βIII-tubulin in cerebellar microexplant cultures. Microexplants were cultured and stimulated for 4 days alone (A) or with Ang II (B), Ang II + DUP 753 (C), Ang II + PD 123319 (D), or CGP 42112 (E) as explained in the legend to Fig. 3.

Several studies indicate that this synthesis follows a time course that is correlated with axonal and dentritic growth (36Matus A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We therefore studied whether Ang II could affect the level of expression of tau and MAP2, two MAPs specifically expressed in axons and dendrites, respectively (36Matus A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 37Avila J. Dominguez J. Diaz-Nido J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 13-25PubMed Google Scholar). Tau 1 antibody identified a group of several tau isoforms. A representative Western blot in Fig.7 A illustrates that AT2 receptor activation by Ang II, after inhibition of the AT1 receptor by DUP 753 or after CGP 42112 treatment, strongly increased the level of the tau protein. In control cells, a single band of 50 kDa was observed, whereas in Ang II plus DUP 753- or in CGP 42112-treated cells, isoforms of higher molecular weight began to appear. The far right lane in Fig. 7 A shows the control pattern of tau expression in brain extracts from postnatal day 13 and from adult rats. As expected, a single isoform was detected in the young rat, whereas several bands were revealed in the adult (36Matus A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 37Avila J. Dominguez J. Diaz-Nido J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 13-25PubMed Google Scholar, 38Brion J. Smith C. Couck A.

Parallel Western blots with the 5E2 antibody, which recognizes unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of tau, revealed a stronger effect of Ang II, via the AT2 receptor, suggesting that the difference with the tau 1 immunoblot (Fig.7 A) is due to a preferential increase in tau phosphorylation. Fig. 7 (C and D) illustrates the effect of Ang II and analogs on the level of HMW-MAP2 and on MAP2c. Adult HMW-MAP2 was resolved in two isoforms, termed MAP2a and MAP2b of 280 kDa; MAP2a is present early in development, whereas the expression of MAP2c disappears in the adult. Again, AT2 receptor stimulation increased the levels of both proteins. As for tubulin measurements, incubation with DUP 753 or PD 123319 alone exhibited the same immunoreactivity against tau and MAP 2 than control cells (data not shown). Quantification of cell migration was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” following cell nuclei labeling with propidium iodine as shown in Fig. 8. Results from Fig. 8 A indicate that under CGP 42112 treatment, cells exhibited the highest degree of cell migration. Measurement of the number of migrating cells from the edge of the microexplant to the outermost peripheral ring indicates that Ang II induced a 1.9 ± 0.1-fold increase (n = 3) in the number of migrating cells, compared with control cultures. In corroboration with microscopic examination, these effects were due to AT2 receptor activation, because CGP 421122 or Ang II plus DUP 753 induced a stronger effect (3.3 ± 0.21- and 3.1 ± 0.25-fold, respectively, n = 3), whereas co-incubation with PD 123319 blocked these effects (1.2 ± 0.21-fold difference compared with control, n = 3) (Fig.9).Figure 9Quantification of the effect of Ang II on cell migration in cerebellar microexplant cultures.

https://openalex.org/W1991241185,"The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform UGT1A6 is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum by a single C-terminal transmembrane domain, followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. This topology is thought to be established through the sequential action of a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide and of a C-terminal stop transfer/anchor sequence. We found that the deletion of the signal peptide did not prevent membrane targeting and insertion of this protein expressed in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in yeast Pichia pastoris. Interestingly, the same results were obtained when the protein was depleted of both the signal peptide and the C-terminal transmembrane domain/cytoplasmic tail sequences, suggesting the presence of an internal topogenic element able to translocate and retain UGT1A6 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in vitro and in yeast cells. To identify such a sequence, the insertion of several N-terminal deletion mutants of UGT1A6 into microsomal membranes was investigated in vitro. The data clearly showed that the deletion of the N-terminal end did not affect endoplasmic reticulum targeting and retention until residues 140–240 were deleted. The signal-like activity of the 140–240 region was demonstrated by the ability of this segment to confer endoplasmic reticulum residency to the cytosolic green fluorescent protein expressed in mammalian cells. Finally, we show that this novel topogenic sequence can posttranslationally mediate the translocation of UGT1A6. This study provides the first evidence that the membrane assembly of the human UGT1A6 involves an internal signal retention sequence.

Targeting and insertion of integral membrane proteins involve characteristic topogenic sequences that act to initiate (signal peptide sequence) and terminate (stop transfer sequence) translocation. In mammalian cells, the N-terminal signal peptide generally targets the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 via a cotranslational pathway by binding to the signal recognition particle, which then interacts with its receptor and releases the signal sequence (1Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 79: 3111-3115Google Scholar). A second signal recognition event within the ER involving the Sec61 complex, the main constituent of a protein conducting channel, is then required for the subsequent translocation of the nascent polypeptide across the lipid bilayer (2Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The elongating polypeptide is then extruded through the membrane until a stop transfer sequence terminates translocation and integrates laterally into the membrane. A number of reports describing overlapping properties of signal sequences, signal anchors, and stop transfer sequences question the nature and specificity of these topogenic sequences. The stop transfer sequence of the IgM heavy chain (3Mize N.K. Andrews D.W. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1986; 47: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the seventh transmembrane segment of band 3 of the erythrocyte anion exchanger (4Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are able to initiate the translocation process. Signal anchors can also act as signal sequences as shown for cytochrome b 5 (5Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biol.

Single spanning membrane proteins that present a cleavable signal peptide sequence usually have a type I topology with the N-terminal part of the transmembrane domain exposed to the exterior of the membrane and the C-terminal portion exposed to the cytoplasmic side (N-exo/C-cyto). Examples of such bitopic membrane proteins include the low density lipoprotein receptor (7Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Yamamoto T. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.E.

In this study, we have investigated the topogenic determinants that drive the membrane assembly of the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoform UGT1A6, an integral ER glycoprotein with a type I orientation. The UGT superfamily consists of numerous isoforms catalyzing the addition of a glycosidic residue, glucuronic acid, on to a wide variety of hydrophobic acceptor substrates, i.e. small endogenous and exogenous molecules, as well as complex glycolipids and glycoproteins (10Dutton G.J.

UGT1A6 is a major human UGT isoform playing an essential role in the elimination of planar phenols, carcinogenic environmental compounds, and therapeutic agents such as naftazone and paracetamol (12Fournel-Gigleux S.

Sequence alignment of more than 50 mammalian UGT cDNAs indicated the presence of a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide sequence that is cleaved during membrane insertion (15Mackenzie P.I.

Tukey R.H. Nebert W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Examination of the sequences also suggested the presence of a single TMD of 17 amino acid residues near the C-terminal end, followed by about 26 cytoplasmic residues containing a di-lysine motif that could function as a ER retrieval/retention signal (16Jackson M.R.

However, the membrane organization and the topological determinants of UGTs remain hypothetical since no structural determination by x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance is yet available. This study represents the beginning of a systematic effort to understand the structural implications of the membrane-associated regions of UGTs. We previously provided evidence that UGT1A6 with its signal peptide sequence deleted remained integrally associated with the inner membrane ofEscherichia coli, when heterologously expressed in this host cell (24Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Pillot T. Burchell B. Siest G. Magdalou J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To further address the mechanism by which UGT1A6 is targeted and inserted into the ER membrane, we generated a series of truncations deleting individually or simultaneously the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein. Using an efficient expression system in the yeastPichia pastoris together with in vitro expression experiments in a reticulocyte lysate, we demonstrate the existence of a previously unidentified internal topogenic sequence mediating the translocation and retention of polypeptides across the ER membrane. Moreover, we provide evidence for a posttranslational mechanism of translocation of the full-length and truncated UGT1A6 polypeptides. [35S]Methionine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ulis, France). Bacterial and yeast culture media were from Difco (Detroit, MI). Mammalian (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) cell culture medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Protein assay reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad (Yvry sur Seine, France). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, RNAsinTM, pGEM-3Z, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, dog pancreas microsomes, and competent E. coli JM109 cells were purchased from Promega (Charbonnières, France). Prepro-α-factor mRNA used as control in in vitro experiments was also provided by Promega. The plasmid pEGFP-N1 for expression of protein fused to a red shift variant of the green fluorescent protein of jellyfish was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The P. pastoris yeast expression system was from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Vent DNA polymerase and endoglycosidase H were provided by New England Biolabs (Hitchin, United Kingdom). Other reagents including cycloheximide, proteinase K, methanol, paraformaldehyde, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-sheep immunoglobulins, rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins, and anti-goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated immunoglobulins were purchased from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). The glycosylation acceptor tripeptidesN-benzoyl-asparagine-asparagine-threonine-N-methylamide andN-benzoyl-asparagine-alanine-serine-N-methylamide were synthesized by Dr. G. Bloomberg (Recognition Center Peptide Synthesis Facility, Bristol, United Kingdom) and used to inhibitN-linked glycosylation, as described previously (25High S. Flint N. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of full-length UGT1A6 cDNA (GenBank accession no. M84130) have been reported elsewhere (26Harding D. Fournel-Gigleux S. Jackson M.R. Burchell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8381-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For in vitro expression of UGT1A6, the corresponding cDNA was isolated from the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA1-UGT1A6 (27Ouzzine M. Pillot T. Fournel-Gigleux S. Burchell B. Siest G. Magdalou J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and subcloned into theEcoRI-XbaI sites of pGEM-3Z. UGT1A6 lacking the signal peptide sequence was obtained by PCR amplification using a sense primer comprising an EcoRI site, a Kozak sequence, and nucleotides 79–102 corresponding to UGT1A6 coding region together with an antisense primer comprising a XbaI site, a stop codon, and nucleotides 1593–1576. The PCR fragment was subcloned into theEcoRI-XbaI sites of pGEM-3Z to generate UGT1A6ΔSP. Constructs encoding polypeptides lacking the 26, 43, 68, 140, or 240 N-terminal amino acid residues as well as 43 C-terminal residues (corresponding to the TMD/CT sequence) were generated by PCR amplification using sense primers containing an EcoRI site, a Kozak sequence, and nucleotides 79–102, 130–153, 205–228, 421–444, 721–744 corresponding to UGT1A6 coding region, respectively, and an antisense primer comprising a XbaI site, a stop codon, and nucleotides 1515–1498. The PCR products were individually subcloned into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of pGEM-3Z to generate UGT1A6ΔSP/TMD/CT, UGT1A6Δ-N43/TMD/CT, UGT1A6Δ-N68/TMD/CT, UGT1A6Δ-N140/TMD/CT, and UGT1A6Δ-N240/TMD/CT, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were then used for in vitro transcription-translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the T7 RNA polymerase. To generate the UGT141–240/EGFP expression plasmid encoding a chimeric protein between the 141–240 region of UGT1A6 and EGFP, a sense primer comprising a HindIII site, a Kozak sequence, and nucleotides 421–441 corresponding to UGT1A6 coding region was used together with an antisense primer comprising a BamHI site and nucleotides 720–702. The resulting amplified fragment was subcloned into theHindIII-BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector in frame with the EGFP coding sequence. The recombinant vector was used for transient expression of the chimeric UGT141–240/EGFP protein in HeLa 229 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, ECACC). For expression in P. pastoris of wild-type and truncated UGT1A6 mutants, the sequences coding for UGT1A6, UGT1A6ΔSP, and UGT1A6ΔSP/TMD/CT were isolated from the corresponding pGEM-3Z constructs and subcloned into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of pPICZB. The corresponding expression vectors were named pPICZ-UGT1A6, pPICZ-UGT1A6ΔSP, and pPICZ-UGT1A6ΔSP/TMD/CT. All mutant clones were screened for Taq-introduced errors by dideoxy sequencing (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The in vitrotranscription-translation procedures were performed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and [35S]methionine, at 30 °C for 60 min using the TNTTM coupled reticulocyte lysate kit from Promega. For membrane translocation tests, dog pancreas microsomal membranes (Promega) were added to the reaction mixture according to the suggestions of the supplier. N-Glycosylation was prevented by acceptor tripeptides (0.2 mm) added to the incubation mixture before the microsomal membranes. For alkaline extraction, the incubation mixture containing the microsomes was diluted two times in buffer A (50 mm KOAc, 200 mmNa2CO3, 20 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, pH 11.5) and kept in ice for 20 min to fracture microsomes and remove non-integral proteins. The mixture was then layered over a 250-μl sucrose cushion (buffer B: 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine, 140 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2) containing 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and the membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g in a Sorvall RC M120 micro-ultracentrifuge for 45 min. The pellet was washed with 25 μl of buffer B and suspended in sample loading buffer. Supernatant proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% (v/v)), and the samples were electrophoresed on 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protease sensitivity and topology of the expressed polypeptide were analyzed using proteinase K as described (30Connolly T. Collins P. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transcription-translation products were treated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K in the presence or absence of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 10 min, the samples were heated at 100 °C in Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The following calibrated prestained SDS-PAGE standards (Bio-Rad) were used: phosphorylase B, 107 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 76 kDa; ovalbumin, 52 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 36.8 kDa; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 27.2 kDa; and lysozyme, 19 kDa. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed directly to Kodak Biomax films for visualization. Following linearization by XbaI, recombinant pGEM-3Z plasmids encoding the full-length and truncated UGT polypeptides served as templates forin vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase using mCAP RNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The RNAs produced were translated in vitro using the FlexiTM rabbit reticulocyte lysate expression system (Promega). After translation for 30 min, 2 mm cycloheximide was added for 10 min to inhibit further elongation. Translocation reactions were then initiated by addition of dog pancreas microsomes and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The same procedure was carried out using the yeast prepro-α-factor mRNA as a control. pPICZ-UGT1A6, pPICZ-UGT1A6ΔSP, and pPICZ-UGT1A6ΔSP/TMD/CT were individually transformed into P. pastoris SMD 1168 (Invitrogen) by the lithium chloride method according to the recommendations of the supplier. Transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin. The cells were grown in BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, and 1% glycerol). Expression was induced in a buffered BMGM medium (BMGY with 1% glycerol replaced by 2% methanol) and carried out for 48 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (200 rpm). Cells were harvested after 48 h of induction, washed once, and suspended in cold breaking buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol). The cells were then broken by vortexing with glass beads. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were then pelleted from the supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in sucrose-Hepes buffer (0.25m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Alkaline extraction was carried out as described above. For high salt extraction, membranes were incubated in buffer (50 mmtriethanolamine, 140 mm KOAc, 2.5 mmMg(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min, then layered over a 250-μl sucrose cushion (0.25m sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1m NaCl, pH 7.4) and fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g to yield pellet and soluble fractions. For endoglycosidase H digestion, microsomal membranes were denatured in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min and then incubated with endoglycosidase H in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, buffer containing Complete MiniTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) at 37 °C for 1 h, according to the recommendations of the supplier (New England Biolabs). Protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and immunoblot analysis were performed using anti-UGT1A6 antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described previously (27Ouzzine M. Pillot T. Fournel-Gigleux S. Burchell B. Siest G. Magdalou J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were replated in 30-mm diameter wells on coverslips 1 day before transfection with the pUGT141–240/EGFP plasmid using ExgenTM as transfecting reagent (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) and fixed after 24 h of culture with 3% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100/PBS, followed by blocking with 0.2% gelatin/PBS (w/v). Permeabilized cells were then incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-calnexin antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), washed in PBS, and incubated for 20 min with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (32Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Finally, cells were washed in PBS and mounted on microscope slides using mounting medium (Sigma). Microscopic observations were performed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 100× objective. Kodak Ektachrome 400 film was used for photography. To study the process of UGT1A6 targeting and insertion into the microsomal membranes, we employed an in vitro transcription-translation expression system using in the first instance two constructs. One of these directed the synthesis of the full-length UGT1A6 precursor, and the other was an engineered mutant, UGT1A6ΔSP, lacking 26 N-terminal amino acids (the entire signal peptide sequence). A schematic representation of the constructs appears in Fig.1 A. The insertion of the polypeptides in dog pancreas microsomes was first characterized by their glycosylation pattern and resistance to alkaline treatment. Thein vitro expression of UGT1A6 cDNA yielded a polypeptide of about 54 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane a) corresponding to the expected apparent molecular mass of the precursor, as evaluated by comparison with calibrated molecular masses of prestained SDS-PAGE standards. In the presence of microsomal membranes, polypeptide bands exhibiting a slower mobility on gel electrophoresis (55–56 kDa, Fig. 1 B, lane c) were observed. This increase of apparent molecular mass was consistent with the cleavage of the signal peptide followed byN-asparagine-linked glycosylation, previously described for this UGT isoform (26Harding D. Fournel-Gigleux S. Jackson M.R. Burchell B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8381-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the presence of acceptor tripeptides that are competitive inhibitors of asparagine-linked glycosylation, a single polypeptide band of 52 kDa was generated, which corresponds to the mature unglycosylated form of UGT1A6 resulting from the cleavage of the signal peptide sequence (Fig. 1 B, compare lane e to lanes a and c). In the case of UGT1A6ΔSP, a polypeptide of about 52 kDa was produced in the absence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 1 B, lane b), which was, as expected, about 2 kDa shorter than the product of the wild-type cDNA expressed in the same conditions. Interestingly, addition of microsomes to the transcription-translation incubation mixture resulted in the appearance of higher molecular mass species (Fig. 1 B, lane d) that was prevented by addition of glycosylation inhibitory tripeptides (Fig.1 B, lane f). These results indicate that the deletion mutant, like the precursor form, was translocated andN-glycosylated in the lumen of the ER. A high concentration of a strong base is classically used to test the integration of proteins into the membrane. Such treatment extracts only peripheral membrane and secretory proteins but not integral membrane-bound proteins. Both the wild-type UGT1A6 and the form lacking the signal peptide sequence were found to be tightly integrated into the lipid bilayer of microsomal membranes with the majority of the polypeptides recovered in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1 B, lanes i and j). Fig. 1 B (lanes g and h) shows that, indeed, only small amounts of protein could be detected in the supernatant. As a positive control, the yeast prepro-α-factor expressed in the presence of microsomes was processed and glycosylated to produce a 30-kDa polypeptide. This secreted protein was effectively removed from the membrane pellet, when subjected to alkaline treatment (Fig. 1 B, lanes k and l). The results of this set of experiments (glycosylation of newly synthesized chains and resistance to alkaline extraction) showed that UGT1A6, despite the lack of its N-terminal cleavable signal peptide, was translocated and integrated into the ER membrane as the wild-type protein. The in vitro targeting and translocation of UGT1A6 deprived of its natural signal peptide prompted us to further investigate ER targeting in vivo. A yeast P. pastoris expression system was developed to analyze the topogenic elements mediating membrane insertion of UGT1A6 in vivo. After subcloning both full-length and truncated UGT1A6 cDNA into the expression vector pPICZB, the resultant recombinant plasmids were individually transformed in the methyltrophic yeast strain P. pastoris. Upon methanol induction, expression of both wild-type UGT1A6 and mutant lacking the signal peptide sequence was successfully achieved. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts showed that the recombinant wild-type UGT1A6 migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a polypeptide band of approximately 55–56 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane a). Subfractionation experiments showed that, as expected, the protein was associated with the microsomal membranes and was resistant to alkaline (Fig. 1 C, lanes b and c) and to high salt extraction (Fig.1 C, lanes d and e). Treatment of the microsomal fraction with endoglycosidase H under denaturating conditions resulted in the appearance of a lower molecular mass band (Fig. 1 C, compare lane g tolane f), indicating that UGT1A6 was translocated and retained in the ER of recombinant yeast cells. Interestingly, Western blot analysis performed on recombinant yeast cell extracts expressing UGT1A6ΔSP (Fig. 1 D) showed that this polypeptide exhibited the same apparent molecular mass as the wild-type (55–56 kDa), suggesting that despite the absence of signal sequence, the protein was also targeted and translocated across the ER (Fig.1 D, lanes a and b). Upon sodium carbonate (Fig. 1 D, lanes c andd) or high salt (Fig. 1 D, lanes e and f) extraction, the polypeptide remained associated with the microsomal fraction, indicating that the protein was integrated into the membranes. Moreover, the protein was sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion (decrease of apparent molecular mass of 2 kDa, Fig. 1 D, lane g) similarly to the wild-type protein suggesting a compartmentalization restricted to the ER. To further assess the intracellular localization of wild-type and mutant UGT1A6 expressed in yeast cells, immunofluorescence microscopy studies were carried out. The wild-type UGT1A6 exhibited a typical ER staining pattern (data not shown). The same ER staining pattern was observed in P. pastoris expressing UGT1A6ΔSP, confirming that the deletion of the UGT1A6 signal peptide did not prevent targeting and ER residency of the protein (data not shown). Based both on in vitro and in vivo experiments, these results provide evidence that the absence of the signal peptide does not preclude ER targeting, translocation, and retention of UGT1A6. Members of the UGT family present a hydrophobic stretch of 17 amino acids at the C terminus followed by a positively charged tail of about 26 amino acids, thought to be important for membrane integration and ER retention (16Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar,17Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of the deletion of this region by creating a mutant lacking 43 C-terminal amino acid residues as well as the N-terminal leader peptide (UGT1A6ΔSP/TMD/CT represented in Fig. 2 A).In vitro transcription-translation showed that in the absence of microsomal membranes, the UGT1A6ΔSP/TMD/CT construct yielded a polypeptide of the expected size (about 48–49 kDa) (Fig.2 B, lane b).

However, most cancer cells that lack functional p53 retain an unknown checkpoint mechanism(s) by which cells are arrested at the G2/M phase. Here we demonstrate that a human homolog of Cds1/Rad53 kinase (hCds1) is rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to DNA damage not only in normal cells but in cancer cells lacking functional p53. A survey of various cancer cell lines revealed that the expression level of hCds1 mRNA is inversely related to the presence of functional p53. In addition, transfection of normal human fibroblasts with SV40 T antigen or human papilloma viruses E6 or E7 causes a marked induction of hCds1 mRNA, and the introduction of functional p53 into SV40 T antigen- and E6-, but not E7-, transfected cells decreases the hCds1 level, suggesting that p53 negatively regulates the expression of hCds1. In cells without functional ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, phosphorylation and activation of hCds1 were observed in response to DNA damage induced by UV but not by ionizing irradiation.

Interestingly, cells derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT)1 are defective in both G1 and G2 checkpoint functions and display a high frequency of spontaneous as well as radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations (7Kastan M.B.

In yeast, several Rad-related proteins are thought to participate in the signaling as well as monitoring processes that detect DNA damage (10Longhese M.P. Foiani M. Muzi-Falconi M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5525-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Among these, Rad3, a yeast homolog of human ATM (AT mutated), appears to play a central role in the DNA damage checkpoint. Rad3 is a member of a subfamily of protein kinases that are large proteins with lipid kinase-related domains at their carboxyl termini (11Zakian V.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 685-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and it is considered to be a transducer of a DNA damage signal in yeast. In fission yeast, the protein kinases Chk1 and Cds1 are required for cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage (12Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D.

It has been shown that human homologs of Chk1 and Cds1 (hCds1) phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser-216 (22Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

A more recent study points to the involvement of hCds1 in the DNA damage checkpoint, by showing that hCds1 is activated through phosphorylation in an ATM-dependent manner in response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (23Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown at which phase of the cell cycle hCds1 functions and how it cooperates with p53-dependent checkpoint pathways in response to DNA damage. In this report, we demonstrate that hCds1 is specifically expressed at the S-to-M phase of the cell cycle and is rapidly activated through phosphorylation in response to DNA damage not only in normal cells but also in p53-deficient cancer cells. In addition, we present evidence that hCds1 expression is negatively regulated by functional p53, leading to a high level of expression in p53-deficient cancer cells. Thus, hCds1 may complement the function of p53 in the DNA damage checkpoint in p53-deficient cancer cells. HeLa cells and human diploid fibroblasts (MJ90) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16 E6 and E7 retrovirus vectors and LXSN-E6 and -E7 were kindly provided by Dr. D. Galloway (25Halbert C.L. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SV40 T antigen retrovirus vector pZipSV40 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Jat (26Jat P.S. Cepko C.L. Mulligan R.C. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell.

Retroviruses encoding SV40 T antigen and HPV E6 and E7 were prepared using pZipSV40, LXSN-E6, LXSN-E7, respectively, as described previously (27Miller Rosman BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human fibroblasts WI-38 (obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank) were used as the recipients for retroviral infection and were cultured under the same conditions as described above. Human p53 adenovirus vector was kindly donated by Drs. H. Hamada and J. Miyazaki. Fibroblasts derived from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia (AT2KY) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. To induce DNA damage, cells were irradiated with UV at 322 nm using a UV cross-linker (Taitech, Tokyo). Degenerate primers for the conserved motifs in the FHA and kinase domains of SpCds1 (28Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), T/AG/CNAAT/CGGNACCTTTTTNAAT and T/CTTA/GTTA/G/TATA/G/TATT/C/TTA/G/TATGGC, were used to screen MDAH041 cDNAs by PCR. Sequence analysis of a PCR product revealed an incomplete open reading frame, which was highly homologous to SpCds1. Additional nucleotides of the novel 5′ DNA sequence were obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). The sequence of the 3′-end of hCds1 cDNA was identical with a partial sequence in the data base of an expressed sequence tag clone (AA773443). mRNAs were isolated using a Quickprep mRNA Purification kit (Amersham Parmacia Biotech) according to the manufacture's instructions. RNA (2 μg each) was denatured, separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes. hCds1 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridization signal was detected and quantitated using a Fuji imaging analyzer (BAS 1500). Baculoviruses expressing hCds1myc/6xHis were generated by PCR with a common 5′-primer (TTTGAATTCGCGGTCGTGATGTCTCGGGAG) and a 3′-primer (TTTCTCGAGCAACACAGCAGCACACACAGC), using cDNA derived from MJ90 cells as a template. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI/XhoI and ligated into pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisA. The EcoRI/PmeI fragment from pcDNA3.1/Myc-His hCds1 was subcloned into pVL1392, which was cut with EcoRI/SmaI. One μg of pVL1392hCds1myc/6xHis was co-transfected into Sf9 cells with 2.5 μg of linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen). pGEX-hCds1 was generated by ligation of theEcoRI/XhoI fragment of hCds1 cDNA into pGEX 5X-1. Overnight cultures of E. coli transformed with plasmids encoding GST-fusion proteins were diluted 10-fold with fresh medium and cultured for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in NETN150 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Recombinant proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibody against hCds1 was generated by immunizing a rabbit with hCds1myc/6xHis protein purified from Sf9 cells using ProBond Resin (Invitrogen). Antisera were purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with GST-hCds1. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in ice-cold IP kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml PMSF) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 5 mg/ml phosphatase substrate). Clear lysates (100 μg) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-hCds1 antibody (1:1000). Baculovirus-expressing wild-type hCds1myc/6xHis and its mutant (K249M) proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-Tag (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Cell lysates from HeLa and AT2KY cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-hCds1 antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. For immunocytochemistry, HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-hCds1 antibody (1:200) and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Immunotech) and were mounted in PermaFluor aqueous mounting medium (Immunon, PA). The kinase activity of hCds1 was determined at 30 °C for 30 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm ATP, and 185 kBq[γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol; NEM), using the GST-Cdc25C fragment as a substrate (29Kaneko, Y. Watanabe, N. Akita, H. Morisaki, H. Fujimoto, A. Tominaga, K. Ikeda, K. Nakanishi, M. Oncogene. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. In some experiments, anti-hCds1 immunoprecipitants from HeLa cell lysates were treated with 2000 units of λ phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h in the absence of phosphatase inhibitor. To determine the chromosomal localization of the hCds1 gene, fluorescencein situ hybridization was performed as described previously (30Hirai M. Suto Y. Kanoh M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A biotinylated cDNA probe for hCds1 was hybridized to R-banded chromosomes prepared from PHA-stimulated lymphocytes from normal donors. After overnight hybridization at 37 °C, the slides were washed in 50% formamide/2× SSC at 37 °C for 10 min followed by a wash in 1× SSC at room temperature for 15 min. Hybridization signals were amplified using rabbit antibiotin (Enzo) and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Enzo). The chromosomes were counter-stained with propidium iodide. A human homolog ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe Cds1 (spCds1), which functions in both DNA replication and damage checkpoints, was cloned by degenerate PCR using primers designed on the basis of spCds1 sequences. The human cDNA predicts a translation product of 543 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 60 kDa, and the nucleotide sequence ofhCds1 gene is identical with that of human Chk2, which has recently been reported by Matsuoka et al. (23Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). To examine at which stage(s) of the cell cycle hCds1 functions in mammalian cells, we first determined the expression of hCds1 mRNA during cell cycle progression by Northern blotting. Normal human fibroblasts (MJ90) were synchronized at the G0phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation for 72 h and then stimulated with fresh medium containing 15% FBS. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the S phase started approximately 18 h after serum stimulation and that maximal cell division occurred at 24–36 h (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1 A, Northern blot analysis with an hCds1 cDNA probe revealed that an hCds1 transcript of approximately 2.2 kilobases was weakly detected in serum-starved, quiescent cells (time 0). The steady-state level of hCds1 mRNA increased as cells approached the G1/S transition (18 h), remained elevated until 36 h, and declined during the next G1 phase (48 h in Fig. 1 A). To examine whether the level of hChk1 protein also changes in a cell cycle-dependent fashion, we prepared antiserum that specifically interacts with full-length hCds1 protein expressed in insect cells, and extracts from synchronized MJ90 cells were analyzed by Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-hCds1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A (lower panel), using the antibody, a predominant band was detected at 60 kDa in the lysates of MJ90 cells, and this completely disappeared after preabsorption of the antibody with GST-fused hCds1 protein expressed in E. coli(data not shown). In agreement with the results of the Northern analysis, Western analysis revealed that hCds1 protein was expressed from late G1 through M phases of the cell cycle. Although cell cycle-dependent expression of Cds1 and Rad53 has not been described in yeast, the expression pattern of hCds1 is very similar to that of hChk1, another checkpoint kinase in mammalian cells (29Kaneko, Y. Watanabe, N. Akita, H. Morisaki, H. Fujimoto, A. Tominaga, K. Ikeda, K. Nakanishi, M. Oncogene. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). We next attempted to determine the subcellular localization of hCds1 protein. As shown in Fig.1 B, whereas almost no signal was detected using normal rabbit serum (Control Ab), indirect immunofluorescence revealed clearly detected signals with our anti-hCds1 antibody in the nucleoplasm of HeLa cells, indicating that hCds1 is present in the nucleoplasm. The nuclear localization of hCds1 was not affected by DNA damage (data not shown). Very recently, Cahillet al. (31Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) reported that mutations of a mitotic checkpoint gene, hBUB1, can cause chromosomal instability in human cancers. To see whether this is also the case with hCds1, we determined the chromosomal localization of hCds1 and analyzed the chromosomal aberrations in the region. The results of fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the hCds1 gene is localized to human chromosome 22q11.2 (Fig.2). It is also noteworthy that thehCds1 locus is adjacent to the gene encoding hSNF5/INI1, which has been implicated in the etiology of malignant rhabdoid tumors (32Versteege I. Sevenet N. Lange J. Rousseau-Merck M.-F. Ambros P. Handgretinger R. Aurias A. Delattre P. Nature. 1998; 394: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that a mutation or deletion in thehCds1 gene may be involved in the oncogenesis of rhabdoid tumors. In yeast, Rad53 and spCds1 have been reported to be phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, in a Mec1/Rad3-dependent manner (33Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 34Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes & Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To see whether hCds1 functions in DNA damage response in mammalian cells under p53-deficient conditions, modification of hCds1 protein following UV-induced DNA damage was determined in HeLa cells that lack functional p53. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the band corresponding to hCds1 protein was shifted upward on SDS-PAGE in extracts of HeLa cells exposed to UV compared with those from untreated cells. This mobility shift was completely reversed by phosphatase treatment, indicating that the modification following UV irradiation was because of phosphorylation of hCds1 protein. Although hCds1 protein was mostly phosphorylated at 2 h after UV irradiation, a time course experiment revealed that phosphorylation of hCds1 protein occurred as early as 10 min, when an intermediate pattern was observed (data not shown). To examine whether the phosphorylation of hCds1 protein affects its kinase activity, we measured the kinase activity of hCds1 from HeLa cell extracts, with or without DNA damage, using the GST-Cdc25C fragment as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the kinase activity in the anti-hCds1 immunoprecipitates increased approximately 5-fold following UV irradiation. The kinase activity was not detected when a Cdc25C mutant (S216A) with a substitution of alanine at serine 216 was used as a substrate (data not shown), which is consistent with a previous report that hChk2 phosphorylates serine 216 of Cdc25C (23Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Interestingly, autophosphorylation of hCds1 was detected in the anti-hCds1 immunoprecipitates following UV treatment (Fig.3 B). These results suggest that hCds1 is activated by phosphorylation in response to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation and that activated hCds1 phosphorylates Cdc25C on serine 216. Taken together with the recent report that phosphorylation of Cdc25C on serine 216 is critical for the DNA damage checkpoint in mammals (19Peng C-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that hCds1 plays a pivotal role in this checkpoint pathway. We next examined whether hCds1 is phosphorylated by other DNA-damaging agents. As shown in Fig. 3 C, hCds1 was phosphorylated following x-ray irradiation and MMS treatment, as well as UV irradiation, not only in HeLa cells but in normal fibroblasts, suggesting that hCds1 is involved in DNA damage checkpoint pathways induced by a wide variety of DNA damage. Interestingly, in AT2KY cells, which lack functional ATM, the band shift of hCds1 was observed in response to UV irradiation or MMS treatment but not following x-ray irradiation (Fig. 3 C). Taken together with the previous observations that AT cells show hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation but not to UV or alkylating agents (35Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F.

Although the data so far suggest the role of hCds1 in the DNA damage response, the functional relationship between the hCds1-mediated G2 checkpoint and the p53-mediated G1 checkpoint is largely unknown. To address this question, we first surveyed the expression of hCds1 in various cell lines with and without functional p53. Interestingly, the level of hCds1 mRNA was very low (Cds1 mRNA/GAPDH mRNA ratio, 0.12–0.23) in cells with wild-type p53, such as MJ90 (37Nakanishi M. Adami G.R. Robetorye R.S. Noda A. Venable S.F.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) cells (Fig.4 A), raising the possibility that wild-type p53 negatively regulates the expression of thehCds1 gene. The status of p53 and its content in these cell lines were confirmed by Northern blot analysis using p21 cDNA as a probe, which showed a higher expression of p21 in cells containing functional p53 and a lower expression in cells lacking functional p53 (data not shown). These results, that the levels of hCds1 mRNA varied among cancer cells lacking functional 53, raise the possibility that additional genetic alterations may be involved in the regulation of hCds1 expression. To further substantiate negative regulation of hCds1 expression by p53, normal human fibroblasts (WI-38) were transfected with retroviruses encoding the viral oncoproteins, SV40 large T antigen, and HPV E6 or E7 protein to abrogate the function of both p53 and pRb (45Segawa K. Minowa A. Sugasawa K. Takano T. Hanaoka F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), p53 only (47Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar), or pRb only (48Dyson N. Howley P.M. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar), respectively, and the expression of hCds1 mRNA was determined. As shown in Fig. 4 B, parent WI-38 cells expressed a low level of endogenous hCds1 mRNA. Expression of SV40 large T antigen, E6 or E7 protein in WI-38 cells caused a marked induction of hCds1 mRNA, with T antigen being more potent than E6 or E7 protein in inducing hCds1 expression (4.5-fold by T antigen, 2.0-fold by E6, and 2.1-fold by E7). Interestingly, as shown in Fig.4 B, infection of an adenovirus vector encoding wild-type p53 significantly decreased the level of hCds1 mRNA in SV 40 large T antigen (both p53 and pRb disrupted)- and E6-transformed cells (only p53 function disrupted) but not in E7-transformed cells (only pRb function disrupted). These results indicate that the induction of hCds1 expression in oncoprotein-transduced cells (Fig. 4 B) is, at least in part, because of the inhibition of p53 function. In addition, on the basis of our finding that the expression of hCds1 was also increased in E7-transformed (pRb function disrupted) cells, compared with parent WI-38 cells, and that the level was higher in cells transformed by SV 40 large T- than in E6-transduced cells, it is tempting to speculate that the pRb pathway may also negatively regulate hCds1 expression. Taken together with the recent report that pRb plays an essential role in the DNA damage checkpoint during the G1 phase (49Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11945-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of hCds1 is enhanced when the G1 checkpoint function is compromised by either p53 or pRb dysfunction. In conclusion, we propose the existence of a counter-regulatory mechanism; when cells lose functional p53 and thus G1checkpoint control, hCds1 plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage checkpoint during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. In normal cells, p53 and/or pRb, rather than hCds1, are thought to play the main role in DNA damage checkpoint. Once mutations disrupt the p53- and/or pRb-dependent pathways, cells respond with increased expression of hCds1, which in turn plays a compensatory role in the G2 checkpoint in the case of DNA damage. It is conceivable that activation of the hCds1-dependent checkpoint pathway may underlie the resistance of p53-deficient cancer cells to ionizing irradiation and anti-cancer drugs. Thus, the development of specific inhibitors of hCds1 may provide a novel strategy for cancer therapy by enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damage induced by anti-cancer drugs.

A distinct biochemical feature of these membranes is their high relative levels of free cholesterol; the mole ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid (C/P) measured in these membranes ranges from 1 to 4. The organization of cholesterol in this membrane system is not well understood, however. In this study, the structure of plasma membrane samples isolated from nuclear (3.3 C/P) and cortical (2.4 C/P) regions of human lenses was evaluated with x-ray diffraction approaches. Meridional diffraction patterns obtained from the oriented membrane samples demonstrated the presence of an immiscible cholesterol domain with a unit cell periodicity of 34.0 Å, consistent with a cholesterol monohydrate bilayer. The dimensions of the sterol-rich domains remained constant over a broad range of temperatures (5–20 °C) and relative humidity levels (31–97%). In contrast, dimensions of the surrounding sterol-poor phase were significantly affected by experimental conditions. Similar structural features were observed in membranes reconstituted from fiber cell plasma membrane lipid extracts. The results of this study indicate that the lens fiber cell plasma membrane is a complex structure consisting of separate sterol-rich and -poor domains.

The lens is an encapsulated structure consisting almost entirely of a large number of rigid, elongated cells known as lens fibers or fiber cells. These cells are produced via the terminal differentiation of a monolayer of epithelial cells located just beneath the anterior lens capsule (1Rafferty N.S. Maisel H. The Ocular Lens. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1985: 1-60Google Scholar). This process begins early in embryogenesis and continues throughout life, resulting in the deposition of one layer of fiber cells upon another. As new layers of fiber cells are produced, existing layers are displaced toward the center of the lens. Fiber cell layers that are compacted into the center of the lens during embryonic development and through adulthood comprise a region known as the lens nucleus; fiber cells peripheral to the nucleus, including the newly formed and metabolically active fiber cells, define the lens cortex. During their progressive displacement toward the lens nucleus, fiber cells lose all subcellular organelles that would scatter light and thus impair vision (2Bassnett S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1793-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, plasma membrane becomes essentially the only organelle of the lens (1Rafferty N.S. Maisel H. The Ocular Lens. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1985: 1-60Google Scholar). The fiber cell plasma membrane is unique in that it contains only trace amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid (3Broekhuyse R.M. Soeting W.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1976; 22: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), very high concentrations of a 26-kDa water channel protein known as main intrinsic protein (MIP or MP26) (4Mulders S.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9010-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and, in the human lens, a phospholipid composition of over 50% sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin derivatives (5Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Porter R.A. Taylor K.G. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 4333-4343PubMed Google Scholar, 6Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Ophthalmic Res. 1997; 29: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, human lens fiber cell plasma membrane contains a relative concentration of cholesterol that is the highest found in nature (7Zelenka P.S. Curr. Eye Res. 1984; 3: 1337-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cholesterol to phospholipid (C/P)1 mole ratio ranges from 1 to 2 in the cortex to 3 to 4 in the nucleus (8Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li L.K. So L. Spector A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, plasma membranes of typical eukaryotic cells have C/P mole ratios between 0.5 and 1.0 (10Emmelot P. Jamison G.A. Robinson D.M. Mammalian Cell Membranes. Butterworths, Inc., Boston1977: 1-54Google Scholar). Despite an advanced understanding of the lipid composition of the human ocular lens, there is little information about the structural organization of the lens plasma membrane. How does a membrane accommodate 3 to 4 cholesterol molecules per one phospholipid? The presence of cholesterol at such extremely high relative concentrations in lens membrane has led to the proposal that the fiber cell plasma membrane is “a mosaic of phospholipid bilayer and cholesterol patches” (8Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of independent studies employing other biological membrane systems give credence to this possibility. Using model membrane systems, it has been determined that cholesterol tends to aggregate into clusters at C/P mole ratios in excess of 0.3 (11Engelman D.M. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3694-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and C/P mole ratios greater than 1.0 (i.e. 50 mole % sterol) can yield pure cholesterol phases (12Houslay M.D. Stanley K.K. Dynamics of Biological Membranes: Influence on Synthesis, Structure and Function. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1982: 71-81Google Scholar). In well defined lipid monolayer systems, the addition of cholesterol produces lateral sterol domains, as characterized by microscopy approaches (13Rice P.A. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6445-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The formation of distinct cholesterol domains has also been observed in various membrane bilayer systems. Using small angle x-ray diffraction, it has been shown that increasing the relative cholesterol content to 50% of total phospholipid in model membrane bilayers produces an immiscible cholesterol monohydrate phase with a unit cell periodicity or d-space of 34.0 Å existing within the liquid crystalline lipid bilayer (16Ruocco M.J. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 695-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The periodicity of 34.0 Å corresponds to a tail-to-tail cholesterol bilayer, as the long axis of cholesterol monohydrate is 17 Å in the crystalline state (17Craven B.M. Nature. 1976; 260: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recent studies in our laboratories have also provided evidence for the existence of separate cholesterol domains in vascular smooth muscle cell plasma membranes under diseased, atherosclerotic conditions, a process characterized by an excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the vascular wall (18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these diseased membranes, the C/P mole ratio approached 1.0, a level that is 3-fold higher than in normal membranes. Small angle x-ray diffraction analysis of these membranes provided evidence for the formation of membrane-restricted cholesterol domainsin vivo under pathologic conditions. In the present study, small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to characterize the structural organization of cholesterol within fiber cell plasma membranes isolated from human ocular lenses. Immiscible cholesterol monohydrate domains were present in lens cortical and nuclear membrane samples, and these domains remained stable over a broad range of temperatures and relative humidity levels. Additionally, membrane protein content did not affect the presence or molecular dimensions of the observed cholesterol domains. The structurally distinct cholesterol phase was found to be restricted within the surrounding sterol-poor membrane bilayer phase with dimensions that were highly affected by temperature, humidity, and protein content. These results provide direct evidence for the existence of immiscible cholesterol monohydrate domains in human ocular lens fiber cell plasma membranes under physiologic-like conditions. The structural stability of these domains suggests a well ordered membrane system that must be conserved to maintain lens transparency to visible light. Six normal human lenses were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia). The ages of the lens sample donors ranged from 65 to 77 years. Lenses were decapsulated with the concomitant removal of lens epithelial cells that adhere to the capsule. The decapsulated lenses were placed in a 20-cm2 culture dish containing 8 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) and stirred on a rotatory mixer at 100 rpm for 2 h. Under these gentle stirring conditions, the lens cortex separated from the nucleus as clumps of fiber cells. Based on lens weight before and after fractionation, the removed cortex accounted for 48% of total lens volume. Cortical and nuclear lens regions were separately homogenized in 8 ml of buffer A using a glass Dounce homogenizer. Plasma membranes were isolated using the methods described by Russell, et al.(19Russell P. Robison Jr., W.G. Kinoshita J.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellets were washed twice with buffer A, extracted twice with 7 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and extracted twice with 0.1 mm NaOH. The pellets were then washed once with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3(buffer B) and were resuspended in 1.2–1.4 ml of buffer B. Small aliquots were taken for quantitation of protein using a modified Lowry assay (20Lees M.B. Paxman S. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47 (1): 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Main intrinsic protein of 26 kDa and its 22-kDa degradation product were overwhelmingly the principal proteins shown present by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the cortical and nuclear membrane preparations (data not shown). Total lipids from one-half of each membrane suspension were Folch-extracted as described previously (21Fleschner C.R. Cenedella R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dissolved in chloroform. Aliquots of these membrane lipid extracts were taken for gas-chromatograph quantitation of cholesterol (22Cenedella R.J. Lipids. 1982; 17: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and colorimetric assay of phospholipid (23Pollet S. Ermidou S. Le Saux F. Monge M. Baumann N. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 916-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Shoemaker W.J. Shajenko L. Chambers T.E. Herbette L.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μg (phospholipid) of plasma membrane samples (in buffer B) were loaded into Lucite sedimentation cells. Each sedimentation cell contained an aluminum foil substrate upon which the membrane pellets were collected. The membrane samples were centrifuged in a Sorvall AH-629 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor (DuPont) at 35,000 ×g for 50 min at 5 °C. Samples were washed three times with diffraction buffer (0.5 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.3). After the final washing cycle, the supernatants were removed, and the aluminum foil substrates, containing the membrane pellets, were removed from the sedimentation cells and mounted on curved glass supports. The samples were then placed in hermetically sealed brass canisters in which temperature and relative humidity were controlled during x-ray diffraction experiments. Aliquots of lens plasma membrane total lipid, initially solubilized in chloroform (see above), were added directly to 13 × 100 mm glass test tubes to yield 230 μg of phospholipid. The samples were then dried down under a steady stream of nitrogen gas to the sides and bottom of the test tubes while vortex mixing. Residual solvent was removed under vacuum. A volume of diffraction buffer was added to each test tube to yield a final phospholipid concentration of 0.38 mg/ml. Multilamellar vesicles were formed by vortex mixing the buffer and lens membrane lipids for 3 min at ambient temperature. Volumes yielding the equivalent of 200 μg of phospholipid for each sample were loaded into sedimentation cells. Oriented membrane multibilayers were prepared by centrifugation, as described above for the intact membrane samples. The oriented lens plasma membrane samples were aligned at grazing incidence with respect to a collimated, monochromatic x-ray beam (CuKα, λ = 1.54 Å) produced by a Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200, a high brilliance rotating anode microfocus generator (Rigaku USA, Danvers, MA). The fixed geometry beamline utilized a single Franks mirror providing nickel-filtered radiation (K α1 andK α2 unresolved) at the detection plane. Diffraction data were collected on a one-dimensional, position-sensitive electronic detector (Innovative Technologies, Newburyport, MA), the calibration of which was verified using cholesterol monohydrate crystals. The sample-to-detector distance used in these experiments was 150 mm. Representative two-dimensional diffraction patterns for each sample were also collected on a two-dimensional PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) at a sample-to-detector distance of 70 mm. The unit cell periodicity, or d-space, of the membrane lipid bilayer is the measured distance from the center of one lipid bilayer to the next, including surface hydration. The d-spaces for the membrane multibilayer samples were calculated using Bragg's Law,hλ=2dsinθEquation 1 in which h is the diffraction order number,λ is the wavelength of the x-ray radiation (1.54 Å),d is the membrane lipid bilayer unit cell periodicity, andθ is the Bragg angle equal to one-half the angle between the incident beam and scattered beam. Saturated salt solutions were used to define the relative humidity (RH) levels employed in these x-ray diffraction analyses. The following salt solutions (with associated RH in parentheses) were used in these experiments: MgCl2·6H2O (33%), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (52%), K2C4H4O6·½H2O (74%), (NH4)2SO4 (79%), NaKC4H4O6·4H2O (87%), Na2C4H4O6·2H2O (92%), NH4H2PO4 (93%), K2SO4 (97%). Small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to characterize directly the structural organization of plasma membranes isolated from human ocular lens fiber cells in the presence and absence of membrane protein. Representative x-ray diffraction profiles generated from oriented fiber cell plasma membranes at 20 °C, 92% RH are shown in Fig. 1. All samples yielded meridional diffraction patterns consistent with two structurally distinct membrane domains or phases: a sterol-poor liquid crystalline membrane bilayer phase, corresponding to diffraction orders 1 and 2, and an immiscible cholesterol monohydrate domain, defined by diffraction orders 1′ and 2′. Calculation of d-space values corresponding to these diffraction orders revealed distinct structural features of these separate lipid domains. The width of the sterol-poor membrane bilayer region varied with each sample, with intact plasma membranes from the cortex and nucleus (Fig. 1, A andC, respectively) yielding d-space values of 80.6 and 88.8 Å, respectively. In the absence of membrane protein (reconstituted membrane samples), the cortical and nuclear membrane lipid bilayer d-space was 79.1 Å (Fig. 1, B andD, respectively). In contrast, the d-space for the cholesterol domain remained unchanged at 34.0 Å. Two-dimensional representations of the x-ray diffraction data are shown in Fig.2.Figure 2Two-dimensional diffraction patterns obtained from oriented human ocular lens fiber cell plasma membrane samples. Data were collected at 40 °C, 74% RH. Meridional diffraction patterns were generated from intact plasma membrane samples (A) and reconstituted lipid membrane samples (B) isolated from the lens cortex. Diffraction bands are labeled as for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intact and reconstituted cortical and nuclear plasma membranes were examined over a temperature range of 5 to 40 °C (Fig.3). Diffraction peaks corresponding to an immiscible cholesterol domain were observed at every temperature level. The calculated width of the cholesterol domains was unaffected by temperature changes, with a reproducible d-space of 34.0 Å. In contrast, the surrounding lipid membrane bilayer phase was significantly affected by sample temperature. Consistent with a disordering effect with increasing temperature, elevating the temperature from 5 °C to 40 °C caused an overall decrease in membrane unit cell periodicity. Intact cortical and nuclear plasma membrane bilayer d-spaces decreased by 5.2 Å (7%) and 3.3 Å (5%), respectively. As observed for temperature, changes in relative humidity did not affect the presence of cholesterol monohydrate phases in each of the samples tested (Fig. 4). Over a range of 33 to 97% RH, the cholesterol domains remained highly organized and stable with a consistent d-space value of 34.0 Å. However, the surrounding membrane bilayer phase for each sample was significantly altered as a function of relative humidity. With increasing relative humidity, d-space values increased by 28.2 Å (54%) and 30.9 Å (60%) for intact and reconstituted lens cortical plasma membrane bilayer phases, respectively. Over the same relative humidity range, nuclear sample d-space values increased by 40.1 Å (79%) and 24.0 Å (44%) for intact and reconstituted samples, respectively. Cholesterol is asymmetrically distributed within typical eukaryotic cells, and it is estimated that more than 90% of cellular cholesterol associates with the plasma membrane (25Lange Y. Ramos B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15130-15134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This estimate is probably low for lens fiber cell plasma membranes, however, because mature fiber cells lack internal organelles, particularly in the lens nucleus (8Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membrane accounts for only ∼1% of total lens volume (26Bloemendal H. Zweers A. Vermorken F. Dunia I. Benedetti E.L. Cell Differ. 1972; 1: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 27Broekhuyse R.M. Kuhlmann E.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 19: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and surface area calculations have indicated that phospholipid accounts for only ∼1/3 of the lens plasma membrane (8Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because essentially all lens cholesterol is confined to this small portion of the total lens volume, the C/P mole ratios for native lens membranes are extremely high. In these studies, the C/P mole ratios ranged from 2.42 to 3.27 (Table I), consistent with previous reports (8Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li L.K. So L. Spector A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These ratios are significantly greater than the C/P values of 0.5–1.0 reported for the typical cell membrane (10Emmelot P. Jamison G.A. Robinson D.M. Mammalian Cell Membranes. Butterworths, Inc., Boston1977: 1-54Google Scholar). It is well established that C/P mole ratios in excess of 1 (i.e. 50 mole % sterol) can promote the formation of separate cholesterol domains in the cell membrane (12Houslay M.D. Stanley K.K. Dynamics of Biological Membranes: Influence on Synthesis, Structure and Function. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1982: 71-81Google Scholar). Numerous theoretical and model monolayer and bilayer studies have demonstrated that the systematic addition of cholesterol to biological membranes can eventually induce lateral phase separation, forming membrane-restricted immiscible sterol domains (11Engelman D.M.

Lipids. 1998; 92: 71-77Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent small angle x-ray diffraction studies in our laboratory have provided direct evidence for the formation of separate, membrane-restricted cholesterol domains in vascular smooth muscle cell plasma membranes isolated from animals modeling atherosclerosis, a process characterized by an excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the vascular wall (18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these diseased membranes, the C/P mole ratio approached 1.0, a level 3-fold higher than in normal membranes (18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies confirm the physicochemical propensity of cholesterol to form separate membrane phases at high relative concentrations. Because the C/P mole ratios of ocular lens fiber cell plasma membranes are extremely high, it has been proposed that these membrane bilayers are a mosaic of cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-poor regions (8Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, direct evidence for the existence of separate cholesterol domains in lens fiber cell plasma membrane has not been previously provided. Immediately evident from the results of this study is the presence of two structurally distinct membrane domains within the lens fiber cell plasma membrane: a sterol-poor liquid crystalline membrane bilayer phase and an immiscible sterol-rich monohydrate bilayer phase. A striking feature of the cholesterol monohydrate phase is its stability over a broad range of temperatures and relative humidity levels. In contrast, the sterol-poor liquid crystalline membrane bilayer phase was significantly influenced by temperature and humidity. The biochemical basis for these changes in membrane width may be attributed to the complex head group and acyl chain composition of the lens fiber cell plasma membrane. This question is being systematically evaluated in a separate study. The high levels of cholesterol present in these membrane samples may contribute to the stability of the lateral cholesterol phases. Cholesterol is present at levels 2.5–3.5-fold higher than required to produce sterol domains in previous studies (18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the phospholipid constitution of the surrounding membrane bilayer may promote cholesterol domain stability. Sphingomyelin and its derivative, 4,5-dihydrosphingomyelin, are the most abundant phospholipids in human ocular lens, accounting for more than 50% of total phospholipid (5Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Porter R.A. Taylor K.G. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 4333-4343PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol is known to have favorable molecular interactions with sphingomyelin (29Calhoun W.I. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Lund-Katz S. Laboda H.M. McLean L.R. Phillips M.C.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2020-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), exhibiting greater affinity for sphingomyelin-enriched plasma membranes than for other cellular membranes (32Wattenberg B.W. Silbert D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2284-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Demel R.A. Jansen J.W. van Dijck P.W. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 465: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms responsible for the preferential interaction of cholesterol with sphingomyelin are not fully understood, it is believed that an increased probability of van der Waal's forces may contribute to the strength of their interaction (14Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Lund-Katz S. Laboda H.M. McLean L.R. Phillips M.C.

It should be pointed out that sphingomyelin is not required for the formation of cholesterol domains since domains have been observed in systems composed exclusively of other lipids (28Bach D. Borochov N. Wachtel E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 92: 71-77Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), including dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (35Subramaniam S. McConnell H.M. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 1715-1718Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (13Rice P.A. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6445-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),N-palmitoylgalactosylsphingosine (16Ruocco M.J. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 695-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (28Bach D. Borochov N. Wachtel E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 92: 71-77Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, recent experiments conducted in our laboratory suggest that cholesterol domains form more readily in cholesterol/sphingomyelin binary mixtures and exhibit stability characteristics similar to that of cholesterol domains formed in the lens fiber cell plasma membrane (unpublished data). Slotte (14Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has published data suggesting that the high-affinity interactions of cholesterol with sphingomyelin may reduce the free energy needed to form the critical nuclei for the growth of cholesterol domains in cholesterol/sphingomyelin monolayers. In addition, the lateral surface pressure required to abolish lateral phase boundaries of cholesterol-rich domains appears to be significantly lower for cholesterol/dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayers than for mixtures of cholesterol/sphingomyelin (14Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the sphingomyelin-rich lens fiber cell membrane provides the ideal lipid milieu for forming very stable cholesterol domains. It is also interesting to note that nuclear lens membranes contain greater amounts of sphingomyelin (36Broekhuyse R.M. Daemen F.J.M. Snyder F. Lipid Metabolism in Mammals. Plenum Press, New York1977: 145-148Crossref Google Scholar) and saturated fatty acids (9Li L.K. So L. Spector A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) than do cortical membranes. This observation would suggest that cholesterol domains occur more readily in the lens nucleus, possibly explaining the fact that the diffraction peaks corresponding to the cholesterol domains in the intact nuclear samples were more well defined than in the intact cortical samples (compare Fig. 1, A and C). Protein content did not affect the presence of immiscible cholesterol domains within the lens fiber cell plasma membrane. However, the intensity of the cholesterol diffraction peaks was greater in the absence of membrane protein (reconstituted samples), which may be due to partial protein interference with diffraction of the cholesterol domains. It is also clear that the formation of cholesterol domains does not require lens membrane protein because cholesterol domains were present in reconstituted samples. Thus, lateral cholesterol domains occur within the phospholipid bilayer regions of the lens fiber cell plasma membrane. These data support a model that is consistent with the existence of separate cholesterol monohydrate bilayers within the plane of the cell membrane (Fig. 5). Individual cholesterol molecules appear to align in a tail-to-tail fashion, as described previously in model bilayers and atherosclerotic vascular smooth muscle cell membranes (18Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Harris J.S. Epps D.E. Davis S.R. Kezdy F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 34: 3851-3857Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography approaches have determined that the long-axis dimension of an individual cholesterol monohydrate molecule is 17 Å (17Craven B.M. Nature. 1976; 260: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); thus, a tail-to-tail orientation in the cholesterol bilayer yields a periodicity of 34.0 Å. The formation of cholesterol domains appears to be supported by direct interaction of cholesterol with the acyl chains of surrounding membrane phospholipids, independent of molecular interaction with membrane protein. This conclusion is supported by the observation of distinct cholesterol phases in bilayers reconstituted solely from lens fiber cell plasma membrane lipid. The functional significance of cholesterol domains within the ocular lens fiber cell plasma membrane is not completely understood. However, the essential function of the lens fiber cell plasma membrane is to maintain lens transparency to visible light throughout life, and the unusually high membrane concentrations of cholesterol appear to be critical for supporting this function. Using infrared spectroscopy approaches, it has been determined that the progressive increase in membrane cholesterol concentration moving from the lens cortex toward the lens nucleus is necessary to buffer the structural order of these two regions to similar fluidity levels (38Borchman D. Cenedella R.J. Lamba O.P. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This membrane ordering effect of cholesterol may be essential to maintaining lens transparency and is achieved only by significantly higher concentrations of cholesterol in nuclear versus cortical membranes. In addition to containing the highest relative levels of membrane cholesterol, the lens also contains high concentrations of soluble protein, known as lens cyrstallins. Association of crystallin, primarily α-crystallin, with the lens membrane has been shown to accompany the development of human and experimental animal cataracts (39Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 130-146PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cenedella R.J. Fleschner C.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Chandrasekher G. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This association may be promoted by reductions in membrane cholesterol as the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in the lens has been shown to induce the development of cataracts in rats (42Cenedella R.J. Bierkamper G.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 28: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), dogs (43Gerson R.J. MacDonald J.S. Alberts A.W. Chen J. Yudkovitz J.B. Greenspan M.D. Rubin L.F. Bokelman D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and humans (44Kirby T.J. Acher R.W.P. Perry H.O. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1962; 68: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 45Laughlin R.C. Carey T.F. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1962; PubMed Google Scholar). Maintenance of high membrane concentrations of cholesterol may attenuate the interaction of α-crystallin with the lens fiber cell membrane (46Tang D. Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is not understood. Based on the findings from this study, it is proposed that the formation of separate sterol-rich and -poor domains may interfere with the ability of extrinsic proteins to aggregate at the membrane surface. This hypothesis is currently being investigated in our laboratory and may lead to new insights into the effects of fiber cell plasma membrane lipid organization on cataract formation."
https://openalex.org/W2025439653,"To study the relationship between conventional kinesin's structure and function, we identified 13 lethal mutations in the Drosophila kinesin heavy chain motor domain and tested a subset for effects on mechanochemistry. S246F is a moderate mutation that occurs in loop 11 between the ATP- and microtubule-binding sites. While ATP and microtubule binding appear normal, there is a 3-fold decrease in the rate of ATP turnover. This is consistent with the hypothesis that loop 11 provides a structural link that is important for the activation of ATP turnover by microtubule binding. T291M is a severe mutation that occurs in α-helix 5 near the center of the microtubule-binding surface. It impairs the microtubule-kinesin interaction and directly effects the ATP-binding pocket, allowing an increase in ATP turnover in the absence of microtubules. The T291M mutation may mimic the structure of a microtubule-bound, partially activated state. E164K is a moderate mutation that occurs at the β-sheet 5a/loop 8b junction, remote from the ATP pocket. Surprisingly, it causes both tighter ATP-binding and a 2-fold decrease in ATP turnover. We propose that E164 forms an ionic bridge with α-helix 5 and speculate that it helps coordinate the alternating site catalysis of dimerized kinesin heavy chain motor domains.

Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). It is a heterotetramer comprised of 2 kinesin heavy chains (KHCs)1 and 2 light chains. The heavy chains dimerize to form an elongated stalk with 2 amino-terminal globular domains (“motor domains”) at one end and the light chains at the other end. The light chains and stalk are expected to bind the cytoplasmic cargoes that conventional kinesin transports. Each motor domain couples a cycle of ATP turnover to conformational changes and a cycle of microtubule binding and release that generates displacement toward the microtubule plus end. A single motor domain is not processive (2Berliner E. Young E.C. Anderson K. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Nature. 1995; 373: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In contrast, dimerized motor domains are remarkably processive, making hundreds of steps before releasing from the microtubule (4Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 5Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Nature. 1996; 380: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). This feature is probably critical for the resolute transport of small organelles that can present only one or a few kinesin molecules to a microtubule. The pathway of ATP hydrolysis has been studied in detail, and there is general agreement on a number of features of kinesin's alternating site mechanism (6Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A.

The model in Fig.1 illustrates some of those features in the context of its mechanochemical cycle. Free in solution, kinesin exists with ADP bound in its active site. The ATPase cycle begins as one motor domain binds to the microtubule, leading to rapid release of ADP (step 1). ATP binding at this empty active site (step 2) stimulates binding of the second motor domain to the microtubule and release of its ADP (step 3). Thus, the two motor domains of the dimer are coupled through this step. After ATP hydrolysis by the first head (step 4), a rate-limiting step occurs (step 5) encompassing both detachment from the microtubule and phosphate release. ATP binding to the second head and rebinding of the first head to the next forward site on the microtubule lattice 16 nm away advances the kinesin dimer center of mass by 8 nm (step 2′; Ref. 14Svoboda K. Schmidt C.F. Schnapp B.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). For KHC, recent evidence has ruled out step distances other than 8 nm and coupling ratios other than 1 ATP per 8 nm step (15Hua W. Young E.C. Fleming M.L. Gelles J.

The crystallographic analysis of KHC monomers with ADP bound revealed an extended β-sheet flanked on each side by 3 α-helices (see Fig. 4 B). The nucleotide-binding site is near the top of the sheet on the side occupied by helices 1–3. Evidence to date indicates that the binding of kinesin to microtubules is mediated by multiple contacts on the side of the molecule occupied by helices 4–6.

Crystallographic studies of rat KHC dimers with ADP bound showed the same motor domain structure seen with monomers and revealed that the heads are joined by coiled-coil interactions at α7. The dimer structure also revealed that a negatively charged portion of L8b on one head can approach a positively charged portion of L10 on the other head (Fig. 8). The opposing charges and proximity of these loops has raised the possibility of a salt bridge forming between the motor domains that may be important for the coordination of their mechanochemical cycles and consequently for the processive movement of kinesin.Figure 8Two ionic interactions that may influence dimeric kinesin structure and function.

Woehlke et al. (31Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) have discovered a number of probable microtubule-KHC contact sites by changing solvent-exposed, polar amino acids to alanine and testing for effects on both motility and microtubule stimulated ATPase activity. Several of those sites are concentrated in L11, α4, L12, and α5. Two additional in vitro mutagenesis studies have focused on the contributions of the KHC hinge I and neck regions to motor velocity and processivity. Changes in hinge I, which connects the neck to the beginning of the kinesin stalk, can alter the velocity of gliding movements dramatically, indicating that hinge I is important for normal motor domain mechanochemistry (32Grummt M. Woehlke G. Henningsen U. Fuchs S. Schleicher M. Schliwa M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5536-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Changes in α7 and other neck sequences can alter processivity but do not abolish it, suggesting that structural interactions between dimerized motor domains outside the neck region also contribute to processivity (33Romberg L. Pierce D.W. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have addressed questions of KHC structure-function using an approach that combines in vivo genetics and in vitromechanochemical tests. We reasoned that by screening for missense mutations that disrupt axonal transport (34Hurd D.D. Saxton W.M. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cause lethality inDrosophila, amino acid substitutions would be identified that affect kinesin mechanochemistry in ways that are physiologically relevant. By testing purified mutant motor domain dimers for motility, microtubule interaction, nucleotide-binding, and steady-state ATP turnover, we have identified two amino acids that are important for communication from the microtubule-binding site to the nucleotide-binding site and one likely to form an ionic bridge between β5a/L8b and α5; a bridge that influences nucleotide binding and may be involved in coordinating the ATPase and microtubule-binding cycles of dimerized heads.

Drosophila were cultured at 25 °C with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle on standard soft medium (0.5% agar, 7% molasses, 6% cornmeal, and 0.8% killed yeast) seeded with live yeast. Descriptions of some of the mutations used in this study can be found in Lindsley and Zimm (35Lindsley D.L. Zimm G.G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Description ofKhc 1 -Khc 13 can be found in Saxton et al. (36Saxton W.M. Hicks J. Goldstein L.S.B. Raff E.C. Cell. 1991; 64: 1093-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All other Khc alleles were isolated in a standard F2 screen for new recessive-lethal alleles ofKhc. 2D. J. Rose, K. M. Brendza, and W. M. Saxton, manuscript in preparation. Chromosomes mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate were tested overKhc 8, a null mutation. Those that failed to complement Khc 8 were retested overDf(2R)Jp6, a deletion that removes Khc. They were then tested over Df(2R)Jp6 with a wild-type Khctransgene present in the background. Chromosomes that failed to complement Df(2R)Jp6 and were rescued by the Khctransgene were maintained in balanced stocks for subsequent tests. To determine the lethal profiles caused by the Khc mutations reported here, adult males and virgin females of the genotypesKhc m/T (2Berliner E. Young E.C. Anderson K. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Nature. 1995; 373: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Hancock W.O. Howard J. J.

After hatching, second instar larvae of the genotypeKhc m/Df(2R)Jp6 were isolated and then observed for lethality throughout development as described previously (36Saxton W.M. Hicks J. Goldstein L.S.B. Raff E.C. Cell. 1991; 64: 1093-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Adult male flies that carried eachKhc allele in the following genotype: w; Khcm/Df (2R) Jp6; P{w+,wumk9}/+, were collected and stored at −80 °C.P{w+,wumk9} is a stable P-element insert that contains a wild-type copy of Khc cDNA fused to a c-myc epitope tag (37deCuevas M. An Analysis of the Stalk of Drosophila Kinesin Heavy Chain. Doctoral thesis. Harvard University, Boston, MA1993Google Scholar). High level expression is driven by a ubiquitin promoter. The Myc-KHC fusion protein completely rescues the lethality caused by Khcnull mutations. Total protein was extracted from male flies by homogenization in cold extraction buffer as described previously at a volume of 8 μl of extraction buffer/animal (38Saxton W.M. Porter M.E. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. Raff E.C. McIntosh J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation: 2 fly equivalents of each supernatant were run on a 5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose (38Saxton W.M. Porter M.E. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. Raff E.C. McIntosh J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Myc-KHC fusion protein migrated more slowly than native KHCs in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, allowing comparison of their relative levels. Both KHCs were detected by incubation in a mouse monoclonal anti-Drosophila KHC antibody, Flyk-2, diluted 1:50 followed by incubation in an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse serum at 1:1000 (36Saxton W.M. Hicks J. Goldstein L.S.B. Raff E.C. Cell. 1991; 64: 1093-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated fromKhc m /Df(2R)Jp6 pre-lethal larvae using the QIAmp Tissue Kit. Overlapping ∼300-base pair fragments of genomic DNA covering the entire coding sequence of Khc were amplified separately using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were then purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit. DNA was sequenced using a Thermo Sequenase sequencing kit, and the reactions were run on an ABI automated sequencer. Both sense and antisense strands were sequenced and in areas that had changes both strands were sequenced at least twice. The expression plasmid pEY4, used for motility assays, contains aDrosophila Khc cDNA that encodes the NH2-terminal 401 residues of Khc fused to a cDNA that encodes the COOH-terminal 87 residues ofEscherichia coli Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein. This construct was generously provided by Dr. Jeff Gelles (39Berlinear E. Mahtani H.K. Karki S. Chu L.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelles J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8610-8615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations tested were inserted by restriction digest at 2 unique sites (NruI and BssHII) in wild-type Khc. Mutant Khc inserts were amplified from mutant genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-GTCAAGGGCGCTACGGAACG-3′ and 5′-TGCTTGCCTCCATGAGATCC-3′. After restriction digestion, the plasmid and amplification products were ligated using T4 DNA ligase and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Plasmids isolated from single colonies were sequenced. Those containing the appropriate mutations and no other changes were subsequently transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells for protein expression as described in Berlinear et al.(39Berlinear E. Mahtani H.K. Karki S. Chu L.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelles J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8610-8615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After induction, cells were harvested and subjected to 3 cycles of freezing (liquid N2) and thawing (37 °C). The cell extract was then centrifuged and the resulting supernatant (approximately 4 ml) was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of storage buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 10 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 10 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The cell extract was not capable of producing microtubule-based movements in the gliding assay described below. To enrich for active K401-BIO motors, the clarified dialysate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 7 mmmagnesium/AMP-PNP and 0.4 mg/ml taxol-stabilized microtubules followed by centrifugation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a salt wash (75 mm NaCl + 7 mm Mg/AMP-PNP in extraction buffer) to remove proteins that were nonspecifically bound to microtubules. After sedimentation, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 mm MgATP plus 100 mm NaCl in extraction buffer to release K401-BIO motors. After centrifugation, the supernatant was stored on ice and used within 24 h for motility assays. These preparations induced microtubule gliding but the gliding was not smooth, suggesting that either the inactive motors were not completely eliminated or misorientation of the motor on the glass prevented efficient motility. The supernatants were also characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots. The blots were probed with either anti-KHC (FLYK-2) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin. The KHC bands stained heavily with avidin, indicating that the motors were indeed biotinylated by the bacteria (data not shown). A few faint lower molecular weight polypeptide bands were also observed. Those biotinylated polypeptides did not cross-react with anti-KHC. Similar low molecular weight biotinylated proteins produced by this expression system have been previously reported (39Berlinear E. Mahtani H.K. Karki S. Chu L.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelles J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8610-8615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The motors used for kinetic analyses were re-engineered to eliminate the biotin tag and a new purification scheme was used to minimize the loss of motor activity. Motor domain mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Chameleon Double-stranded Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit) into a plasmid, pET5b-K401, that has been used extensively for previous kinetic analysis (6Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A.

The mutagenic primers used were as follows: K401-4 (5′-CCGTGATTCCAAGCTTATGC-GCATCCTGCAG-3′); K401-23 (5′-GTGTGCACAAGGATAAGAAC-3′); K401-17 (5′-GGTTCCGAGAAGGTTTTCAAGACTGGAGCGG-3′); and K401-37 (5′-CTGCCCTGGCGAACGGAAACAAAACGCAC-3′). The selection primer (5′-CTAATCCTGTTACTAGTGGCTGC-3′) removed a AlwNI site from the pET5b plasmid. Plasmids isolated from single colonies were sequenced. Those containing only the desired mutations were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Each of the Khc alleles was expressed as described previously with slight modifications (40Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Four 2-liter cultures were incubated at 37 °C untilA 600 = 0.5. The cells were then temperature shifted to 20–22 °C and induced with 0.075 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were cultured overnight, harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, then stored at −80 °C until purification. For protein purification, approximately 30 g of cells were diluted to a final volume of 180 ml (1 g/6 ml) in lysis buffer (10 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.2, 75 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus lysozyme to 0.1 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 45 min with gentle stirring. The cells were then lysed by 3 cycles of freezing (liquid N2) and thawing (37 °C). The cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation yielding a supernatant of ∼140 ml. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 100-ml S-Sepharose column that was equilibrated with S-Sepharose column buffer (10 mmNaPO4 buffer, pH 7.2, 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.02 mm ATP). The column was eluted with a 600-ml linear salt gradient (75–600 mm NaCl). The K401 protein eluted at approximately 100 mm NaCl. Fractions enriched in K401 were pooled and dialyzed against DEAE buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.02 mm ATP). The dialysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation and passed over a 15-ml DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with DEAE buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.02 mm ATP). The column was eluted with a 200-ml linear salt gradient (50–400 mm KCl). The K401 protein eluted at approximately 80–100 mm KCl. Fractions enriched in K401 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Centriprep 30) to ∼5 ml. The concentrated K401 was then dialyzed twice against ATPase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 5% sucrose adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH), clarified, and stored at −80 °C. This procedure yielded 4–10 mg of highly purified K401 per 30 g of E. coli. The protein concentration of the kinesin preparations was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Protein Assay with ovalbumin and IgG as standards). It was also measured spectrophotometrically atA 280 and A 259 to determine the concentration of the stoichiometrically bound ADP (40Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, the concentration of active kinesin was determined using the creatine kinase-coupled assay described previously (41Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The active site concentration for each preparation varied from 90 to 99% of the protein concentration estimated by the Bradford method. For the experiments reported, the concentration of kinesin is based on the active site concentration of the preparation. Bovine brain tubulin was prepared as described previously (40Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the day of each experiment, an aliquot of tubulin was thawed, cycled, and then stabilized with 20 μmtaxol. Microtubule-gliding assays were performed using K401-BIO preparations as described by Berlinear et al.(39Berlinear E. Mahtani H.K. Karki S. Chu L.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelles J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8610-8615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that α-casein was used in all washes instead of bovine serum albumin. Samples were observed by video-enhanced differential interference microscopy using an Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a 100 × Plan-Neofluar objective, a Hamamatsu C2400 series video camera, and an Argus-10 image processor (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Images were recorded on Maxell S-VHS tapes using Mitsubishi model BV-1000 Professional Video Cassette recorder. Microtubule movements were measured directly from the video monitor. ATPase assays were performed at 25 °C in ATPase buffer at 50 mm potassium acetate by following the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP as described previously (40Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All concentrations are reported as final values after mixing. To initiate an ATPase reaction, a 5-μl aliquot of MT·K401 complex (0.5 μm K401, 0.25–20.0 μm tubulin, and 20 μm taxol) was mixed with 5 μl of substrate (0.01–2.0 mm MgATP and trace [α-32P]ATP). After incubation for times varying from 5 to 120 s, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 4 n HCl followed by the addition of 20 μl of chloroform, and neutralization with 8.7 μl of 2 m Tris, 3 m NaOH (final pH 7–7.8). 1.5 μl of each quenched reaction was spotted on a p"

To determine roles played by individual members of the large myosin superfamily, we designed a mutation in myosin's nucleotide-binding pocket that permits binding of adenine nucleotides modified with bulky N 6substituents. Introduction of this mutation, Y61G in rat myosin-Iβ, did not alter the enzyme's affinity for ATP or actin and actually increased its ATPase activity and actin-translocation rate. We also synthesized several N 6-modified ADP analogs that should bind to and inhibit mutant, but not wild-type, myosin molecules. Several of these N 6-modified ADP analogs were more than 40-fold more potent at inhibiting ATP hydrolysis by Y61G than wild-type myosin-Iβ; in doing so, these analogs locked Y61G myosin-Iβ tightly to actin.N 6-(2-methylbutyl) ADP abolished actin filament motility mediated by Y61G, but not wild-type, myosin-Iβ.

The myosin superfamily contains at least 15 major classes, eight or more of which are found in vertebrates. Because multiple myosin isozymes are found within each class, the superfamily is large; for example, the murine genome has more than 30 myosin genes (3Hasson T. Skowron J.F. Gilbert D.J. Avraham K.B. Perry W.L. Bement W.M. Genomics. 1996; 36: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Probst F.J. Fridell R.A. Raphael Y. Saunders T.L. Wang A. Liang Y. Morell R.J. Touchman J.W. Lyons R.H. Noben-Trauth K. Friedman T.B. Camper S.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Myosin molecules share a common three-domain structure: an actin- and ATP-binding head that carries out chemomechanical transduction, an extended neck or lever domain that binds light chains of the calmodulin family and amplifies small movements within the head, and diverse tail domains that couple myosin molecules to other cellular structures (2Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Although roles have been identified for conventional myosin isozymes (the myosin-II class), elucidating cellular functions for unconventional myosin isozymes has been notably difficult. Cells may express a dozen or more myosin isozymes simultaneously (5Bement W.M. Hasson T. Wirth J.A. Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6549-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Solc C.K. Derfler B.H. Duyk G.M. Corey D.P.

Roles for other isozymes have been inferred from consequences of null or inhibitory mutations, either those occurring naturally (4Probst F.J. Fridell R.A. Raphael Y. Saunders T.L. Wang A. Liang Y.

As with other genes, null mutations can lead to developmental abnormalities or compensatory responses. Accordingly, gene deletion may not be the best approach for understanding myosin function. An isozyme-selective myosin inhibitor that could be applied acutely would be a powerful tool for unveiling myosin function. Unfortunately, active-site conservation between myosin isozymes assures that nucleotide analogs that bind one isozyme should bind to others. Although inhibitory antibodies can be useful (7Doberstein S.K. Baines I.C. Wiegand G. Korn E.D. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 841-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), they are often difficult to deliver easily into cells and may not successfully inhibit myosin molecules that are bound to other proteins within cells. We chose instead to design a mutation that would render a myosin isozyme sensitive to a nucleotide analog that otherwise did not bind native myosin molecules. Once these mutant myosin molecules have been introduced into a cell, processes dependent on that isozyme should become sensitive to the inhibitor. This strategy uses as its inspiration other examples of modification of enzymatic specificity by protein engineering. For instance, the substrate specificity of the GTPase superfamily can be changed from guanine nucleotide- to xanthine nucleotide-dependent by changing a conserved Asp (in the motif NKXD) to Asn (17Weijland A.

In a second example, nucleotide-binding pockets of protein-tyrosine kinases can be altered to accept certainN 6-substituted adenosine triphosphates, which otherwise did not serve as substrates for known kinases (25Shah K.

We have designed a missense mutant of rat myosin-Iβ, replacing tyrosine-61 with glycine (Y61G), which has little effect on ATP hydrolytic activity yet renders the mutant sensitive to N 6-modified adenosine diphosphates. These analogs inhibit ATP hydrolysis by preventing myosin dissociation from actin, inducing a tightly bound state that arrests actin filament motility in an in vitro motility assay. By introducing Y61G myosin-Iβ (equivalent to Y135G in Dictyostelium discoideumand chicken muscle myosin-II) into cells, we should be able to selectively inhibit mutant myosin and the cellular processes in which it participates. Life Technologies, Inc. was the source of Grace's medium, lactalbumin hydrolysate, yeastolate, Pluronic F-68, gentamicin, and fetal calf serum. The pBlueBacHis2B transfer vector, linearized DNA from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, cationic liposomes, and anti-DLYDDDDK antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA). Reagents for unique-site elimination, Superdex 200 columns, phenyl-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephadex, and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Ni2+-NTA)1 was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Frozen bovine brains and rabbit muscle acetone powder (special order) were purchased from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR). Microtiter plates were either Immulon from Dynex (West Sussex, UK), or high binding plates from Xenopore (Hawthorne, NJ). All SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents, dithiothreitol, and Tween 20 were from Bio-Rad. Secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL), whereas bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents and p-nitrophenol phosphate were from Pierce. ATP, ADP, catalase, glucose oxidase, and protein A were from Sigma. Adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADPβS) and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Calbiochem, whereas rhodamine-phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Nitrocellulose in isoamyl alcohol was from Ernest Fullam (Latham, NY). Insight II (version 4.0.0), used to prepare the structure in Fig.1 A, was obtained from Molecular Simulations (San Diego, CA). Analogs 1-6(see Fig. 5 B) were synthesized as described previously (25Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar); 6-chloropurine riboside (Aldrich) was refluxed with aniline, benzylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, 3-methylbenzylamine, 1-methylbutylamine, or 2-methylbutylamine, respectively, in ethanol overnight (29Kikugawa K. Iizuka K. Ichino M. J. Med. Chem. 1973; 16: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Triphosphate synthesis was carried out as described previously (25Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). N 6-modified nucleoside diphosphates were isolated as a by-product (about 20% of total) of the triphosphate synthesis. Nucleotides were purified on DEAE-Sephadex (A-25) using a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.5. These compounds were characterized by 1H NMR and mass spectral analysis. Nucleotides were also characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography on a strong anion-exchange column (Rainin SAX-83-E03-ETI), using a linear gradient of 5–750 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.9, for 10 min, followed by isocratic elution at 750 mm ammonium phosphate for 10 min. Typical retention time difference between diphosphates and triphosphates was about 2 min. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we modified the pBlueBacHis2B baculovirus transfer vector by adding an NcoI site immediately following the enterokinase cleavage site. We also removed an NcoI site in the original multiple cloning site by KpnI digestion, removal of 3′ overhangs with T4 DNA polymerase and deoxynucleotides, and religation; the modified plasmid was termed pBlueBacHis2B-Nco. The plasmid C myr2 tag pCMV5 (30Ruppert C. Godel J. Muller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the cDNA sequence for rat myosin-Iβ with a COOH-terminal myc epitope tag (courtesy of Dr. Martin Bähler), was digested with NcoI andBamHI; after purification, myosin-Iβ cDNA was ligated to NcoI- and BamHI-digested pBlueBacHis2B-Nco to generate the plasmid pBBHis2B-rmyoIβ. Sequencing was carried out to ensure the fidelity of the cloning junctions. When expressed, the recombinant myosin-Iβ contained an extra 34 amino acids at its NH2 terminus, including a hexahistidine tag, an antibody epitope (DLYDDDDK), and an enterokinase protease cleavage site. The COOH terminus contained the 10-amino acid c-myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL). Mutagenesis of tyrosine-61 of wild-type myosin-Iβ to glycine was carried out using unique-site elimination (31Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), adding aKpnI site, and was confirmed by sequencing. Sf9 cells were cotransfected with pBBHis2B-rmyoIβ (with or without the Y61G mutation) and linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genomic DNA using cationic liposomes; recombinant plaques were identified using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside staining. Virus stocks were manipulated using standard methods (32O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Xenopus laeviscalmodulin, incorporated into baculovirus using the pVL1393 transfer vector, was provided by Dr. James Sellers. Rat myosin-Iβ was expressed by infecting Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses. In a typical purification, 4–8 × 108 Sf9 cells, in 400 ml of Grace's medium that contained 3.3 mg/ml lactalbumin hydrolysate, 3.3 mg/ml yeastolate, 20 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.1% Pluronic F-68, and 10% fetal calf serum, were infected with myosin-Iβ and calmodulin viruses at multiplicities of infection of 4 and 2, respectively. After shaking at 100 rpm in a 2,500-ml low form culture flask for 48 h at 27 °C, cells were centrifuged at 1,500 × g, washed with Grace's medium without serum, and recentrifuged. Pelleted cells were usually stored at −80 °C before use. For purification, cells were thawed, resuspended with purification buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin), and lysed by passing twice each through 22- and 25-guage needles. This and all subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The solution was adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm ATP and was centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min. After applying the high-speed supernatant to a 1-ml Ni2+-NTA column, the column was washed with purification buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Myosin-Iβ (and contaminating Sf9 cell proteins) was eluted at pH 8.0 with 250 mm imidazole, 25 mm Tris, 200 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin. In some experiments, myosin-Iβ was purified further by cycling on and off actin filaments. 10 μm purified actin, stabilized with 10 μm unlabeled phalloidin was added to the Ni2+-NTA eluate; after incubation on ice for 30 min, the solution was centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the actin pellet was resuspended with 1 mm ATP, 0.3% Tween 20, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 15 mm HEPES at pH 7.5; the solution was recentrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min. We confirmed that this concentration of Tween 20, included to minimize protein adsorption and aggregation, does not affect myosin ATPase activity (data not shown). Active myosin-Iβ was in the supernatant. Frog myosin-Iβ, expressed in Sf9 cells with a baculovirus vector 2S. Jean and P. G. Gillespie, unpublished data. was purified to >90% by purification of the Ni2+-NTA eluate with gel filtration on Superdex 200. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder as described (33Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar); its concentration was determined assuming 38.5 μm/A 290 nm. Calmodulin was purified from bovine brain using isoelectric precipitation and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (34Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar); its concentration was determined assuming 330 μm/A 276 nm (35Wallace R.W. Tallant E.A. Cheung W.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The concentration of myosin-Iβ was measured using an ELISA. Frog myosin-Iβ was used as a standard (typically 0–100 ng/well). The concentration of frog myosin-Iβ was determined assuming 6.8 μm/A 280 nm, assuming two bound calmodulin molecules (36Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (calculated from sequences using the ExPASy tool ProParam; see Ref. 37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). This value was confirmed by measuring the concentration of frog myosin-Iβ using the Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and bicinchoninic acid (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) protein assays, which when averaged together gave a protein concentration similar to that determined from absorbance. Solutions of partially purified rat myosin-Iβ or purified frog myosin-Iβ were diluted with PBS and applied overnight to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. After the remaining protein-binding sites were blocked for 1 h with 0.3% Tween 20 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS (ELISA block), primary antibody was applied in ELISA block for 1–2 h. The primary antibody was anti-DLYDDDDK (1:5,000), which recognized epitope tags on frog and rat myosin-Iβ. After washing with water, bound antibodies were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000) in ELISA block. After incubation with 3 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate, alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. The ATPase assay solution contained 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 15 mm HEPES at pH 7.5. Assays also included [γ-32P]ATP (∼60,000 cpm/sample) and unlabeled ATP; KCl was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. Myosin ATPase activity was measured in 10 μl total volume; after mixing components in 1.7-ml siliconized microfuge tubes and initiating the reaction with [γ-32P]ATP or a mixture of actin and myosin, tubes were centrifuged for ∼5 s. After incubation at 37 °C for 10–40 min, reactions were terminated with silicotungstic acid and sulfuric acid and [γ-32P]Pi was recovered using isobutanol:benzene (1:1) and ammonium molybdate as described (40Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To account for the intrinsic ATPase activity of actin and its inhibition by adenine nucleotides, we always included in our assays control samples lacking myosin-Iβ but including actin and appropriate nucleotides. Data were plotted as the mean ± S.D. of 2–5 (usually 3) samples. Inhibition data in Figs. 4, 6, and 7 were fit with:Velocity(%of control)=[I][I]+IC50Equation 1 where [I] is the concentration of the nucleotide analog and IC50 is the concentration yielding 50% inhibition. IC50 values were occasionally extrapolated from data sets showing very little inhibition; confidence in these IC50values was therefore poor (e.g. inhibition of wild-type myosin-Iβ by some analogs). Binding data in Fig. 7 were plotted as described in the legend.Figure 6Inhibition of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis by N6-modified adenosine diphosphates. ATPase activity was measured as in Fig. 4 legend. Analogs were: A,N 6(benzyl) ADP; B,N 6(2-phenethyl) ADP; C,N 6(2-methyl butyl) ADP; D,N 6(3-methyl benzyl) ADP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Effect of N6-modified ADP analogs on ATP-actin-myosin binding. Binding of myosin-Iβ in the Ni2+-NTA eluate was measured at 25 °C in the presence of 100 μm ATP and 12.5 μm actin. Results are plotted with 100% corresponding to the amount of myosin remaining in the supernatant with actin and ATP only and 0% corresponding to the amount of myosin remaining in the supernatant with actin and no nucleotides. A, for ADP, the K 0.5(half-maximal concentration for promoting myosin association with actin) was 85 μm for wild type and 940 μmfor Y61G. B, for N 6(2-phenethyl) ADP, the K 0.5 was >1,000 μm for wild type and 25 μm for Y61G. C, forN 6(2-methyl butyl) ADP, theK 0.5 was >2,000 μm for wild type and 10 μm for Y61G. D, forN 6(2-methyl)benzyl ADP, theK 0.5 was >2,000 μm for wild type and 300 μm for Y61G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The standard buffer was ATPase assay solution. Myosin (0.02–0.1 μm) and actin (12.5 μm) were mixed at room temperature in the presence of various concentrations of adenine nucleotides; the solution was immediately centrifuged at 550,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C to sediment actin filaments. Supernatants were removed and the concentration of myosin-Iβ was measured by ELISA. We used the sliding filament assay (41Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) modified to use tail-specific antibodies to immobilize myosin molecules (42Winkelmann D.A. Bourdieu L. Ott A. Kinose F. Libchaber A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 43Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips coated with nitrocellulose (0.1% in isoamyl alcohol) were assembled into flow chambers; chambers were sequentially incubated with 0.5 mg/ml protein A in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, block solution (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, and 0.25 mg/ml anti-myosin-Iβ antibody (R2652) 3Y.-D. Zhao and P. G. Gillespie, unpublished data. in block solution at 4 °C overnight. This antibody recognizes the COOH-terminal 15 kDa of rat myosin-Iβ. Subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. Chambers were then washed with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in ATPase assay solution and incubated with myosin-Iβ (0.025 mg/ml) for 1 h. Flow chambers were washed, treated for 2 min with 20 nm rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin in wash buffer, and finally incubated with motility buffer (ATPase assay buffer containing 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm calmodulin, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mg/ml catalase, 0.25 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 3 mg/ml glucose). Motility was observed at room temperature (23–25 °C) on an Axiovert inverted microscope, equipped with a 63× Plan Neofluar objective and 1.6× Optivar accessory lens (all from Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Images were captured with an intensified CCD camera (Photon Technologies International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) using an AG-5 frame-grabber board from Scion (Frederick, MD) in an Apple Macintosh G3. Acquisition was controlled by and filament movement was measured with a modified version of NIH Image, Scion Image 1.62a (Scion). To measure actin filament velocity, we calculated the centroid position (short filaments) or the leading edge (long filaments) of each filament at 5-s intervals and averaged filament velocity over 20 frames. Data were collected from multiple protein preparations each of wild-type and Y61G myosin-Iβ; velocities of at least 30 filaments in three separate fields were counted. We sought to design mutations in myosin that would render it sensitive to modified adenosine diphosphates yet maintain normal ATP hydrolysis. In a two-fold approach, we designed nucleotide analogs that were modified on theN 6 amine, the furthest position on the adenine base from the 5′-triphosphate. To these nucleotide analogs, we needed to then create an additional cavity in the nucleotide-binding site of myosin. We identified amino acid positions in the binding pocket with bulky side chains that could be compacted by substitution by examining the crystal structures of D. discoideum myosin-II complexed with nucleotides (44Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 45Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I.

Biol. 1997; 274: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In each of these structures, the side chain of tyrosine-135 forms a hydrogen bond with N 6 of the nucleotide (Fig. 1 A). We reasoned that this tyrosine might be amenable to substitution for the following reasons. First, in some myosin isozymes, other amino acids occupy the position corresponding to Tyr-135, including leucine inAcanthamoeba castellanii myosin-IB, serine in D. discoideum myosin-IB, and phenylalanine in Drosophila melanogaster myosin-III (ninaC) (48Cope M.J.T.V. Whisstock J. Rayment I. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 1996; : 969-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ATPase activity and motility of A. castellanii myosin-IB have been studied in detail and resemble closely those of other well characterized myosin isozymes (49Albanesi J.P. Fujisaki H. Hammer III, J.A. Korn E.D. Jones R. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8649-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Second, modifications at the C6 position of ATP are tolerated by myosin; even analogs such as 2′,3′-O-isopropylidene-6-chloropurine ribose (51Tonomura Y. Imamura K. Ikehara M. Uno H. Harada F. J. Biochem. 1967; 61: 460-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or 2-[(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]ethyl triphosphate and its derivatives (52Wang D. Pate E. Cooke R. Yount R. J. Muscle Res.

J. 1991; 59: 598-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are hydrolyzed by myosin-II and support muscle contraction. These data suggest that although a hydrogen bond between Tyr-135 and a nitrogen or oxygen at the C6 position of a nucleotide may be optimal for motor activity (51Tonomura Y."
https://openalex.org/W1969510839,"PYK2/CAKβ is a recently described cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase related to p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) that can be activated by a number of stimuli including growth factors, lipids, and some G protein-coupled receptors. Studies suggest PYK2/CAKβ may be important for coupling various G protein-coupled receptors to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The hormone neurotransmitter cholecystokinin (CCK) is known to activate both phospholipase C-dependent cascades and MAPK signaling pathways; however, the relationship between these remain unclear. In rat pancreatic acini, CCK-8 (10 nm) rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PYK2/CAKβ by both activation of high affinity and low affinity CCKA receptor states. Blockage of CCK-stimulated increases in protein kinase C activity or CCK-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i, inhibited by 40–50% PYK2/CAKβ but not p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Simultaneous blockage of both phospholipase C cascades inhibited PYK2/CAKβ tyrosine phosphorylation completely and p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by 50%. CCK-8 stimulated a rapid increase in PYK2/CAKβ kinase activity assessed by both an in vitrokinase assay and autophosphorylation. Total PYK2/CAKβ under basal conditions was largely localized (77 ± 7%) in the membrane fraction, whereas total p125FAK was largely localized (86 ± 3%) in the cytosolic fraction. With CCK stimulation, both p125FAK and PYK2/CAKβ translocated to the plasma membrane. Moreover CCK stimulation causes a rapid formation of both PYK2/CAKβ-Grb2 and PYK2/CAKβ-Crk complexes. These results demonstrate that PYK2/CAKβ and p125FAK are regulated differently by CCKA receptor stimulation and that PYK2/CAKβ is probably an important mediator of downstream signals by CCK-8, especially in its ability to activate the MAPK signaling pathway, which possibly mediates CCK growth effects in normal and neoplastic tissues.

In the central nervous system, CCK has such widespread effects as functioning as a potent regulator of satiety and morphine-induced analgesia, modulating dopamine release, stimulating panic attacks, and stimulating vagal afferent transmission (1Liddle R.A.

With different GPCRs, the coupling to PYK2/CAKβ and the mechanisms of the possible coupling of these different intracellular cascades vary widely.At present, it is unknown whether CCKA receptor activation stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2/CAKβ or whether its ability to activate one or both limbs of the PLC cascade is important for this tyrosine phosphorylation if it occurs. It is also unknown whether PYK2/CAKβ activation might be an important intermediate in coupling the CCKA receptor activation to MAPK cascade activation, which is important in mediating the potent effects of this receptor's activation on normal and neoplastic tissues. In the present study, the ability of CCKA receptor activation to stimulate PYK2/CAKβ tyrosine phosphorylation and its relationship with these other intracellular signaling cascades was explored in pancreatic acini, which are one of the main physiological sites of action of CCK.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMale Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (150–200 g) were obtained from the Small Animals Section, Veterinary Resources Branch, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) or from the Animal Farm, Faculty of Veterinary (Universidad de Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain); purified collagenase (type CLSPA) was from Worthington; COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8) was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA); CCK-JMV was obtained from Research Plus Inc.

Homogenates were centrifuged first at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and debris and then for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to obtain membrane and cytosol fractions. Precipitates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2 mmNa3VO4 at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and sonicated for 5 s at 4 °C.

Nine LXXLL receptor-interacting motifs are organized into two clusters within this molecule, each differentially interacting with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). RAR interacts with the 5′ cluster, whereas RXR interacts with both clusters. Additionally, a third ligand-dependent receptor-interacting domain is assigned to the very C terminus of this molecule, which contains no LXXLL motif. In mammalian cells, receptor heterodimerization is required for efficient interaction of RAR/RXR with RIP140. Furthermore, the heterodimeric, holoreceptors cooperatively interact with RIP140, which requires the activation function 2 domains of both receptors. By using different retinoic acid reporter systems, it is demonstrated that RIP140 strongly suppresses retinoic acid induction of reporter activities, but coactivator SRC-1 enhances it. Furthermore, an intrinsic repressive activity of RIP140 is demonstrated in a GAL4 fusion system. Unlike receptor corepressor, which interacts with antagonist-bound RAR/RXRs, RIP140 does not interact with antagonist-occupied RAR/RXR dimers.

The steroid hormone receptors, such as androgen receptor, estrogen receptor (ER),1 and orphan receptors TR2, TR4, and chicken or albumin upstream promoter-transcription factors form homodimers, whereas nonsteroid hormone receptors, such as retinoic acid (RAR) thyroid, and vitamin D receptors, and oxysterol and fatty acid receptors (PPARs) heterodimerize with a common partner, retinoid X receptor (RXR) (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

In addition to these common receptor dimerization pathways, heterodimerization can also occur for orphan receptors TR2/TR4 and ERα/ERβ (4Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

The modular structure of nuclear receptors can be divided, from the 5′- to the 3′-ends, into the N-terminal region containing activation function 1 (AF-1) domain, the DNA binding domain, the hinge region, and the ligand binding domain (LBD). A ligand-dependent AF-2 domain is located in LBD. Recent studies have revealed that transrepression by apo receptors is mediated by histone deacetyltransferase complexes, which are recruited by corepressors N-CoR/silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor through interaction with the hinge region of apo receptors (6Heinzel T.

Upon ligand binding, a conformational change in the LBD releases corepressors and recruits coactivators by re-positioning helix 12 (AF-2 domain).

It is suggested that nuclear receptor/coregulator (coactivator or corepressor) complexes alter the chromatin structure by modifying the acetylation status of histone, thereby regulating the expression of target genes. It has been demonstrated that the LXXLL motifs in SRC-1 and TIF2 are essential for these coactivators to interact with holoreceptors (17Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

The human receptor-interacting protein (human RIP140), originally cloned as a strong ER-interacting protein, has been proposed as a coactivator based upon the presence of nine LXXLL motifs in this molecule and its ligand-dependent interaction with nuclear hormone receptors (19Cavailles V.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, its role in nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation has been controversial (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol.

We have recently isolated the mouse homologue of human RIP140 and demonstrated that the mouse RIP140 functions as a corepressor for orphan receptor TR2 in a ligand-independent manner (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although RIP140 interacts with RAR in its holo form, it also interacts with apo-TR2. In addition, this ligand-independent interaction of RIP140 with TR2 is also mediated by the putative AF-2 of TR2 and the LXXLL motifs of RIP140. Retinoids are important physiological molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes (24Horn V. Minucci S. Ogryzko V.V. Adamson E.D. Howard B.H. Levin A.A. Ozato K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Yao M. Bain G. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two major types of retinoid receptors are present, each containing three subtypes. RARα, RARβ, and RARγ bind to both all-trans-RA (at-RA) and 9-cis-RA (9c-RA), whereas RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ bind only to 9c-RA. For therapeutic applications in cancer management, a number of specific agonists and antagonists have been developed recently, such as the RAR-specific agonist TTNPB and antagonist AGN193109 (26Agarwal C.

In this study, we determined the domain requirements for the ligand-dependent interaction of RIP140 with RAR/RXR and compared this interaction with its ligand-independent interaction with certain orphan receptors as demonstrated in our previous studies (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in order to gain insights into the role of RIP140 in RA signaling pathways. We report here that the LXXLLs of RIP140 have different affinities for RAR/RXRs, and a C-terminal region that contains no LXXLL motif also interacts with RAR/RXRs. We further demonstrate that heterodimerization of RAR/RXR is required for their interaction with RIP140, and ligand occupancy of both receptors cooperatively enhances this interaction. By using different reporter systems, it is demonstrated that RIP140 consistently suppresses RA induction of reporter activities, possibly through its intrinsic repressive activity, which is transferable, as demonstrated in a GAL4 fusion system. RIP140 may be categorized as a coregulator that utilizes a novel mechanism to suppress the activation of certain agonist-bound hormone receptors. The DEF domains (the ligand binding domains) of both mouse RARα (primers 5′-GAATTCATGTCCAAGGAGTCGGTG-3′ and 5′-ACTCGAGTCATGGGGATTGCGT-3′) and RXRβ (primers 5′-GGGAATTCAAAAGGGAGGCGGTT-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGTCAGGCTAGCTGGT-3′) were generated in polymerase chain reactions and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the production of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. For expression in yeast, the same DNA fragments were inserted to the pBD-GAL4 Cam vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate GAL4BD-RARLBD and GAL4BD-RXRLBD. The AD fusions of the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal portions of RIP140 in the pAD-GAL4 vector (Stratagene) were as described previously (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For the mammalian two-hybrid interaction tests, the LBDs of RAR and RXR and their AF-2 deletion mutants (primers for RARLBDΔAF-2: 5′-GAATTCATGTCCAAGGAGTCGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCACATGGAGCCTGGGTACT-3′; RXRLBDΔAF-2: 5′-GGGAATTCAAAAGGGAGGCGGTT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCAGTCGCCAATGAGCTTGA-3′), also generated in polymerase chain reactions, were cloned into the pVP16 vectors (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) atEcoRI and SalI sites to generate the VP16 fusions. In the VP16-RARLBDΔAF-2 construct, the C-terminal 52 amino acids of RARLBD was deleted. The C-terminal 19 amino acids of RXRLBD were deleted in the VP16-RXRLBDΔAF-2 construct. The GAL4BD fusions of all the RIP140 expression vectors constructed in pm vector (CLONTECH) were as described previously (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the BD-N-CoR containing the C-terminal portion of mouse N-CoR (residues 1843–2453) was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI site of the pm vector as described (3Chinpaisal C.

The IR0-tk-luciferase was constructed by placing six copies of a IR0 element (GTCGGGTCACGAACTCTG), derived from the proximal promoter region of orphan receptor TR2 (29Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8820-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), upstream of a thymidine kinase-luciferase reporter. The RARβ-luciferase was generated by cloning the basal promoter (nucleotides −100 to −16) of the RARβ gene (30Hoffmann B. Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.-K. Hermann T. Husmann M. Graupner G. Pfahi M. Mol.

The GST pull-down interaction assay was conducted as described previously (4Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

Briefly, a total of 6 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins purified fromE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) LysS were bound to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with 4 μl of the [35S]methionine-labeled RIP140 protein prepared from a 50-μl in vitro transcription/translation reaction (TNT, Promega) in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 2 h. Unbound proteins were removed by five washes with the binding buffer without bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors. The specific bound proteins were released by resuspending beads in 20 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and detected in a PhosphorImager. For yeast two-hybrid tests, different combinations of GAL4BD and GAL4AD fusion constructs (100 ng each) were cotransformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae YGR-2 cells containing ahis3 and a lacZ reporter. Transformants were selected on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. A liquid lacZ assay was performed, and the unit of lacZ activity was defined as described previously (4Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25209-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For mammalian two-hybrid tests, COS-1 cells were co-transformed with different combinations of GAL4BD and VP16 fusions (50 ng each), a GAL4-tk-luciferase reporter (400 ng), and an SV40-lacZ internal control (25 ng). Luciferase and lacZ activities were determined as described (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The final concentration of at-RA and 9c-RA or antagonist AGN193109 utilized in these studies was 5 × 10−7m. P19 and COS-1 cells were maintained as described previously (4Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C.

Cells were cotransfected with 500 ng of luciferase reporter, 50–400 ng of expression vectors, and 25 ng of lacZ internal control by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. DNA precipitates were washed off, and RA was added 16 h after transfection. Dextran charcoal-depleted medium was used for all the RA induction experiments. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase and lacZ activities, means, and S.E. values were determined as described previously (4Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25209-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we identified the mouse homologue of human RIP140 as a corepressor of orphan receptor TR2, named mRIP140 (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The mRIP140 interacted strongly with apo-TR2, but its interaction with RAR required the addition of RA in a yeast two-hybrid interaction test (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, experiments were conducted to define the roles of RIP140 in RA signaling pathways and to examine the domain requirement and ligand dependence of its interaction with RAR and RXR. We first performed GST pull-down assays to examine the interaction between RIP140 and RAR/RXR. The LBD of both RAR and RXR was each fused to the C terminus of GST protein (constructs GST-RARLBD and GST-RXRLBD) and expressed in E. coli. The purified GST fusion proteins and the control GST alone were then bound to glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads and incubated with in vitro translated, radioactive-labeled RIP140 protein. The ligand, at-RA, 9c-RA, or vehicle was added to the reactions. After extensive washes, the reactions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently detected in a PhosphorImager. As shown in Fig. 1, the RARLBD interacts with full-length RIP140 in the presence of ligand, at-RA, or 9c-RA (lanes 4–6), consistent with the previous results of yeast two-hybrid tests. Furthermore, the RXR ligand 9c-RA, but not the RAR ligand at-RA, potentiates the RXR/RIP140 interaction (lanes 7–9), indicating that RIP140 is a potential transcriptional modulator for both holo-RAR and RXR. In the control experiments (Fig.1, lanes 1–3), GST protein alone cannot interact with RIP140 with or without the addition of RA. The bottom panelof Fig. 1 shows the Coomassie Blue staining of the gel, confirming equal amount of protein loading in each lane. We next utilized the yeast two-hybrid interaction tests to dissect the RAR- and RXR-interacting domains of RIP140. It is known that the receptor-interacting motif, LXXLL, is responsible for the ligand-dependent interaction of coactivator with nuclear receptors. To examine whether the nine LXXLL motifs of RIP140 were responsible for its interaction with RAR/RXRs, the coding region of mRIP140 was divided into three parts, each fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) to generate constructs mRIP/1–495 containing the 5′ LXXLL cluster: mRIP/623–951, containing the 3′ LXXLL cluster, and mRIP/977-1161, containing the very C terminus, which lacked any LXXLL motif (Fig.2, top panel). Yeast cells containing a lacZ reporter with GAL4 binding sites (Fig. 2, top panel) were cotransfected with one of these constructs and the GAL4BD fusion of RARLBD or RXRLBD (BD-RARLBD and BD-RXRLBD, respectively). The interaction was examined by determining the β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, although a mild ligand-independent interaction activity was detectable for both RAR (lanes 1 and 5) and RXR (lanes 7 and11) with the very N and C termini of RIP140 (mRIP/1–495 and mRIP/977-1161, respectively), addition of ligands dramatically enhances the reporter activities, indicating a stronger interaction as a result of ligand binding to the receptors. Whereas both the 5′ and 3′ LXXLL clusters interacted well with holo-RXR (lanes 7–10), only the 5′ cluster had a high affinity for RAR (lanes 1 and 2). Surprisingly, the C terminus of RIP140 (mRIP/977-1161), a region containing no LXXLL motifs, also interacts strongly with both holo-RAR and RXR (lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). Similar results were obtained in the mammalian two-hybrid tests, in which the three portions of RIP140 were fused to GAL4BD and RAR and RXR were fused to VP16. However, the interactions were strictly ligand-dependent (data not shown). These data suggest that the LXXLL clusters of RIP140 have different affinities for holo-RAR and RXR. Furthermore, a C-terminal fragment containing no LXXLL motif is also able to interact strongly with holo-RAR and RXR. It is believed that most nuclear receptors bind DNA as dimers. For instance, coregulators SRC-1 directly contacts the AF-2 of dimeric receptors through the LXXLL motifs, thereby connecting the receptors to the basal transcription machinery (31Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiyi S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chen W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although the three partial RIP140 fragments interact well with both holo-RAR and RXR in the yeast (Fig. 2), only RXR, and not RAR, interacts strongly with RIP140 in mammalian cells (see below). Because RXR, but not RAR, could form homodimers of its own, it was speculated that the full-length RIP140 interacted with receptors only in their dimeric forms in mammalian cells. To test this possibility and to examine whether AF-2 of RAR and/or RXR was also essential for RAR/RXR interaction with RIP140, the mammalian two-hybrid tests were conducted. In this experiment, the full-length RIP140 was fused to GAL4BD (BD-RIP140, Fig. 3,top panel), and RARLBD, RXRLBD, and their AF-2 deletion mutants (RARLBDΔAF-2 and RARLBDΔAF-2) were each fused to VP16 protein. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with BD-RIP140, different combinations of VP16 fusions (Fig. 3, lower panel), a luciferase reporter containing GAL4 binding sites (GAL4-tk-luciferase), and a lacZ internal control construct. As shown in Fig. 3, ligand-bound RARLBD interacts very weakly with RIP140 (lanes 4–6), which is mediated by the AF-2 of RAR because deletion of AF-2 completely abolishes this interaction (lanes 7–9). In contrast, ligand-bound RXRLBD interacts strongly with the full-length RIP140 (10-fold induction of the reporter activity; Fig. 3, compare lane 10 to lane 12), which is also AF-2-dependent (lanes 13–15). Interestingly, in the presence of both receptors and at-RA, interaction of receptors with RIP140 results in a 6-fold reporter activity (Fig. 3, lane 17), a 3-fold stronger interaction than that obtained using RAR alone (Fig. 3, lane 5). Moreover, when 9c-RA, the ligand for RAR and RXR, was present, a synergistic induction of reporter activity (25-fold) was observed (Fig. 3, compare lane 18 to17 and lane 12 to 6). These data indicate that dimerizations are required for an optimal interaction between full-length RIP140 and RAR/RXR in mammalian cells, and the AF-2 of the receptors is indispensable for their interaction with RIP140. Although RXR was believed to be a silent partner in the RAR/RXR dimer, the synergistic induction of reporter activity (Fig. 3, lane 18) prompted us to investigate the possible cooperative binding of RAR and RXR receptor complexes to RIP140. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with either RARLBD/RXRLBDΔAF-2 or RARLBDΔAF-2/RXRLBD pair and tested their interaction with RIP140. As shown in Fig. 3, the holo-RARLBD/apo-RXRLBDΔAF-2/RIP140 interaction results in a reporter activity (Fig. 3, lane 20) similar to that of holo-RARLBD/apo-RXRLBD/RIP140 (lane 17), and the interaction is almost completely abolished in the holo-RARLBDΔAF-2/apo-RXRLBD/RIP140 pair (lane 23). This result indicates that an intact AF-2 of RAR in the holo-RAR/apo-RXR dimer is required for RIP140 interaction. Furthermore, the synergistic activation of reporter activity by 9c-RA (Fig. 3, lane 18) is abolished when either receptor is deleted in its AF-2 (Fig. 3,lanes 21 and 24). Over a wide range of RIP140 concentrations, this synergism is still observed (data not shown). Therefore, the AF-2 domains of both receptors are required for a cooperative interaction of holoreceptors with RIP140. Consistent with these results, the interaction of holo-RARLBD/holo-RXRLBDΔAF-2/RIP140 (9c-RA as ligand, lane 21) is similar to that of holo-RARLBD/apo-RXRLBDΔAF-2/RIP140 (at-RA as ligand, lane 20), suggesting that once RXR is deleted in its AF-2, the ligand for RXR no longer has an effect on this interaction. Based upon the presence of LXXLL motifs and its ligand-dependent interaction with hormone receptors, human RIP140 was originally categorized as a coactivator (20L'Horset F. Dauvois S. Heery D.M. Cavailles V. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, our previous studies showed that RA activation of a chimeric protein, GAL4BDRAR, was strongly suppressed by RIP140 in COS-1 cells (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To confirm this observation and to examine this controversy, we utilized two RA reporter systems in this study. The first reporter contains a commonly used DR5 type RARE from RARβ basal promoter (DR5-tk-luciferase). As expected, this reporter is effectively activated by RA in COS-1 cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2,a 26-fold induction). Co-expression of RIP140 suppresses the RA induction level down to approximately 50% (lanes 3 and4). In contrast, addition of coactivator SRC-1 enhances the induction level to a 40-fold (lanes 5 and 6). The second reporter utilizes a recently characterized IR0 type RARE (IR0-tk-luciferase) (29Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8820-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that is also very effectively activated by RA in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B, RA induces the reporter activity for approximately a 33-fold (lanes 3 and4), and co-expression of RIP140 also suppresses RA induction to approximately a 9-fold (lanes 5 and 6). These data confirm that in the same cellular environment, RA induction is enhanced by coactivator SRC-1 as expected but is suppressed by RIP140. Furthermore, RIP140 is able to suppress RA induction of two different types of RARE. Our previous data showed that RIP140 was highly expressed in most of the adult mouse tissues (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that this protein was moderately expressed in COS-1 cells (20L'Horset F. Dauvois S. Heery D.M. Cavailles V. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is possible that suppression of RA induction by RIP140 in COS-1 cells is mediated by sequestering common components of the coactivator complex. To examine this possibili"

Phosphorylation approached 1 mol of phosphate/mol of Gαz in vitro. In transfected cells, Gαz was phosphorylated both by wild-type PAK1 when stimulated by the GTP-binding protein Rac1 and by constitutively active PAK1 mutants. In vitro, phosphorylation occurred only at Ser16, one of two Ser residues that are the major substrate sites for protein kinase C (PKC). PAK1 did not phosphorylate other Gα subunits (i1, i2, i3, o, s, or q). PAK1-phosphorylated Gαz was resistant both to RGSZ1, a Gz-selective GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and to RGS4, a relatively nonselective GAP for the Gi and Gqfamilies of G proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser27 by PKC did not alter sensitivity to either GAP. The previously described inhibition of Gz GAPs by PKC is therefore mediated by phosphorylation of Ser16. Phosphorylation of either Ser16 by PAK1 or Ser27 by PKC decreased the affinity of Gαz for Gβγ; phosphorylation of both residues by PKC caused no further effect. PAK1 thus regulates Gαz function by attenuating the inhibitory effects of both GAPs and Gβγ. In this context, the kinase activity of PAK1 toward several protein substrates was directly inhibited by Gβγ, suggesting that PAK1 acts as a Gβγ-regulated effector protein.

Mechanisms of kinase activation are diverse, however. They include both direct stimulation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and PKC1 by second messenger products of G protein-regulated effectors and less direct activation of tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. In yeast, heterotrimeric G proteins regulate members of the p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) family. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste20p is stimulated by Gβγ subunits (Ste4p/Ste18p) in response to mating pheromones (1Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y.

White M. Marcus S. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 50-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAKs are mammalian homologs of Ste20p and Shk1p that were initially recognized as kinases that are activated by Rac and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of monomeric GTP-binding proteins (4Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The PAKs also respond to heterotrimeric G proteins through pathways that include regulation of both GDP/GTP exchange factors and GAPs for Rac and Cdc42 (5Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.-S.

Receptors are subject to feedback regulation by second messenger-activated kinases and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (8Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar); G protein-regulated effectors are modulated by phosphorylation (9Filtz T.M. Cunningham M.L. Stanig K.J. Paterson A.

Gαz, a sparsely expressed member of the Gi family, is phosphorylated by PKC both in platelets and in cells where it has been expressed artificially (13Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F.

PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation decreases the affinity of Gαz for Gβγ subunits, potentially sensitizing Gz to activation because Gβγ inhibits GDP/GTP exchange. Phosphorylation by PKC also desensitizes Gz to the GAP activity of RGS proteins, which are widely thought to inhibit G protein signaling (20Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). PKC may potentiate Gz signaling through either of these mechanisms. Gz is found primarily in neurons, platelets, and adrenal chromaffin cells, and its intracellular localization suggests that it may regulate formation, transport, or release of secretory granules (21Matsuoka M.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of PAK1 to cause remodeling of cytoskeletal structures points to a role in regulating processes such as cell motility and secretion, and PAK1 has been implicated directly in the Fcγ receptor-mediated respiratory burst and cytokine secretion (26Izadi K.D. Erdreich-Epstein A. Liu Y. Durden D.L. Exper. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Few natural PAK substrates are known, however; but PAK1 probably phosphorylates proteins that regulate either cytoskeletal disassembly or the cytoskeletal elements themselves. We report here that Gαz is phosphorylated specifically at Ser16 by PAK1, thus inhibiting its interaction with both Gβγ and RGS proteins. We have used this specificity to distinguish and delineate the functional consequences of phosphorylation at Ser27 and Ser16, which we show to be the two principal substrate sites for PKC. An unexpected outcome is the finding that Gβγ, which stimulates the PAK homolog Ste20p inSaccharomyces, inhibits the activity of mammalian PAK1 toward both Gαz and other substrates. Mammalian expression vectors for full-length PAK1, the constitutively active mutant PAK1-(165–544) (N-terminal truncation leaving residues 165–544) (27Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N.

Gα subunits were phosphorylated by PAK1 at 30 °C for 60 min or the times indicated in 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of Gαz were performed as described (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Partial tryptic proteolysis after protection of phosphorylated Gαz by GTPγS was performed exactly as described (35Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M.

Human embryonic kidney fibroblasts (HEK-293 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, cells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes to ∼70% confluence and then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (27Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Twenty hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. For determination of in vivo phosphorylation of Gαz, transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 2–3 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus [32P]Pi (0.5 mCi/ml). For harvesting, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) that contained 0.2% SDS, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A. Lysates were stored at −20 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were sonicated at 0 °C for 10 s and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants were diluted to 800 μl with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer that contained 0.2% SDS and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and precleared by passage through a 0.2-ml column of Sephadex G-25. The precleared lysates were incubated with 20 μl of protein A-agarose and 10 μg of purified anti-Gαz antibody for 15 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer that contained 0.2% SDS, precipitates were solubilized with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Schleicher & Schüll BA85 nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography or immunoblotting with anti-Gαz antibody. Autoradiographs and Western blot images were quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer and appropriate standards. Gz GAP activity was assayed at 15 °C as described (28Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding was measured at 30 °C as described. GTPγS-bound Gαz was partially proteolyzed with trypsin as described (35Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Antibody against Gαz was raised by injecting rabbits with the N-terminal peptide GCRQSSEEKEAARRSRR conjugated to hemocyanin. Antibody was purified from serum by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 and, following dialysis, immunoaffinity chromatography on a column of the immunizing peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B. The protein kinase PAK1 phosphorylated Gαz in vitro, but did not phosphorylate several other Gα subunits tested (Fig.1). PAK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Gαz was efficient relative to that catalyzed by PKCα, and the truncated protein PAK1-(232–544) displayed activity similar to that of the wild-type kinase. We were unable to detect phosphorylation of Gαz by either TAO1 or protein kinase A (data not shown). PAK1 phosphorylated Gαz within the first 29 amino acid residues because all 32P was removed by limited tryptic proteolysis (Fig. 2 A), which cleaves after Arg29 (35Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated Gαz detected only phosphoserine (data not shown), consistent with the absence of Thr residues in this region. In contrast to the site specificity displayed by PAK1, PKC phosphorylated at least one additional site C-terminal to Gln30, usually accounting for ∼10% of the total incorporation of phosphate (Fig.2 A, lane 12). We then used serine mutants of Gαz to determine the site of PAK1-catalyzed phosphorylation near the N terminus. PAK1 catalyzed the phosphorylation of Gαz to ∼1 mol of phosphate/mol of Gαz, and phosphorylation was blocked completely by mutation of Ser16 to Ala. Phosphorylation was not diminished by mutation of either Ser25 or Ser27 (Fig. 2,B and C). Longer incubation with PAK1 or the use of more PAK1 did not cause further phosphorylation of Gαz(data not shown). PAK1 thus selectively phosphorylates Ser16 of Gαz. In contrast to PAK1, PKC catalyzed the addition of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of Gαz, and phosphorylation was decreased by about half when either Ser16 or Ser27 was mutated (Fig. 2, B and C). Both residues are thus PKC substrate sites. The time courses of phosphorylation of S16A and S27A Gαz suggest that Ser27 is the kinetically preferred PKC substrate (Fig. 2 C). Such preference agrees with the conclusion of Lounsbury et al. (17Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Ser27 is the major phosphorylation site in transfected 293 cells, although cellular phosphorylation might also be influenced by selectivity of whatever protein phosphatases naturally dephosphorylate Gαz. We have not attempted to map the minor, more C-terminal PKC phosphorylation site on Gαz. To determine whether PAK1 also phosphorylates Gαz in vivo, we expressed Gαz in HEK-293 cells and measured its differential steady-state phosphorylation upon coexpression with PAK1, with or without the PAK activator G12V Rac1 (Fig. 3). Gαz was phosphorylated by endogenous HEK-293 cell kinases during the 3-h incubation with [32P]Pi, primarily at one of the Ser residues near the N terminus. Phosphorylation was slightly increased by coexpression of wild-type PAK1 and was further increased when both PAK1 and the constitutively activated G12V mutant of Rac1 were present. It was difficult to quantitate the in vivophosphorylation of Gαz by PAK1 because an unknown fraction of Ser16 may already be phosphorylated prior to addition of 32P and because considerable phosphorylation by other kinases occurred at Ser27 (Fig. 3 A,lanes 6–8). However, phosphorylation of the S25A,S27P Gαz mutant showed that wild-type PAK1 plus G12V Rac1 can at least double the incorporation of 32P into Ser16 of Gαz and that the activated mutant PAK1-(165–544) can increase labeling by 50%. For reference, phosphorylation of Gαz by endogenous PKC was monitored by stimulating the cells with phorbol ester, which increased phosphorylation of both wild-type and S16A Gαz by ∼2–2.6-fold (Fig. 3) (17Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Gαz at sites C-terminal to Arg29 was relatively minor (Fig.3 B, lanes 8–14). Activation of Gαz by AlF4− had no effect on its phosphorylation by either PAK1 or PKC (Fig.4). Activation by GTPγS was also without effect (data not shown). Conversely, neither PAK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of MBP or PAK1 autophosphorylation was altered by Gαz when bound to GDP/AlF4− (Fig. 4), GDP, or GTPγS (data not shown). To determine whether PAK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Gαz decreases its affinity for Gβγ, as is true for PKC (18Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we monitored the effect of phosphorylation on the concentration dependence with which Gβγ inhibits GDP/GTPγS exchange. As shown in Fig.5 A, phosphorylation of Gαz by PAK1 markedly attenuated the ability of Gβγ to inhibit nucleotide exchange on Gαz, but had no effect on the intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate. This attenuation reflected a 10–20-fold decrease in the affinity of phospho-Gαz for Gβγ (Fig. 5, B and D). PAK1 and PKC inhibited Gβγ binding equally. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser16 by PAK1 alone (Fig. 5, B and D) or of Ser27 by PKC in the S16A mutant (Fig. 5 C) decreased Gαz-Gβγ affinity equally. Phosphorylation of both residues by PKC had no greater effect than phosphorylation of only one or the other. Although mutation of either residue to Ala itself decreased affinity for Gβγ somewhat (IC50shifted from ∼1 μm to ∼2.5 μm in this and other experiments), the additional decrease caused by phosphorylation was much greater, ∼12-fold in Fig. 5 B and ∼20-fold in Fig. 5 (C and D) and similar experiments. Phosphorylation of Gαz by PKC blocks the GAP activity of RGS proteins (29Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,38Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Selective phosphorylation of Ser16 by PAK1 also substantially inhibited the GAP activities of both RGSZ1 and RGS4 (Fig.6 and TableI). RGS4 was inhibited by >96%. RGSZ1 was inhibited by ∼60–80% under the conditions shown. GzGAP purified from bovine brain, which contains RGSZ1 and at least one other member of the RGSZ subfamily (29Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was inhibited to the same extent as was recombinant RGSZ1 (data not shown). Inhibition of GAP activity by Gαz phosphorylation is caused by an increase in K m , which probably indicates a decrease in affinity (29Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fractional inhibition will therefore vary with the concentration of phospho-Gαz relative to itsK m , and the greater fractional inhibition of RGS4 thus reflects its lower affinity for GTP-bound Gαz.Table IModulation of the Gz GAP activity of RGS proteins by Gβγ and by PAK1- or PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of GαzHydrolysis rate constantBasalGβγPAK1PAK1, GβγPKCαPKCα, Gβγmin−1Wild typeNo GAP0.0135 ± 0.0010.0119 ± 0.0010.0134 ± 0.0010.0134 ± 0.0010.0134 ± 0.0010.0134 ± 0.001 RGSZ10.0583 ± 0.0020.0176 ± 0.0020.0257 ± 0.0020.0214 ± 0.0020.0214 ± 0.0010.0219 ± 0.001 RGS40.0580 ± 0.0020.0122 ± 0.0010.0146 ± 0.0010.0138 ± 0.0010.0139 ± 0.0010.0136 ± 0.001S16ANo GAP0.0112 ± 0.0010.0113 ± 0.0010.0127 ± 0.0010.0128 ± 0.001RGSZ10.0226 ± 0.0020.0181 ± 0.0010.0338 ± 0.0020.0265 ± 0.001RGS40.0153 ± 0.0020.0119 ± 0.0010.0143 ± 0.0010.0134 ± 0.001S27ANo GAP0.0104 ± 0.0010.0103 ± 0.0010.0117 ± 0.0010.0107 ± 0.001RGSZ10.0266 ± 0.0020.0212 ± 0.0020.0248 ± 0.0020.0155 ± 0.001RGS40.0117 ± 0.0020.0110 ± 0.0010.0139 ± 0.0010.0119 ± 0.001The rates of hydrolysis of wild-type and mutant GTP-bound Gαz(∼2 nm in all experiments) were measured either without GAP or in the presence of 50 pm RGSZ1 or 750 pmRGS4.

Because PAK1 phosphorylates Ser16 exclusively and PAK-catalyzed phosphorylation inhibits responses to GAPs as much as does phosphorylation of both Ser16 and Ser27 by PKC, phosphorylation of Ser16 can account for the inhibitory effect of PKC on GAP activity. Phosphorylation of Ser27 in S16A Gαz had no effect on its sensitivity to either GAP. Thus, PAK1 will be just as efficacious an inhibitor of the RGSZ family of Gz GAPs as is PKC. Addition of Gβγ to phosphorylated Gαz had little further inhibitory effect on GAP activity (Fig. 5). The slight inhibition that was observed occurred primarily below 200 nm Gβγ, well below the K d of phospho-Gαz for Gβγ. Residual inhibition by Gβγ probably reflects effects on the small fraction of Gαzthat was not phosphorylated during incubation with kinase. In addition to blocking phosphorylation, mutation of either Ser16 or Ser27 to Ala also inhibited the intrinsic sensitivity of Gαz to GAP activity (Fig. 6 and Table I). Sensitivity of non-phosphorylated S16A Gαz to either RGSZ1 or RGS4 was equivalent to that of phospho-Ser16 Gαz and was not further altered by phosphorylation of Ser27. S27A Gαz was more sensitive to GAP activity than was S16A Gαz, but was still a far worse GAP substrate than wild-type Gαz. It was striking that PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation at Ser27 in the S16A mutant reproducibly increased its sensitivity to GAPs. Although this effect was relatively small, it was a consistent finding in multiple experiments. The small inhibitory effect of Gβγ on the sensitivity of mutated or phosphorylated Gαz to GAPs was similarly reproducible. The intrinsic rates at which S16A and S27A Gαz hydrolyzed bound GTP were diminished in comparison to the wild type, by ∼15 and 25% respectively (Table I). Proteolysis of the N-terminal 29 amino acid residues of Gαz provided a control to show that the effects of mutation or phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser27 are local. Limited tryptic proteolysis increased thek hydrol for each of these proteins to ∼0.022 min−1 (data not shown), the value characteristic of the proteolyzed wild-type, non-phosphorylated protein (35Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). During the course of the experiments described above, we noticed that Gβγ reproducibly inhibited the protein kinase activity of PAK1-(232–544) (Fig. 7 A). Inhibition was detectable by 80 nm and was half-maximal at ∼200 nm, well within the range of concentrations over which other regulatory actions of Gβγ have been described (39Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with full-length, wild-type PAK1 both before and after removal of the fused GST domain (data not shown). The buffer used to store Gβγ had no effect on PAK1 activity (Fig. 7 A). Gβγ also inhibited the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate either MBP (Fig. 7) or MEK1 (data not shown). Gβγ thus appears to inhibit PAK directly rather than simply binding the Gαz substrate and blocking access to the kinase. The inhibitory activity of Gβγ was relatively specific for PAK. It had no effect on the protein kinase activities of either protein kinase A or TAO1 in two separate experiments and inhibited PKC insignificantly (10–15% at the highest concentrations tested). Gβγ slightly but reproducibly stimulated PAK1 autophosphorylation in the presence or absence of added substrate (example in Fig.7 A), indicating that Gβγ binds directly to PAK1 to alter its function. In yeast, Gβγ also binds (and stimulates) the PAK homolog Ste20p directly (1Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and its stimulatory activity is blocked by binding to Gα. Surprisingly, Gβγ was a potent inhibitor of PAK1 protein kinase activity both when free or when complexed as a heterotrimer with GDP-bound Gαz or Gαi(Fig. 7, A and B) or Gαq (data not shown). Addition of the Gβγ-binding protein phosducin (up to 6.7 μm) also failed to reverse inhibition by Gβγ (Fig.7 B). Mammalian PAKs were discovered as effectors of the small G proteins Rac and Cdc42, although the yeast homolog Ste20p was first identified as a protein kinase activated by Gβγ. Our current findings now indicate that PAKs function both upstream and downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins in animal cell signaling pathways. First, PAK1-catalyzed phosphorylation potentiates Gz activation by inhibiting the GAP activity of RGS proteins, including the RGSZ subfamily of Gz-selective GAPs. Second, phosphorylation of Gαz decreases its affinity for Gβγ subunits and thus attenuates the inhibitory effects of Gβγ on Gzactivation. The net result is a two-pronged potentiation of Gz signaling by PAK. The reduced affinity of phospho-Gαz for Gβγ will promote Gβγ release and might thereby potentiate Gβγ signaling, but Gαz is expressed at such low levels that it may release too little Gβγ to have significant impact on intracellular signaling. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that PAK phosphorylates Gαz under physiological conditions in cells. In vitro, PAK1-phosphorylated purified Gαz to a stoichiometry of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of Gαz. The rate of phosphorylation was also reasonably fast in comparison with PKC, which phosphorylates Gαz in platelets stimulated by either thrombin or phorbol ester (13Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Gαz in HEK-293 cells was increased by expression of constitutively active PAK1 or of wild-type PAK1 and its activator Rac. PAK1-driven incorporation of 32P into Gαz was of the same order as that catalyzed by PKC in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate despite the fact that PKC phosphorylates Gαz on two sites rather than one. Finally, phosphorylation of Gαz by PAK is associated with altered function of the protein as discussed more fully below. We conclude that stimulation of PAKs, via the activation of either Rac or Cdc42, provides a novel means of potentiating the cellular function of Gz. PAK1 displays marked selectivity for Gαz relative to other Gα subunits and for Ser16 relative to other potential phosphorylation sites in Gz. Selectivity for Ser16 allowed us to delineate the individual contributions of phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser27 to regulation of Gαz in a manner not possible using mutagenesis. Phosphorylation of Ser16 was both sufficient and necessary to decrease sensitivity to the GAP activity of RGS proteins (Fig. 6 and Table I). It was also sufficient to decrease affinity for Gβγ. PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser27 in the S16A mutant also decreased affinity for Gβγ. On the other hand, phosphorylation of both residues in wild-type Gαz had no more effect than phosphorylation of Ser16 alone. These data confirm the idea that the extreme N-terminal helix of Gα subunits is crucial for interaction with RGS proteins (29Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), despite the fact that this interaction was not observed in the crystal structure of the Gαi1-RGS4 complex (40Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The ability of Gβγ subunits to inhibit the protein kinase activity of PAK1 is provocative for two reasons. First, it suggests that the PAKs may be a new family of heterotrimeric G protein-regulated effectors. Inhibition of PAK1 by Gβγ was nearly complete, was effective with multiple protein substrates, and occurred over a physiological range of Gβγ concentrations. Second, PAK inhibition by Gβγ extends the pattern of G protein regulation of the PAK family that was established in yeast. However, whereas Shk1p is activated, perhaps indirectly, by Gα in S. pombe and Ste20p is directly activated by Gβγ in S. cerevisiae, PAK1 is directly inhibited by mammalian Gβγ. The ability of Gβγ to regulate PAK1-(232–544) also indicates that the Gβγ-binding site on PAK is unrelated to the binding site for Rac and Cdc42, which lies near the PAK N terminus (41Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). A tantalizing possibility is that mammalian G proteins may regulate PAKs through multiple mechanisms. Inhibition of PAK by Gβγ in vitro fulfilled most criteria for physiological validity, so it was initially puzzling that inhibition was not blocked either by GDP-bound Gαi or by phosducin. However, yeast Gβγ binds Ste20p through the N-terminal helix of Gβ (2Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is not occluded in the phosducin-Gβγ complex (33Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Whereas the N-terminal helix of Gβ makes extensive contact with Gα (43Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E.

Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), the face of the helix that binds PAK may remain accessible in some conformations of the Gα-Gβγ heterotrimer. Contact sites for other Gβγ-regulated effectors cluster on the face of the Gβ torus rather than near its N terminus (45Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G.

It should be possible to use such structural information to evaluate the biological relevance of PAK inhibition by Gβγ in cells where PAK activity can be monitored in response to receptor-regulated Gβγ release.

Several forms of extracellular flagellated Leishmaniapromastigotes colonize the digestive tract of vector sandflies. After transmission to the mammalian host by the bite of the insect, the parasites transform to the obligatory intracellular, nonflagellated amastigotes, which reside in the phagolysosomes of macrophages (1Alexander J.

These glycoconjugates, which are thought to have crucial functions for parasite survival, development, and virulence in the sandfly vector and the mammalian macrophage, include a family of phosphoglycan-modified molecules, which comprises lipid-linked, protein-linked, and unlinked forms (4Mengeling B.J.

More recently, it has been found that the biologically active phosphoglycan structures of LPG are also present on several highly glycosylated Leishmania proteins, collectively termed proteophosphoglycans (PPGs, Refs. 5Ilg T.

Trans. 1999; 27: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This group of molecules includes secreted acid phosphatase synthesized by promastigotes of allLeishmania species except Leishmania major (23Lovelace J.K. Gottlieb M. Am. J. Trop. Med.

J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar), and a filamentous proteophosphoglycan (fPPG) secreted by promastigotes of all species investigated so far (5Ilg T. Handman E. Ng K. Stierhof Y.-D. Bacic A. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 1999; 11: 1-19Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar,26Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Russell D.G. Hohenberg H. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Capped phosphoglycan chains are linked to the polypeptide backbone of these proteins via phosphodiester linkages to serine, an unusual type of protein modification called phosphoglycosylation (27Ilg T.

Among the PPGs, fPPG exhibits some unique features; the contour length of filaments observed by electron microscopy in purified preparations may exceed 6 μm. The fPPG protein backbone is largely formed by Ser, Ala, and Pro (together >87 mol%), and more than 40 mol% of its amino acids are phosphoglycosylated Ser residues. This extensive glycosylation leads to high protease resistance of fPPG and may also be responsible for its filamentous ultrastructure that is reminiscent of mammalian mucins (28Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21583-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it has been shown that fPPG, initially observed in promastigote cultures (26Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Russell D.G. Hohenberg H. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is also abundantly present in Leishmania-infected sandflies, where it forms a gel of three-dimensional filamentous meshworks that immobilizes the parasites and occludes the lumen of the insect digestive tract (30Stierhof Y.-D. Bates P.A. Jacobson R. Schlein Y. Rogers M. Handman E. Ilg T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This fPPG/parasite plug may be important for efficient transmission of metacyclic promastigotes to the mammalian host during the bite of the vector insect (see Refs. 30Stierhof Y.-D. Bates P.A.

Parasitol. Res. 1988; 74: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and references therein). In this paper we describe the identification of a L. majorgene family whose members share common repetitive sequences encoding exclusively Ser, Ala, and Pro in ratios very similar to those found in fPPG. One of the genes (ppg1) was cloned and sequenced, and its expression and functional elements were analyzed. Our results suggest that ppg1 encodes a novel membrane-bound and possibly glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored PPG that is present on the surface of L. major promastigotes. Promastigotes of L. major LRC-L137, clone 121, were grown in vitro in semidefined medium 79 (32Brun R. Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested at densities of 5 × 107 to 108/ml. Agarose gel electrophoresis, isolation of λ-phage DNA, purification of genomicLeishmania DNA and total RNA, Southern and Northern blotting, λ-phage and bacterial colony lifts, antibody screening of a λgt11 expression gene library, restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations, and transformation of Escherichia coli were performed according to standard methods (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA and DNA fragments from agarose gels were isolated using commercial kits according to the manufacturers' instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany; Gene-Clean, Bio101, Vista, CA). Digoxygenin (DIG) labeling of DNA or RNA fragments was performed by random priming and by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by in vitro transcription, respectively (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). DIG-labeled DNA or RNA on blots was detected using anti-DIG-Fab fragments coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche) and CDP-StarTM (Tropix, Bedford/MA) as chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturers instructions. PCR was performed using the ExpandTM high fidelity PCR system (Roche). Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed from total L. major promastigote RNA using the Masteramp™ RT-PCR kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). A λgt11 expression library constructed from sheared genomic L. major DNA (36Murray P.J. Spithill T.W. Handman E. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4221-4226PubMed Google Scholar) was propagated in E. coli Y1090 and plated on agar dishes. Nitrocellulose filter lifts of λgt11 phage plaques were used for antibody screening for the PPG genes using a rabbit antiserum against HF-dephosphorylated secreted L. major fPPG (28Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21583-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that had been preadsorbed four times with E. coli lysate (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).L. major DNA inserts were excised from DNA of positive λgt11 phages and cloned into NcoI/NdeI-cut pGEM5z+ (37Moran L. Maina C. Poole C. Slatko B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 93: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Isolated inserts were labeled with DIG and used for Southern blot analyses or hybridization on bacterial filter lifts (see below). For the construction of dedicated genomic plasmid libraries L. major DNA was digested with XhoI orSphI and separated on 0.7% agarose gels. DNA fragments that corresponded to positive bands on Southern blots using the DIG-labeled λ-phage inserts as probes, were cloned into XhoI-cut pBSK+ or SphI-cut pGEM5z+, respectively. Filter lifts from transformed E. coli XL1-Blue colonies were hybridized with DIG-labeled λ-phage inserts and the clones pBSK+ ppg1/XhoI and pGEM5z+ ppg1/SphI containing overlapping inserts were isolated (compare Fig. 3 A). To obtain the entire ppg1 gene on one plasmid theXbaI/XhoI fragment of pGEM5z+ ppg1/SphI (Fig. 3 A) was ligated into XbaI/XhoI-cut pBSK+. This construct was cut with XhoI and ligated with theXhoI fragment from pBSK+ ppg1/XhoI (Fig. 3 A), yielding pBSK+ ppg1/ORF. The correct orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction digests and sequencing. Sequence analysis of the clones was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 12: 4563-5467Google Scholar). Both DNA strands were sequenced in nonrepetitive regions. For sequencing of the large repetitive region, the central 4.75-kb Sau3AI fragment was isolated from pBSK+ ppg1/XhoI and ligated intoBamHI-cut pBSK+. The resulting construct (pBSK+ ppg1/Sau3AI) was sequenced from both ends. Internal regions of the repeats were characterized by constructing exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease nested deletion clones (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) of pBSK+ ppg1/Sau3AI followed by sequencing. RT-PCR of the ppg1 3′-region used oligonucleotides flanking this sequence (5′-GACTCTAGAGCTTCAAGTCGACATCAC; 3′-CATGGATCCCGATAGACTCTATCTTC) with an initial reverse transcription step of 60 °C for 20 min, followed by 1 min of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 1 min of extension at 72 °C for 35 cycles. Determination of theppg1 splice site involved an initial RT-PCR reaction using an oligonucleotide complementary to the L. major miniexon consensus sequence (35Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide TGCAGTCGACTACCTTCTCTATCAGA located within ppg1 coding region. Conditions were as described above except that the extension was done for 25 cycles and was followed by a second round of nested PCR using the same miniexon primer and an oligonucleotide situated immediately downstream of the ppg1 start codon (GCGTCTAGACATGATCCTAAAACGTTTCTG). The product was cloned into pBSK+ and its primary structure determined by DNA sequencing. The XbaI/ScaI fragment from pBSK+ ppg1/ORF that includes part of the ampicillin gene was ligated with theXbaI/ScaI-cut Leishmania expression vector pX (39LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) yielding pXppg1/ORF. For the generation of fusion constructs of the repetitive ppg1 domains to the 3′-region of a L. mexicana membrane-bound acid phosphatase (lmmbap; Ref. 40Wiese M. Berger O. Stierhof Y.-D. Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) whose transmembrane anchor sequence had been removed (modified lmmbap = modMAP; Ref. 41Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Wiese M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the expression construct pXmodMAP (41Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Wiese M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was cut with BglII and ligated in frame with the large Sau3AI fragment (4.75 kb, compare Fig. 3B) of ppg1 yielding pXmodMAP-repeat. Correct orientation was confirmed by restriction digests with NcoI. The C-terminal region of ppg1 was amplified using the primers TCTAGATCTCCCAGGATTCTTCCGTGGATG and TCCGGATCCCATGCCTGCATGCCTCAAGT to create a BglII and a BamHI site for in frame ligation withBglII-cut pXmodMAP yielding pXmodMAP-GPI. The correct orientation was confirmed by restriction digests and sequencing.L. major promastigotes were transformed by electroporation as described previously (42Wiese M. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and grown in semidefined medium 79 plus 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum that was supplemented with 20–100 μg/ml G418 to select for plasmid-harboring parasites. Discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; Ref. 43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed on 4% stacking gels over 7.5–20% separating gels. For electrotransfer of proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels (24Ilg T. Harbecke D. Wiese M. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) were used. For immunodetection of antigens on PVDF membranes, nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% skimmed milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/MT). The monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb) LT6 (hybridoma supernatant), which recognizes the PO4-6-Galβ1–4Manα1- phosphoglycan repeats, the biotinylated purified mAb L7.25, which recognizes the phosphoglycan cap structures (Manα1–2)0–2Manα1-PO4- (24Ilg T. Harbecke D. Wiese M. Overath P. Eur. J.

Handman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and affinity-purified rabbit anti-C-region antibodies (1 mg/ml) were used as primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:20, 1:1000, 1:2000 and 1:200, respectively in TBS/MT. After 3 washes with in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T), goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dianova) or Extravidin-Peroxidase (Sigma) were used at a 1:10000 dilution in TBS/MT. After 5 washes with TBS/T, the bound enzyme conjugates were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system (Amersham-Pharmacia). Two-site ELISA of culture supernatants fromL. major promastigotes transfected with pXmodMAP constructs were performed using mAb AP4-coated (50 μl/well 20 μg/ml, 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, 1 h 25 °C) flexible polvinylchloride ELISA plates (Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). mAb AP4 recognizes a conformational peptide epitope of L. mexicana modMAP (41Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Wiese M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45Menz B. Winter G. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The plates were washed twice with TBS/T (200 μl/well), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with TBS/MT (200 μl/well, 1 h, 25 °C). After washing with TBS/T L. major culture supernatants (undiluted, and diluted 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 in semidefined medium 79 plus 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) were added (100 μl/well, 1 h, 25 °C). Bound acid phosphatase activity was then determined after three washing steps with TBS/T (200 μl/well) by incubation with 5 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (100 μl/well, 1 h, 37 °C). 80-μl aliquots were then transferred to 20 μl of 1 m NaOH and the optical density at 405 nm (OD405) was measured. For subsequent ELISA detection, the wells were washed twice with TBS/T followed by incubation with the biotinylated mAbs L7.25, WIC79.3, and WIC108.3 (1–2 μg/ml in TBS/MT, 100 μl/well, 1 h, 25 °C). After three washing steps with with TBS/T, the ELISA plates were incubated with Extravidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), diluted 1:5000 in TBS/T, 5% fish gelatin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), (100 μl/well, 1 h, 25 °C) followed by four washes with TBS/T, one wash with 1m diethanolamine-HCl, pH 9.8, 1 mmMgCl2, and incubation with 5 mm pNPP in the same buffer. Bound enzyme conjugate was measured by determination of the OD405. A 1026-bp SalI/HindIII DNA fragment of the ppg1 5′-region (N-domain) and a 303-bpSphI/HpaI fragment of the ppg13′-region (C-domain) (Fig. 3 A) were ligated in frame intoSalI/HindIII-cut andSphI/SmaI-cut pQE31, respectively. Hexa-His-tagged recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli M15 were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of purified recombinant protein by standard protocols (28Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21583-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting studies, anti-N-domain antibodies as well as anti-C-domain antibodies were affinity-purified on recombinant protein that had been electrotransfered to PVDF membranes after SDS-PAGE as described previously (40Wiese M. Berger O. Stierhof Y.-D. Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 50-μl aliquots of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resuspended in 1 ml of TBS/T were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with 200 μl of rabbit anti-SalI/HindIII serum, rabbit anti-C-domain serum, or rabbit preimmune serum. The beads were washed five times with TBS/T, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). L. majorpromastigotes (2 × 109) were solubilized in 1 ml 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0,5% sodium desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 mm o-phenanthroline) and 10 units/ml benzonuclease (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were added to the antibody-loaded protein A-Sepharose beads. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with TBS/T, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 50 mmdithiothreitol and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Samples (30 μl) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes, and subjected to immunodetection. Frozen cell pellets of L. major promastigotes (1011 cells) were resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2 containing protease inhibitors and sonicated. After addition of 100 units/ml benzonuclease, the lysate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min (Ti 50.2 rotor (Beckman, München, Germany) at 40,000 rpm and 4 °C yielding supernatant (SN) 1 and pellet (P) 1. P1 was resuspended in 20 ml 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors, sonicated and again subjected to ultracentrifugation yielding P2 and SN2. Resuspension of P2 in 20 ml 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors followed by sonication and ultracentrifugation yielded P3 and SN3. Samples of the lysate, SN1, SN2, and SN3 as well as P1, P2, and P3 were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to PVDF membranes, and subjected to immunodetection. Late log phaseL. major promastigotes were washed with PBS, fixed with an equal volume of 4% para-formaldehyde in PBS, and incubated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass microscope slides for 30 min at 25 °C (26Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Russell D.G. Hohenberg H. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) followed by two washings with PBS. After incubation with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C, dilutions of mouse mAbs (1:10 for mAb LT6, 1:500–1:2000 for mAb AP4) or rabbit antisera/preimmune sera (1:100–1:500) in PBS plus 2% BSA were added to the fixed promastigotes for 30–60 min at 25 °C. After three washings with PBS, the cells were incubated with either goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Cy3 (Dianova) diluted 1:500 in 2% BSA in PBS for 30–60 min at 25 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, incubated with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS for 10 min, and washed again three times with PBS, followed by embedding in Mowiol and inspection by fluorescence microscopy. Glycerol spraying and rotary metal shadowing of purified modMAP and modMAP-repeat protein with and without addition of mAb AP4 for electron microscopic inspection was performed as described earlier (28Ilg T.

Multiple attempts to generate peptide sequence information from L. major fPPG were unsuccessful (28Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21583-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which precluded a gene cloning strategy using degenerate oligonucleotides. Therefore, a λgt11 expression library constructed from sheared genomic L. major DNA was screened with a rabbit antiserum directed against the 40% HF-deglycosylated protein backbone of fPPG (anti-HFP serum; Ref. 28Ilg T.

Three positive λgt11 clones were identified, subcloned into plasmid vectors, mapped by restriction enzyme digests and partially sequenced. These clones appeared to consist exclusively of repetitive DNA sequence potentially encoding Ser-, Ala-, and Pro-rich peptide repeats (Fig.1). The average amino acid composition of these predicted peptide repeats was 67.7 mol% Ser, 19.4 mol% Ala and 12.9 mol% Pro, which was highly reminiscent of the amino acid composition of the glycosylated protease-resistant fPPG domains analyzed in an earlier study (59 mol% Ser, 23.1 mol% Ala, 15.3 mol% Pro, 2.6 mol% other amino acids; Ref. 28Ilg T.

https://openalex.org/W2037405524,"NK-4 (tinman) encodes an NK-2 class homeodomain transcription factor that is required for development of the Drosophila dorsal mesoderm, including heart. Genetic evidence suggests its important role in mesoderm subdivision, yet the properties of NK-4 as a transcriptional regulator and the mechanism of gene transcription by NK-4 are not completely understood. Here, we describe its properties as a transcription factor and its interaction with the p300 coactivator and the Groucho corepressor. We demonstrate that NK-4 can activate or repress target genes in cultured cells, depending on functional domains that are conserved between Drosophila melanogaster andDrosophila virilis NK-4 genes. Using GAL4-NK-4 fusion constructs, we have mapped a transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 1–110) and repression domains (amino acids 111–188 and the homeodomain) and found an inhibitory function for the homeodomain in transactivation by NK-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NK-4-dependent transactivation is augmented by the p300 coactivator and show that NK-4 physically interacts with p300 via the activation domain. In addition, cotransfection experiments indicate that the repressor activity of NK-4 is strongly enhanced by the Groucho corepressor. Using immunoprecipitation and in vitropull-down assays, we show that NK-4 directly interacts with the Groucho corepressor, for which the homeodomain is required. Together, our results indicate that NK-4 can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor and provide the first evidence of NK-4 interactions with the p300 coactivator and the Groucho corepressor.

Using GAL4-NK-4 fusion constructs, we have mapped a transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 1–110) and repression domains (amino acids 111–188 and the homeodomain) and found an inhibitory function for the homeodomain in transactivation by NK-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NK-4-dependent transactivation is augmented by the p300 coactivator and show that NK-4 physically interacts with p300 via the activation domain. In addition, cotransfection experiments indicate that the repressor activity of NK-4 is strongly enhanced by the Groucho corepressor. Using immunoprecipitation and in vitropull-down assays, we show that NK-4 directly interacts with the Groucho corepressor, for which the homeodomain is required. Together, our results indicate that NK-4 can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor and provide the first evidence of NK-4 interactions with the p300 coactivator and the Groucho corepressor. polymerase chain reaction chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Groucho glutathione S-transferase base pair amino acid(s) repressor domain homeodomain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tinman Homeobox genes encode sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that play important roles during development by regulating transcription in organisms as diverse as insects, nematodes, mammals, and plants (1Krumlauf R.

These homeodomain transcription factors can act as transcriptional activators or repressors that require separate but sometimes overlapping functional domains including a DNA-binding domain for their transcriptional activities (3Krasnow M.A. Saffman E.E.

In addition, it was recently demonstrated that homeoproteins interact with other transcription factors that lead to their functional specificity in vivo, utilizing a specific but conserved domain of the homeoproteins for these interactions (5Biggin M.D. McGinnis W.

In general, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins recruit a coactivator or corepressor for their transcriptional activation or repression of target genes (12Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev.

Additionally, tinman activity is required for the formation of glia-like dorsal-median cells (21Gorczyca M.G. Phillis R.W. Budnik V. Development. 1994; 120: 2143-2152PubMed Google Scholar), gonadal mesoderm (22Broihier H.T. Moore L.A. van Doren M. Newman S. Lehmann R.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In mammals, targeted disruptions of the mouse Nkx-2genes (Nkx-2.1/TTF1, Nkx-2.2, and Nkx-2.5) revealed their functions in organogenesis including heart development (25Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 26Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P.

Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Also, cross-phylum rescues of the NK-2 class of homeobox genes have recently been demonstrated (29Haun C. Alexander J. Stainer D.Y. Okkema P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5072-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Ranganayakulu G. Elliot D.A. Harvey R.P. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 3037-3048PubMed Google Scholar). For example, zebrafish nkx 2.5efficiently rescues a ceh-22 mutant when expressed in the pharyngeal muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans (29Haun C. Alexander J. Stainer D.Y. Okkema P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5072-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and mouseNkx2–5 rescued only visceral mesoderm when tested for its ability to rescue the tinman mutant phenotype ofDrosophila (30Ranganayakulu G. Elliot D.A. Harvey R.P. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 3037-3048PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, genetic evidence clearly indicates that NK-4 plays an important role during development and suggests that its function is well conserved in the animal species. NK-4 is initially expressed in the presumptive mesoderm at the cellular blastoderm stage, continues to be expressed in all mesodermal cells during germ band elongation, and eventually becomes restricted to dorsal mesodermal cells including precursor cells of the heart (15Bodmer R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1990; 110: 661-669PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, NK-4 has been shown to be regulated by the myogenic factor Twist during embryogenesis (31Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Yin Z. Xu X.L. Frasch M. Development. 1997; 124: 4971-4982PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, previous work has shown that inductive signals from dorsal ectodermal cells such as Dpp can induce tinman expression in the dorsal mesoderm (33Frasch M. Nature. 1995; 374: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 34Staehling-Hampton K. Hoffmann F.M. Baylies M.K. Rushton E. Bate M.

Similarly, chicken Nkx-2.5, a potential vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila NK-4 gene, was shown to be induced by BMP-2 and BMP-4 (36Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulatory pathways for its induction are also conserved. We have previously demonstrated that NK-4 binds to a target sequence (5′-TCAAGTG-3′) (31Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,37Gajewski K. Kim Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has recently been shown that NK-4 directly activates the D-mef2 gene in cardial cells (37Gajewski K. Kim Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and ventral muscle founder cells (42Gajewski K. Kim Y. Choi C.Y. Schulz R.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), makingD-mef2 the first known in vivo target of NK-4 to be described. Cofactors of NK-4 are totally unknown. However, physical interaction of Nkx-2.5 with GATA-4 has been reported, suggesting that they may act as mutual cofactors (43Durocher D. Charron F. Schwartz R.J. Warren R. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 44Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Despite the growing body of evidence that supports an important role for NK-4 during embryogenesis, the properties of NK-4 as a transcriptional regulator and the mechanism of gene transcription by NK-4 are still poorly understood. In this study, we characterize the functional domains of NK-4 that are responsible for its transcriptional activity. Our analysis reveals that NK-4 acts as either a transcriptional activator or repressor that utilizes separate functional domains for its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence of interaction of NK-4 with the p300 coactivator and the Groucho corepressor. For the generation of GAL4-NK-4 fusion constructs (Fig. 2 A), corresponding coding regions for NK-4 were amplified by PCR1 (30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) with specific primers, and amplified DNA fragments were codigested with EcoRI andXbaI (in the case of A4 and A5 constructs, EcoRI digestion). These DNA fragments were subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites (in the case of constructs A4 and A5, EcoRI site) of the pSG424 expression vector (46Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Open reading frames of each construct were confirmed either by sequencing with specific primers or by expression of fusion genes inE. coli (Fig. 5; see below) or by expression of GFP-NK-4 fusion genes in CV-1 cells. Specific primer sets used for PCR amplifications are as follows: A1, primer 20 and primer 502; A13, primer 20 and primer 69; A4, primer 20 and primer 70; A5, primer 20 and primer 25; A6, primer 20 and primer 501; A7, primer 20 and primer 520; A8, primer 20 and primer 500; A10, primer 519 and primer 501; A14, primer 9516 and primer 501; A15, primer 9517 and primer 501; A12, primer 912 and primer 502; A18, primer 9515 and primer 502; A19, primer 9525 and primer 502; A2, primer 422 and primer 502; A23, primer 9513 and primer 502; A24, primer 9536 and primer 502; A31, primer 9513 and primer 9538; A32, primer 9515 and primer 9535; A33, primer 9515 and primer 423; A34, primer 9515 and primer 9537; A35, primer 9515 and primer 9538.Figure 5Interaction of NK-4 with the Groucho corepressor. A, Groucho enhances the repressor activity of GAL4-NK-4. Cells were cotransfected with the G5EnXCAT reporter and the indicated expression vector (0.5 μg each) in the presence of increasing amounts of Groucho expression vector (GRO;lanes 2 and 6, 0.5 μg/transfection;lanes 3 and 7, 1 μg/transfection;lanes 4 and 8, 2 μg/transfection), and CAT activities were measured. The normalized CAT activity obtained from transfection with G5EnXCAT and pSG424 (GAL4 alone) was divided by the corresponding value obtained with a test expression vector, and -fold repression of the GAL4 and GAL4-NK-4 by Groucho is shown (averages of three sets of independent experiments). B, physical interaction of NK-4 with the Groucho corepressor. Cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged Groucho expression vector. Nuclear extracts were prepared and mixed with GST-NK-4 fusion protein (lane 3) or GST alone as control (lane 2) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The co-precipitated Myc-Groucho (GRO) was separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody. Lane 1 (Input) contained 4% (20 μg) of the amounts used for binding. C, analysis of NK-4-interaction domain of Groucho.

For the NK4A6 construct (Fig. 3 A), DNA fragments containing the activation domain (amino acids (aa) 1–110) of NK-4 were amplified with specific primers (primer 20 and primer 21 (5′-CAAGAATTCTGGTGGCGCCATCGTCCA-3′)), digested withEcoRI, and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pSG424 expression vector. For the SG424VP16 construct, DNA fragments containing the activation domain (aa 411–490) of VP-16 were amplified by PCR with specific primers (primer VPAD1 (5′-GCATGAATTCGCAGATCTGGCCCCCCCG-3′) and primer VPAD2 (5′-GATTGAATTCCCCACGGTACTCGTCAAT-3′)) and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pSG424. For the NK4HD1 construct that contains the NK-4 homeodomain (aa 297–364), DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with specific primers (primer NK4–53 (5′-GATGAATTCAAGCCCCGGATGAAGCGAAAG-3′) and primer 9538) and subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the pSG424 vector. For the cloning of the NK-1 homeodomain (aa 531–628), DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with specific primers (primer NK1–53 (5′-CAGGAATTCCGTAATGGGGATGGAAAG-3′) and primer NK1–35 (5′-CTATCTAGATGCCCCCGGACCGAAGGA-3′)) and subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the pSG424 vector to generate the GAL4-NK1HD plasmid. For constructions of series of the GAL4-NK-4 fusion expression vectors used in Fig. 3, plasmids containing the activation domain of either NK-4 (NK4A6 or NK4A6TDm) or VP16 (SG424VP16) were digested with EcoRI, and DNA fragments were eluted from the gel and subcloned into the EcoRI site of either the GAL4-NK-4 fusion constructs (A2, A31, NK4HD1, NK4HD(NQ), and NK4HD(SA); see below) or the GAL4-NK-1 fusion construct (GAL4-NK1HD). A PCR-based method was used to generate mutations within either the TN domain or the homeodomain. For the NK4A6TDm construct that contains a mutation (Phe → Ala at aa 38, TTT → GCT) within the TN domain, DNA fragments (TDm, aa 1–43) were amplified by PCR with specific primers (primer 20 and primer NK4FA (5′-GTTCAGGATATCCTTGACCGAAGCTGGAGTGGTGTTCAGGGC-3′), and amplified DNA fragments were codigested with EcoRI and EcoRV. The corresponding region of the NK4A6 construct was replaced by the TDm DNA fragments to generate the NK4A6TDm expression vector. For the A6-NK4HD(NQ) construct that contains a mutation (Asn → Gln at aa 351, AAT → CAG) at the helix III region of the homeodomain, two separate DNA fragments (fragment A, aa 188–356; fragment B, aa 345–416) were amplified by PCR with specific primers (fragment A, primer 422 and primer 9540 (5′-CGATTTGTAGCGCCGCTGCTGGAACCAAATCTTCACTTG-3′); fragment B, primer 9541 (5′-CAAGTGAAGATTTGGTTCCAGCAGCGGCGCTACAAATCG-3′ and primer 502). Mixed DNA fragments (A and B) were denatured and reannealed. DNAs (39-nucleotide overlap) were gap-filled with Vent DNA polymerase, and gap-filled DNAs were subjected to PCR with specific primers (primer 422 and primer 502). Amplified DNAs were gel-eluted and subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the pSG424 expression vector to generate the NK4HD(NQ) plasmid. For the A6NK4HD(SA) construct that contains a mutation (Ser → Ala at position 309, TCC → GCC) at the helix I region of the homeodomain, two separate DNA fragments (fragment C, aa 267–309; fragment D, aa 309–364) were amplified by PCR with specific primers (fragment C, primer 9539 (5′-CAAGAATTCGATAACAGCCAGGTGACC-3′ and primer NK4SA-1 (5′-GACTGAAGACTGGGCAAAGAGCACGCGAGGCTTTCG-3′); fragment D, primer NK4SA-2 (5′-GACTGAAGACTTTGCCCAGGCACAGGTCCTGGAGCT-3′) and primer 9538). DNA fragments (C and D) were digested withBbsI and ligated together. The ligated DNAs were codigested with EcoRI and XbaI and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pSG424 vector to generate the NK4HD(SA) plasmid. Mutations and open reading frames of the clones were confirmed by sequencing. Cell growth, transfections into cells with indicated reporters and expression vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, normalization of transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase activity, and CAT assays with a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were performed as described (31Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the constructions of truncated NK-4 expression vectors (d8 and d6), DNA fragments (121 bp, from 5′-untranslated region to the first ATG codon) were amplified by PCR with specific primers (primer NK453 (5′-TAAGTCGACGCGGCCGCGTACCCAGATTCCAATTC-3′) and primer LEE10 (5′-GATGAATTCCATCCTCGCTGTGCGAT-3′)). Amplified DNA was codigested with EcoRI andSalI and subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pBluscript vector in order to generate the pKSII-NK4N plasmid. Subsequently, coding regions of NK-4 from GAL4-NK-4 chimeras (A18 and A2 in Fig. 2 A, d8 and d6 in Fig. 1, respectively), which were obtained by codigestion with EcoRI and XbaI followed by gel elution, were subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the pKSII-NK4N plasmid to generate the pKSII-NK4d8 and the pKSII-NK4d6 plasmids. These plasmids were digested with NotI, and DNA fragments were subcloned into NotI site of pRC-CMV expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate d8 or d6 expression vectors. Expression vector for full-length NK-4 (NK-4, CMV-NK-4) and reporter plasmids (P1, P1E2m, E2CAT, and E2mCAT) were described previously (31Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The G5EnXCAT reporter plasmid, which contains SV40 enhancer, was described previously (47Kim Y.H.

For the construction of the Groucho expression vector, PCR-amplified cDNAs were subcloned into the pKSII vector, and the resulting plasmid (pKS-GRO) was confirmed and used for the construction of the Groucho expression vector (pCI-GRO) by inserting cDNA intoEcoRI/SalI sites of the pCI vector (Promega). For the construction of the Myc-tagged Groucho expression vector, theNcoI/XbaI DNA fragment from the pSPUTK-GRO was subcloned into the pCS3(+)MT expression vector. For the construction of the GST-NK-4 fusion protein expression vectors, DNA fragments of the corresponding regions of NK-4 were excised from GAL4-NK-4 fusion constructs (Fig. 2 A) and subcloned into either theEcoRI site of the pGEX5X-1 plasmid or into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the pGEX5X-1Xb plasmid containing an extra XbaI site. For the constructions of GST-TD and GST-TDm expression vectors, corresponding regions were amplified (primer 20 and primer 500) from NK4A6 and NK4A6TDm, respectively, and subcloned into pGEX5X-1. Expression and purification of the fusion proteins were performed as described previously (31Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol.

For the constructions of the truncated p300 expression plasmids, the NK-4, and the Groucho expression plasmids used for in vitro translation (Figs. 4 and 5), DNA fragments of the corresponding regions of p300 and Groucho were amplified by PCR with specific primers (in the case of construction of the NK-4 expression vector, the corresponding regions of the NK-4 were obtained from GAL4-NK-4 constructs) and subcloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of the pSPUTK vector.

https://openalex.org/W2093234875,"Endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1) is a basic helix-loop-helix/PAS domain transcription factor that is preferentially expressed in vascular endothelial cells. EPAS1 shares high homology with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and, like HIF-1α, has been shown to bind to the HIF-1-binding site and to activate its downstream genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin. In this report, we show that EPAS1 increased VEGF gene expression through the HIF-1-binding site. This transactivation was enhanced further by cotransfection of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator expression plasmid. Deletion analysis of EPAS1 revealed a potent activation domain (amino acids 486–639) essential for EPAS1 to transactivate the VEGF promoter. We confirmed the ability of this domain to activate transcription using a Gal4 fusion protein system. Because a truncated EPAS1 protein lacking the transactivation domain at amino acids 486–639 eliminated induction of the VEGF promoter by wild-type EPAS1, the truncated protein functions as a dominant-negative mutant. Most important, infection of the cells with an adenoviral construct expressing this mutant inhibited the induction of VEGF mRNA under conditions that mimic hypoxia. Our results suggest that EPAS1 is an important regulator of VEGF gene expression. Since VEGF plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the ability of dominant-negative EPAS1 to inhibit VEGF promoter activity raises the possibility of a novel approach to inhibiting pathological angiogenesis.

The basic helix-loop-helix and PAS domains in EPAS1 and HIF-1α share a particularly high degree of homology (83% identity in the basic helix-loop-helix domain and 66% identity in the PAS domain). Like HIF-1α, EPAS1 heterodimerizes with ARNT and binds to the HIF-1-binding site. However, the pattern of EPAS1 expression is distinct from that of HIF-1α. EPAS1 is expressed preferentially and at high levels in vascular endothelial cells from early development to adulthood. HIF-1α, in contrast, is expressed ubiquitously, but at low levels (1Ema M.

Pathol. 1998; 153: 25-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported recently that VEGF expression is up-regulated markedly in hemangioblastomas and that this up-regulation correlates highly with elevated EPAS1 expression, but not HIF-1α expression. These data suggest that the role EPAS1 plays in pathological angiogenesis is distinct from the role HIF-1α plays. The functional properties and domain structure of EPAS1, however, had not been characterized until this report. We show in vascular endothelial cells that EPAS1 transactivates the VEGF promoter through its HIF-1-binding site. Using a series of deletion mutants, we have identified a potent activation domain within the EPAS1 C terminus. By gene fusion experiments, we show that this activation domain is sufficient to confer transactivity to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We also show that a truncated EPAS1 protein that lacks the transactivation domain functions as a dominant-negative mutant and inhibits VEGF gene induction by desferrioxamine. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) and cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 60 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), and 50 mg/ml heparin as described (19Patterson C.

Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from calf aortas and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (20Lee M.-E. Temizer D.H.

The pGL2-Basic plasmid containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The pGL2hVEGF reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting the human VEGF promoter from base pairs (bp) −2362 to +61 into pGL2-Basic (22Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). pGL2hVEGFmut was identical to pGL2hVEGF, except that the HIF-1-binding site (bp −975 to −968) was mutated from TACGTGGG to TCTCGAGG. The EPAS1 expression vector phEP-1, which contains the entire coding sequence of human EPAS1 in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was a gift from Steven L. McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) (4Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Devel. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal deletion experiments described in this study, we designated this plasmid as phEP-1-(1–870). To construct phEP-1-(1–X) C-terminal deletion mutants, we amplified a section of phEP-1 encoding amino acids 279 to X of the EPAS1 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The specific 5′-primers contained an EcoRI site, and the 3′-primers contained an XbaI site. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the fragment was used to replace the corresponding site in phEP-1. To generate phHIF-1α, we first amplified a 2622-bp cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of human HIF-1α by reverse transcriptase-PCR with human leukocyte total RNA and Pfu DNA polymerase. The PCR fragment was then cloned into pcDNA3. phARNT was constructed by subcloning a BamHI fragment containing full-length ARNT-coding sequences from pBM5/NEO-M1-1 (a gift from Oliver Hankinson, University of California, Los Angeles, CA) (7Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3. For the Gal4-hEPAS1 fusion constructs, hEPAS1 fragments were fused in frame to the C terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) of pSG424 as described (24Yet S.-F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

The reporter pG5Luc (containing five Gal4-binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E1b gene) and the luciferase reporter gene were obtained from Promega. The authenticity of all constructs was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Recombinant adenoviruses were prepared with standard homologous recombination techniques using the replication-defective E1/E3-deleted serotype 5 human adenovirus (25Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). A Myc tag sequence was added to the 3′-end of the cDNA fragment of EPAS1-(1–870) or EPAS1-(1–485). We then used these fragments to replace the β-galactosidase fragment of the pAdCMVβGAL adenoviral shuttle plasmid, in which the expression of β-galactosidase cDNA is under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer (25Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These shuttle plasmids were cotransfected with the plasmid pJM17 into 293 cells. Recombinant adenovirus clones were isolated from a single plaque, expanded in 293 cells, and purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. The titer of the purified adenovirus was determined in 293 cells by plaque assay techniques. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase, EPAS1-(1–870), or EPAS1-(1–485) were designated as AdCMV.βGAL, AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–870), and AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–485), respectively. Expression of AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–870) and AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–485) was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-c-myc antibody (9E10, Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) and cell extracts from the infected HUVECs. Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride according to standard protocols (21Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Nitropure filters (MSI, Westborough, MA). The filters were then hybridized with 32P-labeled, randomly primed cDNA probes for 1 h at 68 °C in Quick-hyb solutions (Stratagene). The hybridized filters were washed in 30 mmNaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and autoradiographed on Eastman Kodak XAR film at −80 °C. A 1.0-kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragment of hEPAS1 cDNA or the 538-bp (bp 58–595) human VEGF cDNA fragment amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR according to the published human VEGF cDNA sequence was used as a probe (26Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in RNA loading, the filters were rehybridized with a radiolabeled 18 S oligonucleotide. phEP-1-(1–870) and its C-terminal deletion mutants contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter for in vitro expression. In vitro transcription and translation were carried out using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence or absence ofl-[35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the HIF-1-binding site (5′-CCACAGTGCATACGTGGGCTCCAACAGGTCCTCTT-3′) was derived from the sequence of the VEGF promoter (23Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described (21Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A typical binding reaction mixture contained 25,000 cpm probe, 5 μl of in vitro translated protein, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× buffer containing 22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were transfected with 0.15 μg of reporter construct and 0.5–1 μg of expression construct using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To correct for variation in transfection efficiency, we cotransfected 0.15 μg of pCAT3-Control (Promega) in all experiments. In some experiments, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 130 μm desferrioxamine (Sigma) for an additional 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection by a detergent lysis method (Promega). Luciferase activity and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity were measured as described (21Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity to CAT activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Each construct was transfected at least four times, and each transfection was done in triplicate. Data for each construct are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by a factorial analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test when appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Although EPAS1 has been shown to transactivate the VEGF promoter by transient transfection assays, it was not known whether EPAS1 increases the levels of VEGF mRNA (1Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first generated an adenoviral construct (AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–870)) that contains a full-length EPAS1 cDNA. By infecting HUVECs with increasing titers of AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–870), the adenovirus-derived EPAS1 mRNA (Fig. 1) and protein (data not shown) expression increased in a dose-dependent manner. This overexpression of EPAS1 resulted in a dose-dependant increase in VEGF mRNA abundance (Fig. 1). Induction of VEGF mRNA by AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–870) is specific because infection of the cells by the same titer of control adenovirus AdCMV.βGAL, which expresses β-galactosidase, did not increase the VEGF mRNA level (Fig.1). To further elucidate the mechanism by which EPAS1 increases the VEGF mRNA levels, we cotransfected into BAECs the human EPAS1 expression plasmid phEP-1 and the reporter plasmid pGL2hVEGF containing a 2.3-kilobase fragment of the human VEGF promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. EPAS1 increased VEGF promoter activity by 17-fold (Fig. 2 A). This up-regulation of VEGF promoter activity by EPAS1 appears to be specific because cotransfection of the EPAS1 expression plasmid had no effect on endothelin-1 promoter or SV40 promoter activity (data not shown). EPAS1 is known to bind to the HIF-1-binding site (4Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Devel. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). To determine whether EPAS1 transactivates the native VEGF promoter by binding to an HIF-1-binding site, we mutated the HIF-1-binding site at bp −975 to −968 (TACGTGGG to TCTCGAGG) of the VEGF promoter. A reporter plasmid harboring this mutated site (pGL2hVEGFmut) was transfected into BAECs in the presence and absence of EPAS1. Mutation of the HIF-1-binding site dramatically reduced induction of the VEGF promoter by EPAS1 (Fig.2 A). These data indicate that EPAS1 transactivates the VEGF promoter mainly through its HIF-1-binding site. EPAS1 has been shown to heterodimerize with ARNT (4Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Devel. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). To determine whether heterodimerization between EPAS1 and ARNT is important for transactivation of the VEGF promoter, we performed cotransfection experiments. EPAS1 alone increased VEGF promoter activity by 15-fold (Fig. 2 B), whereas ARNT alone did not significantly affect the VEGF promoter. Cotransfection of EPAS1 and ARNT synergistically increased VEGF promoter activity by 137-fold. Members of the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS family of transcription factors contain an activation domain in the C terminus (4Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W.

To determine whether the EPAS1 C terminus is necessary for EPAS1 to transactivate the VEGF promoter, we constructed several EPAS1 C-terminal deletion mutants. First, we confirmed the authenticity of the deletion mutants by sequencing and in vitrotranscription and translation followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 A). The size of each in vitro translated protein was consistent with its predicted molecular mass. Each construct was then cotransfected with phARNT and pGL2hVEGF into BAECs. As shown previously, full-length EPAS1 (phEP-1-(1–870)) increased VEGF promoter activity by 127-fold. Deletion of the C terminus (phEP-1-(1–690)) increased transactivation activity further (Fig. 3 B), and deletion of the 230 C-terminal amino acids (phEP-1-(1–639)) increased VEGF promoter activity by 567-fold. This increase raised the possibility of an inhibitory domain between amino acids 640 and 870 (see “Discussion”). Further deletion of the C terminus diminished transactivation (Fig. 3 B), and deletion of the 385 C-terminal amino acids (phEP-1-(1–485)) abolished the stimulatory effect of EPAS1 completely (Fig. 3 B), suggesting the presence of an activation domain between amino acids 486 and 639. To exclude the possibility that deletion of the EPAS1 C terminus had affected the ability of EPAS1 to dimerize with ARNT, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitrotranslated full-length or truncated EPAS1 proteins and a labeled probe containing the VEGF HIF-1 site. Full-length EPAS1 or ARNT alone did not bind to the probe; DNA binding activity was detected only in the presence of both proteins (Fig. 3 C). This DNA binding was specific to the HIF-1-binding site because a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe, but not the same amount of an arbitrary oligonucleotide encoding a nuclear factor κB-binding site, abolished binding. Both C-terminal mutants, EPAS1-(1–639) and EPAS1-(1–485), formed heterodimers with ARNT and bound to the HIF-1-binding site (Fig.3 C). Thus, it appears that the failure of EPAS1-(1–485) to transactivate the VEGF promoter was not due to an inability to form heterodimers with ARNT or to bind to DNA. To map the transactivation domain of EPAS1 further, we generated a series of plasmids containing various fragments of EPAS1 fused to the DNA-binding domain (corresponding to amino acids 1–147) of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (Fig.4). The fusion plasmids were cotransfected into BAECs with a reporter construct containing five Gal4-binding sites in front of the minimal promoter of the adenovirus E1b gene and luciferase (pG5Luc). The Gal4-hEPAS1 plasmid encoding EPAS1 amino acids 481–870 increased transcription by 146-fold relative to the plasmid encoding Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone (Gal4-(1-147)) (Fig. 4). Fusion plasmids encoding shorter EPAS1 C termini, Gal4-hEPAS1-(481–688) and Gal4-hEPAS1-(481–639), had higher transcriptional activity (9051- and 14,854-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4). Although further deletion of the C terminus diminished transactivation by EPAS1, Gal4-hEPAS1-(481–545) still had significantly higher transcriptional activity (2727-fold) than Gal4-(1–147) (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with those from the experiments with EPAS1 C-terminal deletion mutant plasmids (Fig.3 B) and indicate the presence of a potent activation domain between amino acids 481 and 639. Furthermore, the N-terminal part (amino acids 481–545) also appears to contain a transactivation domain that is transferable to the heterologous Gal4 protein (Fig.4). To determine whether the C-terminal portion of sequence 481–639 contains an activation domain, we deleted amino acids 481–639 from the N terminus. Transactivation diminished markedly with Gal4-hEPAS1-(540–639) (Fig. 4) and was only minimal with plasmids encoding amino acids 593–639 and 540–597. Thus, although the C-terminal portion of sequence 481–639 is required for maximal activity, it fails to confer activity on a heterologous protein. To rule out the possibility that this difference in activity reflected differences in the level of fusion protein expression, we performed parallel immunoblotting experiments with an anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibody. We found that the expression level for each Gal4 fusion protein was similar (data not shown). These data indicate that a potent transactivation domain is located within EPAS1 amino acids 481–545, although amino acids 546–639 are also necessary for full transactivation. EPAS1-(1–485) was able to form heterodimers with ARNT and to bind to the HIF-1-binding site (Fig. 3 C), but was not able to transactivate the VEGF promoter (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we hypothesized that phEP-1-(1–485) may function as a dominant-negative mutant. To test this possibility, we cotransfected into BAECs phARNT, phEP-1-(1–870), and increasing amounts of phEP-1-(1–485) with the reporter pGL2hVEGF. phEP-1-(1–870) and phARNT (0.15 μg each in this experiment) increased VEGF promoter activity by 58-fold (Fig. 5 A, white bars). phEP-1-(1–485) inhibited induction of the VEGF promoter by phEP-1-(1–870) and phARNT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A, white bars). Hypoxia is an important stimulus for angiogenesis, and hypoxia increases the abundance of the EPAS1 protein (33Wiesener M. Turley H. Allen W. Willam C. Eckardt K. Talks K. Wood S. Gatter K. Harris A. Pugh C. Ratcliffe P. Maxwell P. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested whether conditions that mimic hypoxia increase the activity of transfected phEP-1-(1–870) and whether dominant-negative EPAS1 inhibits induction of the VEGF promoter by EPAS1 under hypoxic conditions. To mimic the effect of hypoxia, we treated BAECs with desferrioxamine as described (4Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Devel. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar, 34Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82 (12): 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Desferrioxamine increased the effect of EPAS1 on the VEGF promoter (460-fold maximum) (Fig.5 A, black bars). In addition, induction of VEGF promoter activity by EPAS1 in desferrioxamine-treated cells was inhibited by phEP-1-(1–485) in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was nearly complete at higher doses of phEP-1-(1–485). Because HIF-1α must dimerize with ARNT before activating target genes, we speculated that phEP-1-(1–485), by sequestering ARNT, may also work against HIF-1α as a dominant-negative protein. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected into BAECs phARNT, the HIF-1α expression plasmid phHIF-1α, and increasing amounts of phEP-1-(1–485) with the reporter pGL2hVEGF and then treated the cells with desferrioxamine. phHIF-1α and phARNT increased VEGF promoter activity by 7.7-fold (Fig. 5 B, white bars). Desferrioxamine increased the effect of HIF-1α on the VEGF promoter by 57-fold (Fig.5 B, black bars). Also, phEP-1-(1–485) inhibited induction of the VEGF promoter by HIF-1α and ARNT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). We further wanted to know whether phEP-1-(1–485) could inhibit activation of the VEGF promoter by endogenous EPAS1 or HIF-1α in the presence of desferrioxamine. Desferrioxamine increased VEGF promoter activity by 4.9-fold (Fig. 6), an increase similar to that observed with exogenously transfected EPAS1 and HIF-1α (Fig. 5, A and B). This increase was inhibited by phEP-1-(1–485) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). To determine whether this dominant-negative isoform of EPAS1 can inhibit induction of endogenous VEGF mRNA by desferrioxamine, we generated an adenoviral construct (AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–485)) that expresses the truncated form of EPAS1. Desferrioxamine markedly increased VEGF mRNA abundance in control HUVECs infected by AdCMV.βGAL (Fig. 7). However, this induction of VEGF mRNA by desferrioxamine was markedly inhibited in AdCMV.EPAS1-(1–485)-infected cells. These results suggest that dominant-negative EPAS1 functions as an inhibitor of endogenous VEGF gene induction under conditions that mimic hypoxia. We show in this report that EPAS1 induces VEGF gene expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 1) and that this induction is mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2 A). Although the activity of the VEGF promoter is regulated by multiplecis-acting elements, we (23Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and others (15Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the HIF-1 site located 1 kilobase distal to the transcription start site mediates hypoxia-induced increases in VEGF promoter activity. EPAS1-induced increases in VEGF promoter activity are mediated through an HIF-1-binding site and are enhanced markedly by cotransfection with ARNT (Fig. 2 B). In two assay systems (Figs. 3 and 4), we identified a potent transactivation domain between amino acids 486 and 639. An EPAS1 mutant that lacks this transactivation domain functions as a dominant-negative form of the protein under basal normoxic conditions and after treatment with desferrioxamine to pharmacologically mimic hypoxic conditions. Both EPAS1 (Fig. 2 B) and HIF-1α (1Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 15Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind the VEGF HIF-1 site. However, the tissue distribution of EPAS1 and HIF-1α is quite different; EPAS1 is mainly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, whereas HIF-1α is more ubiquitous. Thus, EPAS1 and HIF-1α may not necessarily compete for the same binding site in the same cells. Instead, they may collaborate to adapt tissue in response to hypoxia. The EPAS1 transactivation domain between amino acids 481 and 545 is rich in acidic residues (25%; estimated pI 3.4). In its acidic nature, the EPAS1 activation domain is similar to those of other transcription factors such as Gal4 and Gcn4 (35Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Jiang et al. (30Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) have reported that HIF-1α has two transactivation domains at amino acids 531–575 (TAD-N) and 786–826 (TAD-C). Sequence 481–545 of the EPAS1 activation domain and HIF-1α TAD-N share a high sequence identity (58%). In our study, however, we found that amino acids 546–639 of EPAS1 are also required for full target gene transactivation. This sequence is completely different from the sequence that follows TAD-N in HIF-1α. Although the most C-terminal sequence of EPAS1 (amino acids 820–870) does share a high sequence identity with HIF-1α TAD-C (62%), sequence 820–870 did not function as a transactivation domain in our studies. This difference may be due to the presence of fewer acidic residues in the EPAS1 sequence in comparison with the HIF-1α sequence (12 versus 17%) or to a difference in the cell types tested. The lower transcriptional activity of Gal4-hEPAS1-(481–870) in comparison with that of Gal4-hEPAS1-(481–639) (Fig. 4) raised the possibility that EPAS1 amino acids 640–870 contain a repressor domain. However, we were unable to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of Gal4-hEPAS1-(640–870) on adenovirus E1b gene minimal promoter activity (data not shown). An alternative explanation would be that removal of EPAS1 amino acids 640–870 may cause a conformational change that exposes the EPAS1 activation domain to the target gene. A truncated EPAS1 protein lacking the C terminus retains the ability to form heterodimers and to bind to the HIF-1α-binding site (Fig. 3). Thus, it may sequester ARNT and prevent the formation of functional EPAS1/ARNT and HIF-1α/ARNT heterodimers in the way that Id inhibits formation of MyoD/E2A heterodimers (36Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Indeed, the EPAS1 C-terminal mutant potently inhibited induction of the VEGF promoter by wild-type EPAS1 and HIF-1α in the presence and absence of desferrioxamine (Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, an EPAS1 C-terminal mutant inhibited the induction of endogenous VEGF mRNA by desferrioxamine (Fig. 7). We have also found that EPAS1 induces the KDR/flk-1promoter and that EPAS1 truncated at the C terminus inhibits induction of the KDR/flk-1 promoter by full-length EPAS1. 2K. Maemura and M.-E. Lee, unpublished observation. As an EPAS1 dominant-negative protein, the C-terminal mutant may inhibit the transcription of VEGF as well as that of its receptor. The ability of the dominant-negative form of EPAS1 to inhibit the transcription of VEGF under hypoxic condition has important therapeutic implications, given the pivotal role of VEGF in pathological angiogenesis associated with many diseases (37Folkman J.

https://openalex.org/W2016845933,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) contains a gene encoding a G protein-coupled receptor (KSHV-GPCR) that is homologous to mammalian chemokine receptors. KSHV-GPCR signals constitutively (in an agonist-independent manner) via the phosphoinositide-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway. Because it has been proposed that the N terminus (N-TERM) of other GPCRs may act as tethered agonists, we determined whether the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR is necessary for constitutive signaling activity or ligand binding, or both. We show that replacement of the entire N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR with those of two other GPCRs, deletion of residues within the N-TERM, and disruption of a putative disulfide bond that may hold the N-TERM in close proximity to extracellular loop 3 do not affect constitutive signaling activity but decrease chemokine binding. There were differences in the effects of mutation of the N-TERM on binding of the chemokines growth-related oncogene α, which is an agonist, and interferon-γ-inducible protein-10, which is an inverse agonist. The effects on chemokine binding were accompanied by changes in chemokine regulation of KSHV-GPCR signaling. We conclude that the N-TERM is not necessary for constitutive KSHV-GPCR signaling, i.e. the N-TERM is not a tethered agonist, but plays a crucial role in binding of chemokine ligands and of chemokine regulation of KSHV-GPCR signaling.

Currently, it is the most common AIDS-related tumor. The causative agent for this disease appears to be a member of the herpesvirus family known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)1 or human herpesvirus 8, which is also likely involved in the pathogenesis of primary effusion lymphoma and Castleman's disease (1Boshoff C. Weiss R.A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 57-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the genes encoded by KSHV, ORF-74, is a chemokine-like G protein-coupled receptor (KSHV-GPCR). KSHV-GPCR has been found to be a constitutively (or basally) active receptor that signals through the phosphoinositide-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway, stimulates cell proliferation, and transforms rodent fibroblasts (2Arvanitakis L.

Based on its signaling properties and stimulation of cell proliferation, we suggested that KSHV-GPCR may play an important role in KSHV-induced tumorigenesis (2Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 3Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E.

Thus, delineation of the mechanism of regulation of KSHV-GPCR signaling may lead to insights into the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and to drugs that may treat Kaposi's sarcoma. Based on the mechanism of activation of protease-activated receptors (7Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the N terminus (N-TERM) of the GPCR functions as a “tethered ligand,” we considered whether the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR acts as a tethered agonist to constitutively activate the receptor. Protease-activated receptors are not constitutively active but undergo proteolysis of their extreme N-TERM to uncover the activating domain within the N-TERM. We reasoned that changes within the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR during viral evolution could have led to its serving as a tethered agonist without requiring protease cleavage. It is noteworthy that mutations within the melanocortin-1 receptor have been suggested to cause constitutive activation by mimicking the effect of agonist (8Lu D.S. Vage D.I. Cone R.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and that the binding of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to the N-TERM of its cognate GPCR, CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), may produce a pseudo-tethered ligand (9Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23186-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because the N-TERMs of other chemokine receptors are involved in ligand binding (10Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar), we also determined whether the N-TERM was involved in regulation of KSHV-GPCR signaling by chemokines (4Geras-Raaka E. Varma A.

Out data show that the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR, although playing an important role in ligand binding and chemokine regulation of signaling, is not necessary for the constitutive activity of the receptor. All KSHV-GPCR mutants were constructed by PCR using pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR as template (2Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E.

Δ(2–11), Δ(2–11)/4A, Δ(1–22), and Δ(2–29) were constructed using the following oligonucleotides: (a) 5′-CAAGAATTCCACCATGGATGATGATGAATCCTGGAATGAAACT-3′, (b) 5′-CCGGAATTCTCCGGACCACCATGGCTGCTGCTGCATCCTGGAATGAAACTCTAAATATGA- GC-3′, (c) 5′-CAAGAATTCCACCATGAGCGGATATGACTACTCTGGAAACTT-3′, and (d) 5′-CAAGTGGAATTCCACCATGGGAAACTTCAGCCTAGAAGTGAGCGTGTGT-3′, respectively, as sense primers, and (e) 5′-ACTGCTTCTTGGGCCAGGAACGCGTAG-3′ as the antisense primer.EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites were used to clone the PCR fragments into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR.

For antisense primers, C39A used primer e, and C286A used primerg (5′-GGTTTAAACGGGCCCTCTAGACTCGAGCGG-3′. The two overlapping primers were as follows: (h) 5′-CTAGAAGTGAGCGTGGCTGAGATGACCACCGTGGTGCCTTACACG-3′, and (i) 5′-CACGGTGGTCATCTCAGCCACGCTCACTTCTAGGCTGAAGTTTCCAGA-3′ for C39A; and (j) 5′-ATCCGGGACAGCGCCTATACGCGGGGGTTGATAAACGTGGGT-3′ and (k) 5′-CCCCCGCGTATAGGCGCTGTCCCGGATCCAGCGTCGCCTTAG-3′ for C286A. PCR products for C39A were ligated into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR using EcoRI and EcoRV; for C286A,EcoRV and XbaI sites were used. C39A/C286A was constructed through digesting and ligating C39A and C286A. CXCR3-NT and hCTR3-NT were also generated through overlapping PCR, only that more than one template was involved. For CXCR3-NT, primersl (5′-CCGGAATTCTCCGGACCACCATGGTCCTTGAGGTGAGTGACCACCAAGTG-3′) and m (5′-GAGTATTCCAACGTTCAGGCTGAAGTCCTGTGGGCAGGGCGG-3′) were used on template pcDNA3-CXCR3, and primers n(5′-GACTTCAGCCTGAACGTTGGAATACTCTCTCTGATTTTCCTC-3′) and ewere used on pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR. Then, the two PCR fragments were combined, and primers l and e were used to amplify them. In the making of hCTR3-NT, primers o(5′-CAAGAATTCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGATGGATGCGCAGTACAAATGCTAT-3′) and p (5′-GGTCATCTCACACATAGTATAGTTGGACCACGTGCGATT-3′) were used on template pMT4ProlacFLAGShCTR (11Nussenzveig D.R. Thaw C.N. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28123-28129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and primers q(5′-TCCAACTATACTATGTGTGAGATGACCACCGTGGTGCCTTAC-3′) ande were used on pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR. Primers oand e were used in the second PCR. The restriction sitesEcoRI and EcoRV were used to ligate both PCR products into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR. KSHV-GPCR-(His)10-(Gly)5-FLAG-Gly-FLAG (wild-type (WT)-H/F) was constructed by PCR using primersr(5′-CAAGTGGAATTCCTCGAGCACCATGGCGGCCGAGGATTTCCTAACCATCTTC-3′ ands(5′- GCCTCTAGAAGATCTCTAACCACCACCACCACCGTGGTGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGCGTGGTGGCGCCGGACATGAA-3′). The PCR fragment of about 1.2 kilobases was isolated using Qiagen spin columns. A second PCR was carried out with primers r andt(5′-CGCTCTAGAGTTAACCTACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCCCTTATCATCATCATCCTTGTAATCACCACCACCACCACCGTGGTG-3′) with the isolated PCR fragment as a template. The new PCR fragment was digested with EcoRV and XbaI and ligated into pCDNA3.1-KSHV-GPCR. The H/F mutant plasmids were created by digestion and ligation using EcoRI andEcoRV sites (for Δ(2–11), Δ(2–11)/4A, Δ(1–22), Δ(2–29), CXCR3-NT, hCTR3-NT, and C39A) or Bsu 36I andEcoRI sites (for C286A and C39A/C286A). All mutants were screened by unique restriction sites and length differentiation and confirmed by sequencing. COS-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (2Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) with pcDNA 3.1 plasmids (mock transfectants were cells transfected with plasmid not encoding a receptor) encoding the WT or mutant KSHV-GPCR. Transfected cells were reseeded into 24-well plates 24 h later in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% Nu-Serum (Collaborative Research) and 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products). HEK 293EM cells (a generous gift of R. Horlick (Pharmacopeia, Cranbury, NJ)) were transfected using calcium phosphate or SuperFectTM (Qiagen). Forty-eight or 72 h after transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HHBSS). The cells were then incubated in HHBSS containing 10 mm LiCl in the absence or presence of various ligands for 2 h at 37 °C. Accumulated inositol phosphates were measured using ion-exchange chromatography as described (12Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate accumulation was analyzed as 3H-inositol phosphates/(3H-lipids + 3H-inositol phosphates). Cells were transfected and seeded as described above except that nomyo-[3H]inositol was added. Forty-eight h after reseeding, cells were rinsed once with cold HHBSS and then incubated in cold HHBSS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10 pm125I-Groα (NEN Life Science Products) in the absence or presence of various competing ligands for 4 h at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold HHBSS containing 0.5 m NaCl and lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.4 n NaOH. Cell lysates were transferred to glass test tubes and counted in a gamma counter. We developed an assay to measure receptor expression using receptors dually tagged with 10 His residues and 2 FLAG epitopes at the C termini (H/F-tagged). COS-1 or HEK 293EM cells were transfected with plasmids encoding H/F-tagged receptors as described above in 10-cm dishes. After 72 h, the cells were scraped in Buffer A (PBS containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and 50 μg/ml bacitracin) (2 ml/dish). The scraped cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1.5 ml of Buffer A, and lysed in a Tri-R Star homogenizer. The lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei, the supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. After 10 min, 100 μl of the lysates were transferred into each well of a 96-well plate that had Ni+ chelated to polystyrene on the well bottom (Reacti-BindTM, Pierce). The plate was rinsed once with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and 0.2 ml of 5% milk (in wash buffer) for each well was used for blocking (30 min). After aspiration, anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) at 1:300 dilution was added for 1 h. The plate was then washed twice with 0.2 ml of wash buffer, and the β-galactosidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Tropix) was added for 1 h. After the incubation, the plate was washed as before, 0.07 ml of the β-galactosidase substrate (Galacton-StarTM, Tropix) was added for 15 min, and the luminescence was measured in a 96-well plate luminometer (TR 717, Tropix). We studied WT KSHV-GPCR and the following KSHV-GPCR mutants (Fig.1): CXCR3-NT, in which the first 50 residues of the N-TERM were substituted by the first 50 residues of CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), the cognate receptor for IP-10 and monokine-induced by interferon-γ (13Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar); hCTR3-NT, in which the first 50 residues of the N terminus were substituted by the first 86 residues of human calcitonin receptor type 3 (14Ho H.H. Gilbert M.T. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); Δ(2–11), lacking amino acid residues 2–11; Δ(2–11)/4A, lacking residues 2–11 and having Asp-12, Asp-13, Asp-14 and Glu-15 substituted by Ala; Δ(1–22), lacking residues 1–22; Δ(2–29), lacking residues 2–29; C39A, in which Cys-39 was substituted by Ala; C286A, in which Cys-286 was substituted by Ala; and C39A/C286A, in which Cys-39 and Cys-286 were substituted by Ala. All mutant KSHV-GPCRs exhibited constitutive signaling activity when expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2). Groα is a CXC chemokine that contains the sequence ELR and is a high affinity agonist at KSHV-GPCR (6Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Gershengorn M.C. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found that CXCR3-NT, hCTR3-NT, Δ(2–11)/4A, Δ(1–22), and Δ(2–29) did not bind125I-Groα with sufficiently high affinity to be characterized in a binding assay. Indeed, in addition to WT, only Δ(2–11) exhibited high affinity binding of 125I-Groα. Binding of 125I-Groα to Δ(2–11) was only 10% of that to WT. These data show that the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR is important for binding Groα. To estimate the level of expression of receptors that did not bind 125I-Groα with high affinity, we developed a chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using H/F-tagged receptors. The His residues allowed the solubilized receptors to be chelated by Ni+ bound to polystyrene at the bottom of wells in a 96-well plate. The FLAG epitopes of the Ni+-adsorbed receptors were bound with the monoclonal antibody M2 and measured with a secondary antibody conjugated to β-galactosidase. Fig.3 illustrates the direct relationship between the luminescent signal and the binding of125I-Groα to WT KSHV-GPCR-H/F. These data validate this assay for quantitation of receptor expression. There was no difference in constitutive signaling between untagged and H/F-tagged WT and KSHV-GPCR mutant receptors (data not shown).Figure 3Comparison of M2 monoclonal antibody and125I-Groα binding to cells expressing KSHV-GPCR-H/F. Specific 125I-Groα and anti-FLAG-M2 antibody binding were measured in wells containing various amounts of COS-1 cells expressing WT KSHV-GPCR-H/F. The total cell number was 40,000 in all wells by addition of untransfected COS-1 cells. The nonspecific signal from cells transfected with KSHV-GPCR (without tags) was subtracted from the total signal. The data are the mean ± S.D. of three determinations in one representative experiment of two performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 illustrates an experiment in which H/F-tagged, mutant KSHV-GPCRs were expressed in HEK 293EM cells. As shown in Fig. 2 in COS-1 cells, CXCR3-NT and hCTR3-NT exhibited constitutive activity. The basal levels of signaling were 28 and 39% of WT for CXCR3-NT and hCTR3-NT, respectively. The level of expression of CXCR3-NT was 18% of WT, and that of hCTR3-NT was 44% of WT. Thus, the lowered basal levels of signaling of these two KSHV-GPCR mutant receptors appeared to be due to their lower levels of expression (see below). These findings show that the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR is not needed for basal signaling activity. To confirm that the N-TERM is not needed for basal signaling and to begin to delineate the domains within the N-TERM that are necessary for binding and regulation of KSHV-GPCR signaling by chemokines, we used KSHV-GPCR mutant receptors that had deletions within their N-TERMs. Fig. 4 illustrates the levels of basal signaling and expression of these mutant receptors in HEK 293EM cells. We consistently observed lower levels of basal signaling and of receptors in cells expressing these mutant receptors than in cells expressing WT KSHV-GPCR. The levels of basal signaling were 20, 64, 33, and 42% of WT, and the levels of expression were 43, 57, 11, and 17% of WT for Δ(2–11), Δ(2–11)/4A, Δ(1–22), and Δ(2–29), respectively. These N-TERM deletion mutant receptors, therefore, appear to exhibit a lowered basal signaling that is proportional to their lowered levels of expression (see below). These data further support the conclusion that the N-TERM is not involved in constitutive signaling of KSHV-GPCR. Fig. 5 illustrates that the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR is important for Groα binding. As shown in Fig. 2, only WT and Δ(2–11) bound 125I-Groα with high affinity. The loss of binding in Δ(2–11)/4A shows that the negatively charged sequence Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu at positions 12–15 is important for binding Groα, which, like other chemokines (16Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar), contains a number of Lys and Arg residues in its C terminus. The decreased binding of125I-Groα to Δ(2–11) compared with WT is not accounted for by a decrease in the affinity of 125I-Groα binding (Fig. 5) but represented a lower level of expression of Δ(2–11) of approximately 40% of WT (Fig. 4). The binding affinities for Groα were indistinguishable for WT and Δ(2–11) with equilibrium inhibitory constants (K i values) of 2.8 (2.1–3.7 nm) and 5.3 nm (3.4–8.3 nm), respectively. By contrast, Δ(2–11) exhibited a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity for IP-10, which is a CXC chemokine that does not contain the ELR sequence and is an inverse agonist of KSHV-GPCR (4Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Ho H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), compared with WT; K i for IP-10 of 120 nm(72–190 nm) for Δ(2–11) and 12 nm (10–15 nm) for WT. These data suggested that although both Groα and IP-10 bind to KSHV-GPCR, at least in part, via interacting with the N-TERM, there are different domains within the N-TERM that interact with Groα and IP-10. Fig. 6 illustrates that mutations of the N-TERM that decrease binding of Groα and IP-10 decrease the activities of these chemokines to stimulate and inhibit KSHV-GPCR signaling, respectively. CXCR3-NT, hCTR3-NT, Δ(2–11)/4A, Δ(1–22), and Δ(2–29) did not bind Groα, and Groα did not stimulate signaling of these mutant receptors, nor did IP-10 inhibit it. It is not surprising that IP-10 does not inhibit signaling by, for example, hCTR3-NT, because the N-TERM of hCTR3, which is important in binding its cognate ligand calcitonin (17Stroop S.D. Kuestner R.E. Serwold T.F. Chen L. Moore E.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Stroop S.D. Nakamuta H. Kuestner R.E. Moore E.E. Epand R.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4752-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is very different from that of KSHV-GPCR. It was perhaps surprising that basal signaling of CXCR3-NT was not inhibited by IP-10, because the N-TERM of CXCR3 is likely involved in binding IP-10 to wild-type CXCR3 (10Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). We cannot determine whether IP-10 does not bind to CXCR3-NT or whether it binds but does not inhibit signaling because radioiodinated IP-10, which is used to measure binding to CXCR3 (19Weng Y.M. Siciliano S.J. Waldburger K.E. Sirotina-Meisher A. Staruch M.J. Daugherty B.L. Gould S.L. Springer M.S. DeMartino J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18288-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), does not exhibit high affinity binding to KSHV-GPCR (data not shown). In contrast to the lack of effects of both Groα and IP-10 on the other mutant receptors, Groα stimulated signaling by Δ(2–11), but 1000 nm IP-10 did not inhibit it. The lack of inhibition of Δ(2–11) signaling by IP-10 is not due to its reduced affinity because the concentration of IP-10 used in the experiment is estimated to occupy more than 95% of the available receptors. Therefore, the deletion of residues 2–11 must inhibit some postbinding step that is necessary for IP-10 to inactivate the receptor. That is, there must be a consequence of the binding of IP-10 to residues 2–11 in the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR, perhaps by mediating a change in IP-10 conformation that allows IP-10 to act as an inverse agonist. Thus, the N-TERM is important in binding chemokines and in allowing a secondary effect that allows chemokines to regulate KSHV-GPCR signaling. We have previously proposed that a conformational change occurs in another ligand, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, upon binding to its cognate GPCR and that the induced conformation is biologically more active than the predominant conformation found in solution (20Laakkonen L. Li W.H. Perlman J.H. Guarnieri F. Osman R. Moeller K.D. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1092-1096PubMed Google Scholar). There is a conserved Cys residue in the N-TERM and another in the third extracellular loop in chemokine receptors that appear to form a disulfide bond and were shown to be important for ligand binding in other chemokine GPCRs (9Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23186-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Tournamille C. Le Van Kim C. Gane P. Blanchard D. Proudfoot A.E. Cartron J.P.

Dupriez V. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18902-18908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cys residues in the N-TERM and extracellular loop-3 of KSHV-GPCR may form a disulfide bond, we constructed C39A, C286A, and C39A/C286A receptors. All three Cys-to-Ala mutant receptors were expressed at the cell surface and exhibited constitutive signaling activity (Fig.7). The levels of basal signaling were 61, 68, and 68% of WT, and the levels of expression were 79, 80, and 29% of WT for C39A, C286A and C39A/C286A, respectively. Thus, as with the other N-TERM mutant KSHV-GPCRs (see above), the lowered basal signaling of the Cys-to-Ala mutant receptors appeared to be due to their lowered levels of expression (see below). We did not observe any high affinity binding of 125I-Groα to these mutants (data not shown). To support the idea that the decrease in binding was caused by loss of a disulfide bond, we pretreated cells expressing WT receptors with dithiothreitol and N-ethylmaleimide. As expected, we found a marked decrease (>95%) in high affinity binding of 125I-Groα to cells in which WT KSHV-GPCR was reduced and alkylated (data not shown). Fig. 8illustrates that 100 nm Groα stimulated but 1000 nm IP-10 did not inhibit signaling of C39A, C286A, or C39A/C286A receptors. To further delineate the effects of disruption of this disulfide, we measured the concentration dependences of Groα stimulation. Fig. 9 illustrates that there were similar rightward shifts of the Groα concentration-response curves for all three Cys-to-Ala mutant receptors compared with WT. The half-maximally effective concentration (EC50) of Groα was 7.1 nm (4.9–10 nm) in cells expressing WT and 71–79 nm(19–340 nm) in those expressing the Cys to Ala substitution mutant receptors. Thus, the lack of high affinity binding appears to be caused by 10-fold decreases in affinities. It is noteworthy that the double mutant, C39A/C286A, did not show a greater increase in EC50 for Groα than C39A or C286A. This lack of additivity of effects of two mutations has been taken as evidence that the two mutations affect the same aspect of GPCR structure (23Osman R. Colson A.-O. Perlman J.H. Laakkonen L.J. Gershengorn M.C. Wess J. Structure/Function of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) and, therefore, further support the idea that there is a disulfide bond between Cys-39 and Cys-286 in WT KSHV-GPCR. This disulfide bond is important for proper interaction between the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR and chemokine ligands.Figure 8Effects of substituting Cys-39 and Cys-286 with Ala on KSHV-GPCR signaling.

The data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations in two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we probed the role of the N-TERM in KSHV-GPCR signaling. We find that the N-TERM is not required for basal (or constitutive) signaling by KSHV-GPCR. That is, the N-TERM does not serve as a tethered agonist. This is, perhaps, most easily appreciated in Fig.10, which shows a direct correlation between the levels of constitutive signaling and of expression for 9 of the 10 KSHV-GPCRs studied herein. We do not understand why Δ(2–11) appeared to exhibit a lower basal signaling activity relative to its expression than the other receptors. We conclude, therefore, that there is a domain(s) in KSHV-GPCR other than the N-TERM that causes the receptor to signal constitutively. A related conclusion regarding the involvement of a domain in addition to the N-TERM for chemokine activation of a mammalian GPCR has been drawn. Pease et al. (24Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) found that chimeras of CCR1 and CCR3 that contained the N-TERM of one receptor fused to the remainder of the other receptor were able to bind macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and eotaxin, the cognate ligands for CCR1 and CCR3, respectively, but neither ligand activated either chimeric receptor. One way of searching for this domain is to see whether there are any differences in amino acid residues in KSHV-GPCR at positions that are highly conserved and are important in signaling in other members of the same GPCR subfamily. This is based on the observations that mutations of critical residues in GPCRs can convert them from basally inactive to constitutively active (25Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gershengorn M.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 27-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There are several residues that are highly conserved in GPCRs of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic subfamily, of which KSHV-GPCR is a member, that are involved in signaling but are substituted in KSHV-GPCR. For example, there is a highly conserved (D/E)RY sequence in the intracellular region of transmembrane helix 3 and a highly conserved NPXXY sequence in the intracellular region of transmembrane helix 7 of rhodopsin subfamily members that have been shown to be involved in signaling (26Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Both the D/E of the (D/E)RY sequence and the N of the NPXXY are Val residues in KSHV-GPCR. However, KSHV-GPCR mutants in which either of these residues was substituted by the conserved residue exhibited unchanged basal signaling activities. 2H. H. Ho, E. Kershaw, and M. C. Gershengorn, unpublished observations. Mammalian chemokine receptors generally bind chemokines of the CXC or CC family, but not both (27Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). For most chemokine receptors, important interactions between ligand and receptor involve the receptor N-TERM (10Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). KSHV-GPCR binds CXC and CC chemokines (2Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), and we have now shown that important interactions involve the KSHV-GPCR N-TERM. It is, therefore, interesting that a mammalian seven-transmembrane spanning protein, Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines, which is a protein with a topology similar to GPCRs but which has not been shown to exhibit signaling activity (28Hadley T.J. Peiper S.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3077-3091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds CXC and CC chemokines with primary interactions involving its N-TERM (29Lu Z. Wang Z. Horuk R. Hesselgesser J. Lou Y. Hadley T.J. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26239-26245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is, however, no sequence homology between the N-TERMs of KSHV-GPCR and Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines. We provide evidence for a disulfide bond between Cys-39 in the N-TERM and Cys-286 in extracellular loop-3 of KSHV-GPCR and found that it was important in binding chemokines. A disulfide bond between Cys residues in the same positions of two mammalian chemokine receptors, CCR2 (9Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23186-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (21Tournamille C. Le Van Kim C. Gane P. Blanchard D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16274-16280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), have been described also, and this pair of Cys residues is highly conserved in chemokine receptors in general (16Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). A pairs of Cys residues, which appears to form a disulfide bond between the N-TERM and third extracellular loop, is present in the bradykinin B2 receptor, another rhodopsin subfamily member (30Herzig M.C.S. Nash N.R. Connolly M. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29746-29751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This pair of Cys residues, however, is not found in most GPCRs. Our findings that show that the N-TERM of KSHV-GPCR is important for binding and regulation of signaling by chemokine agonists and inverse agonists is similar to the findings with mammalian chemokine GPCRs (10Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar).

In previous studies, we identified a kinase unique to H. influenzae extracts that phosphorylates Kdo-lipid IVA, a key precursor of lipopolysaccharide in this organism. We have now identified the gene encoding the Kdo kinase by using an expression cloning approach. A cosmid library containing random DNA fragments from H. influenzae strain Rd was constructed in Escherichia coli.

The kinase gene was identified by activity assays, sub-cloning, and DNA sequencing. When the putative kinase gene was expressed inE. coli behind a T7 promoter, massive overproduction of kinase activity was achieved (∼8000-fold higher than in H. influenzae membranes). The catalytic properties and the product generated by the overexpressed kinase, assayed with Kdo-lipid IVA as the substrate, were the same as observed withH. influenzae membranes. Unexpectedly, the kinase gene was identical to a previously characterized open reading frame (orfZ), which had been shown to be important for establishing bacteremia in an infant rat model (Hood, D.

However, based solely on the genome sequence of H. influenzae Rd, no biochemical function had been assigned to the product of orfZ, which we now designate kdkA(“Kdo kinase A”).

Many strains are further glycosylated with a distal repeating oligosaccharide, known as the O-antigen (not shown) (6Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C.

Recent studies have established an important role for proper core biosynthesis in the virulence ofH. influenzae. Hood et al. (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R.

The virulence of the mutant strains was then tested by their ability to cause bacteremia in an infant rat model (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R. Venter J.C. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A correlation was found between the extent of core glycosylation and virulence (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R. Venter J.C. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For instance, mutants lacking heptose, which have the minimal LPS structure capable of supporting growth (Fig. 1), did not cause significant bacteremia (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H.

The first step of core biosynthesis in all Gram-negative bacteria is the addition of Kdo to the 6-OH of the precursor, lipid IVA(Fig. 1) (6Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar, 10Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is an unusual bi-functional enzyme (Fig. 1) that catalyzes the sequential addition of two Kdo residues in distinct glycosidic linkages to lipid IVA (23Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most other Gram-negative bacteria similarly contain at least two Kdo residues in their inner core (24Rietschel E.T. Brade L. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 3-41Google Scholar). In H. influenzae, however, only a single Kdo is present (25Zamze S.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Moxon E.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2091-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the same site at which the second Kdo residue is attached in E. coli (Fig. 1). By using a non-typeable strain of H. influenzae, we previously demonstrated that the H. influenzae Kdo transferase is mono-functional (28White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

In addition, we provided the first evidence for the presence of a Kdo kinase unique to extracts of H. influenzae (28White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

We now report the expression cloning and biochemical characterization of the Kdo kinase structural gene of H. influenzae. A cosmid library containing DNA fragments of the H. influenzae strain used for the genome project (Rd) (11Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J.

Interestingly, the gene encoding the kinase had previously been described as a possible open reading frame of unknown function, termedorfZ (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A.

Although OrfZ had been shown to be essential for virulence, no biochemical function could be assigned to the protein based solely upon its sequence and the apparently normal electrophoretic properties of the LPS isolated fromorfZ mutants (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R. Venter J.C. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In light of our discovery thatorfZ encodes the Kdo kinase, the genetic and pathogenic studies by Hood et al. (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R.

Given the identification of the biochemical function of orfZ, we suggest that the gene now be designatedkdkA (for “Kdo kinase A”) (Fig. 1).

The Kdo[4′-32P]lipid IVA was synthesized by a slight modification of the published method (28White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16555-16563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, [4′-32P]lipid IVA was prepared as usual (38Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11139-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but at the end of the reaction, the volume was adjusted to 180 μl with water. The solution was then converted to a two-phase Bligh/Dyer system, consisting of CHCl3/methanol/H2O (2:2:1.8, v/v) (41Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar, 42Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by the addition of 200 μl of both CHCl3 and methanol. The tube was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 20,800 ×g for 5 min at room temperature to separate the phases. The chloroform-rich lower phase was removed and transferred to a fresh tube. The upper phase was then washed twice with pre-equilibrated acidic lower phase, i.e. a lower phase generated by mixing chloroform/methanol/0.1 m HCl (2:2:1.8, v/v). The resulting lower phases were pooled with the initial lower phase and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The reaction components for the mono-functional Kdo transferase reaction (28White K.A.

Following the Kdo transferase reaction, the Kdo[4′-32P]lipid IVA was isolated by preparative thin layer chromatography as described (28White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16555-16563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All lipids were stored as aqueous dispersions at −20 °C and were dispersed again after thawing by sonic irradiation in a bath for 30–60 s prior to use. Recombinant E. coliCMP-Kdo synthetase (43Goldman R.C. Bolling T.J. Kohlbrenner W.E. Kim Y. Fox J.L. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Mini-Prep purification system (Qiagen). Restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs), T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. DNA sequencing was performed at the Duke University Medical Center shared DNA sequencing facility. Kdo transfer from the donor, CMP-Kdo, to the acceptor, [4′-32P]lipid IVA, was assayed as described previously (28White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16555-16563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (typically 10–20 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm Kdo, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μm[4′-32P]lipid IVA (3000–6000 cpm/nmol), 5 mm CTP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 milliunits of partially purified, recombinant CMP-Kdo synthase. Assays (at 30 °C) were initiated by the addition of enzyme, usuallyH. influenzae membrane preparations, as indicated. The reactions were terminated by spotting 5-μl portions onto a thin layer plate. The plate was dried under a cool air stream and developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v). The solvent was evaporated with a hot air stream, and the plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 12–16 h. The conversion of32P-labeled substrate to product was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software. The Kdo kinase was assayed using the acceptor Kdo[4′-32P]lipid IVA, as described previously (28White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16555-16563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conditions were very similar to those used for the Kdo transferase. Briefly, reaction mixtures (10–20 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 100 μmKdo[4′-32P]lipid IVA (3000–6000 cpm/nmol). The reactions were initiated with enzyme and incubated for designated times at 30 °C. The assays were terminated, and the substrate and product were resolved by thin layer chromatography, as described above for the Kdo transferase. When membranes from pKdkA/BLR(DE3)/pLysS were used in the assays, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was included in the reaction mixture.

We have now studied the subcellular localization of S100A6 using a new, specific monoclonal antibody.

Upon cell division, however, S100A6 was found exclusively in the cytoplasm. Cell fractionation studies showed that S100A6 was present in the microsomal fraction in the presence of Ca2+ and was released from this fraction by the addition of EGTA/EDTA but not by Triton X-100. The data demonstrate that S100A6 is localized both at the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope in vivo and suggest a Ca2+-dependent interaction with annexins or other components of the nuclear envelope.

HEPES-buffered saline Because calcium plays a crucial role in the regulation of several nuclear functions (1Gilchrist J.S. Czubryt M.P. Pierce G.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Carafoli E. Nicotera P. Santella L. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a strong interest exists in identifying Ca2+-binding proteins involved in the perception and transduction of signals involved in cell cycle control and cell death. The S100 family comprises 16 closely related members, 13 of which form a gene cluster in the epidermal differentiation complex of chromosome 1 in humans (3Volz A. Korge B.P. Compton J.G. Ziegler A. Steinert P.M. Mischke D. Genomics. 1993; 18: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). S100 proteins consist of two Ca2+-binding EF-hands and short individual N and C termini. The first EF-hand is conserved among the S100 family and the second EF-hand follows the canonical consensus. Almost all S100 proteins form stable homo- or heterodimers and several members have been shown to bind Zn2+ in addition to Ca2+ in vitro(4Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A subclass of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins forming the large S100 protein family has attracted substantial interest in the last decade due to their tissue- and cell type-specific expression patterns and their involvement in several diseases (5Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The S100 gene products play a role in multiple proliferation- and differentiation-related events and appear to be involved in autoimmune diseases and cancer (6Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). S100B is predominantly expressed in brain and has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative symptoms commonly associated with Down Syndrome (7Marks A. Allore R. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). S100A7 is overexpressed in psoriatic lesions (8Watson P.H. Leygue E.R. Murphy L.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the S100A8/A9 (MRP8/MRP14) heterodimer plays a role in inflammation and cystic fibrosis (9Kerkhoff C. Klempt M. Sorg C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (for review see Ref. 6Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above, S100A2 is down-regulated in breast cancer and the promotor is activated upon the interaction with wild-type p53 (10Tan M. Heizmann C.W. Guan K. Schafer B.W. Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, S100A2 was suggested to be a tumor suppressor-related gene. S100A6 (calcyclin) was first identified by molecular cloning of the growth factor-inducible gene 2A9 (11Calabretta B. Kaczmarek L. Mars W. Ochoa D. Gibson C.W. Hirschhorn R.R. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4463-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Its expression is elevated in response to growth factor-stimulated proliferation of quiescent fibroblasts, indicating a role in cell cycle progression (12Calabretta B. Battini R. Kaczmarek L. de Riel J.K. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12628-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies showed that this elevation in expression is mediated by a growth factor-responsive element in the promotor region of S100A6 (13Ghezzo F. Valpreda S. De Riel J.K. Baserga R. DNA. 1989; 8: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and peaks in the transition from G0- to S-phase in serum-stimulated quiescent smooth muscle cells (14Kindy M.S. Brown K.E. Sonenshein G.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). S100A6 was also found to be overexpressed in several tumors like acute myeloid leukemia (11Calabretta B. Kaczmarek L. Mars W. Ochoa D. Gibson C.W. Hirschhorn R.R. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4463-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma (15Tonini G.P. Fabretti G. Kuznicki J. Massimo L. Scaruffi P. Brisigotti M. Mazzocco K. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31A: 499-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and also in a variety of melanoma cell lines (16Weterman M.A. Stoopen G.M. van Muijen G.N. Kuznicki J. Ruiter D.J. Bloemers H.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1291-1296PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of S100A6 correlates with the metastatic behavior in nude mice and an up-regulated expression has also been observed in wound healing after corneal injury (17Bazan H.E. Allan G. Bazan N.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). S100A6 was additionally identified and purified from murine Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (18Kuznicki J. Filipek A. Hunziker P.E. Huber S. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Gou et al. (19Guo X.J. Chambers A.F. Parfett C.L. Waterhouse P. Murphy L.C. Reid R.E. Craig A.M. Edwards D.R. Denhardt D.T. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 333-338PubMed Google Scholar) described a correlation between the expression of S100A6 and the metastatic behavior of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In benign tissues, S100A6 is expressed predominantly in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (20Kuznicki J. Kordowska J. Puzianowska M. Wozniewicz B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) but is also present in neuronal and smooth muscle cells. To elucidate thein vivo function(s) of S100A6 recent efforts focused on the identification of cellular binding partners and the metal-binding characteristics (21Kordowska J. Stafford W.F. Wang C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies revealed Ca2+-dependent interactions with actin binding proteins like caldesmon (22Mani R.S. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6658-6663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), tropomyosin (23Golitsina N.L. Kordowska J. Wang C.L. Lehrer S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and calponin (24Wills F.L. McCubbin W.D. Gimona M. Strasser P. Kay C.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). More recently a novel protein of yet unknown function, termed p30 or CaCYBP, has been reported to bind to S100A6 in vitro (25Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, members of the annexin family were shown to interact with S100A6 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Thus, affinity chromatography using immobilized calcyclin revealed an interaction with annexin II and annexin VI (26Zeng F.Y. Gerke V. Gabius H.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The interaction of S100A6 with annexin XI has been studied in more detail, and the binding sites on both molecules have been mapped (27Sudo T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6351-6357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Notably, annexin XI has been reported to target to the nucleus and to display a distinct localization during mitosis (28Mizutani A. Usuda N. Tokumitsu H. Minami H. Yasui K. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13498-13504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of S100A6 has been also studied in transformed (15Tonini G.P. Fabretti G. Kuznicki J. Massimo L.

Cell Res. 1992; 200: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Yamashita N. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Kosaka T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and in cultured smooth muscle cells (31Mandinova A. Atar D. Schafer B.W. Spiess M. Aebi U. Heizmann C.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody. In this study we have reinvestigated the Ca2+-dependent subcellular localization of S100A6 using a novel highly specific monoclonal antibody and show that the protein localizes to the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope of smooth and nonmuscle cells. All chemicals were from Merck with the exception of HEPES and Triton X-100 (Sigma), fetal bovine serum (HyClone), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and minimal essential medium (Life Technologies). Monoclonal anti-porcine calcyclin (clone CACY-100) was from Sigma. Fresh porcine stomach smooth muscle tissue was excised in 2 × 2 × 30 mm strips and submerged in buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin-pepstatin (Roche), and 2 m sucrose as cryoprotectant at 4 °C overnight. Muscle strips were then mounted onto aluminum cryopins (Reichert) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections of 5–8 μm were cut using a Reichert-Jung FC4E cryo-ultramicrotome. Sections were then transferred to silanized coverslips, dried for 1 h at room temperature and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Porcine testis (ST) and human CaKi-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on ethanol/HCl-washed 15-mm glass coverslips. Cells on coverslips were rinsed in HBS1 (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2), fixed for 20 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in HBS and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in HBS for 5 min. All steps were carried out in the presence of either 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm ZnCl2, or 5 mm EGTA. After blocking with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 5% donor horse serum in HBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-S100A6 antibody (clone CACY-100), followed by incubation with secondary Cy-3-labeled (Sigma) or biotinylated (Dako) goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and Cy-2 streptavidin (Fluorolink). Coverslips were washed and mounted in Gelvatol containing 2.5 mg/ml n-propylgallate. All steps were carried out in the presence of either 2 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Fluorescent images were recorded on a Zeiss Axiophot using a 63× (nominal aperture 1.4) oil immersion lens and Kodak P3200 Tmax film. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 model using a Zeiss 63× (nominal aperture 1.2) C-apochromat water immersion lens. Cells (porcine ST and human CaKi-2) were grown to 90% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture Petri dishes (Falcon), washed in HBS and harvested in 2 ml of HBS with a tissue culture scraper. For harvesting the cells and all following steps, the HBS contained either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, with or without 0.5% Triton X-100. The suspension was homogenized with a glass-glass tissue grinder and fractionated by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g (Sorvall, RC M150 GX) at 4 °C. The pellet was washed by resuspension in HBS and ultracentrifugation was repeated. All samples were precipitated with methanol/chloroform following the method of Wessel and Flugge (32Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and an equivalent of 2 cm2 of cells was applied to the gel. Analytical SDS gel electrophoresis on 10–26% gradient polyacrylamide mini-slab gels and Western blotting onto nitrocellulose (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described elsewere (33Gimona M. Herzog M. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Transferred proteins reactive with the monoclonal anti-S100A6 antibody were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclei of cultured pig ST cells were isolated as described by Kihlmark and Hallberg (34Kihlmark M. Hallberg E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1988: 152-158Google Scholar), resuspended in HBS containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin-leupeptin, and 0.05% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 5 min, and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in HBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with the monoclonal anti-S100A6 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the nuclei 3 times in HBS they were incubated with a 10-nm gold-labeled secondary antibody (BioCell) for 45 min at room temperature, washed 3 times and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde , 2.5% glutaraldehyde in HBS for 15 min. The blocks were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Araldite (TAAB). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed in a Zeiss EM 10A electron microscope. A monoclonal antibody specific for S100A6 was generated as described earlier (35Gimona M. Lando Z. Dolginov Y. Vandekerckhove J. Kobayashi R. Sobieszek A. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar) using porcine smooth muscle S100 proteins as the antigen. Clone CACY-100 specifically recognizes S100A6 but not S100A2 or S100b on Western blots of whole cell and tissue extracts (Fig.1). We first determined the subcellular localization of S100A6 in unfixed, frozen sections of porcine stomach smooth muscle. In the presence of Ca2+, S100A6 displayed a dual localization, on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus. Longitudinal sections revealed an association along thin thread-like structures (Fig.2 A), which correlated with the punctate pattern around the cell periphery seen in cross sections (Fig.2 B). Labeling in the nucleus was confirmed by counterstaining for nucleic acids and higher resolution images revealed a ring-like structure, indicating that S100A6 is localized at the nuclear envelope, but not inside the nucleus (Fig. 2 C). Incubation of unfixed tissue sections with buffer containing chelating agents resulted in the complete loss of the fluorescent signal (data not shown). These data suggested that S100A6 colocalizes with two membranous cellular compartments, namely the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope of smooth muscle cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To support the results obtained with unfixed tissue sections, we next studied the distribution of S100A6 in cultured porcine ST cells fixed and labeled both in the presence or absence of divalent cations. In the presence of Ca2+, staining of the plasma membrane was observed in cells extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig.3 A). When the Triton X-100 concentration was increased to 0.3%, localization at the plasma membrane was lost and a weak cytoplasmic distribution in addition to a strong concentration in the nucleus was observed. Notably, in the presence of Zn2+, S100A6 localization was indistinguishable from that seen in cells stained in the absence of both Ca2+and EGTA/EDTA (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of chelating agents like EGTA and EDTA S100A6 localization was detected only in the nucleus (Fig. 3 C). Identical results were obtained in the human cell line CaKi-2 indicating that the observed localization pattern reflects the position of endogenous S100A6 (not shown), and in agreement with these data Brink et al. (29Brinck U. Gabius H.J. Zeng F.Y. Gerke V. Lazarou D. Zografakis C. Tsambaos D. Berger H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1995; 10: 181-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Mandinova et al.(31Mandinova A. Atar D. Schafer B.W. Spiess M. Aebi U. Heizmann C.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) likewise reported partial nuclear localization of S100A6 in human cells and tissues. In mitotic cells, S100A6 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm but is absent from regions of condensed chromatin (Fig.3 B, arrowheads). Staining of mitotic and interphase cells using an anti-lamin A antibody resulted in patterns similar to those obtained with the S100A6 antibody (not shown). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to further confirm the dual localization of S100A6 at the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. Cells were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of Ca2+ and examined by confocal microscopy in thex-z axis. As seen in Fig.4, A and B, the antibody CACY-100 revealed the presence of S100A6 at the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm. We interpret the lack of fluorescent signal at the nuclear envelope as an indication for the inaccessibility of the antibody epitope under these gentle extraction procedures. This conclusion was supported by the results of sections and three-dimensional reconstructions of confocal images from cells extracted in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100, which showed a specific association of S100A6 with the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4,C and D). In contrast to the results obtained with unfixed tissue sections, S100A6 remained associated with the nuclear envelope of fixed cultured cells even in the presence of EGTA/EDTA. Together with the observed requirement for increased Triton X-100 concentrations, these data strongly suggest that S100A6 localizes at the inner face of the nuclear envelope and that this binding is mediated via a binding partner, which is sensitive to formaldehyde fixation. We therefore used immunogold electron microscopy on isolated nuclei to further test the hypothesis that S100A6 colocalized with inner structures of the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope consists of three compartments, the outer nuclear membrane, the inner membrane, and the lamina. As expected, gold particles were detected exclusively in the space between the outer and the inner nuclear membrane, and in the vicinity of the nuclear lamina (Fig. 5). Both fluorescence and electron microscopy suggested a membrane association of S100A6 requiring the presence Ca2+. To further support this conclusion, we carried out cell fractionations. As seen in Fig. 6, S100A6 was detected in the microsomal fraction of cultured porcine ST cells by Western blotting, and this association was strictly Ca2+-dependent. S100A6 was released from the pellet upon addition of EGTA/EDTA. In contrast, the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 to the extraction buffer failed to solubilize S100A6. However, significant amounts of S100A6 were also found in the soluble fraction, in agreement with the results obtained in the microscopic studies. These data also support previous studies by Lesniak and Filipek (36Lesniak W. Filipek A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that demonstrated the Ca2+-dependent interaction of S100A6 with microsomal membranes from murine Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Taken together, our data suggest that S100A6 is located in the cytoplasm and is targeted to two membranous compartments, namely the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope upon the increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+, mediated by yet unidentified signals. The variable extractability of S100A6 associated with the plasma membraneversus the nuclear envelope points to an interaction of S100A6 with two different targets. Interaction with the plasma membrane was strongly dependent on the presence of Ca2+ but was lost upon the addition of Triton X-100 despite fixation with paraformaldehyde. The interaction with the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction, i.e. the nuclear envelope, likewise depended on the presence of Ca2+, as shown in the cell fractionation experiments and in unfixed tissue sections, but S100A6 remained firmly attached to its putative target after fixation even in the presence of EGTA. In contrast, cytoplasmic S100A6 was extracted in the presence and absence of Ca2+ despite prior fixation with formaldehyde. Interestingly, several S100 proteins have been shown recently to interact directly with intermediate filament proteins (37Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of S100A6 with the intermediate filaments of the nuclear lamina is plausible. The potential binding partners for S100A6 that have thus far been identified can be divided into two groups, one comprising several actin-binding proteins, and the second embracing members of the annexin family. In this study we failed to detect any colocalization of S100A6 with actin-rich structures, although an interaction with components of the actin cytoskeleton cannot be ruled out completely. Annexin II and annexin VI were described to interact with S100A6 and have been shown to colocalize with the plasma membrane (38Barwise J.L. Walker J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Barwise and Walker (38Barwise J.L. Walker J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that annexin II relocates to granular structures at the plasma membrane, whereas annexin VI adopts a more homogeneous distribution at the plasma membrane in cells treated with the calcium ionophore A23187. More importantly, this group also claimed that the intranuclear portion of annexins IV and V translocates to the nuclear membrane under the same conditions. Likewise, annexin XI displays partial nuclear localization and is one of the potential targets of S100A6. The binding sites of both molecules have been mapped within residues 4–7 in S100A6 (39Watanabe M. Ando Y. Tokumitsu H. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and residues 52–59 in annexin XI (27Sudo T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6351-6357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), respectively. Furthermore annexin XI has been reported to alter its localization during mitosis, forming an arc-like structure around the mitotic spindle (28Mizutani A. Usuda N. Tokumitsu H. Minami H. Yasui K. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13498-13504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that S100A6 is localized at multiple discrete sites in the cell including the inner face of the nuclear envelope and that the protein undergoes specific translocations during mitosis. The colocalization of S100A6 with these membranous compartments is strictly dependent on the presence of Ca2+and is likely to correspond to the sites of functionally active S100A6. From these data we therefore suggest an interaction of S100A6 in vivo with members of the annexin family, and in particular with nuclear annexin XI. Moreover, we have shown that refined methods are required to reveal the localization of S100A6 at multiple distinct compartments in the cell. Our further efforts are directed toward characterizing the interaction between S100A6 and annexin XI in vitro and in vivo. We are grateful to Dr. K. I.

Although closely related to the well known and widely distributed methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) reaction (1Rétey J. Dolphin D. B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 357-379Google Scholar) (Fig.1), MCM does not catalyze the rearrangement of isobutyryl-CoA to n-butyryl-CoA (2Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J.

ICM has been detected in several polyketide antibiotic-producing streptomycetes, where it appears to play a key role in valine and fatty acid catabolism as well as in the production of fatty acid-CoA thioester building blocks for polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis (4Reynolds K.A. O'Hagan D. Gani D. Robinson J.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1988; : 3195-3207Crossref Google Scholar). In earlier work (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6508-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), purification of ICM from the monensin-producing microorganism Streptomyces cinnamonensis gave a protein (IcmA) of ∼65 kDa whose gene was subsequently cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli. However, recombinant IcmA alone showed no ICM activity. Using IcmA with a His6 tag attached to its N terminus, a second subunit of ICM with an apparent mass of ≈17 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (denoted IcmB) was isolated by affinity chromatography from S. cinnamonensis, which gave ICM activity when combined with IcmA and coenzyme B12 (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A. Vrijbloed J.W. Hess D. Hunziker P. Robinson J.A. J. Biol.

In this work, we describe for the first time the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding IcmB and the first characterization of ICM reconstituted from small and large subunits produced separately in E. coli.The MCMs from S. cinnamonensis (2Birch A.

J. 1989; 260: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) are heterodimers with subunits of ≈79 kDa (MutB) and ≈65 kDa (MutA). Several crystal structures of P. shermanii MCM were reported recently (7Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7999-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which revealed a single coenzyme B12 molecule bound to the 728-residue MutB protein, sandwiched between a (β/α)8-triosephosphate isomerase barrel and a C-terminal, flavodoxin-like, cobalamin-binding domain. IcmA fromS. cinnamonensis, however, comprises only 566 residues (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A. Vrijbloed J.W. Hess D. Hunziker P. Robinson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6508-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), corresponding to a loss of the entire ≈160-residue C-terminal cobalamin-binding domain from MutB. The sequence of the (β/α)8-barrel in MutB comprising residues A1–A400 is highly conserved in IcmA. Residues A401–A559 in MutB correspond to a largely helical linker, which connects the (β/α)8-barrel with the cobalamin-binding domain (residues A560–A728). The linker residues A401–A559 correspond in a sequence alignment approximately with residues 393–560 in IcmA, although the sequence identity in this region is only ≈18%. But after just 6 more residues, IcmA terminates.The structure determination of the cobalamin-binding domain of MetH, a member of the methyltransferase family, revealed for the first time a protein-bound form of methylcobalamin, a vitamin B12derivative (10Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The cobalamin was shown bound to the protein with a histidine residue providing an axial imidazole ligand to cobalt, replacing the DMB group appended to the corrin ring. This key histidine residue is found in the motif DXHXXG, which is conserved in some (but not all) of the coenzyme B12-dependent mutases (11Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MCM from P. shermanii revealed not only an active site, inaccessible to solvent, embedded along the axis of the (β/α)8-barrel in MutB (7Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A.

Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but also the coordination of cobalt in coenzyme B12 by the histidine in the conserved DXHXXG motif within the C-terminal cobalamin-binding domain. In the case of ICM, however, the large subunit (IcmA) contains no contiguous cobalamin-binding domain, but instead requires a separate small subunit (IcmB) to bind coenzyme B12 and to afford active mutase (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A. Vrijbloed J.W. Hess D. Hunziker P. Robinson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6508-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggested that IcmB has taken on the role of a separate cobalamin-binding domain in ICM, a conclusion that is confirmed here by the high sequence similarity between IcmB and the cobalamin-binding domains of MutB, methyleneglutarate mutase, and MetH as well as the small subunit (MutS) of glutamate mutase.DISCUSSIONicmA and icmB are not adjacent in the chromosome of S. cinnamonensis. In contrast, mutAand mutB from this organism share overlapping start and stop codons (2Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a device that may lead to transcriptional coupling and hence to the production of stoichiometric amounts of the two proteins. It is presently unclear how far apart icmA andicmB are in the S. cinnamonensis genome, although the regions extending over 8 kb upstream and 11 kb downstream oficmA, isolated in an earlier work (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A. Vrijbloed J.W. Hess D. Hunziker P. Robinson J.A. J. Biol.

DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), whose genomes have now been completely sequenced, each contain two ORFs of similar size and sequence to icmAand icmB, although they were reported as MCM-like sequences. mcmA1 and mcmA2 from A. fulgidus encode proteins of 548 and 144 residues and are located only 2.5 kb apart, whereas the large and small ICM-like genes inP. horikoshii encode proteins of 563 and 147 residues, but are located ∼230 kb apart. It is interesting to speculate that, in both organisms, these MCM-like proteins might be components of ICM. However, this remains to be proven. The distinguishing features of ICM include an MCM-like large subunit of only ∼65 kDa, with a separate small subunit of ∼14 kDa providing the cobalamin-binding domain. An isolated report has appeared of a propionate-induced MCM fromEuglena gracilis that contains two mutases with apparent molecular masses of 72,000 and 17,000 Da (23Watanabe F. Abe K. Tamura Y. Nakano Y. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2631-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Neither protein, however, has yet been purified to homogeneity.Although in MCM a single polypeptide chain comprises both the coenzyme B12- and substrate-binding domains, the glutamate mutase from clostridia consists of two subunits, MutE (which forms a tightly associated homodimer) and MutS (which is the coenzyme B12-binding domain). The active glutamate mutase holoenzyme appears to be an α2β2-heterotetramer that binds up to two molecules of coenzyme B12, as deduced here for ICM.The analysis of the kinetics for ICM is complicated by the fact that IcmA and IcmB interact only weakly until coenzyme B12 is added, and then IcmA binds to IcmB in a cooperative manner. This also complicates any attempts to measure the stoichiometry of bound coenzyme B12. As a result, the apparent kinetic parameters depend on the relative concentrations of the two subunits, as observed earlier in studies of glutamate mutase (24Holloway D.E. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20425-20430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chen H.P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, the substrateK m values with ICM were determined using equimolar ratios of IcmA and IcmB, and the V max was determined relative to the IcmA concentration at saturating concentrations of IcmB.The assay used for the determination of kinetic constants is a discontinuous gas chromatography assay, which is not well suited for accurate initial velocity measurements. Notwithstanding this, in the determination of K m values, a nonlinear least-squares regression fitting of the initial velocities to a velocity equation for a bireactant system converged for both substrates. Double-reciprocal plots gave sets of lines that intersected on or close to the x axis (Fig. 7, A andB). The results are consistent with either a random or ordered sequential mechanism, involving the reversible formation of a ternary complex between enzyme, substrate, and coenzyme B12. The k cat value of 39 ± 3 s−1 determined for ICM (Fig. 7 C) assumes one active site per IcmA monomer subunit.The apparent K m values for n-butyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA are in the same range as the K m values reported elsewhere for methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA with MCM (26Kellermeyer R.W. Allen S.H.G. Stjernholm R. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but are at least an order of magnitude lower than the apparent K m for glutamate with glutamate mutase, measured under comparable conditions (1:1 molar ratio of MutE to MutS) (Table II). It is interesting to note that MCM and ICM have similar substrate structures and most likely similar substrate-binding sites in their large subunits (see below), reflecting the similar K m values for their substrates. On the other hand, ICM and glutamate mutase share a similar mode of cobalamin binding involving two independent subunits and have similar K m values for coenzyme B12. In comparison, a significantly lower K m is found for coenzyme B12 with MCM (Table II).Early insights into the structures of cobalamin-dependent enzymes came from a primary sequence comparison between the C-terminal domains (now also known as α/β-domains) of MetH and MCM (from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms) with MutS of bacterial glutamate mutase (11Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This revealed a region of highly conserved sequence comprising the motifD X H XX G (where Xis any amino acid), which was invariant in all the proteins examined. After the determination of the crystal structure of the cobalamin-binding fragment of MetH, Drennen et al. (10Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) were able to define a sequence fingerprint for cobalamin binding that includedD757 X H XX G …S804 X L …G833G. This fingerprint is also apparent in IcmB (Fig. 8).Figure 8Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of a subset of cobalamin-dependent enzymes with homologies to the α/β-domain of IcmB. The sequences shown are as follows: residues 1–136 of IcmB from S. cinnamonensis (IcmB-Sc), residues 572–727 of MCM MutB from P. shermanii (MutB-Ps), residues 1–137 of glutamate mutase MutS from Clostridium tetanomorphum (MutS-Ct), residues 720–902 of MetH fromE. coli (MetH-Ec), and residues 448–614 of methyleneglutarate mutase from Clostridium barkeri(MGM-Cb).

The protein brings the cobalamin cofactor to a base-off/His-on form and places the DMB group in a central hydrophobic cleft in the cobalamin-binding domain. The histidine participates in a hydrogen-bonding network comprising 3 residues: His759–Asp757–Ser810 in MetH and His610–Asp608–Lys604 in MCM. In the case of IcmB, the corresponding residues appear to be well conserved and are represented by His20–Asp18–Lys14, which most likely are also involved in binding coenzyme B12. The other residues in the fingerprint sequence appear to line the hydrophobic cleft, to interact with the displaced DMB group, and thereby to anchor the cobalamin molecule to the protein. These comparisons therefore suggest that the residues contacting the lower face of the corrin ring are conserved in IcmB and these other cobalamin-binding proteins.The structural conservation of the cobalamin-binding domain is readily apparent from the available crystal structures of MetH and MCM as well as the NMR solution structure of MutS (27Tollinger M. Konrat R. Hilbert B.H. Marsh E.N.G. Krautler B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of the cobalamin-binding domains in MCM and MetH are essentially superimposable (7Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The core structure consists of a five-stranded twisted parallel β-sheet surrounded by five α-helixes. The NMR solution structure of the coenzyme B12-free form of MutS also revealed a similar tertiary structure (27Tollinger M. Konrat R. Hilbert B.H. Marsh E.N.G. Krautler B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), except for the first α-helix, which in solution appeared slightly disordered. The displacement of the DMB group of coenzyme B12 upon binding to the cobalamin-binding domain appears to be a common feature of several (but not all) coenzyme B12-dependent mutases.As shown in earlier work (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K.

This suggests that the triosephosphate isomerase barrel and much of the acyl-CoA-binding site identified in the crystal structure of MutB are also conserved in IcmA. The triosephosphate isomerase barrel uses a hole through its center to bind substrate, but also appears to open in the absence of ligand (8Mancia F. Evans P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Many of the residues that interact with CoA along the hole seem to be highly conserved in a sequence comparison with IcmA (Fig.9). One residue, TyrA89 in MutB, is conserved in all MCM sequences and is located near the bottom of the substrate-binding hole near to the interface with coenzyme B12. A Y89F mutant of MCM was prepared recently, and its structure was determined by crystallography (28Thoma N.H. Meier T.W. Evans P.R. Leadlay P.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14386-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the mutant enzyme structure was essentially superimposable on the wild-type structure and the K m for succinyl-CoA was not significantly affected, the k cat of the mutant was 580-fold lower than that of the wild type. Hence, it was suggested that TyrA89 plays a key role in the MCM reaction, although not as a site for a protein-based radical. In the sequence comparison with IcmA (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A. Vrijbloed J.W. Hess D. Hunziker P. Robinson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6508-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), this TyrA89 residue corresponds to Phe80, so the hydrogen-bonding ability of a Tyr-OH is not needed at this site in ICM. The k cat values for ICM and wild-type MCM are very similar (Table II).Figure 9Schematic diagram showing the relative location of residues in MCM lining the substrate-binding site, together with the substrate methylmalonyl-CoA (taken from Refs. 7 and 9). The residues are denoted by type, chain (A-chain = MutB and B-chain = MutA), and number. The corresponding residues in a sequence alignment (5) with IcmA are shown in each case inparentheses and in italics. Notable is the exchange of ArgA207 in MCM for Gln198 in IcmA (see “Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Very recently, a crystal structure of MCM with bound substrate revealed an interaction between ArgA207 and the carboxyl group of methylmalonyl-CoA (9Mancia F. Smith G.A. Evans P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7999-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As far as the different substrate specificities of MCM and ICM are concerned, it is intriguing to note that this ArgA207 residue is replaced in IcmA by a glutamine, whereas many other residues around the active site are highly conserved between MutB and IcmA (Fig. 9). Presently, it seems reasonable to assume that the catalytic mechanisms of ICM and MCM will be largely similar or identical. The coenzyme B12-dependent isobutyryl-CoA mutase (ICM1; butanoyl-CoA:2-methylpropanoyl-CoA mutase, EC 5.4.99.13) catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of isobutyryl-CoA to n-butyryl-CoA. Although closely related to the well known and widely distributed methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) reaction (1Rétey J. Dolphin D. B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 357-379Google Scholar) (Fig.1), MCM does not catalyze the rearrangement of isobutyryl-CoA to n-butyryl-CoA (2Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J.

Engl. 1988; 27: 1089-1090Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ICM has been detected in several polyketide antibiotic-producing streptomycetes, where it appears to play a key role in valine and fatty acid catabolism as well as in the production of fatty acid-CoA thioester building blocks for polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis (4Reynolds K.A. O'Hagan D. Gani D. Robinson J.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1988; : 3195-3207Crossref Google Scholar). In earlier work (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6508-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), purification of ICM from the monensin-producing microorganism Streptomyces cinnamonensis gave a protein (IcmA) of ∼65 kDa whose gene was subsequently cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli. However, recombinant IcmA alone showed no ICM activity. Using IcmA with a His6 tag attached to its N terminus, a second subunit of ICM with an apparent mass of ≈17 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (denoted IcmB) was isolated by affinity chromatography from S. cinnamonensis, which gave ICM activity when combined with IcmA and coenzyme B12 (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K.

In this work, we describe for the first time the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding IcmB and the first characterization of ICM reconstituted from small and large subunits produced separately in E. coli. The MCMs from S. cinnamonensis (2Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) andPropionibacterium shermanii (6Marsh E.N. McKie N.

Several crystal structures of P. shermanii MCM were reported recently (7Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R.

IcmA fromS. cinnamonensis, however, comprises only 566 residues (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K. Ratnatilleke A. Philippon N. Birch A. Leiser A. Vrijbloed J.W. Hess D. Hunziker P. Robinson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6508-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), corresponding to a loss of the entire ≈160-residue C-terminal cobalamin-binding domain from MutB. The sequence of the (β/α)8-barrel in MutB comprising residues A1–A400 is highly conserved in IcmA. Residues A401–A559 in MutB correspond to a largely helical linker, which connects the (β/α)8-barrel with the cobalamin-binding domain (residues A560–A728). The linker residues A401–A559 correspond in a sequence alignment approximately with residues 393–560 in IcmA, although the sequence identity in this region is only ≈18%. But after just 6 more residues, IcmA terminates. The structure determination of the cobalamin-binding domain of MetH, a member of the methyltransferase family, revealed for the first time a protein-bound form of methylcobalamin, a vitamin B12derivative (10Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The cobalamin was shown bound to the protein with a histidine residue providing an axial imidazole ligand to cobalt, replacing the DMB group appended to the corrin ring. This key histidine residue is found in the motif DXHXXG, which is conserved in some (but not all) of the coenzyme B12-dependent mutases (11Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MCM from P. shermanii revealed not only an active site, inaccessible to solvent, embedded along the axis of the (β/α)8-barrel in MutB (7Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A.

In the case of ICM, however, the large subunit (IcmA) contains no contiguous cobalamin-binding domain, but instead requires a separate small subunit (IcmB) to bind coenzyme B12 and to afford active mutase (5Zerbe-Burkhardt K.

Atomic level investigations on antigen-antibody complex formation reveal that, although charged and polar side chains can be critical in binding, notably important contributions originate from hydrophobic side chains just as they do in other protein-protein complexes (1Wilson I.A.

A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Solution state studies of the binding of two different proteins to the same antibody, for example, have shown that, in certain cases, the free energy of binding may arise from the accumulation of many interactions of varying strength over the entire protein-protein interface (12Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the perception as propounded by crystal structural results that protein-protein recognition is mediated by only a few strong interactions may not be a general feature (13Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Complications also arise from the observation that a majority of direct contacts in the antigen-antibody complex may be energetically neutral (14Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Lin W. Teng C. Tsuchiya D. Li H. Ysern X. Braden B.C. Li Y. Smith-Gill S.J. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7981-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This highlights the need for a complete characterization of binding energetics of antigen-antibody interactions as a prelude to understanding the underlying structural basis of the molecular recognition process. The net balance between the energy versus distance functions of the aspecific (macroscopic) repulsion that usually prevails between antigen and antibody molecules in aqueous mediavis-à-vis the specific (microscopic) attraction between the epitope and paratope of the antigen and the antibody, respectively, determines their propensity for complex formation (15van Oss C.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1997; 10: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rearrangement of solvent water molecules accompanying macromolecular complexation events is believed to be largely responsible for the observed nonlinear thermodynamic phenomena (16Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Water molecules serve a variety of roles and, in different positions, significantly affect the energetics of biomolecular interactions (17Levitt M. Park B.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) that involved controlled alteration of water activity using the osmotic stress technique has laid the foundation for a direct address of different roles of water molecules in solution.

GCC:B10 mAb, generated against the human GCC receptor, binds specifically to the unique, conserved epitope HIPPENIFPLE (23Nandi A. Bhandari R. Visweswariah S.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The epitope contains two independent recognition motifs (mimotopes) for GCC:B10 mAb, one represented by HIPPEN and the other by ENIFPLE, an example of novel topological mimicry and a probable duplication of the cognate epitope in the native GCC receptor sequence (24Nandi A. Suguna K. Surolia A. Visweswariah S.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The thermodynamics of the GCC:B10 mAb-peptide binding reactions were considered in terms of the site binding constant (K b) and changes in the free energy (ΔG b0), the binding enthalpy (ΔH b0), and the binding entropy (ΔS b0). The binding reaction between the GCC:B10 mAb-binding site and the peptide ligand (L) is given by GCC:B10 mAb + L ⇌ GCC:B10 mAb·L, in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 ± 0.01 containing 150 mm sodium chloride (PBS), with or without the neutral osmolyte glycerol or ethylene glycol, constituting an “osmotic stress” effect (16Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). All reagents were of analytical or ultrapure grade from Sigma. Deionized Milli-Q water was used throughout. The peptide HIPPENIFPLE was a product of Peptidogenic Research and Co. (Livermore, CA), whereas the peptides HIPPEN and ENIFPLE were synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Shim-PAK Prep-ODS(H) preparative column and quantitated by amino acid analysis as described earlier (24Nandi A. Suguna K. Surolia A. Visweswariah S.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The purity and the mass of the peptides were ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The monoclonal antibody GCC:B10 was generated as described earlier (23Nandi A. Bhandari R. Visweswariah S.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concentration of GCC:B10 mAb was determined spectrophotometrically in a quartz cuvette of 1-cm path length at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of ε = 210,000 at pH 7.2 and expressed in terms of a dimer ofM r = 150,000 (25Corradin G. Juillerat M.A. Engers H.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2915-2919PubMed Google Scholar). GCC:B10 mAb solution was prepared in PBS, dialyzed overnight in a large volume of the same buffer, and centrifuged to remove any insoluble matter. The peptide solutions were prepared by weight in the dialysate to minimize differences between the protein buffer solution and the ligand buffer solution in the ITC measurements. For osmotic stress studies, the mAb solution was dialyzed extensively against glycerol and ethylene glycol solutions in the above buffer. Peptide solutions were then prepared with the final dialysate. Care was taken that the neutral solute osmolalities used were not significantly different from their ordinary molal concentrations (16Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 61st Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980: D229-D276Google Scholar). The titration calorimetric measurements were performed with a MicrocalTM Omega titration calorimeter (19Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Samples carefully scrutinized for precipitate after the titration revealed none either in the presence or absence of the osmolytes. The quantity c =K b·[GCC:B10 mAb]0, where [GCC:B10 mAb]0 is the initial macromolecular GCC:B10 mAb concentration and K b is the association constant, was in the range of 2 < c < 200 as required for ITC studies (19Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). This corresponds to a binding regime that is best suited for the most precise measurements of the binding stoichiometry,K b, and ΔH b0simultaneously in a single ITC experiment. The total concentration of GCC:B10 mAb used was from 0.02 to 0.04 mm, whereas the total concentration of peptide ligand taken was from 0.8 to 1.2 mm. The titration of ligand solution in this concentration range with the buffer solution alone gave negligible values for the heat of dilution both in the presence and absence of osmolytes at 293.2 K. Nonetheless, for every experiment, the heat of dilution of the ligand was measured and subtracted from the runs conducted with the mAb. The time duration between the injections was at least 3 min to allow the peak to return to the base line, and the number of additions of the peptide titrant was fixed such that the area below the peak was reduced by at least an order of magnitude or until antibody-binding sites were saturated >95%. All measurements were made at a constant stirrer speed of 395 rpm. Since GCC:B10 mAb contains two binding sites per molecule, an identical-site model utilizing a concentration of the protein dimer was the simplest binding model found to provide the best fit to the ITC data using the OriginTM program (19Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 27Yang C.P. Omega Data in Origin. Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA1990Google Scholar). Values for ΔS b0 were obtained from the basic equation of thermodynamics, ΔG b0 = ΔH b0 −TΔS b0, where ΔG b0 = −nRT ln K b, where n = number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, andR = 8.315 J mol−1 K−1. The results of a typical titration calorimetry measurement, which consisted of adding 15-μl aliquots of 0.8 mmHIPPENIPLE solution to 0.03 mm GCC:B10 mAb solution in PBS at 283.2 K, together with the nonlinear least-squares fit of the data are shown in Fig. 1. The results exhibit a monotonic decrease in the exothermic heat of binding with successive injections until saturation is achieved. As shown by the solid curve in Fig. 1 B, the incremental heats per mol of added ligand follows closely the molar ratio of the peptide ligand over GCC:B10 mAb. The results of a representative calorimetric titration of peptide HIPPENIFPLE solution into GCC:B10 mAb solution in the presence of 0.35 osmol·(kg H2O)−1 glycerol is shown in Fig. 2. The close fit of the data to the identical-site model shows that the ligand binds to each of the two binding sites of GCC:B10 mAb independently, both in the absence and presence of osmolytes. The thermodynamic parameters ΔG b0, ΔH b0, and ΔS b0 at 293.2 K determined from the titration calorimetry measurements are presented in Table I. The heat capacity change at constant pressure (ΔC p) is defined by the Kirchoff equation asdΔH b0/dT= ΔC p. The binding reaction is exothermic in the temperature range of 6.4 to 42 °C and is driven by dominant favorable enthalpic contributions (Table I). A plot of the change in enthalpy of binding of HIPPENIFPLE to GCC:B10 mAb as a function of temperature yields a ΔC p of −421 ± 27 cal mol−1 K−1 (Fig.3). The temperature dependence of entropy is shown in Fig. 4. The unfavorable negative value of ΔS b0 at 25 °C becomes a positive one below an inversion temperature of 20.5 °C, an unusual feature among protein-protein systems (28Hibbits K.A. Gill D.S. Willson R.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3584-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is almost no temperature dependence of the binding free energy (i.e.ΔΔG b0 ≅ 0) within the temperature range examined (Fig.5). This occurs because the contributions from the enthalpic and entropic components are reciprocal (Figs. 3 and4); hence, they balance each other out in such a fashion that the changes are relatively equal in magnitude, but opposing one another.Figure 2Calorimetric titration of HIPPENIFPLE peptide solution with GCC :B10 mAb solution under osmotic stress.

For each solute, binding free energies show a linear dependence on solute osmolal concentration, consistent with an exclusion of these solutes from the water surrounding the associating peptide and antibody surfaces. The positive sign of the slope defines the net release of water molecules by the GCC:B10 mAb-peptide complex during the process of binding. The magnitude of the effect of osmotic stress depends both on the solute osmolal concentration, which is equivalent to the bulk water chemical potential, and on the difference in the number of solute-excluding water molecules associated with the GCC:B10 mAb-peptide complex and the number associated with the free GCC:B10 mAb and peptide molecules. The slope of log K a versus lna w, where a w is the water activity, is 2.303 Δn w. This value, Δn w, gives the change in the number of solute-excluding water molecules coupled to the binding process (16Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem.

Since ln a w = −[solute]osmolal/55.56, where [solute]osmolal is the solute osmolal concentration and 55.56 is the moles of water in 1 kg, the slope of the lines shown in Fig. 6 is given by the following (Equation 1).dlogKa/d[solute]osmolal=-2.303Δnw/55.56Equation 1 Our results demonstrate that GCC:B10 mAb recognizes the peptides HIPPENIFPLE, HIPPEN, and ENIFPLE differentially, with a concomitant release of variable numbers of water molecules, viz. 15, 7, and 3, respectively, from the vicinity of the binding site (TablesII andIII). Control experiments in which aliquots of glycerol or ethylene glycol were injected into GCC:B10 mAb or peptide solutions did not result in any measurable heats of binding, ruling out the possibility of specific interactions between the stressing solute and GCC:B10 mAb or peptides, affirming the neutrality of the chosen osmolytes.Table IIThermodynamic quantities for binding of peptides to GCC:B10 mAb under osmotic stress at 20 °CPeptide[Glycerol]K b−ΔG b0−ΔH b0−TΔS b0−ΔS b0osmol (kg H2O)−1×10−3kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1HIPPENIFPLE0316.17.387.980.6020.35594.07.759.621.8860.73875.27.9712.574.60161.623371.18.7615.817.0524HIPPEN047.96.288.151.8760.3550.36.319.933.62120.7378.96.5711.725.15181.62131.06.8713.666.7923ENIFPLE04.64.9110.155.24180.355.24.9910.685.69190.736.85.1411.146.00201.627.85.2211.396.1721 Open table in a new tab Table IIIChanges in the number of solute-excluding water molecules released (−Δnw) upon binding of peptides to GCC:B10 mAb as a function of osmotic stressPeptideGlycerolEthylene glycolHIPPENIFPLE15.01 ± 0.7314.47 ± 0.64HIPPEN6.94 ± 0.967.23 ± 0.62ENIFPLE3.43 ± 0.803.01 ± 0.71Values represent the means ± S.D. from four independent measurements.

Formation of specific protein-protein complex is mediated by a few productive interactions that dominate the energetics of association, whereby the residues at the periphery make only a minor contribution to the binding energy (12Dall'Acqua W.

Among the relatively few protein-protein interaction systems for which thermodynamic data are available, there appears to be a group of complexes characterized by a large favorable enthalpy of binding that is partly offset by an unfavorable entropy, and most antigen-antibody interactions studied so far seem to belong to this group (28Hibbits K.A.

There is a contrasting group of protein complexes that are stabilized by a large positive entropy of binding, partly compensated by an unfavorable enthalpic term as found among protease-protease inhibitor complexes (36Baugh R.J.

For the interaction of the HIPPENIFPLE peptide with GCC:B10 mAb at physiological temperature (37 °C) as well as at room temperature (25 °C), the binding reaction is driven strongly by the enthalpic component,i.e. the binding enthalpy is negative and contributes favorably to the binding free energy (Table I). At these temperatures, the binding entropy is negative and hence contributes unfavorably to the binding energy. Interestingly, there is a strong temperature dependence of the binding entropy; and therefore, below the inversion temperature of 20.5 °C, it changes sign and becomes a positive one (Fig. 4). Hence, below 20.5 °C and up to 2.3 °C, the inversion temperature of the enthalpy of binding of the HIPPENIFPLE peptide to GCC:B10 mAb, there are favorable contributions to the free energy from both enthalpic and entropic components. Below 2.3 °C, the binding enthalpy changes sign (Fig. 3) and becomes positive, and the reaction is driven only by favorable entropic contributions. The lowest temperature at which we could study the binding of peptides to GCC:B10 mAb was 6.4 °C, below which the heats of reaction are too small to be measured accurately (19Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Despite the limited number of antibody residues that can be used for complexation, several modes of molecular recognition abound in protein-protein interactions (6Keitel T. Kramer A. Wessner H.

Primed continuous GlcN infusion (750 μmol/kg bolus; 30 μmol/kg·min) in conscious rats limited both maximal stimulation of muscle PI3K by acute insulin (I) (1 unit/kg) bolus (I + GlcN = 1.9-fold versussaline = 3.3-fold above fasting levels; p < 0.01) and chronic activation of PI3K following 3-h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic (18 milliunits/kg·min) clamp studies (I + GlcN = 1.2-fold versus saline = 2.6-fold stimulation;p < 0.01). To determine the time course of GlcN-induced defects in insulin-stimulated PI3K activity and peripheral insulin action, GlcN was administered for 30, 60, 90, or 120 min during 2-h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp studies. Activation of muscle PI3K by insulin was attenuated following only 30 min of GlcN infusion (GlcN 30 min = 1.5-fold versus saline = 2.5-fold stimulation; p < 0.05). In contrast, the first impairment in insulin-mediated glucose uptake (Rd) developed following 110 min of GlcN infusion (110 min = 39.9 ± 1.8versus 30 min = 42.8 ± 1.4 mg/kg·min,p < 0.05). However, the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate production and to activate glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle was preserved following up to 180 min of GlcN infusion. Thus, increased GlcN availability induced (a) profound and early inhibition of proximal insulin signaling at the level of PI3K and (b) delayed effects on insulin-mediated glucose uptake, yet (c) complete sparing of insulin-mediated glycogen synthase activation.

Marshall S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal end product of the pathway is UDP-GlcNAc (10Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which modifies intracellular proteins by glycosylation. Thus, even modest perturbations of the amount of flux through the hexosamine pathway could have diverse effects on protein functions. The amount of flux into the pathway, estimated by the accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc in muscle, is strongly correlated with the degree of impairment in peripheral insulin action (5Hawkins M. Angelov I.

The variety of observed effects of GlcN may be compatible either with a proximal defect in the insulin signaling pathway or defects at more than one downstream site of insulin action. The p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, (PI3K),1 is an important proximal effector in the insulin signaling cascade (12Ruderman N. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, prolonged stimulation of PI3K by insulin for 100 min has recently been demonstrated in human skeletal muscle (22Wojtaszewski J. Hansen B. Kiens B. Richter E.

Additionally, we examined the effect of GlcN on insulin-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), probably the most metabolically important end product of PI3K (23Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). We thereby defined the pattern and time sequence of GlcN-induced defects in proximal insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, particularly in the activation of the intracellular PI3K pool and on the peripheral metabolic actions of insulin. Eighty nine normal male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were housed in individual cages and subjected to a standard light (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.)-dark (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) cycle. The rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight), and indwelling catheters were inserted into the right internal jugular vein and the left carotid artery, as described previously (1Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The venous catheter was extended to the level of the right atrium, and the arterial catheter was advanced to the level of the aortic arch. All in vivo studies were performed 5–7 days following catheter placement in awake, fasted, and unstressed rats. At the end of all the in vivo studies, rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital 60 mg/kg body weight, intravenously); the abdomen was quickly opened, and the rectus abdominal muscle was freeze-clampedin situ with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen (1Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The time from injection of the anesthetic to freeze clamping of the muscle was approximately 30 s. All tissue samples were stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Initial pilot studies (n = 12) using bolus doses of insulin between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg administered 1, 2, or 5 min prior to sacrifice indicated that maximal stimulation of PI3K by insulin was observed 2 min following a 1 unit/kg bolus of insulin (data not shown). Thus, in the current protocol, fasting animals received intra-arterial boluses of insulin (1 unit/kg) followed 1.5 min later by the intravenous administration of pentobarbital. Freeze-clamped rectus muscle was then obtained 2 min following the insulin bolus. The effect of primed continuous infusions of GlcN (750 μmol/kg bolus, 30 μmol/kg·min) on the ability of insulin to maximally stimulate PI3K activity was assessed by infusion of GlcN (n = 6) versussaline (n = 8) for 2 h, prior to the administration of insulin. Plasma samples were obtained via the venous catheter both before the insulin bolus and at the time of sacrifice for measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, and GlcN concentrations. Euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic (18 milliunits/kg·min) clamp studies were performed for 3 h in combination with [3-3H]glucose infusion as described previously (1Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GlcN (750 μmol/kg bolus, 30 μmol/kg·min) was administered throughout the 3-h insulin clamp studies (n = 5), while time control euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were performed with infusion of saline for 3 h in additional age- and weight-matched control rats (n = 6). A primed continuous infusion of HPLC-purified [3H-3]glucose (NEN Life Science Products; 8 μCi bolus, 0.4 μCi/min) was infused throughout the studies in order to measure the rates of peripheral glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis. A variable infusion of 25% glucose solution was started at time 0 and adjusted every 10 min, maintaining basal plasma glucose concentrations (∼7 mm) throughout. Plasma samples were obtained for determination of [3H]glucose-specific activity at 10-min intervals throughout the insulin infusions. Samples for measurement of plasma insulin and GlcN concentrations were obtained at times 0, 60, 120, and 180 min. The total volume of blood sampled was ∼3.0 ml/study; to prevent volume depletion and anemia, a solution (1:1 v/v) of ∼3.0 ml of fresh blood (obtained by heart puncture from a littermate of the test animal) and heparinized saline (10 units/ml) was infused throughout. Primed continuous infusions of GlcN were administered for variable time intervals during the 2-h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic (18 milliunits/kg·min) clamp studies to establish a time course for the effects of GlcN on insulin-mediated glucose uptake and on insulin-stimulated PI3K activity. Thus, GlcN (750 μmol/kg bolus, 30 μmol/kg·min) was administered throughout the 2-h insulin clamp studies (designated 120 min, n = 5) or during the final 30 (30 min, n = 5), 60 (60 min,n = 5), or 90 min (90 min, n = 5) of the protocols. Time control euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (18 milliunits/kg·min) clamp studies were performed with infusion of saline for 2 h in an additional n = 12 age- and weight-matched control rats. Primed continuous infusions of HPLC-purified [3-3H]glucose (8 μCi bolus, 0.4 μCi/min) were infused throughout the studies, and plasma samples were obtained for determination of [3H]glucose-specific activity, insulin, and GlcN concentrations as described above. Assessment of basal PI3K activity was performed in additional fasting animals in the presence of 2-h infusions of GlcN (750 μmol/kg bolus, then 30 μmol/kg·min;n = 8) or saline (n = 12). The rates of glycolysis were estimated as described previously (24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma-tritiated water-specific activity was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the protein-free supernatant (Somogyi filtrate) before and after evaporation to dryness. Since tritium on the C-3 position of glucose is lost to water during glycolysis, it can be assumed that plasma tritium is present either in the form of tritiated water or [3-3H]glucose (24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The rates of peripheral glycogen synthesis during the insulin clamp studies were estimated as the difference between the rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis. Muscle glycogen concentration was determined following digestion with amyloglucosidase as described previously (24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Muscle glycogen synthase activity was measured by a modification (24Rossetti L. Laughlin M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Rossetti L. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2963-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) of the method of Thomas et al. (27Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and is based on the measurement of the incorporation of radioactivity into glycogen from UDP-[U-14C]glucose. Frozen rectus muscle samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and placed in ice-cold lysis buffer (NaCl 140 mm, Tris·HCl 10 mm, CaCl2 1 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, aprotinin 10 μg/ml, leupeptin 50 μm, sodium vanadate 2 mm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1 mm, glycerol 10%; total dilution 1:3). Samples were immediately homogenized on ice with a Tissumizer at moderate speed, using 3 cycles of 20 s each. Nonidet P-40 1% by volume was added to each tube, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Post-13,000 × g supernatants were immunoprecipitated with αp85 antibody (28Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) overnight and then assayed for PI3K activity by the method of Ruderman (12Ruderman N. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Each set of assayed samples included tissues from at least 2 fasted and insulin-stimulated animals, respectively, and PI3K activity in each sample was expressed as a multiple of the average fasting activity in that sample set. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentration in skeletal muscle samples was determined by a highly specific radioligand displacement assay, adapted from the method of van der Kaay et al. (29van der Kaay J. Batty I.H. Cross D.A.E. Watt P.W. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5477-5481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding protein was generated from BL21 cells transfected with GST-ΔC2 GAP1IP4BP (kind gift of Drs. Derek Brazil and Morris White of Boston) following induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cell lysate was applied twice to a ProBond Resin column containing 50% glutathione-Sepharose. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (with EGTA 1 mm, EDTA 1 mm, and β-mercaptoethanol 1 mm) and twice with 75 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl and then suspended in 75 mm Tris and 300 mm NaCl with 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Preparation of skeletal muscle samples involved alkaline hydrolysis of tissue phospholipid extract to generate Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Briefly, 200 mg of frozen muscle was homogenized in 2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. 3 ml of EDTA 10 mm were added to the pellet, which was then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with chloroform/MeOH and then extracted with chloroform/MeOH/HCl (40:80:1). Following centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 20 min, the chloroform was taken to dryness under N2. 200 μl of 1 m KOH was added to the pellet, which was put in a boiling water bath for 30 min. The pH was then raised to 5.0 with 1 m acetic acid. Two extractions were performed with 2 ml of butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (20:4:1) to remove fatty acids, and then the samples were dried and stored at −20 °C. On the day of the assay the samples were resuspended in 200 μl of 40 mm acetic acid. The assay was performed by measurement of displaced labeled [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (NEN Life Science Products) by the tissue extract. To 10 μl of a suspension of protein-bound glutathione beads, 40 μl of the tissue extract and 1.5 × 104 dpm of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were added, to a total volume of 200 μl in assay buffer (0.1 m NaAc, 0.1m KH2PO4, pH 5.0, 4 mmEDTA). The samples were incubated in the cold for 30 min and the beads separated by centrifugation and washed once. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of the washed beads. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and plasma insulin by radioimmunoassay using rat and porcine insulin standards. Plasma [3H]glucose radioactivity was measured in duplicate on the supernatants of Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 precipitates of plasma samples after evaporation to dryness to eliminate tritiated water. Regression analysis of the slopes of 3H2O rate of appearance (used in the calculation of the rates of glycolysis) was performed at 60-min intervals throughout the insulin clamp studies. Muscle UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc concentrations were obtained through 2 sequential chromatographic separations and UV detection (30Rossetti L. Lee Y. Ruiz J. Aldridge S. Shamoon H. Boden G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E761-E769PubMed Google Scholar, 31Giaccari A. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc co-elute with UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal during the solid phase extraction. The retention times for UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc were 28.5, 30.7, 33.9, and 35.4 min, respectively. Plasma GlcN concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following quantitative derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate as described by Anumula and Taylor (32Anumula K.R. Taylor P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All HPLC analyses were performed on a Waters HPLC system using a reverse-phase, ion pairing isocratic method, on two C18T (Supelco) reverse-phase columns (0.46 × 25 cm) in series. ATP concentrations in skeletal muscle were measured as follows: freeze-clamped skeletal muscle samples were finely pulverized in liquid nitrogen and then stirred into ice-cold 3 mHClO4 (3 ml/g) in an alcohol bath maintained at −10 °C. Following complete penetration of acid into tissue powder, tissue extracts were diluted with 1 ml of H2O, 0.3 ml of extract, rotated at 4 °C for 10 min, then centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and neutralized to pH 7 with 2 m KOH and 0.4 m imidazole base. ATP concentrations in neutralized supernatants were calculated from fluorometric measurements of NADPH generated in a two-step reaction, following the method of Passonneau and Lowry (33Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press Inc., Totawa, NJ1993: 122-123Google Scholar). All values are presented as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made using repeated measures analysis of variance where appropriate. Where F ratios were significant, further comparisons were made using Student's t tests (paired difference test and small sample test for independent samples, as appropriate). At the time of the study, the mean body weight of the animals was similar in all groups and averaged 309 ± 16 g. The mean plasma glucose, free fatty acid, and insulin concentrations at base line (0 h) were also similar in all groups. We assessed the effect of 2-h infusions of GlcN versus saline on acute insulin stimulation of PI3K, 2 min following intra-arterial bolus of insulin (1 units/kg) in normal rats (Fig. 2). The administration of bolus insulin resulted in rapid elevations in plasma insulin levels from fasting levels of 25 ± 5 microunits/ml to >1000 microunits/ml after 2 min. Whereas in saline-infused animals, bolus insulin induced a 3.3-fold stimulation of PI3K activity, there was only a 1.9-fold stimulation by insulin in the glucosamine-treated group. Of note, there was a tendency toward small increases in basal (non-insulin-stimulated) PI3K activity following 2 h of GlcN infusion, but these did not achieve statistical significance. We next examined the effect of more prolonged (3 h) insulin administration on the activation of PI3K in skeletal muscle and whether this was also impaired in the presence of increased GlcN availability. Primed continuous infusion of GlcN for 3 h during the insulin clamp studies resulted in sustained elevations in plasma GlcN levels, achieving a plateau by 90 min of infusion and maximal circulating GlcN levels of 2.3 ± 0.5 mm following 3 h. The plasma glucose concentration was maintained at basal levels throughout all clamp studies. The plasma insulin levels were maintained constant at ∼600 microunits/ml throughout. The coefficients of variation in plasma glucose and insulin levels were less than 5 and 10%, respectively, in all studies. These elevations in plasma GlcN levels resulted in marked and progressive decreases in insulin-mediated glucose disposal (Fig. 3 A). There were comparable decreases in both glucose infusion rates (GIR, 180 min = 31.1 ± 2.0versus 30–60 min = 37.8 ± 1.4 mg/kg·min;p < 0.005) and glucose uptake (Rd, 180 min = 37.2 ± 1.8 versus 30–60 min = 44.6 ± 1.2 mg/kg·min; p < 0.005) with GlcN infusion, with a similar time of onset (p < 0.05 at 110 min). Consistent with previous observations (1Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), there were no significant reductions in either the GIR (180 min = 30.5 ± 3.6versus 30–60 min = 32.3 ± 3.0 mg/kg·min;p > 0.05) or Rd (180 min = 38.6 ± 3.1versus 30–60 min = 40.9 ± 2.7 mg/kg·min;p > 0.05) during the 3-h time control insulin clamp studies with saline infusion. Fig. 3 A depicts the GIR at 10-min intervals throughout the 3-h insulin clamp studies with GlcN infusion (GlcN 180 min), and throughout the time control studies (SalI 80 min). Following the observed decreases in Rd and GIR in the presence of increased GlcN availability, more prolonged infusion of GlcN also resulted in impairments in the rates of peripheral glycogen synthesis (180 min = 21.7 ± 1.7 versus 30 min = 26.3 ± 2.0 mg/kg·min; p < 0.01) which first became significant by 160 min of GlcN infusion (p < 0.05). We measured PI3K activity following 3-h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp studies with infusions of either GlcN or saline throughout. The infusion of GlcN for 3 h throughout insulin clamp studies resulted in a marked impairment in the ability of insulin (∼600 microunits/ml) to stimulate PI3K activity (Fig. 3 B), such that there was only a 1.2-fold stimulation of PI3K activity with GlcN infusion, relative to a 2.4-fold stimulation in the time control group. Once we established that the defect in insulin-stimulated PI3K activity was also detectable following prolonged insulin infusions, we performed time course studies to determine the sequence of various GlcN-induced defects in insulin action and the length of time required for their onset. These observations allowed us to examine the time course of the effect of GlcN on PI3K vis à vis other metabolic actions of insulin. Primed continuous infusion of GlcN for variable durations during the course of 2-h insulin clamp studies resulted in very rapid elevations in plasma GlcN levels, to 1.1 ± 0.2 mm by 60 min of primed continuous infusion (Table I), again reaching a plateau by 90 min of infusion. Fig. 4 Adepicts the GIR at 10-min intervals throughout the 2-h insulin clamp studies with GlcN infusion over variable time intervals and throughout time control studies with saline infusion. Again, significant decreases in Rd and GIR were observed following 110 min of GlcN infusion (p < 0.05 versus 30 min) and were thus only seen in the group which received GlcN infusion throughout the 2-h studies (GlcN 120 min).Table IPlasma concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), glucosamine, an"

In 3T3-F442A fibroblasts stably expressing the c-fos promoter mutated at the C/EBP binding site upstream of luciferase, c-fos promoter activity is stimulated by GH 6–7-fold; wild type c-fos promoter shows only a 2-fold induction by GH. This suggests that C/EBP restrains GH-stimulated expression of c-fos. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from 3T3-F442A cells indicate that GH rapidly (2–5 min) increases binding of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, to the c-fos C/EBP binding site. Both liver activating protein (LAP) and liver inhibitory protein (LIP), forms of C/EBPβ, are detected in 3T3-F442A cells by immunoblotting. GH increases the binding of LAP/LAP and LAP/LIP dimers. Overexpression of LIP interferes with GH-promoted reporter expression in CHO cells expressing GH receptors, consistent with the possibility that LIP restrains GH-stimulated c-fos expression. Overexpression of LAP elevates basal luciferase activity but does not influence promoter activation by GH, while overexpressed C/EBPδ elevates basal promoter activity and enhances the stimulation by GH. GH stimulates the expression of mRNA for C/EBPβ and -δ and increases levels of C/EBPδ. Although C/EBPβ is not detectably altered, GH induces a shift to more rapidly migrating forms of LIP and LAP upon immunoblotting. Treatment of extracts from GH-treated cells with alkaline phosphatase causes a shift of the slower migrating form to the rapidly migrating form, consistent with GH promoting dephosphorylation of LIP and LAP. These studies implicate C/EBPβ and -δ in GH-regulated gene expression. They also indicate that GH stimulates the binding of C/EBPβ and -δ to the c-fos promoter and promotes the dephosphorylation of LIP and LAP. These events may contribute to the ability of C/EBPβ and -δ to regulate GH-stimulated expression of c-fos.

GH stimulates the serine phosphorylation of Elk-1 in conjunction with stimulating transcriptional activation mediated by Elk-1 (8Liao J. Hodge C.L. Meyer D.J. Ho P.S. Rosenspire K.C. Schwartz J. J.

Thus, multiple regulatory sequences and multiple types of postranslational modifications of transcription factors contribute to GH-regulated c-fos expression. Numerous proteins in addition to STATs 1 and 3, SRF, and Elk-1, representing a variety of transcription factor families, also associate with regulatory sequences in c-fos (10Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and might therefore be regulated by GH. In fact, in our previous studies of the SRE, a prominent unidentified complex which appeared to be regulated by GH was usually observed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (8Liao J. Hodge C.L. Meyer D.J. Ho P.S. Rosenspire K.C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25951-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This complex is reported here to reflect binding to a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) site, which lies immediately downstream of the SRE. The C/EBPs belong to the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors, which includes C/EBPα, -β, and -δ (11McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ expression increases with hormone stimulation of preadipocyte differentiation and then gradually decreases as differentiation proceeds (12MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ occurs as alternate translation products in both an activating form known as liver activating protein (LAP) and an inhibitory form known as liver inhibitory protein (LIP), which lacks the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain found in LAP (14Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In the c-fos enhancer, C/EBPβ (also known as NF-IL6) binds to a sequence at −303 to −295, just downstream of the SRE (13Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 15Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Metz R.

It was recently suggested that C/EBPβ may play a role in conjunction with SRF in ternary complex factor-independent signaling for SRE activation of c-fos in response to serum (17Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study implicates C/EBPβ and -δ as GH-responsive transcription factors that appear to contribute to the regulation of c-fosby GH. The above observations, particularly the proximity of the C/EBP site to the SRE and the presence of an unidentified GH-induced complex associated with the SRE, led us to investigate whether C/EBPs might contribute to GH-regulated gene expression and might be regulated by GH. Evidence implicating C/EBPβ and δ in GH-regulated transcription is provided here by the observation that mutation of the C/EBP site in the c-fos promoter enhances responsiveness of this promoter to GH, suggesting that C/EBPs restrain the induction of c-fos by GH. Overexpression of LIP interferes with GH-stimulated gene expression. In contrast, overexpression of LAP does not alter the response to GH, and C/EBPδ enhances it. GH was found to regulate C/EBPβ and -δ in at least three ways. First, GH increases C/EBPβ and δ mRNA and C/EBPδ protein levels. Second, treatment with GH is associated with a rapid increase in binding of LAP/LAP, LAP/LIP, and C/EBPδ to the c-fos promoter. Third, GH produces a transient dephosphorylation of both forms of C/EBPβ. These findings are consistent with an interplay of effects of GH on LIP, LAP, and C/EBPδ contributing to determining responsiveness of the c-fos promoter to GH. 3T3-F442A cells were provided by Dr. H. Green (Harvard University) and Dr. M. Sonenberg (Sloan-Kettering). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing rat GH receptor containing the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain (GHR-(1–454)) (18Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol.

In CHO cells expressing full-length GHR or GHR-(1–454), GH induces c-fos mRNA and stimulates transcriptional activation via the SRE to comparable extents (19Gong T.-W.L. Meyer D.J. Liao J. Hodge C.L.

CHO cells expressing GHR were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. All media were supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. Prior to treatment, cells were deprived of serum overnight in the appropriate medium containing 1% BSA instead of serum unless indicated otherwise.

Pooled clones were maintained in the presence of 0.6 mg/ml G418 and used for experiments. CHO cells expressing GHR-(1–454) were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (24Chen D. Okayama H. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, confluent cells were deprived of serum overnight and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with hormone, serum, or vehicle. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as described (3Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Cochran B.H. Argetsinger L.S. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol.

Binding reactions proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C and were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Where indicated, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 μl of antisera against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ, each at 1:10, or combinations of these antibodies. In the experiment in Fig.3 B, EMSA was performed as described previously (17Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst, version 1.0.2. Cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT), and luciferase or β-galactosidase activity was measured using an Autolumat or Opticomp Luminometer. The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Each condition was tested in triplicate in each experiment. Analysis of variance with factorial Scheffe F-test was used to analyze data from five or six individual experiments. Data are presented as percentage or -fold stimulation relative to a control = 1. Total RNA was isolated from confluent 3T3-F442A preadipocytes as described (9Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol.

Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments used as probes for C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ mRNA have been described previously (12MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). 3T3-F442A cells in 100-mm plates were washed with PBS and scraped into 0.5 ml of SDS lysis buffer (60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS). Lysates were boiled for 3 min, vortexed, and then boiled for an additional 7 min prior to storing at −80 °C (12MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Some experiments used hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) to lyse the cells prior to lysing nuclei with SDS lysis buffer. Whole cell lysates (35–50 μg) or nuclear extracts (20 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (12MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) using anti-C/EBPβ (1:1000) or anti-C/EBPδ (1:1000). In some experiments, whole cell lysates from cells treated with GH for 1 h were incubated with 40 units of alkaline phosphatase, in the presence or absence of vanadate (10 mm), for 1 h at 37 °C prior to immunoblotting (25Hemati N. Erickson R.L. Ross S.E. Liu R. MacDougald O.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The apparentM r values indicated in the figures are based on prestained molecular weight standards (Life Technologies). To determine whether the C/EBP site in the upstream regulatory sequence of c-fos is responsive to GH, the influence of mutating the C/EBP binding site on the ability of GH to regulate c-fos promoter activity was examined. GH was added to pools of 3T3-F442A fibroblasts stably expressing the wild type c-fos promoter (from −379 to +1) immediately upstream of the luciferase gene (wtFos-Luc) and to pools of cells expressing the c-fos promoter mutated in the C/EBP binding site (mC/EBP-Luc). Treatment with GH causes a 2-fold increase in luciferase expression mediated by the wtFos promoter (Fig.1). However, when the C/EBP site is mutated in the context of the c-fos promoter, the response to GH rises to more than 6 times control values (Fig. 1). A luciferase gene without c-fos promoter sequences (TK) fails to respond to GH. These findings indicate that the C/EBP site in the c-fos promoter is responsive to GH and suggest that proteins bound to the C/EBP site may play a restraining role in GH-promoted c-fos expression. To determine whether GH can regulate proteins that bind to a well characterized C/EBP site, nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA using a probe based on the C/EBP site from the 422/aP2gene (22Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), which recognizes C/EBPα, -β, and -δ. Nuclear proteins from 3T3-F442A cells bind to the C/EBP site as a diffuse band in EMSA (Fig. 2, lane 1). This band is not evident in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled homologous probe (data not shown). Treatment of cells with GH for 5 min increases the intensity of the complex bound to the C/EBP site (lane 2). Differences in binding cannot be explained by differences in protein levels as assessed by immunoblots. The addition of antisera specific for C/EBPβ causes almost complete disappearance of the complex and causes the appearance of a slower migrating, supershifted band in extracts from both control and GH-treated cells (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that C/EBPβ is a major component of the complex. Antibodies against C/EBPδ reduce the amount of binding slightly and induce a supershift in extracts from control or GH-treated cells (lanes 7 and 8), indicating the presence of some C/EBPδ in the complex. The addition of antibodies to C/EBPβ and -δ in combination results in a pattern of binding similar to that with anti-C/EBPβ alone (lanes 9and 10). In contrast, antibodies against C/EBPα have no effect on binding to the C/EBP site (lanes 3,4, 11, and 12). These observations indicate that GH can rapidly increase the binding of C/EBPβ and δ to a well characterized C/EBP site. To determine whether GH similarly regulates proteins bound to the C/EBP site in c-fos, nuclear extracts were analyzed with a probe based on the sequence of the wild type c-fos C/EBP site and adjacent (5′) SRE (wtC/EBP-SRE). Three complexes are associated with the wtC/EBP-SRE probe (Fig.3 A, lane 1), each of which is increased by treatment with GH for 5 min (lane 2). One of these complexes (SRF) consists of SRF bound to the probe; a slower-migrating band contains Elk-1 as well as SRF in a ternary complex, as identified previously by supershifting with antibodies specific for SRF or Elk-1 (8Liao J. Hodge C.L. Meyer D.J. Ho P.S. Rosenspire K.C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25951-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The fastest migrating complex consists of a broad diffuse band. All three complexes are absent in the presence of an excess of unlabeled probe but are unaffected by an unrelated (SIE) probe (data not shown). Antibodies specific for C/EBPβ cause disappearance of the broad diffuse band and cause appearance of a supershifted band that migrates more slowly than any of the other complexes (Fig. 3 A,lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that C/EBPβ or an immunologically related protein is a major component of this diffuse complex (hereafter labeled “C/EBP”) and is increased in GH-treated cells (lane 6). Antibodies against C/EBPδ also cause a supershift and reduce the intensity of the C/EBP complex in the presence and absence of GH (Fig. 3 A,lanes 7 and 8), indicating that C/EBPδ is present in the complex in control and GH-treated cells, but at reduced levels compared with C/EBPβ. The C/EBP complex is not altered when antibodies to C/EBPα are added (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4), indicating that C/EBPα is not present in this complex. The addition of antibodies specific for C/EBPβ, δ, or α in combination (lanes 9–16) do not differ from those using anti-C/EBPβ and δ alone; however, the supershift appears greater when anti-C/EBPβ and -δ are added in combination (lanes 13–16) rather than individually. The diffuse C/EBP complex appears to be superimposed on three constitutive bands that remain despite the presence of anti-C/EBPβ and are not altered by GH. Thus, the GH-regulated C/EBP complex bound to c-fos contains C/EBPβ as a major constituent and C/EBPδ to a lesser extent. When the C/EBP site mutation is introduced into the oligonucleotide probe (mC/EBP), the diffuse C/EBP complex disappears from the EMSA (not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that C/EBPβ and -δ are present in complexes bound to the c-fos promoter and that their binding is rapidly increased by GH in 3T3-F442A cells. C/EBPβ occurs as three alternative translation products: the full-length protein (p35C/EBPβ), LAP (p32C/EBPβ), and LIP (p20C/EBPβ). LAP is more prominent than p35 and mediates transcriptional activation in response to multiple stimuli when bound to DNA (26Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 27Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6642-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). LIP retains the basic region and leucine zipper of C/EBPβ but lacks the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of LAP. LIP can form heterodimers with LAP and is reported to inhibit transcriptional activation of genes by LAP (14Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). To detect LAP and LIP in complexes bound to the C/EBP site, the EMSA was modified to improve resolution (17Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using extracts from 293T cells overexpressing LAP or LIP, homodimers of LAP and LIP and heterodimers of LAP/LIP were bound to the c-fos C/EBP-SRE probe (Fig.3 B, lane 1). The addition of antibodies specific for C/EBPβ causes complete disappearance of the complexes (not shown). In 3T3-F442A cells, GH increases the appearance of LAP/LAP and LAP/LIP in 10 min (lane 3).

These include the housekeeping chaperones calnexin and calreticulin and two essential proteins, the transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) for peptide supply, and the protein tapasin which is thought to act as a specialized chaperone. We dissected functional effects of processing cofactors by co-expressing in insect cells various combinations of the human proteins HLA-A2, HLA-B27, β2-microglobulin, TAP, calnexin, calreticulin, and tapasin. Stability at 37 °C and surface expression of class I dimers correlated closely in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, suggesting that these cells retain empty dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both HLA molecules form substantial quantities of stable complexes with insect cell-produced peptide pools. These pools are TAP-selected cytosolic peptides for HLA-B27 but endoplasmic reticulum-derived, i.e. TAP-independent peptides for HLA-A2. This discrepancy may be due to peptide selection by human TAP which is much better adapted to the HLA-B27 than to the HLA-A2 ligand preferences. HLA class I assembly with peptides from TAP-dependent and -independent pools was enhanced strongly by tapasin. Thus, tapasin acts as a chaperone and/or peptide editor that facilitates assembly of peptides with HLA class I molecules independently of mediating their interaction with TAP and/or retention in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Dawson J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar), has been reported to facilitate folding of heavy chains and prevent their aggregation (3Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Upon binding of β2-microglobulin (β2m), HCI heavy chains dissociate from calnexin. Empty HCI/β2m dimers are found in complexes including the soluble ER chaperone calreticulin (4Sadasivan B. Lehner P. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), the putative chaperone tapasin (4Sadasivan B. Lehner P. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P.

Biol. 1998; 8: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lindquist J.A. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Hammerling G.J.

These complexes associate then with the heterodimeric TAP1/TAP2 transporter which delivers cytosolic peptides into the ER. Once a peptide has bound to HCI molecules, these are released from assembly complexes, leave the ER, and transit to the cell surface. Since most protein interactions in HCI loading complexes appear to be formed simultaneously, probably in a cooperative manner (10Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the functions of individual proteins, and the precise nature of the formed contacts are only partially understood (11van Endert P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). So far only peptide supply by TAP (12Spies T. Demars R. Nature. 1991; 351: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and HCI interaction with tapasin (5Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) have been shown to be essential for HCI assembly with peptides. Tapasin mediates association of empty HCI dimers with TAP complexes (5Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P.

Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This role of an intermediary involves binding of a tapasin moiety within the carboxyl-terminal 128 residues to TAP and interaction of the 50 amino-terminal tapasin residues with HCI molecules (10Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Copeman J. Bangia N. Cross J.C. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3783-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of normal peptide assembly in the tapasin-deficient cell line .220.B8 by a soluble tapasin molecule unable to mediate TAP association suggests that tapasin may also act as a chaperone facilitating peptide assembly with HCI molecules (15Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). HCI molecules display great polymorphic variation that determines their peptide ligand preferences but may also affect their associations with other proteins. Both parameters may affect the efficiency and mode of HCI assembly with peptide. Peptide preferences of individual HCI molecules may be more or less well adapted to the products of other components of the antigen processing machinery, for example peptides generated by proteasome or pumped by TAP. Variable interaction with processing cofactors in the ER may also affect HCI peptide loading. Some evidence for HCI polymorphism-related variation in assembly of HCI molecules has been reported. The speed of assembly in complexes and progression to the cell surface has been reported to vary significantly among HCI alleles (16Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Absence of TAP or tapasin affects HCI molecules to a different degree. HLA-A2, the most frequent HCI allele in caucasian populations, is affected the least by both deficiencies (17Alexander J. Payne J.A. Murray R. Frelinger J.A. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,18Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar), presumably because of its capacity of binding signal sequence-derived peptides which is shared with few other HCI alleles (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). More recently, HLA-B27 has been shown to depend less than two other HLA-B alleles on tapasin for peptide assembly (19Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, HCI molecules have been found to display considerable variation with respect to the strength of TAP interaction (20Neisig A. Wubbolts R. Zang X. Melief C. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3196-3206PubMed Google Scholar) and may also vary with respect to their dependence on the proteasome for generation of antigenic peptides (21Benham A.M. Gromme M. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of these differences has so far not been elucidated. One candidate mechanism affecting efficiency of peptide presentation by HCI molecules is peptide supply by the TAP complex. Studies on rodent transporters have demonstrated that strongly incompatible ligand preferences of TAP and MHC class I molecules result in poor peptide supply to the latter (22Powis S.J. Young L.L. Joly E. Barker P.J. Richardson L. Brandt R.P. Melief C.J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Immunity. 1996; 4: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Yellen-Shaw A.J. Laughlin C.E. Metrione R.M. Eisenlohr L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the human transporter is clearly less selective than mouse TAP and rat TAP1-TAP2bcomplexes (24Momburg F. Neefjes J.J. Hämmerling G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we have found that ligand preferences of individual HCI molecules vary greatly with respect to their adaptation to human TAP preferences (25Daniel S. Brusic V. Caillat-Zucman S. Petrovsky N. Harrison L. Riganelli D. Sinigaglia F. Gallazzi F. Hammer J. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar, 26van Endert P.M. Riganelli D. Greco G. Fleischhauer K. Sidney J. Sette A. Bach J.-F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). While HLA-A2 preferences are poorly adapted to those of TAP, ligands for HLA-B27 show the highest TAP affinities among all HCI molecules studied so far (25Daniel S. Brusic V. Caillat-Zucman S. Petrovsky N. Harrison L. Riganelli D. Sinigaglia F. Gallazzi F. Hammer J. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raised the question whether peptides translocated by human TAP are more likely to assemble with HLA-B27 than with HLA-A2. We have used the insect cell/baculovirus system to study functional interactions of proteins involved in class I antigen processing. This system has two advantages. First, since insects do not possess a specific immune system and the associated specialized antigen-processing proteins, fly cells can be used to freely combine sets of processing proteins, thereby creating cells lacking more than one component of the processing machinery. Second, overexpression of proteins in this system may in some cases allow for detecting protein interactions that are difficult to observe at physiological expression levels. By using this system, we addressed the following issues: (i) what are the effects of tapasin, calnexin, and calreticulin on assembly of TAP-dependent and independent peptides with HCI molecules; (ii) are there allelic variations in these effects; and (iii) which interactions between HCI molecules, TAP, calnexin, and calreticulin can be observed in insect cells? Baculoviruses expressing wild type human TAP1.0101 and TAP2.0101 proteins have been described previously (27van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For expression of wild type TAP1-TAP2 complexes, a dual promoter virus containing human TAP1 and TAP2 cDNAs (a gift from Dr. R. Tampé, MPI Martinsried) was used. Mutant TAP1 and TAP2 proteins were generated by replacement of the Walker A sequence motifs by a peptide linker; single and double mutant TAP subunits form dimeric complexes that do not translocate peptides. 2S. Daniel and P.M. van Endert, manuscript in preparation. Correct sequences of all cDNAs to be expressed in baculovirus were verified by PCR-based complete sequencing of plasmid inserts using an Applied Biosystems Inc. automated sequencer. cDNAs were sequenced after cloning of PCR products or restriction fragments into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), pTAG (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), or pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vectors. Human β2m cDNA was PCR-amplified in 22 cycles from plasmid HS4 provided by Dr. S. Kvist, Stockholm, Sweden, using primers with internal BamHI sites. Then the cDNA was cloned into pCRII and finally subcloned into the BamHI sites of pVL1393 (Invitrogen) and of the dual promoter vector pAcUW51 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) already containing HLA-A2 or B27 inserts. An HLA-A*0201 cDNA cloned into an M13 phage vector was obtained from Drs. P. Parham and J. Gumperz (Stanford). Insert was amplified from phage-derived double-stranded DNA in a 22-cycle PCR using primers with an internal BglII (5′) or EcoRI (3′) site, respectively, and cloned into pCRII. A2 cDNA was then cloned as Bgl/Eco fragment into pVL1392 (Invitrogen) and pAcUW51. An HLA-B27*05 cDNA cloned into pUHD was obtained from Dr. K. Früh, San Diego. Insert was amplified in an 18-cycle PCR using primers with aBamHI (5′) or EcoRI (3′) site, respectively, cloned into pMOS Blue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then into pBluescript SK+ for sequencing. Sequencing revealed that the amplified as well as the original pUHD-cloned cDNA differed from the published consensus sequence by a single nucleotide replacement resulting in an aspartic acid for asparagine substitution at codon 151. To correct the sequence, the B27 insert was transferred as Bam/Eco fragment into BglII/EcoRI-digested pAcUW51, and site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene) was performed to obtain the correct B*2705 sequence. A human calnexin cDNA cloned in pMCFR-PAC was obtained from Drs. P. Cresswell and T. Novak, Yale University, and subcloned into pBluescript SK+ containing six histidine codons followed by a stop codon. Calnexin stop codon and 3′-untranslated sequence were then removed by loop out mutagenesis so that the last calnexin codon was joined in frame to the first histidine codon. To shorten and modify the 5′-untranslated calnexin sequence, a 425-base pair KpnI/HindIII 5′ fragment was replaced by an equivalent PCR-amplified fragment with a 5′ BamHI site. Finally, the complete calnexin cDNA was subcloned into pVL1393. A human calreticulin cDNA cloned into pTZ18U was obtained from Dr. J. D. Capra, Dallas. Insert was PCR-amplified using primers with an internal BglII (5′) orEcoRI (3′) site, respectively, and cloned into pTAG before subcloning as Bgl/Eco fragment into pVL1392 and pAcUW51. A human tapasin cDNA with a 3′ polyhistidine extension was generated by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed (Copy Kit™, Invitrogen) cDNA from the cell line U937 using a high fidelity mixture of thermostable DNA polymerases (Advantage HF™ kit,CLONTECH). The tapasin cDNA was sequenced in pCRII before subcloning into pVL1393. Two TAP-independent peptides were expressed in the baculovirus system as minigenes transferred from a vaccinia virus expression plasmid. Briefly, the vaccinia vector pSC11s was first modified by insertion of complementary oligonucleotides encoding the signal peptide of the adenovirus E3/19K protein. Then additional oligonucleotides coding for an HLA-A2-restricted epitope (FLPSDFFPSV (28Sette A. Sidney J. del Guercio M.F. Southwood S. Ruppert J. Dahlberg C. Grey H.M. Kubo R.T. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)), or an HLA-B27-binding peptide (RRYQKSTEL (29Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar)), respectively, were inserted 3′ of the signal peptide encoding sequence, and the complete sequences were transferred into pVL1393. Both epitopes have high binding affinity for their restricting HLA molecules, and vaccinia-expressed sig/core 18-27 gives rise to high levels of TAP-independent target cell lysis by A2-restricted CTLs. 3G. Lauvau and P. M. van Endert, unpublished observations. All recombinant viruses were produced by co-transfection ofSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with 100 ng of baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold™, PharMingen) and 3 μg of pVL1392, pVL1393, or pAcUW51-cloned cDNAs as described (30Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. Hammer J. Bach J.F. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2350-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Control baculoviruses used in this study express human 65-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) or the intracellular portion of the tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 (IA-2ic), two autoantigens targeted in type 1 diabetes (31Bach J.M.

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) AF8 specific for human calnexin (32Hochstenbach F. David V. Watkins S. Brenner M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4734-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. M. Brenner (Harvard Medical School, Boston), and mAb BBM.1 specific for human β2m was kindly provided by Dr. G. Moldenhauer, Heidelberg, Germany. Hybridomas producing mAb W6/32 (recognizing HCI/β2m dimers), BB7.2 (specific for HLA-A2), and B27M1 (specific for HLA-B27) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Hybridoma HC10 with specificity for free HCI heavy chains (33Stam N.J. Vroom T.M. Peters P.J. Pastoors E.B. Ploegh H.L. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. H. Ploegh (Harvard). mAb 148.3 recognizing the carboxyl terminus of human TAP1 and mAb 429.3 (used for Western blots) and 435.3 (used for immunoprecipitations) with specificity for the carboxyl-terminal domain of human TAP2 have been described previously (27van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). mAb were purified from ascites obtained from hybridoma-inoculated Balb/c mice by affinity purification on protein G-Sepharose columns (Gamma-Bind Plus™, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit serum R425 recognizing denatured human HCI heavy chains was provided by Drs. S. Kvist and P. Wang, Stockholm, Sweden. Rabbit sera specific for human calnexin and calreticulin were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada), and a rabbit serum with specificity for human β2m was obtained from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). 5 × 106 Sf9 cells adhering to 6-cm inner diameter tissue culture dishes were infected with 2 × 107 pfu of HCI/β2m double insert virus supernatants together with 4 × 107 pfu of each of two other viral supernatants for 1 h. Infectious supernatants were then replaced by 5 ml of complete TMN-FH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Sigma). To assess steady state levels of HCI molecules, cells were labeled after 24 h infection by incubation for 40 min in 0.6 ml of Grace's medium without methionine supplemented with 0.2 mCi of [35S]methionine (EasyTag™, NEN Life Science Products). Then 0.9 ml of methionine-deficient Grace's medium with 10% fetal calf serum dialyzed against PBS was added, and labeling was continued overnight. Labeled cells were recovered by rinsing in cold PBS, washed once in PBS with 1 mm PMSF, and lysed by incubating 1 h in 1 ml of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), and a mixture of protease inhibitors: 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCL (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), 1 μg/ml aprotinin (ICN), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine (Calbiochem), 5 μm leupeptin (Alexis, Laufelfingen, Switzerland), and 10 μm pepstatin (Alexis). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 10 min and precleared by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Gamma-Bind Plus™, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Sepharose 4B beads coupled to a control mAb. After removal of beads by centrifugation for 1 min at 1,000 ×g, cleared lysates were split in equal parts (for HLA-A2) or at a ratio of 1:2 (for HLA-B27) for immunoprecipitation by mAb HC10 and W6/32 (10 μg each), respectively. 2.5 h later, 12.5 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added for a further 30 min to recover immunoprecipitated material. Then beads were washed with a series of Tris/NaCl buffers containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with increasing pH (2× pH 7.4, 1× pH 8.0, 1× pH 9.0, 1× pH 9.0 with 250 mm NaCl added), washed once in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, with 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and finally boiled in 20 μl reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In experiments on HCI stability at 37 °C, precleared lysates were split in two equal parts that were incubated for 1 h at 4 or 37 °C, respectively. Then HCI molecules were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 45 min with 10 μg of mAb HC10 or W6/32 pre-absorbed onto 8 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Beads were washed as described above. Precipitated proteins were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were fixed in 50% trichloroacetic acid, destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, enhanced in 1 m sodium salicylate, pH 6.0, and finally autoradiographed for 24 h to 1 week. Autoradiographs were scanned and analyzed by densitometry using NIH Image 1.62 software. To analyze protein interactions, 5 × 107 plastic-adherent Sf9 cells were infected for 1 h with 1.5 × 108 pfu in a total volume of 5 ml of TMN-FH. Infectious supernatant was then replaced by 20 ml of fresh medium, and cells were cultured for 2.5 to 3 days. Cells were harvested, washed once in cold PBS with 1 mm PMSF, and unless used immediately, snap-frozen in aliquots of 5 × 106 in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. 5 × 106 cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in 0.65 to 1.0 ml of precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% digitonin (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (see above). After clarification and preclearing as described above, a lysate volume corresponding to 1–2 × 106 cells was added to 10 μg of mAb and incubated for a period ranging from 1 to 16 h. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose during 30 min, followed by three washes in 500 μl of cold precipitation buffer with 0.5% digitonin. Finally, complexes were solubilized by boiling for 10 min in 35 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, protein concentrations of Nonidet P-40 lysates of Jesthom and Sf9 cells were quantified by the BCA assay (Pierce). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in mini-gels with the appropriate percentage of acrylamide (7.5% for TAP and calnexin, 10% for HCI and calreticulin, and 12.5% for β2m). Separated proteins were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 80 V for 1 h in 48 mm Tris, 390 mmglycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol. Blotted proteins were then visualized with a standard ECL protocol, using primary antibody dilutions of 1:10,000 to 1:50,000. For fluorescence-activated cell sorter stainings, 5 × 106Sf9 cells were infected as for metabolic labelings with a combination of three viral supernatants. 36 h after infection, cells were recovered by rinsing, washed once in cold PBS/PMSF, and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in staining buffer (PBS with 0.05% NaN3, 1% fetal calf serum). Aliquots of 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with mAb at 10 μg/ml, washed twice, incubated 30 min at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat Ab to mouse Ig (SBA, Birmingham, AL), diluted 1:100, and again washed three times. Immediately before analysis on a FACSCAN™ cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), propidium iodide (0.8 μg/ml) was added to stained cells. Only live cells excluding propidium iodide were evaluated. We expressed full-length cDNA clones coding for human calnexin, calreticulin, tapasin, β2m, HLA-A*0201, and HLA-B*2705, and two leader sequence-coupled peptides with high affinity for HLA-A2 or B27, respectively, in recombinant baculoviruses under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Calnexin and tapasin were expressed as fusion proteins joined to six carboxyl-terminal histidine codons. For expression of HLA class I heavy chain/β2m dimers and of TAP1-TAP2 complexes, we also produced viruses expressing two proteins under the control of the polyhedrin and the p10 promoter, respectively. To verify expression of proteins with correct molecular weights, we blotted Nonidet P-40 lysates of insect cells infected for the 3 days with one or several viruses onto PVDF membranes and quantified expressed proteins using specific mAb or sera and an ECL protocol (Fig.1). As controls, lysates from the human B cell line Jesthom expressing HLA-A2 and HLA-B27 were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, all recombinant proteins had molecular weights that were similar or identical to their physiological counterparts expressed in the human B cell. This includes HLA-A2 and B27 heavy chains, suggesting that the insect cell-expressed HCI molecules are glycosylated to a similar extent as in human cells. Recombinant calnexin migrated slightly more slowly than its physiological equivalent due to the carboxyl-terminal polyhistidine extension. Recombinant tapasin could be purified as a 49-kDa protein based on the interaction of its polyhistidine extension with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resins (not shown). Recombinant proteins represented a higher percentage of total Nonidet P-40-solubilized cellular protein than their physiological counterparts in the human B cell line. The two TAP subunits and the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin showed the highest relative levels of expression; equal protein amounts of B cells contained on average 10-fold (between 5- and 30-fold in several experiments) less of these proteins than insect cells infected with the relevant viruses. HCI heavy chains and β2m were expressed at relatively more moderate levels; in several independent experiments, the ratio of expression in insect cells to B cells (normalized for equal protein amounts) was between 1 and 3. Tapasin expression levels were not compared with those in human B cells. To study the effect of antigen processing cofactors on steady state levels of HCI dimers, insect cells were infected with various combinations of three viruses, driving expression of up to five human proteins. 24 h after infection, cells were labeled metabolically for 12 h, followed by immunoprecipitation of unfolded free heavy chains or folded HCI dimers with an excess of mAb HC10 or W6/32, respectively. Precipitated HCI molecules were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified by densitometry. For each condition, Fig.2 shows three parameters as follows: (i) the percentage of HCI molecules recovered by dimer-specific mAb W6/32 relative to the sum of HCI molecules precipitated by HC10 and W6/32 (given as numbers); (ii) the amounts of recovered free heavy chains and (iii) of dimers relative to control infections, in which cells expressed HCI/β2m together with two control proteins (expressed as abar graph). Fig. 2 is representative of three independent experiments. Similar results were obtained in four experiments in which the amounts of dimers and free heavy chains were quantified by Western blot staining with a serum (R425) recognizing denatured heavy chains (not shown). In control experiments on Jesthom B cells, 10–20 times less HCI molecules were recovered by HC10 than by W6/32 (not shown). Only HC10-reactive heavy chains could be recovered from insect cells lacking β2m expression (not shown). Both the percentage assembling in dimers in the absence of processing cofactors and the effect of cofactors differed substantially between HLA-A2 and B27. In the case of HLA-A2 (Fig. 2 A), 35% of heavy chains formed dimers with β2m in the absence of any human cofactor. Surprisingly, this percentage was not affected by co-expression of chaperones or peptide sources including a TAP-independent peptide with high A2 binding affinity. However, although not affecting the percentage of A2 molecules forming dimers, calnexin and calreticulin co-expression resulted in modest (30–50%) simultaneous increases in th"
https://openalex.org/W2015016653,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) controls growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Previous reports have indicated that the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF may be modulated by the glycosidic moiety of proteoglycans associated with the membrane of stromal cells. In this work, we have performed in vitrostudies of the interaction between GM-CSF and glycosaminoglycans. The addition of heparin promoted a marked blue shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum of GM-CSF as well as a 30-fold increase in the intensity of light scattering, which indicates formation of large molecular weight complexes between the two molecules. Interestingly, heparin-induced changes in the spectral properties of GM-CSF were only observed at acidic pH. The dependence on acidic pH, together with a strict dependence on glycosaminoglycan sulfation and the fact that high ionic strength destabilized the interaction, indicates that the association between GM-CSF and glycosaminoglycans is mediated by electrostatic interactions. These interactions probably involve sulfate groups in the glycosaminoglycans and positively charged histidine residues in GM-CSF. We propose that negatively charged glycolipids present on the plasma membrane of the hematopoietic and/or the stromal cell could promote an acidic microenvironment capable of triggering interaction between GM-CSF and membrane-bound proteoglycans in vivo. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) controls growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Previous reports have indicated that the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF may be modulated by the glycosidic moiety of proteoglycans associated with the membrane of stromal cells. In this work, we have performed in vitrostudies of the interaction between GM-CSF and glycosaminoglycans. The addition of heparin promoted a marked blue shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum of GM-CSF as well as a 30-fold increase in the intensity of light scattering, which indicates formation of large molecular weight complexes between the two molecules. Interestingly, heparin-induced changes in the spectral properties of GM-CSF were only observed at acidic pH.

Blood. 1986; 67: 257-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2Allen T.D. Dexter T.M. Simmons P.J. Dexter T.M. Garland J.M. Testa N.G. Colony-Stimulating Factors. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that binding of growth factors to the hematopoietic stroma may involve the GAG moiety of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (3Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F.

Nature. 1988; 332: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In addition, GAGs have been shown to modulate the biological activities of an increasing number of cytokines and chemokines. The proposed mechanisms for such modulation may involve: (a) protection against protease-mediated cleavage, as in the case of FGF (5Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and interferon-γ (6Lortat-Jacob H. Baltzer F. Grimaud J.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In addition, oligomerization of growth factors upon binding to heparan sulfate, and consequently facilitation of signal transduction, has been proposed for several factors, such as FGF (10Ornitz D.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The modulation of the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF, as well as of other myelopoietic growth factors that act through the same family of receptors (interleukin-3 and -5), was shown to be mediated by heparin or heparan sulfate, both in the bone marrow and in an extramedullar myelopoietic environment (13Gallagher J.T.

J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, soluble heparin and heparan sulfate were shown to have biological activities similar to that of the corresponding stroma-associated proteoglycans for the above cited three growth factors, either in Verfaillie-type cultures of human hematopoietic cells (17Gupta P. McCarthy J.B. Verfaillie C.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the proliferation of growth factor-dependent cell lines (15Alvarez-Silva M. Borojevic R. J.

These findings suggest that physical interaction between the growth factor and heparan sulfate must occur in vivo and should be detectable in experimental models using soluble molecules. Nevertheless, no direct demonstration of such association has been reported so far. In addition, attempts to affinity-purify GM-CSF onto heparin-Sepharose, such as was done for both basic and acidic FGF (19Lobb R.R. Fett J.W.

In the present study, we have used spectroscopic techniques to investigate the interaction between recombinant human GM-CSF and GAGsin vitro. We have found that GM-CSF undergoes a conformational change upon acidification of the pH of the medium and that the acid-stable conformation is the one mediating in vitro binding with GAGs. In addition, we show that negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (at neutral pH) induce similar conformational changes in GM-CSF as those promoted by acid pH. Based on these observations, we propose that, under physiological conditions, the acidic environment necessary to trigger the effective interaction between GM-CSF and GAGs may be provided by negatively charged groups present on the external surface of the plasma membrane of the interacting cells. Recombinant human GM-CSF was a generous gift from Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). Porcine intestinal mucosa heparin (average molecular mass 15 kDa), bovine intestinal mucosa heparin (average molecular mass 3 kDa), shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate C (average molecular mass 60 kDa), human umbilical cord hyaluronic acid (molecular mass >500 kDa), dermatan sulfate, bovine kidney heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, phosphatidylserine, and Ficoll were from Sigma. Phosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar (Alabaster, AL). (N + O)-desulfated heparin, prepared as described by Nagasawa and Inoue (22Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Whistler R.L. BeMiller J.N. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 287-289Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Dr. A. S. Perlin (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). 2-(p-toluidinil)naphtalene-6-sulfonic acid (TNS) and FITC-labeled heparin were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and HiTrap heparin columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Light scattering was measured on an ISS PC spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) at 25 °C. The wavelength of incident light was 400 nm, and light scattering was monitored at 90°. In all experiments, GM-CSF was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in a 20 mm concentration of either sodium acetate, pH 4.0, or dibasic potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The sample (final volume of 600 μl) was placed in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Different GAGs were then added at various concentrations (from 10 ng/ml to 10 μg/ml), and light-scattering intensities were immediately recorded. Data were corrected by subtraction of the scattering contribution from blanks containing GAGs in the absence of GM-CSF and were additionally corrected for the dilution caused by the additions of small volumes of GAG stock solution to the cuvette. Fluorescence studies were performed on an ISS PC spectrofluorometer at 25 °C, using 8- and 16-nm band passes for excitation and emission, respectively. For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 275 nm. Spectra were corrected by subtraction of blanks containing variable amounts of Ficoll, added in order to provide the same intensity of light scattering at 400 nm obtained for the protein samples. For FITC fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 490 nm, and emission was varied between 500 and 600 nm. When TNS was used, fluorescence was measured with excitation at 385 nm and emission was recorded between 420 and 500 nm. Spectra were corrected both for dilution and for free TNS fluorescence by subtraction of blanks containing the probe alone or probe plus phospholipid vesicles (see “Results”) in the absence of GM-CSF. The fluorescence intensities reported correspond to integrated areas of the emission spectra, calculated as ΣI(λ). Average emission wavelengths correspond to the centers of mass of recorded spectra, and were calculated as ΣλI(λ)/ΣI(λ). In neutralization assays, 1 μg/ml heparin (15 kDa) was initially added to 5 μg/ml GM-CSF in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The mixture was then gradually neutralized to pH 7.5 by addition of small aliquots of 0.5 or 1m Tris-HCl (pH 10.0 or 9.0, respectively) to obtain stepwise increases of 0.5 pH unit after each addition. In acidification assays, heparin (1 μg/ml) was initially added to GM-CSF at pH 7.5. The sample was then gradually acidified by the addition of small aliquots of HCl solutions (0.05–0.5 m) in order to obtain stepwise decreases of 0.5 pH unit after each addition. In both assays, light-scattering intensities (corrected for dilution and blank subtraction) were measured immediately following pH changes. Phospholipids dissolved in chloroform were evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipid film formed was resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 1 mm. The suspensions were vortexed vigorously. Small unilamellar vesicles were formed by sonicating the turbid suspensions using a Branson Sonifier (Sonic Power, Danbury, CT) equipped with a titanium microtip probe. Sonication was performed in an ice bath, alternating cycles of 20 s at 50% full power with 60-s resting intervals, until a transparent solution was obtained (approximately eight cycles). The solutions were centrifuged for 4 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and the supernatants were used immediately. Vesicles were added to GM-CSF samples so as to obtain a final phospholipid concentration of 0.1 mm. Loading samples were prepared by diluting the stock solution of GM-CSF (500 μg/ml) to 10 μg/ml in 20 mm of either sodium acetate, pH 5, or phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Samples (1 ml) were loaded onto a HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column, pre-equilibrated with at least 10 volumes of the same buffer used in the samples. After loading, the column was extensively washed with the same buffer, and the protein content of eluted aliquots (1 ml) was evaluated by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of 275 and 345 nm, respectively). The buffer was then changed to either phosphate (pH 7.5), in the case of samples loaded at acidic pH, or sodium acetate (pH 5), in the case of samples loaded at neutral pH. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and their fluorescence content was analyzed immediately. Standard clonogenic assays were done in soft agar cultures of human hematopoietic cells. The cells were from an aliquot of a sample used for quantification of the hematopoietic precursors harvested by leukoapheresis from a patient submitted to autologous transplantation. Briefly, cells were suspended in Iscove's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.3% agar (final concentration) and plated at 3 × 105cells/35-mm plastic Petri dish. Recombinant human GM-CSF, used before or after binding to heparin-Sepharose at acid pH (see above and Fig.8), was added at the indicated concentrations (see Fig. 9). The supernatant of 5637 cells, which secrete constitutively human GM-CSF, was used as an internal positive control, and cultures without any added growth factor were used as negative controls. No proliferation was observed in the latter cultures (data not shown). GM-CSF-sensitive units were quantified after 14 days of culture, using an inverted microscope.Figure 9Proliferation of human GM-CSF-responsive myeloid cells. The indicated concentrations of human recombinant GM-CSF were added to primary myeloid cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two samples were compared: control GM-CSF (black bars) and GM-CSF eluted from the column shown in Fig. 8 A (white bars). Values given in the ordinate correspond to the number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU) per 105 cells.

Graber P. Moonen P. Craig S. Pain R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we have used intrinsic fluorescence measurements to investigate conformational changes of GM-CSF induced by interaction with GAGs. The fluorescence emission spectrum of GM-CSF presented a peak at 349 nm (corresponding to an average emission wavelength of 358.1 nm) (Fig.1 A). The addition of 1 μg/ml heparin did not promote any significant spectral shift and only a modest (30%) decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1 A). Previous studies using FGF-1 and FGF-2 have shown that, although a decrease in FGF fluorescence was observed upon interaction with heparin at neutral pH (24Li L.Y. Seddon A.P. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it was only at acidic pH that heparin induced a shift of the FGF fluorescence spectrum (25Pineda-Lucena A. Núñez de Castro I. Lozano R.M. Muñoz-Willery I. Zazo M. Giménez-Gallego G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether a similar behavior was exhibited by GM-CSF, we investigated the effect of heparin at pH 4. In this condition, heparin promoted a 6-nm blue shift of the emission spectrum (with a change in average emission wavelength from 355.0 to 349.0 nm) (Fig. 1 B). It is noteworthy that pH acidification by itself caused a 3.1-nm blue shift relative to the emission spectrum measured at neutral pH, which indicates that GM-CSF undergoes a conformational change upon acidification. Examination of the fluorescence spectra obtained at pH 4 showed that heparin promoted a marked increase in the intensity of light scattering, seen at the blue edge of the fluorescence emission (Fig. 1 B, inset). This increase in light scattering indicates an increase in the size of the particles in solution (26Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II. Freeman and Co., New York1980: 838-842Google Scholar). Interaction between one molecule of GM-CSF and one molecule of heparin (15 kDa) would not lead to the increase in light scattering observed in Fig. 1 B (inset). The observed increase in light scattering probably reflects the formation of large complexes, involving simultaneous binding of several units of both GM-CSF and heparin molecules. In order to confirm the formation of high order complexes, we have centrifuged the samples at acidic pH and compared the protein contents in solution before and after centrifugation (Fig. 2). Centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g maxwas sufficient to sediment all of the protein content of the samples, as shown by both a dramatic decrease in light scattering (Fig. 2 A) and the complete disappearance of the 14-kDa band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of centrifuged samples (Fig. 2 B). These results show that high molecular weight complexes are formed between GM-CSF and heparin at acidic pH. Light scattering was measured at 400 nm following stepwise additions of heparin to GM-CSF (Fig. 3). At pH 7.5, the addition of heparin did not promote any increase in light scattering, whereas at pH 4.0 light scattering increased progressively, reaching a maximal enhancement of about 30-fold at 1 μg/ml heparin. The concentration of heparin necessary to promote 50% of maximal complex formation was ∼300 ng/ml. To determine the heparin/GM-CSF stoichiometry in the complex, we carried out the experiment shown in the inset of Fig. 3. FITC-labeled heparin (1 μg/ml) was added to a sample of GM-CSF at pH 4. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 ×g max, and the intensity of FITC fluorescence remaining in the supernatant was measured after neutralization. Only 10% of the initial fluorescence was detected in the supernatant, which indicates that approximately 90% of the heparin molecules added were incorporated into the complex together with GM-CSF. These results indicate that the K d for heparin binding to GM-CSF at acidic pH is approximately 300 ng/ml, or 20 nm (using the average molecular mass for heparin of 15 kDa). In order to determine the optimal pH for complex formation, we investigated changes in light scattering as a function of pH (Fig.4). Complexes were formed by the addition of 1 μg/ml heparin to a GM-CSF sample at pH 4. This sample was subsequently neutralized by stepwise additions of Tris buffer (Fig. 4,closed circles). Neutralization promoted a progressive decrease in light scattering, indicating disruption of previously formed complexes. From these data, an apparent pK a of 5.2 for complex formation was determined. An interesting finding was that when heparin was first added to GM-CSF at pH 7.4 with subsequent acidification of the medium, only a slight increase in light scattering was detected (Fig. 4, open circles). This result indicates that the two initial states (GM-CSF at pH 4 plus heparin and GM-CSF at pH 7.5 plus heparin) cannot be readily interconverted by changing the pH, i.e. that these two states are not in fast equilibrium (see “Discussion”). In order to investigate the contributions of size and degree of sulfation to the interaction of GAGs with GM-CSF, we have compared light scattering increases induced by 15-kDa heparin with those induced by 3-kDa heparin and by chemically (N + O)-desulfated 3.5-kDa heparin (Fig. 5 A). Additions of 15- or 3-kDa heparin promoted maximal increases of light scattering of 30- and 22-fold, respectively. In both cases, maximal levels were obtained at 1 μg/ml heparin, with K 0.5 values of approximately 300 and 400 ng/ml, respectively. The addition of 1 μg/ml of (N + O)-desulfated heparin hardly promoted any increase in light scattering, indicating that sulfation is strictly required for the interaction of heparin with GM-CSF. In line with these results was the observation that the addition of high concentrations of NaCl promoted complete dissolution of the GM-CSF·GAG complexes (IC50 ∼0.5 m; data not shown). This indicates that the association between GM-CSF and GAGs depends on electrostatic interactions, probably involving sulfate groups in GAGs and basic residues in GM-CSF. It is interesting to note that physiological concentrations of salt (150 mm NaCl) did not prevent formation of the GM-CSF·GAG complexes (not shown). In order to determine whether interaction with GM-CSF was specific for heparin, we examined light scattering increases promoted by other GAGs (Fig. 5 B). Heparan sulfate promoted a 42-fold increase in light scattering. The apparent affinities for heparan sulfate and 15-kDa heparin were approximately similar. Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate, although they also promoted significant increases in light scattering (22- and 13-fold, respectively), presented lower apparent affinities for GM-CSF than heparin or heparan sulfate (Fig.5 B). These data indicate that the interaction between GM-CSF and GAGs is not solely determined by the degree of sulfation but rather depends on other structural requirements. Nevertheless, the importance of sulfate groups was confirmed by the observations that hyaluronic acid, a nonsulfated GAG, did not cause any increase in light scattering, whereas dextran sulfate, a polysulfated non-GAG molecule, did (Fig. 5 B). The fact that detectable interaction between GM-CSF and GAGs occurred only at acidic pH (Fig. 4), along with the finding that acidification promoted a blue shift of the fluorescence emission of GM-CSF (Fig. 1), indicated that the growth factor presented different conformations depending on pH. To further investigate this point, we have compared the binding of TNS to GM-CSF at pH 4 and 7.5. The hydrophobic fluorescent probe TNS has been used to monitor conformational changes in proteins, since it is fluorescent only upon binding to hydrophobic sites and is essentially nonfluorescent when free in aqueous solution (27Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, binding to GM-CSF, revealed by a significant increase in TNS fluorescence, was observed only at acidic pH. At neutral pH, no binding of TNS to GM-CSF was observed. This result confirms that GM-CSF undergoes pH-induced conformational changes, which result in exposure of TNS binding sites at acid pH. The fact that the interaction between GM-CSF and GAGs reported here was only observed at acidic pH could, in principle, argue against a possible physiological role for this phenomenon in hematopoiesis, since the pH of the extracellular matrix where these two molecules physiologically interact is neutral. On the other hand, it has been reported that the effective pH near the surface of vesicles containing acidic phospholipids is about 2 pH units lower than the pH of the bulk aqueous phase (28van der Goot F.G. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether an acidic membrane surface could promote the conformational changes in GM-CSF necessary for interaction with GAGs, we measured TNS binding to GM-CSF at pH 7.5 in the presence of vesicles containing neutral, acidic, or an equimolar mixture of neutral and acidic phospholipids (Fig. 7). Binding of TNS to GM-CSF was higher in the presence of acidic phosphatidylserine vesicles, intermediate in the presence of vesicles containing equimolar amounts of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, and virtually absent in the presence of neutral vesicles of phosphatidylcholine. In addition, in the presence of acidic vesicles (but not in the presence of neutral vesicles), the fluorescence emission of GM-CSF was notably blue shifted (data not shown). Blue shifts of intrinsic fluorescence induced by interaction with acidic phospholipids have been previously reported for other growth factors (29Rourke A.M. Cha Y. Collins D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11913-11917Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These results indicate that acidic phospholipid vesicles induce structural changes in GM-CSF that are apparently similar to those induced by acid pH in bulk aqueous solutions. This raises the possibility that a localized acidic microenvironment created at the surface of a lipid membrane could trigger the interaction of GM-CSF with GAGs. In order to further support the hypothesis that local pH acidification contributes to the mechanism of physiological activation of GM-CSF, it was necessary to show that the growth factor preserved its biological activity after interaction with heparin at acidic pH. In order to investigate this possibility, we have measured the biological activity of GM-CSF by its ability to induce proliferation of myeloid cells responsive to GM-CSF. A sample of GM-CSF was bound to a heparin-Sepharose column at pH 5. After extensive washing with acidic buffer, the pH was brought to 7.5, and GM-CSF was eluted (Fig.8 A). Noteworthy is the fact that GM-CSF loaded onto the column at neutral pH did not bind to the heparin matrix (Fig. 8 B). When the sample collected from the column from panel A was tested on a clonogenic proliferation assay, similar cell growth was observed as compared with the growth induced by a nonacidified sample of GM-CSF (Fig.9). This demonstrates that the interaction of GM-CSF with heparin at acidic pH does not inactivate the mitogenic activity of the growth factor. Heparin-like GAGs are known to stimulate the proliferative activity of GM-CSF (13Gallagher J.T. Dexter T.M. Baum S.J. Dicke K. Lotzova E. Plyznik D.H. Experimental Haematology Today. Springer, New York1988: 36-43Google Scholar, 15Alvarez-Silva M. Borojevic R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this work, we report that the interaction between GAGs and GM-CSF can be modulated by acidic pH. We propose that, in an acidic environment, GM-CSF undergoes a conformational transition that enables it to interact with GAGs, giving rise to a multimeric complex. Acid pH-induced conformational changes in GM-CSF were revealed both by a blue shift in the intrinsic fluorescence emission and by increased binding of the hydrophobic probe TNS (Figs. 1 and 6). Intrinsic fluorescence has previously been used to monitor pH-induced conformational changes of other growth factors, such as G-CSF (30Narhi L.O. Kenney W.C. Arakawa T. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 4: 359-367Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and FGF-I (25Pineda-Lucena A. Núñez de Castro I. Lozano R.M. Muñoz-Willery I. Zazo M. Giménez-Gallego G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For FGF-I at neutral pH, the fluorescence is dominated by tyrosine emission, since the emission of the single tryptophan residue is strongly quenched. At acidic pH, quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in FGF is relieved, resulting in an increase in fluorescence. The addition of heparin promoted a further fluorescence increase, which was accompanied by a blue shift of the maximal emission (25Pineda-Lucena A. Núñez de Castro I. Lozano R.M. Muñoz-Willery I. Zazo M. Giménez-Gallego G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of GM-CSF is dominated by tryptophan emission regardless of pH or of the presence of heparin (Fig. 1). Both pH acidification and heparin binding caused blue shifts of the fluorescence emission of GM-CSF (Fig. 1). Unlike changes in fluorescence intensity that may be related to quenching of tryptophan emission by interaction with neighboring amino acids, a spectral blue shift unambiguously reflects a decrease in the exposure of tryptophan residues to the aqueous medium. Conversely, a red shift would indicate an increase in solvent exposure, as generally observed upon protein denaturation (31Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The fact that both heparin binding and pH acidification promoted b"

Integrins are composed of one α subunit (17 varieties) and one β subunit (8 varieties) and associate non-covalently to form over 20 different αβ complexes. Both α and β subunits consist of a large extracellular domain, a membrane spanning sequence, and a cytoplasmic tail. A well characterized function of the integrins is to recognize and bind extracellular matrix proteins containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)1 sequence (the fibronectin cell adhesion motif), which is also found on the surfaces of a wide range of other extracellular matrix glycoproteins in all metazoans from marine sponges to mammals (1Müller W.E.G. Naturwissenschaften. 1998; 85: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One β1, β3, β5, or β6 subunit, in combination with one α subunit, can form an RGD-dependent receptor. In the β1 subunit, the recognition site for the RGD motif is located near the amino terminus. Most integrins that contain the β1 subunit must have additional binding sites since they recognize their ligands in an RGD-independent manner and bind to other protein motifs. For example, α4β1 binds the sequence Leu-Asp-Val in fibronectin and Ile-Asp-Ser-Pro in VCAM-1. Integrins α6β1 and α7β1are RGD-independent laminin receptors, and both α1β1 and α2β1integrins are RGD-independent collagen receptors. Their binding motifs are unknown. The α1 and α2 integrin subunits, and the recently identified α10 I-domain (2Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20383-20389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), differ in their structure from other β1-associated α subunits and have an additional ∼200 amino acids long “inserted” I-domain, which is homologous to the von Willebrand factor A domain (3Hughes A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 216-234PubMed Google Scholar). It is this I-domain in the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins that is responsible for the recognition of native collagen. The α2 I-domain also binds two other ligands, laminin-1 and echovirus-1, but the echovirus-1-binding site is distinct from the matrix protein site on the I-domain. Integrin α2β1 is the major collagen receptor of platelets and many cell types, such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts. It has been associated with various cellular functions, including migration on collagen, invasion through collagenous matrix, and reorganization of paracellular collagen fibers. In cancer biology, α2β1 integrin may be essential for metastasis by certain tumor cells. Several snake venoms contain disintegrin-like proteins, which block integrin function. Many of these disintegrins contain the RGD motif or a closely related motif and inhibit the function of αIIbβ3 or αVβ3integrins. Another toxin, jararhagin, from Bothrops jararaca, seems to inhibit adhesion to collagen (platelet aggregation) in an α2β1-dependent manner (4De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Kamiguti A.S. Markland F.S. Zhou Q. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D. Zuzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32599-32605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but uses a different mechanism. Jararhagin is a polyprotein containing a propeptide, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a cysteine-rich domain. The disintegrin-like domain does not contain the RGD motif, whereas it is replaced by Glu-Cys-Asp. The present hypothesis about jararhagin action suggests that it first binds to the α2 I-domain and then degrades the β1subunit (5Kamiguti A.S. Markland F.S. Zhou Q. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D. Zuzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32599-32605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The interaction between jararhagin and α2I-domain has never been shown directly, and the domain in jararhagin interacting with α2β1 integrin is not known. There is some evidence that the disintegrin domain of jararhagin, called jaracetin, as a dimer could alone inhibit platelet adhesion to collagen, but it seems to be a weaker inhibitor than jararhagin. Our attempts to show that the α2 I-domain binds to jaracetin or to disintegrin domain-derived peptides failed (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and therefore the putative interaction between the metalloproteinase domain and α2 I-domain became more interesting. Furthermore, in the snake venom, a part of jararhagin is normally degraded, and the metalloproteinase domain is dissociated from the disintegrin-like domain, suggesting that the metalloproteinase domain might have some independent functions. Based upon the prediction of surface loop regions along the metalloproteinase sequence, peptides were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of collagen binding to recombinant α2 I-domain (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Each of these peptides included a negatively charged residue, since it was suggested that an acidic residue would play the part of the sixth missing ligand to the bound metal of the MIDAS in the I-domains (7Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 8Bergelson J.M. Hemler M.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A nine-residue aspartate-containing peptide was obtained from the metalloproteinase that, when cyclized through the addition of terminal cysteines and oxidized to form a disulfide bond, was found to inhibit collagen binding to the α2 I-domain. Surprisingly, alanine replacement of individual residues of the peptide showed that the aspartate was not critical for binding, instead the sequence Arg-Lys-Lys-His was essential. Based on these results, a model of the jararhagin metalloproteinase was made and used as the basis for the design of a smaller peptide capable of stronger blocking of collagen binding to the I-domain. The stable conformation of this loop allowed us to predict the complementary characteristics on the surface of a model of the structure of the α2 I-domain (as the three-dimensional structure had not yet been reported) and to identify 5 negatively charged residues as potential sites of interaction with the “RKKH” peptides. Binding studies made with mutant α2 I-domains demonstrated that these five residues on the surface of the α2 I-domain surrounding the MIDAS are critical for ligand binding, whereas the removal of a short helix, suggested to be important for collagen binding and located along one side of the MIDAS, exerted no effects on peptide ligand binding. Recombinant α2 I-domain was produced as described earlier (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations were introduced into the α2 I-domain using the Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis kit, essentially following the manufacturer's instructions as follows: PCR primers having desired point mutations, indicated by the name of the mutant, were designed. PCR was then performed using thePfu polymerase (Stratagene), which at 68 °C makes exactly one copy of the whole GEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the α2 I-domain sequence. The PCR reaction was digested with DpnI, which only cuts methylated DNA (i.e. only the template is digested). In the mutant ΔαCα2I, amino acids 284–288 (GYLNR) were deleted by using PCR with specifically designed primers. In each case, the resulting GEX-2T having mutated α2 I-domain was transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α, and the construct was verified by sequencing the entire α2I-domain. For protein production, each construct was transformed intoE. coli strain BL21. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Protein purity and folding were checked in both native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The peptides were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 431A) using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethylcarbonyl) chemistry. After synthesis, peptides were oxidized to form disulfide bridges. The peptides (229ox, “CTRKKHDNAQC”; 248ox, “CTRKKHDC”), described earlier (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), were solubilized at 1 mg/ml concentration with 0.1m ammonium carbonate buffer and incubated for 16–24 h at 4 °C. The oxidation was checked by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the oxidized peptides were lyophilized. Biotinylation of the peptides was carried out as follows: lyophilized peptide was solubilized in PBS and 1/5 volume of 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0) was added to elevate the pH for biotinylation. Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Calbiochem) was added 1:2 (w/w) peptide:biotin and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by adding 1/10 volume 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The binding assays using biotinylated peptide were performed as described earlier (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well amine binding plates (Costar) were coated with recombinant α2 I-domain or mutant variants (1 mg/ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. 100 μm biotinylated 229ox or 248ox in PBS, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added at the indicated concentrations to the coated wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. For the studies involving anti-α2antibodies, 0.1 μg/ml antibodies (5E8, a kind gift from Dr. Bankert, Roswell Park Cancer Institute; 12F1 (10Pischel K.D. Hemler M.E. Huang C. Bluestein H.G. Woods Jr., V.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 226-233PubMed Google Scholar); Gi9 (11Santoro S.A. Walsh J.J. Staatz W.D. Baranski K.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) were added to the wells together with the biotinylated 229ox peptide at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. After incubation, wells were washed 6 times with PBS, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were again washed 6 times. Finally, 0.1 ml of Delfia enhancement solution (Wallac) was added to each well, and Europium signal was measured by fluorometry (model 1232 Delfia, Wallac). Three-dimensional structures were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (12Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., J.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8176) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were made with the programs MALIGN and MALFORM (13Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 716-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Johnson M.S. May A.C.W. Rodionov M.A. Overington J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 575-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the alignments, initial models (for review see Ref. 15Johnson M.S. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Blundell T.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 1-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) of both the metalloproteinase and the α2 I-domain were constructed using COMPOSER (16Sutcliffe M.J. Haneef I. Carney D. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1987; 5: 377-384Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 17Sutcliffe M.J. Hayes F.R. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1987; 5: 385-392Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18S̆ali A. Overington J.P. Johnson M.S. Blundell T.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 235-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (SYBYL 6.5, Tripos Associates, St. Louis). Final models were made with MODELLER 4.0 (a kind gift from Andrej Šali, Rockefeller University) (19S̆ali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10514) Google Scholar), which allowed us to incorporate additional constraints as follows: disulfide bonds, in the case of the metalloproteinase, and the published secondary structure, in the case of the α2 I-domain. Models built with COMPOSER were energy-minimized using the TRIPOS force field and the steepest descent method. Initially, each model's backbone was kept rigid, and only the side chains were allowed to move. Subsequently, all atoms were allowed to move, and energy minimization was performed until all short contacts and inconsistencies in geometry were rectified. The main purpose of this minimization was to remove steric hindrances and bad geometry. The conformational flexibility of the original cyclic peptide in the cyclic form was assessed using molecular dynamics simulations. The starting conformation of the peptide was taken from the metalloproteinase model structure; cysteines were added to each end, and a disulfide bond was created between them. Peptides derived from metalloproteinase were first minimized to remove atom-atom clashes and then further refined by molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations were performed in vacuum at 300 K and consisted of 20-ps equilibration followed by a 200-ps production run. The SHAKE algorithm from the SYBYL package was applied to constrain the lengths of all bonds between heavy atoms and hydrogen atoms. With the SHAKE algorithm we are able to use a longer 1-fs time step, instead of a 0.5-fs time step, thus achieving a longer production run for the same computational time. Electrostatics were excluded, because small peptides tend to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds to make the structure globular, especially when many charged residues are present within a peptide. All calculations were made using SYBYL and the TRIPOS force field on a Silicon Graphics Onyx II workstation. The essential chemical interactions in the α2 I-domain binding site were mapped using the program GRID version 16 (20Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). GRID calculates energies of interaction between a probe and the receptor. In the calculation, the probe that mimics a chemical group is placed at different positions throughout the binding site, and the receptor side chains are allowed to move to minimize the interaction energy (using the side chain flexibility option in GRID). The GRID maps were visualized using the program CERIUS 2 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego) and GRASP (21Nichols A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). The program Autodock 2.4 (22Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 23Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 347: 293-304Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar) was used to both flexibly (allowing rotation of up to 25 torsion angles) and rigidly dock the 248ox peptide to the crystal structure of α2 I-domain. Autodock combines Monte Carlo-simulated annealing for conformational searching with a rapid, atomic resolution, grid-based method of energy evaluation utilizing the AMBER force field (24Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar, 25Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.-M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11553) Google Scholar). Standard AMBER parameters for Mg2+ were added to the default Autodock parameter set. A distance-dependent dielectric constant was used to account for the solvent screening effects. The interaction of a probe group (corresponding to each type of atom in the ligand) with receptor model was calculated at grid positions 0.3 Å apart in a 30-Å3box centered at the binding site using the program Autogrid (23Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 347: 293-304Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Fifty separate docking simulations were performed; for each simulation there were 100 constant temperature cycles with 15,000 steps accepted or rejected. The initial value of RT (the gas constant times the absolute temperature) was set equal to 300 cal/mol and was reduced by a factor of 0.95 in each cycle. The maximal torsional rotation and molecular center translation steps were 15° and 0.2 Å, respectively, and they were reduced by a factor of 0.99 in each cycle. In this way, over 70 million different conformations were studied for the “rigid” and the “flexible” peptide. Representative alternative modes of binding were identified using cluster analysis of the 50 docked structures from the flexible and rigid docking simulations. A 2.0-Å cut-off value of the root mean square deviation calculated over all atoms in the 248ox peptide was used to define a new cluster. The computer program GOLD (26Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5365) Google Scholar) was used as a second method to produce alternate binding modes for the 248ox-α2I-domain complex. GOLD allows full ligand flexibility and partial protein flexibility. The energy functions in GOLD are based partly on experimental information about hydrogen bond geometries taken from the IsoStar data base (27Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). The program exploits the observed distributions of torsional angles seen in the Cambridge Structural Data Base to search the conformational space available to the ligand. GOLD also considers the fundamental requirement that the ligand must displace loosely bound water on binding. A genetic algorithm is used to search the conformational space. Twenty separate dockings were made within a 17-Å radius sphere centered at the Mg2+ at the MIDAS using the default genetic algorithm parameters. The docked conformations produced with Autodock and GOLD were visually inspected to identify similarities in the predicted binding modes produced by each method. The similar binding modes were then superimposed onto the GRID maps. The 248ox conformations produced with both programs that best fitted the affinity surfaces calculated with GRID were chosen as the representative ones. Autodock and GOLD were run on computers at the Center for Scientific Computing, Espoo, Finland. The results were visualized using the programs CERIUS 2, GRASP, SYBYL and gOpenMol (28Laaksonen L. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 29Bergman D.L. Laaksonen L. Laaksonen A. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). With the knowledge that we had identified a peptide from the metalloproteinase of jararhagin capable of blocking collagen binding to the α2 I-domain (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we sought here to characterize the interactions between the peptide and the I-domain. In this respect we 1) modeled the metalloproteinase domain of jararhagin; 2) identified the location and conformation of the peptide 229ox on the metalloproteinase model structure; 3) used computer simulations to suggest alterations to the original cyclic 9-residue RKKH peptide that would lead to a tighter binding peptide; 4) modeled the α2 I-domain structure to help identify the likely site of interaction between the metalloproteinase and derived peptides with the I-domain; 5) used function blocking antibodies to provide general support for the predicted sites of interaction proposed by the modeling results; 6) used site-directed mutagenesis of key residues to demonstrate in binding studies that 5 negatively charged residues are important for binding the positively charged peptides from the jararhagin metalloproteinase; 7) and, as described under “Discussion,” we used computational chemistry to dock the α2 I-domain with the RKKH peptide and the metalloproteinase of jararhagin. A three-dimensional model of the structure of the zinc metalloproteinase domain of jararhagin was constructed based on homology of the jararhagin metalloproteinase sequence (SwissProt code: DISJ_BOTJA, (30Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) with the 2.0-Å resolution structure of another snake toxin zinc metalloproteinase, the collagenase adamalysin II from the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake Crotalus adamanteus(Brookhaven Protein Data Bank code 1IAG (31Gomis-Rüth F.X. Kress L.F. Bode W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)). The adamalysin II structure consists of a single twisted sheet of five β-strands, surrounded by five α-helices, for 201 of the total 202 amino acids in the processed proteinase; residue 1, a pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, is not present in the structure. The catalytic glutamic acid, Glu143 (numbered according to the structure coordinate file; Fig. 1), is located within a cluster of residues that include the three histidine ligands (His142, His146, and His152) of the essential zinc metal bound at the active site. In addition, adamalysin II has 4 cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds between Cys117 and Cys197, and Cys157 and Cys164. The sequence alignment of the two snake venom metalloproteinase domains is shown in Fig. 1 along with the secondary structure assignments made from the x-ray structure of adamalysin II; these proteins share approximately 50% sequence identity, and there are no insertions or deletions present in the alignment. The 201-residue-long model begins with residue Tyr155 (residue numbering begins with the first residue of the pro-proteinase sequence), the fifth residue in the putative processed protein, and continues until the carboxyl-terminal position Pro355. The key catalytic glutamate (Glu296 in the jararhagin metalloproteinase) and the three ligands of the bound zinc (His295, His299, and His305), common to the snake venom metalloproteinases, are completely conserved in the alignment with jararhagin (Fig. 2). In addition, the jararhagin metalloproteinase sequence contains 7 cysteine residues lying within the carboxyl-terminal half of the metalloproteinase; Cys270 and Cys350, and Cys310 and Cys317 align with the disulfide-bonded pairs seen in the adamalysin II metalloproteinase structure, but there are no cysteines in adamalysin II corresponding to the additional Cys312, Cys334, and Cys339 seen in the jararhagin metalloproteinase sequence (Fig. 1). Cys312 and Cys334 are close enough to each other in space in our preliminary models that they could easily form a disulfide bond, and this is included in the final model. The remaining Cys339is not located on the surface of the metalloproteinase model but lies on the inner buried surface of carboxyl-terminal helix E and is unlikely to participate in forming a disulfide bond. Given the very high level of sequence identity and the additional constraints provided by the three disulfide cross-links, the model of the metalloproteinase domain should be quite close to the authentic three-dimensional structure of the jararhagin metalloproteinase. The model of the jararhagin metalloproteinase pinpointed the location of the sequence TRKKHDNAQ contained within the peptide 229ox that was shown to block collagen binding to the α2 I-domain (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Peptide 229ox has, in addition to this sequence of 9 residues from jararhagin, a cysteine at each end, and oxidation to form the cyclized peptide was shown to be required to block collagen binding to the α2 I-domain; the reduced linear peptide did not block collagen binding (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Arg242-Lys243-Lys244-His245motif of the peptide is a distinct feature on the surface of the metalloproteinase next to the Ca2+-binding site, is distant from the active site, and forms a solvent-exposed loop connecting α-helix C to the following β-strand 3 (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, the aspartate used as one criteria for selection of the peptide, given reports that an acidic residue binding to the MIDAS might be generally important (7Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 8Bergelson J.M. Hemler M.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was in fact a ligand of the bound Ca2+ in the rattlesnake metalloproteinase structure (31Gomis-Rüth F.X. Kress L.F. Bode W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and is shielded from the solvent (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, alanine replacement of the aspartate (in the peptide derived from the jararhagin metalloproteinase) led to no change in the ability of the cyclic peptide to block collagen binding in comparison with the original peptide (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alanine replacement of all other residues within the peptide did demonstrate, however, that the three surface-exposed positively charged residues (Fig. 2 B) of the Arg-Lys-Lys-His motif are essential for binding to the α2 I-domain (6Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffrén A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2009397884,"BRCA1 is the first tumor suppressor gene linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Its involvement in sporadic breast cancer, however, remains unclear. Recent studies showed that a loss or lowered expression of BRCA1 is not uncommon in nonfamilial breast cancers. In addition, there have been cases of inherited BRCA1-linked breast cancer with as yet unidentified mutation. Misregulation of BRCA1 at the transcription level is a possible mechanism for loss of BRCA1 expression. To understand transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1 gene, we cloned and examined the BRCA1 promoter, by both functional reporter gene analyses and protein-DNA complex formation electrophorectic mobility shift assays. A bi-directional promoter could be located within a 229-base pair (bp) intergenic region between BRCA1and its neighboring gene, NBR2. Deletion analyses further delineated a minimal 56-bp EcoRI-HaeIII fragment, which could drive transcription in the NBR2 gene direction 2–4-fold higher than in the BRCA1 direction in all cell lines tested. Furthermore, transcriptional activity in theBRCA1 direction was undetectable in the muscle cell line C2C12, whereas activity in the NBR2 direction was maintained. These results were consistent with the expression pattern of the respective genes. A specific protein-DNA complex was detected when nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and Caco2, a colon cell line, were incubated with the 56-bp minimal promoter. This protein binding activity was further localized to an 18-bp fragment and might involve a tissue-specific factor, because binding was not detected in the C2C12 cell line. The correlation of the detection of this protein-DNA complex only in those cell lines that expressed the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in the BRCA1 direction suggests a significant positive role of this complex in the transcription of the BRCA1 gene."

In earlier studies these two virus types have been shown to directly interact, with AAV inhibiting or enhancing papillomavirus functions depending upon the specific circumstances. One defined interaction between these two viruses is the ability of the AAV Rep78 major regulatory protein to inhibit gene expression of the E6 promoter of BPV-1 (bovine papillomavirus type 1) and HPV types 16 and 18. As Rep78 is a DNA binding transcription factor, we considered whether Rep78 might bind HPV-16 DNA. Here, Rep78 is demonstrated to bind a 44-base pair region (nucleotides 14–56) within the HPV-16 p97 promoter using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This region is important for HPV-16 because it includes functional Sp1 and E2 protein binding motifs as well as part of the origin of replication. Furthermore, two Rep78 amino acid substitution mutants, at positions 77 or 64–65, were identified that did not recognize p97 DNA. Both of these Rep78 mutants were found to be defective for inhibition of p97 promoter activity in HeLa and T-47D nuclear extracts in vitro, in a transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, as well as defective for full inhibition of HPV-16-directed focus formation. These data, taken together, strongly suggest that the Rep78-p97 promoter interaction is at least partially responsible for Rep78-mediated inhibition of HPV-16. Finally, the finding that Rep78 specifically recognizes p97 DNA is surprising because the p97 promoter region contains no GAGC motifs, the core motif for Rep78 recognition. These data suggest that the p97 promoter may represent a new prototypical DNA target type for Rep78.

Here, it is demonstrated that the favored site for Rep78 binding within the HPV-16 genome was a region within the p97 promoter of the long control region (LCR), from nt 14 to 58. These findings are surprising because the p97 target sequence contains no GAGC (or GCTC) motifs, the core sequence of almost all Rep78 DNA recognitions. Furthermore, Rep78 mutants that are unable to bind DNA are also defective in their ability to fully inhibit HPV-16 (pL67R)-induced oncogenic transformation, demonstrating the importance of the Rep78-p97 DNA interaction.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the AAV Rep78 protein meaningfully binds to the p97 promoter of HPV-16. This binding, although not as strong as Rep78-AAV TR interaction, is clearly above the so-called “nonspecific” DNA-binding ability of Rep78 as determined by the experiments presented in Fig. 1. The importance of this interaction is supported by the finding that two AAV mutants (FLAG-64LH65TM and FLAG-77LG) in which the Rep78 proteins are unable to recognize the HPV-16 LCR p97 target are defective for in vitro transcriptional inhibition of p97 and for the inhibition of HPV-16 directed oncogenic transformation. It should also be noted that Rep78 is unable to significantly affect expression from the MSV-LTR (18Hermonat P.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3373-3377PubMed Google Scholar) and that Rep78 is also unable to bind the partial (33Batchu R.B. Kotin R.M. Hermonat P.L.

Virol. 1998; 1: 441-450PubMed Google Scholar) or the full-length sequence of this promoter (Fig. 1 B). How the binding of Rep78 to p97 promoter DNA specifically affects HPV-16 expression is not known. As this region contains active Sp1 (52Gloss B. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5577-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and E2 (54Androphy E.J. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 55Moskaluk C. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1826-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) motifs, one mechanistic possibility might be that Rep78, while bound to p97, sterically inhibits these other transcription factors from binding. This hypothesis can be tested. It should be pointed out that Rep78 inhibition of pL67R gene expression cannot involve E2 because E2 is not present in this experiment. Another possibility might be that Rep78, by binding to p97, puts Rep78 in a favorable position to interact with other transcription factors that are also binding to the promoter DNA or other proteins within the transcription initiation complex. Yet a third possibility may be that by binding DNA an inhibitory domain of Rep78 is down-regulated. Rep78 is known to bind a variety of cellular proteins (36Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Carter C.A. Parham G.P. Quirk J.G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 403: 409-420Google Scholar), including Sp1 (37Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Batchu R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5299-5304PubMed Google Scholar), TBP (39Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Batchu R.B. Zhan D.-J. Virology. 1998; 245: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and TAFIIp110. 2D.-J. Zhan and P. L. Hermonat, unpublished observations.One previous relevant study undertaken by Horer et al. (14Horer M. Weger S. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Geisen C. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5485-5496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) attempted to identify the cis-responsible element within the analogous p105 promoter of HPV-18 (14Horer M. Weger S. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Geisen C. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5485-5496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their results, obtained by the deletion and mutation of sequences along the length of the p105 promoter, were inconclusive for finding a specific responsible element. Their interpretation of this data was that the mechanism of inhibition was complex and involved multiple components. Our data may suggest such complexity, for although the phenotypes of mutants Rep-64LH65TM and Rep-77LG are quite strong in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, it is also clear that they are still able to mildly inhibit oncogenic transformation (Fig. 7; only small foci were generated). It is reasonable to suggest that Rep78 protein-protein interactions may also be involved in these other inhibitory pathways. In addition to the ability of Rep78 to meaningfully interact with transcription factors, in preliminary experiments we have also been able to observe Rep78-E7 oncoprotein interaction using Western blot, affinity chromography, and yeast GAL4 two-hybrid cDNA analyses.2Our finding that Rep78 binds HPV-16 p97 is mildly surprising because this target sequence contains no GAGC motifs, the core sequence of most Rep78 DNA recognitions. Rep78 binding to promoter sequences has been observed previously, including in the AAV p5 promoter (32McCarty D.M. Pereira D.J. Zolotukhin I. Zhou X. Ryan J.H. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1994; 74: 4988-4997Crossref Google Scholar), the c-H-ras promoter (33Batchu R.B. Kotin R.M. Hermonat P.L. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat TAR region (50Batchu R.B. Hermonat P.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 51Kokorina N.A. Santin A.D. Li C. Hermonat P.L. J. Hum. Virol. 1998; 1: 441-450PubMed Google Scholar), and the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (34Wonderling R.S. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 71: 2528-2534Crossref Google Scholar). All of these promoters have GAGC (or GCTC) motifs, and binding by the large Rep proteins (78/68) appears to be required for the inhibition of the AAV p5 promoter (56Kyostio S.R. Wonderling R.S. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6787-6796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the HIV-LTR (51Kokorina N.A. Santin A.D. Li C. Hermonat P.L. J. Hum. Virol. 1998; 1: 441-450PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments using Rep78 affinity selection of random DNA sequences, the consensus target sequence contained a duplex GAGC motif (57Chiorini J.A. Yang L. Safer B. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7334-7338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However a small subset of these selected sequences had no GAGC motifs. Thus, there is a precedent for Rep78 binding DNA without GAGC motifs. However, none of these sequences have significant homology with p97. Furthermore, none of the random selected sequences contain interrupted palindromes such as are present in p97. As we have also observed that Rep78 binds a region within the BPV-1 LCR, which contains two E2 motifs, we suspect that these motifs are the specific target for Rep78 recognition. The AAV TRs, the natural and favored substrate of Rep78, also have significant secondary structure; we believe this further strengthens the argument that such structures (E2 or otherwise) are possibly involved in Rep78 recognition of p97. However, the phenotype of Rep-77LG suggests that Rep78 recognition of AAV TR DNA is different from its recognition of p97. The finding that Rep78 specifically recognizes the negative strand of the p97 promoter is novel (Fig. 3). These data further indicate that Rep78 discriminates between single-stranded DNA substrates, by sequence, as it does for double-stranded substrates. Finally, Rep78 binding to p97 may also inhibit the E1-E2 complex from binding the origin of replication that is located just upstream (35Sarafi T.R. McBride A.A. Virology. 1995; 211: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 58Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1996; 15 (, 1996): 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 59Yasugi T. Benson J.D.

Virology. 1992; 189: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This study extends our knowledge of how AAV and papillomaviruses interact and will help to further reveal the mechanism of action of Rep78 regulation on gene expression. Infection and DNA integration by certain human papillomavirus types (HPV)1 are central events in the generation of cervical cancer (1Durst M. Gissman L. Ikenberg H. zur Hausen H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Because Rep78 is a DNA binding transcription factor, we considered whether Rep78 might bind to HPV-16 DNA and investigated the importance of this interaction by using Rep78 mutants in DNA binding. Here, it is demonstrated that the favored site for Rep78 binding within the HPV-16 genome was a region within the p97 promoter of the long control region (LCR), from nt 14 to 58. These findings are surprising because the p97 target sequence contains no GAGC (or GCTC) motifs, the core sequence of almost all Rep78 DNA recognitions. Furthermore, Rep78 mutants that are unable to bind DNA are also defective in their ability to fully inhibit HPV-16 (pL67R)-induced oncogenic transformation, demonstrating the importance of the Rep78-p97 DNA interaction. DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the AAV Rep78 protein meaningfully binds to the p97 promoter of HPV-16. This binding, although not as strong as Rep78-AAV TR interaction, is clearly above the so-called “nonspecific” DNA-binding ability of Rep78 as determined by the experiments presented in Fig. 1. The importance of this interaction is supported by the finding that two AAV mutants (FLAG-64LH65TM and FLAG-77LG) in which the Rep78 proteins are unable to recognize the HPV-16 LCR p97 target are defective for in vitro transcriptional inhibition of p97 and for the inhibition of HPV-16 directed oncogenic transformation. It should also be noted that Rep78 is unable to significantly affect expression from the MSV-LTR (18Hermonat P.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3373-3377PubMed Google Scholar) and that Rep78 is also unable to bind the partial (33Batchu R.B. Kotin R.M. Hermonat P.L. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 51Kokorina N.A. Santin A.D. Li C. Hermonat P.L. J. Hum. Virol. 1998; 1: 441-450PubMed Google Scholar) or the full-length sequence of this promoter (Fig. 1 B). How the binding of Rep78 to p97 promoter DNA specifically affects HPV-16 expression is not known. As this region contains active Sp1 (52Gloss B. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5577-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and E2 (54Androphy E.J. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 55Moskaluk C. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1826-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) motifs, one mechanistic possibility might be that Rep78, while bound to p97, sterically inhibits these other transcription factors from binding. This hypothesis can be tested. It should be pointed out that Rep78 inhibition of pL67R gene expression cannot involve E2 because E2 is not present in this experiment. Another possibility might be that Rep78, by binding to p97, puts Rep78 in a favorable position to interact with other transcription factors that are also binding to the promoter DNA or other proteins within the transcription initiation complex. Yet a third possibility may be that by binding DNA an inhibitory domain of Rep78 is down-regulated. Rep78 is known to bind a variety of cellular proteins (36Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Carter C.A. Parham G.P. Quirk J.G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 403: 409-420Google Scholar), including Sp1 (37Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Batchu R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5299-5304PubMed Google Scholar), TBP (39Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Batchu R.B. Zhan D.-J. Virology. 1998; 245: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and TAFIIp110. 2D.-J. Zhan and P. L. Hermonat, unpublished observations.One previous relevant study undertaken by Horer et al. (14Horer M. Weger S. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Geisen C. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5485-5496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) attempted to identify the cis-responsible element within the analogous p105 promoter of HPV-18 (14Horer M. Weger S. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Geisen C. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5485-5496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their results, obtained by the deletion and mutation of sequences along the length of the p105 promoter, were inconclusive for finding a specific responsible element. Their interpretation of this data was that the mechanism of inhibition was complex and involved multiple components. Our data may suggest such complexity, for although the phenotypes of mutants Rep-64LH65TM and Rep-77LG are quite strong in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, it is also clear that they are still able to mildly inhibit oncogenic transformation (Fig. 7; only small foci were generated). It is reasonable to suggest that Rep78 protein-protein interactions may also be involved in these other inhibitory pathways. In addition to the ability of Rep78 to meaningfully interact with transcription factors, in preliminary experiments we have also been able to observe Rep78-E7 oncoprotein interaction using Western blot, affinity chromography, and yeast GAL4 two-hybrid cDNA analyses.2Our finding that Rep78 binds HPV-16 p97 is mildly surprising because this target sequence contains no GAGC motifs, the core sequence of most Rep78 DNA recognitions. Rep78 binding to promoter sequences has been observed previously, including in the AAV p5 promoter (32McCarty D.M. Pereira D.J. Zolotukhin I. Zhou X. Ryan J.H. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1994; 74: 4988-4997Crossref Google Scholar), the c-H-ras promoter (33Batchu R.B. Kotin R.M. Hermonat P.L. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat TAR region (50Batchu R.B. Hermonat P.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 51Kokorina N.A. Santin A.D. Li C. Hermonat P.L. J. Hum. Virol. 1998; 1: 441-450PubMed Google Scholar), and the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (34Wonderling R.S. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 71: 2528-2534Crossref Google Scholar). All of these promoters have GAGC (or GCTC) motifs, and binding by the large Rep proteins (78/68) appears to be required for the inhibition of the AAV p5 promoter (56Kyostio S.R. Wonderling R.S. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6787-6796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the HIV-LTR (51Kokorina N.A. Santin A.D. Li C. Hermonat P.L. J. Hum. Virol. 1998; 1: 441-450PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments using Rep78 affinity selection of random DNA sequences, the consensus target sequence contained a duplex GAGC motif (57Chiorini J.A. Yang L. Safer B. Kotin R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7334-7338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However a small subset of these selected sequences had no GAGC motifs. Thus, there is a precedent for Rep78 binding DNA without GAGC motifs. However, none of these sequences have significant homology with p97. Furthermore, none of the random selected sequences contain interrupted palindromes such as are present in p97. As we have also observed that Rep78 binds a region within the BPV-1 LCR, which contains two E2 motifs, we suspect that these motifs are the specific target for Rep78 recognition. The AAV TRs, the natural and favored substrate of Rep78, also have significant secondary structure; we believe this further strengthens the argument that such structures (E2 or otherwise) are possibly involved in Rep78 recognition of p97. However, the phenotype of Rep-77LG suggests that Rep78 recognition of AAV TR DNA is different from its recognition of p97. The finding that Rep78 specifically recognizes the negative strand of the p97 promoter is novel (Fig. 3). These data further indicate that Rep78 discriminates between single-stranded DNA substrates, by sequence, as it does for double-stranded substrates. Finally, Rep78 binding to p97 may also inhibit the E1-E2 complex from binding the origin of replication that is located just upstream (35Sarafi T.R. McBride A.A. Virology. 1995; 211: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 58Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1996; 15 (, 1996): 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 59Yasugi T. Benson J.D.

In this study, we have demonstrated that the neuron-specific, calcium-binding protein, visinin-like protein (VILIP) contains one double-stranded RNA-binding domain, a protein motif conserved among many double-stranded RNA-binding proteins. We showed that VILIP can specifically bind double-stranded RNA, and this interaction specifically requires the presence of calcium. Mobility shift studies indicated that VILIP binds double-stranded RNA as a single protein-RNA complex with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 9.0 × 10−6m. To our knowledge, VILIP is the first double-stranded RNA-binding protein shown to be calcium-dependent. Furthermore, VILIP specifically binds the 3′-untranslated region of the neurotrophin receptor, trkB, an mRNA localized to hippocampal dendrites in an activity-dependent manner. Given that VILIP is also expressed in the hippocampus, these data suggest that VILIP may employ a novel, calcium-dependent mechanism to regulate its binding to important localized mRNAs in the central nervous system.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). By comparing the amino acid sequences of different RNA-binding proteins, several classes of protein domains have been identified that mediate the RNA-protein interaction. One class of RNA-binding proteins specifically recognizes the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)1 A-form helix through a conserved motif called the dsRNA-binding domain (3St. Johnson D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). As opposed to the sequence-specificity of DNA-protein binding, which results from interactions with the DNA major groove and sugar-phosphate backbone, recognition of dsRNA often shows no sequence specificity. Rather, dsRNA-binding proteins recognize elements within the dsRNA minor groove, single-stranded RNA loops, and through tertiary interactions with different regions of the RNA molecule, thereby leading to a greater variety of binding possibilities for RNA-protein recognition (1Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Steitz T.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World.

Proteins with the dsRNA-binding domain have a wide range of expression and a diverse array of essential biological functions. For example, staufen, a protein required for localization of mRNAs during Drosophila development, contains three full-length dsRNA-binding domains (Type 1) and two truncated C-terminal domains (Type 2) (3St. Johnson D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Type 1 and Type 2 dsRNA-binding domains are also found in human interferon-induced dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which is activated during viral infections and has antiviral and antiproliferative properties (6Patel R.C.

In addition, dsRNA-binding domains have been found in proteins isolated from Xenopus oocytes, viral-encoded proteins, and bacterial RNase III (3St. Johnson D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 10Ahn B.Y. Gershon P.D. Jones E.V. Moss B. Mol. Cell.

In neurons of the central nervous system, the asymmetric distribution of specific proteins in response to extracellular signals can occur through the subcellular localization of the protein's cognate mRNA (for review, see Ref. 12Gao F.B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a way to identify RNA-binding proteins that may be involved in the localization of neuronal mRNAs, we used PCR amplification of brain-derived cDNA with degenerative primers directed to conserved regions of the dsRNA-binding domain. Using this approach, we identified a dsRNA-binding domain in the neuron-specific member of the Ca2+-binding EF-hand proteins, visinin-like protein (VILIP) and demonstrated that it specifically binds dsRNA in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In the hippocampus, one localized mRNA encodes the high affinity neurotrophin receptor, trkB, which is localized to the dendrites in response to increased neuronal activity (13Tongiori E. Righi M. Cattaneo A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9492-9505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our studies demonstrated that Ca2+ induces VILIP to bind to a specific region of the trkB mRNA. These studies suggest that VILIP can interact with important localized mRNA in neurons of the central nervous system and may be regulated by the intracellular availability of Ca2+. Total brain RNA was isolated using Trizol™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's directions and converted into cDNA using oligo(dT) as a primer and AMV reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR amplifications were performed using 3 μm dsR-1 and dsR-2 degenerate primers for 30 cycles with 0.6 °C/sec ramp speeds for 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The dsR-1 and dsR-2 primers were directed to the conserved regions of the dsRNA-binding domain as indicated in Scheme 1 in the Dmstau-1 dsRNA-binding domain (also see Fig. 1 B). The sequence and degenerate positions of dsR-1 and dsR-2 are indicated in Scheme 2.Figure 1VILIP contains one RNA-binding domain.

Positive clones were plaque-purified, converted to plasmid DNA using ExAssist™/SOLR system™ (Stratagene) (14Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and sequenced at the Cleveland Clinic Molecular Biotechnology Core. BLASTN version 2.0.3 was used to search the nonredundant GenBankTM data base. Clustal method (PAM 100) of the DNAStar software version 3.05 was used to align the dsRNA domains. The coding region of VILIP was cloned into the pQE32 expression vector as an N-terminal-tagged 6xHis fusion protein (pMhis-VILIP) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain M15. Expression of the 6xHis-VILIP fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in mid-log bacterial cultures. Before induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, an aliquot was removed from the bacterial culture to use as the uninduced crude extract control. Cells were isolated by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Purification of recombinant VILIP used nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography per the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen). RNA binding assays were performed as described previously with modifications (3St. Johnson D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA agarose affinity-purified VILIP was electrophoresed on 15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and electro-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes with transferred proteins were denatured in 8 m urea for 1 h and renaturated by a series of 10 washes that were 2:3 dilutions of the previous wash. Dilutions were with TBS (20 mm Tris base, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 44 mm HCl, and either 10 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA). After blocking for 1 h (25 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 10 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA), 32P-labeled RNA was allowed to bind for 4 h at 25 °C in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% nonfat dry milk, and 10 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA) at 1× 106 cpm/ml. The membranes were washed with three changes of binding buffer, 10 min each, dried, exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak), and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Poly(I-C) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was digested with RNase T & A (Ambion, Austin TX), ethanol precipitated, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Poly C was also end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, except the RNase digestion was omitted. The mobility gel shift assay was adapted from Bass et al. (15Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled poly(I-C) were electrophoresed, and appropriately sized fragments were eluted from nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Single-stranded RNA was prepared by boiling 32P-labeled, gel-eluted poly(I-C) for 10 min and transferring immediately to ice. Known concentrations of recombinant VILIP were allowed to bind either poly(I-C) or single-stranded RNA (∼2.0 × 104 cpm/sample) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm KCl, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and either 100 mm CaCl2or 100 mm MgCl2, for 20 min at 25 °C. Resulting binding reactions were run on a 20-cm 4% polyacrylamide in 1× TB (100 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 100 mm boric acid) without sample buffer at 150 volts. Gels were dried and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak). Bound and unbound dsRNA were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (the protein concentration at which half the free dsRNA is bound) was calculated as described previously (15Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) by plotting the fraction bound (dsRNA-VILIP complex radioactivity/dsRNA-VILIP complex radioactivity + free dsRNA fraction radioactivity) versus protein concentration. DNA templates used to synthesize trkB mRNAs were prepared by PCR amplification using the trkB cDNA (ATCC number 63055) and primers directed to the entire trkB cDNA, trkB 3′-UTR, or trkB coding region. Each 5′ and 3′ primer was flanked by either the promoter sequences for the bacteriophage T3 (5′-GCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) or T7 (5′-CTTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) enzymes. The resulting amplification product was gel eluted and used directly for RNA synthesis using the Maxiscript transcription system (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's directions. The synthesized RNA was then incubated at 98 °C for 10 min in 250 mm KCl, followed by slowly cooling to room temperature to ensure RNA base pairing (17Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.-L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To generate a PCR probe that could be used to identify a dsRNA-binding protein from the central nervous system, RNA isolated from P20 rat brains was converted into cDNA and used as a template for degenerate primers directed to the 5′ and 3′ most conserved regions of the Drosophila staufen dsRNA-binding domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). To avoid excessive degeneracy, primers were designed that took into account mammalian codon utilization (18Lathe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A PCR product was generated and cloned that corresponded in size with a dsRNA-binding domain. Sequencing of the clone revealed a similarity with the dsRNA-binding domain (data not shown). A mouse cDNA library from P20 brains was screened with32P-labeled PCR insert and two cDNA clones were identified that both contained the same open reading frame that encoded a peptide of 22,140-kDa (Fig.1 A). Screening the National Institutes of Health nonredundant data base identified the coding region as visinin-like protein (VILIP) (GenBankTM accession number D21165) (19Kuno T. Kajimoto Y. Hashimoto T. Mukai H. Shirai Y. Saheki S. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Lenz S.E. Henschel Y. Zopf D. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). VILIP is a neural Ca2+-binding protein (NCaPs) that belongs to the superfamily of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (19Kuno T. Kajimoto Y. Hashimoto T. Mukai H. Shirai Y. Saheki S. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a member of the NCaPs family, VILIP contains four canonical EF-hand binding domains (sites I, II, III, and IV) that span amino acid residues 25–56, 66–92, 100–127, and 150–178, (Fig. 1 A) (20Lenz S.E. Henschel Y. Zopf D. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To identify putative dsRNA-binding domains in VILIP, a sequence comparison of the VILIP amino acid sequence with the dsRNA-binding domains of a number of dsRNA-binding proteins was performed. A single region in VILIP spanning amino acid residues 110 to 182 was found to be similar to both the Type 1 (full-length) and Type 2 (C-terminal) dsRNA-binding domains (Fig. 1 A). The average amino acid similarity of the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain to other Type 1 dsRNA-binding domains was only 11%, compared with an average 28.6% similarity among all the dsRNA-binding proteins analyzed (Fig.1 B). When comparing the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain to other Type 2 dsRNA-binding domains the average amino acid similarity is 12.8%, whereas the overall similarity among the Type 2 domains analyzed was 17.9% (Fig. 1 C). The level of similarity of the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain with other dsRNA-binding domains is not particularly high, yet important amino acid similarities were identified in key positions that are conserved among all dsRNA-binding domains (Fig. 1, B andC). For example, a pair of alanines found in all Type 1 and 2 dsRNA-binding domains is conserved in the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain (VILIP amino acid positions 174 and 175). There is also conservation of specific valine and threonine residues (VILIP positions 119 and 146, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that VILIP dsRNA-binding domain is similar to the dsRNA-binding domain at the most conserved residues. Because of the low level of homology of the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain to other dsRNA-binding domains, it was important to determine whether the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain was functional. Recombinant VILIP protein was expressed and purified from E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis shows that after purification, the recombinant VILIP is the only detectable peptide (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether VILIP binds to dsRNA, a Northwestern RNA-binding analysis was performed. Crude uninduced extract and purified recombinant VILIP were electrophoresed and transferred to membranes. The membrane-bound proteins were then denatured, slowly renatured, and allowed to bind 32P-labeled dsRNA (poly(I-C)) or single-stranded RNA (poly(C)). Initially, Northwestern analysis showed very low levels of RNA binding to VILIP. However, EF-hand proteins undergo conformational transitions upon binding with Ca2+ that often increase their α helical content, a conformation conducive for binding dsRNA (21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; : 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 22Johnson W.C. Palczewski K. Gorczyca W.A. Riazance-Lawrence J.H. Witkowska D. Polans A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Tan R.Y. Mabuchi Y. Grabarek Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7479-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that Ca2+ may be required by VILIP to assume a secondary structure that would allow dsRNA binding. Upon the addition of Ca2+ to the renaturing step of the Northwestern assay, VILIP bound dsRNA although there was no binding in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 2 B). VILIP binding of RNA was specific for dsRNA, because single-stranded poly(C) did not bind to VILIP in conditions with or without Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). There was no detectable binding of dsRNA in crude extracts from cells that were not induced to express recombinant VILIP. During Northwestern binding assays, membrane-bound VILIP is denatured then renatured in either the presence or absence of Ca2+ and subsequently allowed to bind dsRNA. Upon binding of Ca2+, VILIP undergoes specific conformational changes (24Cox J.A. Durussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to determine whether the conformational change in native VILIP induced by Ca2+-binding is accompanied by the ability to bind dsRNA. VILIP was renatured under Ca2+-free conditions and then allowed to bind 32P-labeled dsRNA in the presence of Ca2+. VILIP bound dsRNA when Ca2+ was added during dsRNA binding at levels comparable to when Ca2+ was added earlier during renaturation (Fig.3). Therefore, Ca2+-binding can activate native Ca2+-free VILIP in such a way that it assumes a conformation that allows binding of dsRNA. To further characterize dsRNA binding by VILIP, mobility shift analysis was performed. Increasing amounts of VILIP were allowed to bind to a constant concentration of size-fractionated32P-labeled dsRNA in the presence of Ca2+. The resulting VILIP-dsRNA complexes were analyzed on native polyacrylamide gels. Starting at a VILIP protein concentration of 100 ng/μl, a single large dsRNA-protein complex was observed binding to a 200-bp dsRNA (Fig. 4 A). By 500 ng/μl of VILIP, no unbound dsRNA was detected. Increasing amounts of VILIP caused a further increase of the dsRNA-protein complex signal but produced no additional complexes. Quantification of 32P-labeled dsRNA in VILIP bound and unbound fractions allowed calculation of an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) of 9.0 × 10−6m (Fig. 4 B). In marked contrast, there was no VILIP binding to a 50-bp dsRNA and only low level binding to a 100-bp dsRNA indicating that VILIP requires dsRNA at least 200-bp long for efficient binding (Fig. 4, C andD). Similar experiments using in vitrosynthesized RNA of various lengths also demonstrated VILIP's dependence on RNA length for binding (data not shown). Finally, the VILIP-dsRNA complex did not form with single-stranded RNA, because there was no shift when the dsRNA was denatured prior to the gel shift analysis (Fig. 5). The formation of the VILIP-dsRNA complex was specifically dependent on Ca2+, because it was undetectable in the presence of EDTA (no Ca2+) or another divalent cation (Mg2+) (Fig. 5). The mRNA for the high affinity neurotrophin receptor (trkB) has been shown to be localized to the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in an activity-dependent manner (13Tongiori E. Righi M. Cattaneo A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9492-9505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that such neuronal activity generates a concomitant increase in intracellular Ca2+ and VILIP is also expressed in the hippocampus (25Saitoh S. Kobayashi M. Kuroki T. Noguchi T. Takamatsu K. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 23: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we decided to determine whether VILIP can interact with trkB mRNA. Gel shift assays showed that a VILIP-trkB mRNA complex is formed with increasing amounts of VILIP and that this interaction requires Ca2+ (Fig. 6, Aand B). In many localized mRNAs, cis-acting signals in the mRNA 3′-UTR interact with RNA-binding proteins and mediate mRNA localization (for review, see Ref. 26Bashirullah A. Cooperstock R.L. Lipshitz H.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 335-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine whether VILIP binds the trkB 3′-UTR, gel shift experiments using RNA containing only the trkB mRNA 3′-UTR were performed. VILIP binds to the trkB mRNA 3′-UTR in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C), but does not interact with the trkB mRNA coding region (Fig. 6 D). In addition, the VILIP-trkB mRNA complex will not form when trkB mRNA is denatured, and it specifically requires Ca2+ as the divalent cation for binding (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that VILIP in the presence of Ca2+ binds trkB mRNA by interacting specifically with dsRNA sequences in the trkB mRNA 3′-UTR, whereas it does not bind the trkB mRNA coding region. In this study, we showed that the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, VILIP, contains a copy of the dsRNA-binding domain characteristic of such dsRNA-binding proteins as Drosophilastaufen and human PKR. Despite the low amino acid similarity of the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain with other dsRNA-binding domains, we demonstrated that VILIP specifically binds to dsRNA in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Because two EF-hands (III and IV) overlap the dsRNA-binding domain, the low amino acid conservation in the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain may result from selective pressure to maintain the ability to bind both dsRNA and Ca2+. Therefore, VILIP dsRNA-binding domain may represent a minimal dsRNA-binding domain that still remains functional. VILIP is unique, because it contains both Ca2+-binding EF-hands and a dsRNA-binding domain. One possible mechanism for the Ca2+ induction of VILIP binding of dsRNA is through conformational changes in the EF-hands Ca2+-binding domains. EF-hands are helix-loop-helix motifs that are typically paired to interact and produce a single globular domain (for review, see Ref.21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; : 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Binding Ca2+ by the EF-hands of VILIP causes significant conformational changes (24Cox J.A. Durussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+binding of recoverin, another EF-hand protein, increases recoverin α helical content (22Johnson W.C. Palczewski K. Gorczyca W.A. Riazance-Lawrence J.H. Witkowska D. Polans A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RNA binding has been shown to be mediated by α helical-enriched proteins, and α helices have been demonstrated for the structure of the dsRNA-binding domain (27Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 29Harada K. Martin S.S Frankel A.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Naduri S. Carpick B.W. Yang Y. Williams B.R.G. Qin J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations that destabilize the α helices eliminate dsRNA binding (8Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ca2+-binding by VILIP may cause conformational changes that involves increased α helical content that can then mediate dsRNA-binding. Because two EF-hand domains overlap with the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain, Ca2+ binding may affect the conformation of the VILIP dsRNA-binding domain directly resulting in binding dsRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis will be needed to dissect the precise roles of the Ca2+-binding EF-hands and the dsRNA-binding domain in the formation of the VILIP-dsRNA complex. It is interesting that VILIP requires at least 200-bp dsRNA for stable binding, whereas other dsRNA-binding proteins can bind dsRNA as small as 16 bp (31Bevilacqua P.C. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9983-9994Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that VILIP can only recognize a minimum binding site 200-bp long, because we demonstrated VILIP binding to 100-bp dsRNA. Mobility gel shift experiments showed that VILIP appears to bind to 200-bp dsRNA as one complex. Even at low VILIP concentrations, there were no additional smaller complexes. VILIP concentration may need to be significantly high enough to allow VILIP-VILIP interactions that would then result in binding dsRNA. Although the VILIP-VILIP complex can bind a 100-bp dsRNA, a larger dsRNA may be able to interact with more of the dsRNA-binding domains in the complex and form a more stable VILIP-dsRNA complex. Although the measured dissociation constant for VILIP-dsRNA binding is low, thein vivo situation encountered by VILIP may be different from the in vitro assay. For example, other proteins may be involved in the formation of the VILIP-dsRNA complex as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex that often forms with localized RNAs (32Ainger K. Avossa D. Morgan F. Hill S.J. Barry C. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that VILIP interacts with the neuronal trkB mRNA in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Because VILIP does not bind to the trkB mRNA coding region or other mRNAs (data not shown), the trkB mRNA-VILIP interaction apparently does not result from binding a nonspecific dsRNA structure. VILIP may be recognizing specific sequences present in the trkB mRNA 3′-UTR to mediate its binding. It is interesting to note that sequence alignment of human, rat, and mouse trkB mRNA 3′-UTRs reveals a region of high homology about 600 nucleotides in length in all three mRNAs that contains significant RNA stem-loop formation as determined by Mfold computer analysis (data not shown). Further study will determine whether this region of the trkB mRNA 3′-UTR is functional in VILIP binding. Dendritic trkB mRNA localization is activity-dependent and requires increases in intracellular Ca2+. Studies have suggested that because of its EF-hands, VILIP may function to detect changes in intracellular concentration of Ca2+ as a part of a signal transduction system (33Boekhoff I. Braunwell K.-H. Andreini I. Breer H. Gundelfinger E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar). Given its ability to bind a localized neuronal mRNA, VILIP could also function as part of the cellular machinery responsible for activity-dependent localization of specific mRNAs to the dendrites. It is interesting that VILIP has been co-localized with actin filaments (34Lenz S.E. Braunewell K. Weise C. Nedlina-Chittka A. Gundelfinger E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a cytoskeletal compartment shown to be involved in mRNA localization (35Yisraeli J.K. Sokol S. Melton D.A. Development. 1990; 108: 289-298PubMed Google Scholar), and has been found in hippocampal cell bodies and dendrites (25Saitoh S. Kobayashi M. Kuroki T. Noguchi T. Takamatsu K. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 23: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,34Lenz S.E. Braunewell K. Weise C. Nedlina-Chittka A. Gundelfinger E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Therefore, despite its small size, VILIP may be a multifunctional regulatory protein important in the Ca2+messenger system and capable of responding to Ca2+signaling to function as a dsRNA-binding protein in central nervous system mRNA localization.

We previously identified in a PTPS-deficient patient an inactive PTPS allele with an Arg16 to Cys codon mutation. Arg16 is located in the protein surface exposed phosphorylation motif Arg16-Arg-Ile-Ser, with Ser19 as the putative phosphorylation site for serine-threonine protein kinases. Purification of recombinant PTPS-S19A from bacterial cells resulted in an active enzyme (k cat /K m = 6.4 × 103m−1 s−1), which was similar to wild-type PTPS (k cat /K m = 4.1 × 103m−1 s−1). In assays with purified enzymes, wild-type but not PTPS-S19A was a specific substrate for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) type I and II. Upon expression in COS-1 cells, PTPS-S19A was stable but not phosphorylated and had a reduced activity of ∼33% in comparison to wild-type PTPS. Extracts from several human cell lines, including brain, contained a kinase that bound to and phosphorylated immobilized wild-type, but not mutant PTPS. Addition of cGMP stimulated phosphotransferase activity 2-fold. Extracts from transfected COS-1 cells overexpressing cGKII stimulated Ser19 phosphorylation more than 100-fold, but only 4-fold from cGKI overexpressing cells. Moreover, fibroblast extracts from mice lacking cGKII exhibited significantly reduced phosphorylation of PTPS. These results suggest that Ser19 of human PTPS may be a substrate for cGKII phosphorylation also in vivo, a modification that is essential for normal activity. 6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) participates in tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor biosynthesis. We previously identified in a PTPS-deficient patient an inactive PTPS allele with an Arg16 to Cys codon mutation. Arg16 is located in the protein surface exposed phosphorylation motif Arg16-Arg-Ile-Ser, with Ser19 as the putative phosphorylation site for serine-threonine protein kinases. Purification of recombinant PTPS-S19A from bacterial cells resulted in an active enzyme (k cat /K m = 6.4 × 103m−1 s−1), which was similar to wild-type PTPS (k cat /K m = 4.1 × 103m−1 s−1).

(6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin maltose-binding protein protein kinase 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (EC 4.6.1.10) cGMP-dependent protein kinase 8-bromo-cAMP reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction calmodulin protein kinase II polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein kinase Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)1 is an essential cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases,i.e. phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase, as well as for all three nitric-oxide synthase isoforms (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Inherited BH4 deficiency leads primarily to an increase in plasma phenylalanine, and to dopamine and neurotransmitter deficiency in the brain. Such autosomal recessive inherited defects result either from a biosynthetic or a recycling defect of the BH4 cofactor (2Blau N. Thöny B. Heizmann C.W. Dhondt J.-L. Pteridines. 1993; 4: 1-10Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Scriver C.R. Kaufman S. Eisensmith R.C. Woo S.L.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1015-1075Google Scholar). Three biosynthetic enzymes are required for de novo cofactor production: GTP cyclohydrolase I, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase. For recycling of BH4 following hydroxylase reactions, two enzymatic steps are required that involve the pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase and the dihydropteridine reductase. Insufficient PTPS activity due to inherited mutations appears to be the most common cause for BH4 deficiency (4Blau N. Barnes I. Dhondt J.L. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Thöny B. Blau N. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Among the over 200 individuals identified today with PTPS deficiency, more than 20 different mutant alleles have been found (6Blau N. Dhondt J.L. Dianzani I. Thöny B. Pfleiderer W. Rokos H. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines and Folates. Blackwell Science, Oxford1997: 719-726Google Scholar). Some of these alterations have been investigated by expression of recombinant proteins for functional studies such as stability, enzymatic activity, or modification(s). From these analyses, which should not be depreciated for the understanding of the wild-type protein, it was discovered that a few of the mutant alleles were defective as protein substrates for potential post-translational modification(s). Thus, a direct link could be inferred from a disease-causing mutation to the requirement of modification for normal in vivo functionality and activity. Such an example is the arginine 16 to cystein (R16C) PTPS allele that turned out to be reduced in its activity due to an alteration in the protein kinase (PK) recognition site Arg16-Arg-Ile-Ser, with serine 19 as the potential residue for phosphorylation (7Oppliger T.

In this context, phosphorylation of BH4 metabolic enzymes has been proposed to play a role in the regulation or modulation of BH4 biosynthesis, based on various observations. For instance, GTP cyclohydrolase I was found to be phosphorylated in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells (8Imazumi K. Sasaki T. Takahashi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), rat mesangial cells (9Lapize C. Plüss C. Werner E.R. Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (10Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hültner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of GTP cyclohydrolase I contains numerous consensus sites for phosphorylation, but the site for modification has not been identified. However, in vitro phosphorylation studies indicate that GTP cyclohydrolase I is modified by casein kinase II and protein kinase C (PK-C) (9Lapize C. Plüss C. Werner E.R. Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hültner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sepiapterin reductase, the terminal enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis, was found to be stoichiometrically phosphorylated in vitro by calmodulin-dependent PK II (CaM-PK II) and PKC (11Katoh S. Sueoka T. Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation by both kinases modified the kinetic properties of sepiapterin reductase. However, neither an in vivo relevance nor a modification in cell culture or tissue was reported for sepiapterin reductase. Similarly, dihydropteridine reductase was also a good substrate for the CaM-PK II in vitro; yet, phosphorylation did not alter its kinetic properties, and so far no in vivo phosphorylation data are available (11Katoh S. Sueoka T. Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the cellular level, however, indications for signal transduction pathways that lead to stimulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I expression and/or of BH4 biosynthetic activity have been reported by several laboratories (9Lapize C. Plüss C. Werner E.R. Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hültner L. Ueffing M.

Stimulating agents were cAMP and various growth-promoting cytokines (e.g. interleukins, nerve growth factors, kit ligand, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharides). In most cellular assay systems, the addition of these factors led to the de novobiosynthesis of GTP cyclohydrolase I by transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, careful investigation of the effect of adding the constitutive activator 8-Br-cAMP to cultured rat dopamine neurons led to the detection of a biphasic time course in the increase of cellular BH4 levels (19Zhu M. Hirayama K. Kapatos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11825-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the long-term regulation of BH4 biosynthesis involved an alteration in GTP cyclohydrolase I gene expression, the short-term increase was speculated to be due to phosphorylation of a biosynthetic enzyme capable of modifying BH4 metabolism. Since this induction was cAMP-dependent but no corresponding cAMP-PK site was present in the GTP cyclohydrolase I, it was speculated that PTPS might be activated by phosphorylation. Independently from these observations we recently found the aforementioned non-phosphorylated mutant allele (R16C) in a patient suffering from PTPS deficiency (7Oppliger T. Thöny B. Nar H. Bürgisser D. Huber R. Heizmann C.W. Blau N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29498-29506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutated protein pointed toward a regulatory function for such a modification, since the recombinant protein tested under in vitro assay conditions had only a moderately reduced enzymatic activity, but was inactive in vivo although it was expressed as a stable protein in patients' primary cells. In this work, we addressed the question of which site in the human homohexameric PTPS is phosphorylated, what effect such a post-translational modification exerts on protein activity in vivo, and which type of PK might be responsible for the specific modification. The mutagenic primer PTPS205 was synthesized on a Gene Assembler Plus DNA synthesizer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): 5′-GCGCTGAAGGCGATGCGGCGG-3′; the underlined nucleotide indicates the mismatch that leads to the serine 19 to alanine exchange (S19A) in the corresponding human PTPS cDNA sequence (20Thöny B.

Radioactively labeled [32P]orthophosphate and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc., and 8-bromo-cAMP and 8-bromo-cGMP from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. The pMal-c2 expression system was from New England Biolabs. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine was from Sigma, and KT5823 was from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. The phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium orthovanadate were from Sigma, and the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Fluka.

For quantification of32P incorporation, protein bands were cut out from the gel and counted for radioactivity, or quantitated with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For expression of PTPS in COS-1 cells, the pSCT1 derivatives pHSY2009, pHSY2010, and pHSY2013, expressing PTPS-R16C, PTPS-R25Q, and wild-type PTPS, respectively, have been described (7Oppliger T.

Plasmids pHSY2003, pHSY2006, and pHSY2007, for purification of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) derivatives PTPS-R25Q, wild-type PTPS, and PTPS-R16C, respectively, have been published (7Oppliger T.

To express the PTPS-S19A mutant in COS-1 cells, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed by two consecutive PCR reactions on wild-type plasmid template, which was then cloned into pSCT1. For the first round of PCR amplification, primers PTPS21 and PTPS205 were used to generate an 80-base pair fragment. For the second round of PCR, the 80-base pair product in combination with primer PTPS102 was applied to amplify a 460-base pair fragment that was subsequently cut with BamHI and inserted into pSCT1 to generate pHSY2017. To express the MBP-PTPS-S19A fusion protein inEscherichia coli, a PCR reaction with primers PTPS201 and PTPS102 with plasmid pHSY2017 as template DNA was carried out. The amplified fragment was cut with BamHI and inserted into theXmnI/BamHI opened vector pMal-c2 to generate plasmid pHSY2019. Plasmid pMT3–1α-cGK expressing the bovine tracheal smooth muscle cGKIα isoenzmye has been described (21Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Kamm S Klatt P. Dostmann W.R.G. Hofmann F. J. Biol.

To express the murine cGKII in COS-1 cells, the corresponding 2.5-kilobaseSnaBI-HindIII fragment containing a (His)6-tag at its 5′-end was first isolated from the parental pFastBac1-vector (Life Technologies) 2P. Ruth, personal communication. and subcloned into the HincII/HindIII-opened pUC18 vector. Subsequently, the XbaI-HindIII fragment containing the (His)6-cGKII-cDNA in the pUC18 polylinker was cut out and inserted into theXbaI/HindIII sites of pSCT1 to generate plasmid pSCT1-His-cGKII. The pMal-c2 derivatives harboring the MBP-PTPS fusion under control of an isopropyl-2-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter were transformed into E. coli TB-1 cells and induced for expression according to the protocol by New England Biolabs. Human recombinant PTPS was purified from bacterial cells as described (22Bürgisser D.M. Thöny B. Redweik U. Hunziker P. Heizmann C.W. Blau N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The protein-serine/threonine kinases purchased from Promega or Roche Molecular Biochemicals were assayed according to the supplier's protocol for each of the kinases with corresponding control substrates. In parallel, phosphorylation reactions were carried out with a protein concentration of 0.6–12 μm (0.1–2 μg) of purified PTPS substrates in 10 μl reactions. The CaM-PK II was assayed in a volume of 50 μl containing 10 μg of the protein substrate (myelin basic protein as control or recombinant PTPS), 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 20 μg/ml calmodulin, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi/50 μl), and 5 mm dithiothreitol (only for the negative control). The reaction was carried out for 5 min at 30 °C. For quantification, the phosphorylated control peptides were spotted on a Whatman P-81 filter paper, washed 3 times with 75 mmH3PO4, rinsed once with ethanol, dried, and counted. All reactions with recombinant PTPS as substrate were stopped with standard “Laemmli sample buffer,” separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and quantified as described above. COS-1 cell co-transfections with the pSCT1 derivatives plus pSVβ-gal (expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase), [32P]orthophosphate labeling, and immunoprecipitation with the SZ28 anti-human PTPS antibody were carried out as described (7Oppliger T.

PTPS activity was measured and normalized for the β-galactosidase activity co-expressed from the pSVβ-gal plasmid. To prevent dephosphorylation, the cell lysis buffer contained the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (100 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (2 mm). The protein kinase inhibitors KT5823 and staurosporine were added to cultivated COS-1 cells at the same time point as the [32P]orthophosphate incubation was started. Plasmid pMT3–1α-cGK or pSCT1-His-cGKII were transfected according to standard procedures (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with antiserum against the cGK type I or II (kindly provided by F. Hofmann and P.

Embryonal fibroblasts from wild-type and cGKII−/− (25Pfeifer A. Aszodi A. Seidler U. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Fässler R. Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) mice were provided by A. Pfeifer and P. Ruth. Cells from confluent plates were washed twice with standard PBS buffer, and incubated for 5 min in ice-cold lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units/ml aprotinin). Steps beyond this point, unless indicated, were all performed at 4 °C. The cells were scraped from the plates, and the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min to collect the supernatant which was then diluted with 2 volumes of HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Such a freshly prepared soluble extract from a 100-mm tissue culture plate yielded a volume of approximately 1 ml, and was mixed with recombinant MBP-PTPS fusion protein that was preabsorbed to a commercially available amylose resin suspension (Biolabs Inc.). Pre-absorption was performed by mixing 21 μg of purified MBP-PTPS fusion protein with 80 μl of amylose resin suspension, and incubating for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two wash steps each with 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer. The amylose-immobilized MBP-PTPS fusion protein mixed with cell extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and washed three times with 0.6 ml of ice-cold HNTG buffer. For the phosphotransferase reaction, 1 μl of 1 mm ATP, 3.3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), and 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) were added and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then sedimented at 13,000 × g for 1 min, followed by one wash step with 0.2 ml of phosphorylation buffer. For cleavage of human PTPS from the MBP, 3 μg of protease factor Xa was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. The location of all putative protein kinase (PK) phosphorylation site sequences, according to the described consensus sites, are indicated in the amino acid sequence of the human PTPS (Fig. 1), and compiled with the corresponding PKs in Table I. The consensus sites are chosen from a tabulation by Pearson and Kemp (27Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). A total of 17 combinations for phosphorylation with all possible PKs and the listed sites are found. To identify in a first attempt the potential relevant phosphorylation site(s), we applied and combined selection criteria including (i) data from natural PTPS mutations from patients, (ii) surface accessibility from the three-dimensional structure, and (iii) in vitro phosphorylation ability with commercially available PKs and purified PTPS. By scanning the primary amino acids sequence we found six putative phosphorylation sites (Ser15, Ser19, Ser23, Ser28, Ser32, and Ser105), two with overlapping consensus sequences. The first of these clusters with overlapping sequences spans Ser15 to Ser19(sites a1, b, and c1, in Fig. 1), and the second Ser23 to Ser28 (sites a2 and c2, in Fig. 1). In each of these clusters, we identified one functional alteration in the PTPS from patients, i.e. the mutant alleles R16C and R25Q (7Oppliger T. Thöny B. Nar H. Bürgisser D. Huber R. Heizmann C.W. Blau N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29498-29506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we knew from previous experiments with COS-1 cells that the R16C, but not the R25Q alteration, was refractory for in vivo phosphorylation of PTPS. As the Arg16 overlaps with the consensus site a1, the most likely candidate for a phosphoserine modification was Ser19, whereas Ser15 in site c1 with the consensus S*XR, and the site b (RXS*) could be excluded. Furthermore, based on computer simulation, the only highly accessible serine (or threonine) residue in the folded PTPS homohexamer was serine 19. 3G. Auerbach and T. Ploom, personal communication. The consensus sites a2 and c2 in the second cluster are overlapping with arginine 25, which was found to be phosphorylated to the same extent as the wild-type enzyme (see below). Also, these sites of the protein are buried in a cave near the active center and thus appear entirely inaccessible for any PK. Similarly, Ser105 is in the active site of the enzyme, and both consensus sites, d1 and d2 with serine residues 32 and 105, are not accessible from the surface for a PK. We thus investigated further serine residue 19 for a potential phosphoserine modification by assaying as a substrate recombinant PTPS purified from E. coli cells incubated with different PKs.Table ISummary of in vitro phosphorylation data of human wild-type PTPS with putative protein-serine/threonine kinasesProtein kinaseaAbbreviations for protein kinases: cAMP-PK, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; casein K II, casein kinase II.Motif(s)bAsterisks indicate the phosphorylated residue.

Open table in a new tab We tested all the potential and available PKs that recognize one or more of the consensus phosphorylation sites found in the human PTPS for in vitro phosphorylation ability of recombinant PTPS protein (Table I). As a control, corresponding artificial protein substrates were included in the assay. With the exception of cGMP-dependent PK (cGK), all kinases incubated with PTPS showed phosphorylation rates of 2% and less. In case of the CaM-PK II, where the myelin basic control peptide exhibited only ∼5% phosphorylation, we calculated that a 20-fold more efficient labeling (equivalent to 100% phosphorylation of the control peptide) would still result in less than 1% phosphorylation of the PTPS substrate. Thus, from these in vitro experiments the only candidate was cGK (Iα-isoenzyme) suggesting that PTPS might be phosphorylated alsoin vivo by a cGK-like activity. Furthermore, since several sites are potentially recognized by the cGK (sites a1, a2, b, c1, and c2, in Fig. 1), we tested mutated PTPS to identify the actual phosphorylation site(s). Since serine 19 was the only reasonable candidate site for potential phosphoserine modification in PTPS, we mutated the cDNA to express a recombinant protein with a Ser19 to Ala (S19A) exchange. Characterization of the purified mutant PTPS-S19A revealed normal enzyme activity, including thermal stability (not shown) and kinetic parameters akin to that of wild-type enzyme (TableII), confirming that this S19A exchange yielded a correctly folded PTPS. On the other hand, upon incubation with the purified cGK we observed only background phosphorylation for the PTPS-S19A mutant enzyme. This observation agreed with the fact that the R16C mutant was also not a substrate for this PK, in contrast to the wild-type and PTPS-R25Q that were modified by the cGK. Furthermore, soluble, recombinant cGKI and cGKII were both able to specifically phosphorylate wild-type PTPS in vitro (Fig.2). In this context it is worth mentioning that we also tested for potential alteration of kinetic parameters of purified wild-type PTPS phosphorylated at serine 19. When the PTPS protein was modified with an in vitro efficiency of approximately three phosphoserines 19 per hexameric complex, we saw no difference in specific enzyme activity, K m value, or thermal stability in the standard assay with the natural dihydroneopterin triphosphate substrate (not shown) (22Bürgisser D.M.

To examine whether specific sorting mechanisms for individual tRNAs direct them to different mitochondrial compartments, the distribution of tRNA transcripts, internalized in vitro, was examined by suborganellar fractionation. Significant amounts of tRNATyrwere localized in the matrix and on the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. With time, the matrix:membrane ratio increased. Translocation through the inner membrane apparently required the presence of a specific signal in the D arm of tRNATyr, and tRNAGln(CUG), lacking this sequence, was excluded. Hydrolysis of ATP was necessary at both the outer and inner membranes. However, the protonophores carbonylcyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone and nigericin, the K+ionophore valinomycin, and the F1F0 ATPase inhibitor oligomycin had only marginal effects on uptake through the outer membrane but severely inhibited inner membrane translocation, indicating the unusual requirement of both the electrical and chemical components of the electromotive force generated across the inner membrane. The results are consistent with a mechanism involving stepwise transfer of tRNA through distinct outer and inner membrane channels.

The results are consistent with a mechanism involving stepwise transfer of tRNA through distinct outer and inner membrane channels. The mitochondrial genomes of many protozoal species, including leishmania, trypanosomes, and plasmodium, are unusual for their apparently total lack of tRNA genes (1Sloof P. de Haan A.

To sustain the translation of organellar mRNAs, a large number of nuclear-encoded tRNAs are imported from the cytoplasm (4Simpson A.M. Suyama Y. Dewes H. Campbell D. Simpson L.

Mitochondrial import of one or more tRNAs has also been documented in tetrahymena (11Chiu N. Chiu A. Suyama Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), yeast (12Martin R.P. Scheller J.-M. Stahl A.J.C. Dirheimer G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4600-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and several species of higher plants (13Dietrich A. Weil J.H. Marechal-Drouard L. Annu. Rev.

To understand the mechanism of import, we have developed an in organello system from leishmania (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was shown that import is ATP-dependent and specific for RNA sequence (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A purine-rich oligonucleotide motif in the D arm of tRNA was identified as an import signal in vivo (17Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in vitro (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 15-kDa protein associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane acts as carrier or receptor for direct import of tRNA, without the mediation of soluble factors (19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of intact mitochondria or mitoplasts for tRNA internalizedin vivo or in vitro does not address the question of the distribution of the RNA in the various intramitochondrial compartments, viz. the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, or matrix. We have previously reported UTP labeling ofin vitro imported small RNAs (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), presumably by the matrix-localized terminal uridylyl transferase (20Bakalara N. Simpson A.M. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18679-18686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fraction of tRNAIle associated with the mitochondrial fraction in vivo was found to be resistant to micrococcal nuclease in the presence of digitonin, which selectively solubilizes the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggesting the matrix location of this tRNA (17Lima B.D. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether different tRNAs are sorted to different locations once inside the mitochondrion, in a manner analogous to the sorting of imported proteins, and if so, whether separate matrix localization and sorting signals exist within the tRNA structure. The study of intramitochondrial distribution is important as it may enable a distinction to be made between 1) a concerted mechanism of import through a single transport channel spanning both the outer and inner membranes, and 2) a stepwise mechanism involving separate outer and inner membrane translocation channels. In this study, mitochondria were fractionated into various compartments for the study of the distribution of imported RNA, specifically, the sequence specificity and energy requirements of translocation through the inner membrane. The results support the notion of stepwise insertion of RNA through the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Promastigotes of Leishmania tropica strain UR6 were cultured on solid blood agar medium (21Das S. Adhya S. J. Biosci. 1990; 15: 239-248Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) supplemented with 150 μg/ml biopterin and 50 μg/ml adenine. Mitochondria were purified from DNase I-treated lysates by Percoll gradient centrifugation and stored in 50% glycerol storage buffer, as described (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Carbonylcyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), oligomycin, valinomycin, and nigericin (all from Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol and diluted 100-fold into import reactions. The sodium salt of carboxyatractyloside (Sigma) was dissolved in water and similarly diluted. Mitochondria (80–100 μg of protein) were preincubated with inhibitor (plus 0.1m KCl in the case of valinomycin) for 15 min on ice before dilution with an equal volume of import buffer, as indicated. Rabbit muscle myokinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), an ammonium sulfate suspension, was recovered by microcentrifugation and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol before use. Unless otherwise stated, washed mitochondria (80–100 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 100 fmol of 32P-labeled import substrate in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgAc2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm ATP in a total volume of 20 μl. Then RNase A (2.5 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (50 units/ml) were added and incubation continued for an additional 15 min at the same temperature. Mitochondria were washed in cold STE and recovered by centrifugation. RNase-treated mitochondria containing internalized radiolabeled RNA were incubated with 320 μm digitonin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 10 μl of STE for 15 min on ice (23Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T.

Alternatively, mitochondria were subjected to hypotonic shock in 20 μl of 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for 15 min on ice, followed by addition of 2.5 μl of 2 m sucrose. Mitoplasts were separated from the intermembrane space fraction by microcentrifugation at 3450 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C. The mitoplasts were suspended in 10 μl of freeze-thaw buffer (0.6 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA; Ref. 24Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, each consisting of freezing at −70 °C followed by rapid thawing at 37 °C. The inner membrane and matrix fractions were separated by centrifugation at 7000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. RNA was recovered from each fraction by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and isopropanol precipitation (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of RNA, an aliquot was spotted on DEAE anion exchange paper (DE 81, Whatman) and counted. Alternatively, the RNA was resolved by urea-PAGE (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by counting of the dried gel band. Kynurenine hydroxylase and succinate dehydrogenase were spectrophotometrically assayed as described previously (16Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol.

To assay malate dehydrogenase, reactions (1 ml) containing 96 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 μm NAD+, and mitochondrial extract were initiated by the addition of 260 μm sodium malate and the reduction of NAD+ followed by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (ε = 6.22 mm−1cm−1). The uptake of rhodamine 123 was used as a measure of the mitochondrial membrane potential (25Chen L.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 26Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Reactions (1 ml) containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgAc2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 220 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.63 μm rhodamine 123 (Sigma) were placed in a cuvette, and the absorbances at 516 and 495 nm were measured. Mitoplasts (derived from 200 μg of mitochondria), 4 mm ATP, and 50 μm CCCP were sequentially added, and the absorbances at the above wavelengths continuously recorded over time. Previous import assays (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol.

Under these conditions we sometimes observed partial degradation of imported RNA, possibly by residual RNase during the postimport washing and mitochondrial lysis steps. 2S. Mukherjee, S. N. Bhattacharyya, and S. Adhya, unpublished data. In order to make the assay more reliable in terms of RNA intactness and yield, the RNase concentration was lowered, whereas the incubation temperature was raised to 37 °C to increase the rate of degradation. A RNase titration experiment (Fig. 1 A) showed that at 37 °C, protection of intact RNA was observed using only 2.5% of the original enzyme concentration. At lower concentrations, there was evidence of incomplete endonucleolytic cleavage leading to smearing in the lane, whereas at higher concentrations, the amount of protected RNA was reduced and finally eliminated. These results emphasize the importance of controlling the RNase step for successful observation of import. The amount of protected RNA increased in a time-dependent manner up to 20 min of incubation of the mitochondria with radiolabeled tRNATyr and was completely sensitive to RNase if the mitochondria were lysed with Triton X-100 (Fig. 1 B), as expected for uptake into the membrane-bound organelle. In order to assess the intramitochodrial distribution of tRNAs imported in vitro, a simple scheme for separating the various intramitochondrial compartments was developed (Fig.2 A). Mitochondria were treated with digitonin, a detergent that selectively solubilizes the outer membrane (23Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 79-112Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed, the outer membrane marker kynurenine hydroxylase (19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but not the inner membrane marker succinate dehydrogenase (19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab After separation of the digitonin-soluble fraction (outer membrane plus intermembrane space) by centrifugation, the particulate fraction (mitoplasts), containing membrane vesicles of more or less uniform size,2 was subjected to freeze-thaw cycles (24Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to liberate the matrix contents, leaving behind an insoluble fraction enriched with the inner membrane. Light microscopy of this fraction revealed the presence of large, presumably fused, membrane lamellae, with no evidence of intact mitoplasts.2 As expected, malate dehydrogenase was predominantly located in the soluble fraction and succinate dehydrogenase in the particulate fraction (Table I). (Some malate dehydrogenase activity was also detected in the digitonin-soluble fraction; a similar result has been obtained with mammalian mitochondrial preparations (23Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 79-112Google Scholar) and probably represents contamination with the cytosolic form of the enzyme.) The mitochondrial enzyme terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase), implicated in RNA editing mechanisms (20Bakalara N. Simpson A.M. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18679-18686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also released by freeze-thaw lysis, confirming its presence in the matrix.2 Treatment of mitochondria with digitonin resulted in enhanced sensitivity of inner membrane proteins, such as succinate dehydrogenase, to protease treatment, whereas the matrix marker malate dehydrogenase remained unaffected (Fig. 2 B), indicating the intactness of the inner membrane. To determine whether the mitoplasts obtained by this procedure can develop a membrane potential (Δψ), digitonin-treated preparations were incubated with rhodamine 123. The uptake of this lipophilic cation into energized mitochondria is strictly dependent upon the presence of Δψ across the inner membrane and is accompanied by a red shift in the absorption spectrum (25Chen L.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 26Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). When mitoplasts were added to rhodamine 123, a rapid and transient red shift was observed (Fig.2 C), due to incomplete energization by endogenous substrates (26Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Addition of ATP resulted in a more sustained red shift (Fig.2 C), indicating dye uptake into the mitoplasts. Further addition of CCCP, a protonophore that dissipates Δψ, reversed the red shift (Fig. 2 C), confirming the development of an ATP-induced proton gradient across the mitoplast membrane. Mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled tRNATyr transcript, then digested with RNase. After washing, submitochondrial fractions were separated as above and analyzed for the presence of RNA. In the presence of ATP, mitochondria accumulated internalized tRNATyr in different submitochondrial compartments (Fig.3 A). The majority of the RNA (68% in this experiment) was in the matrix, 31% was bound to the inner membrane, and less than 1% was in the intermembrane space. RNase treatment of the digitonin-treated mitoplasts resulted in nearly complete digestion of the membrane-bound RNA, whereas the RNA in the matrix was resistant (Fig. 3 A), as expected. Thus, the RNA bound to the inner membrane is exposed to the intermembrane space. Essentially identical results were obtained when mitoplasts were prepared by hypotonic shock instead of digitonin.2 The intramitochondrial distribution of RNA changed with time (Fig.3 B). At early times of incubation, the majority of the RNA was in the inner membrane fraction, whereas after 10 min at 37 °C, increasing amounts appeared in the matrix, with a concomitant reduction in the membrane-bound fraction, whereas the total amount internalized increased only marginally. These results indicate that translocation through the inner membrane is slower than that through the outer membrane. The effect of temperature on the intramitochondrial distribution of tRNATyr was examined (Fig. 3 C). Total uptake increased sharply between 5 and 15 °C, but rose only marginally thereafter. In contrast, transfer into the matrix was favored at 35 and 45 °C. Near the optimum growth temperature of the promastigote form of Leishmania (25 °C), the RNA was equally distributed between the inner membrane and matrix compartments (Fig.3 C), reflecting a reduced rate of matrix transfer at the lower temperature.2 It was previously shown that uptake of RNA through the outer membrane (as measured by RNase protection assays of intact mitochondria) requires recognition of a conserved motif with the consensus sequence UGGYAGRRY in the D arm of tRNA (see Fig. 4) by the outer membrane receptor, TAB (18Mahapatra S.

To examine whether such a sequence is sufficient for transfer into the matrix, a deletion derivative of tRNATyr, containing the 5′-terminal 39 nucleotides, including the D arm, was tested for its intramitochondrial distribution. Entry of tRNATyr(1–39) into the matrix was better than that of the parental molecule (Fig. 4, A adB). The time course of intramitochondrial distribution was also similar (Fig. 5). At early times of incubation, almost all of the RNA was bound to the inner membrane, whereas after 10 min at 37 °C, the matrix content increased and the amount of membrane-associated RNA decreased. This kinetic pattern is consistent the presence of an intermediate, inner membrane-bound state. Recently, we have observed2 efficient matrix localization of an oligoribonucleotide containing only nucleotides 5–27 of tRNATyr, i.e. the D arm hairpin loop (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K.

Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 56: 233-246Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and contains the conserved D arm sequence (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and tRNAGln(CUG), which is not detectable in mitochondrial RNA (7Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 56: 233-246Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and lacks the conserved D arm signal (16Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20432-20437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4). However, low levels (about 25% of that of tRNATyr) of transfer of tRNAGln(CUG) through the outer membrane could still be observed in vitro (19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that this discrimination is not absolute. When the intramitochondrial distribution of the internalized tRNAGlnwas examined, 90–95% was found to be confined to the inner membrane; little or no RNA was located in the matrix (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, very low levels of δ RNA, a synthetic transcript that lacks the import signal and is transferred to an insignificant extent through the outer membrane (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were found to be exclusively on the inner membrane (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that 1) the D arm signal is sufficient to penetrate the inner membrane, and 2) the inner membrane has an even greater selectivity for RNA sequence than the outer membrane. Total uptake of tRNATyr increased with the concentration of added ATP until saturation was reached at 3–4 mm (Fig. 6 A). The nonhydrolyzable analogs AMPPCP (Fig. 6 A) and AMPPNP2 were unable to replace ATP, illustrating the requirement of cleavage of the β-γ pyrophosphate bond. To determine the sites of ATP action, mitochondria were incubated with RNA and ATP in the presence of AMP and the nonpenetrant enzyme myokinase, to scavenge the external ATP via the reaction ATP + AMP → 2ADP. This treatment resulted in inhibition of outer membrane transfer (Fig. 6 B, left panel). When mitochondria were preloaded with ATP and then incubated with RNA in the absence of further ATP addition, normal levels of outer membrane transfer were observed, but myokinase inhibited this process, indicating that some or all of the ATP must be exported from the matrix or intermembrane space in order to sustain transfer (Fig. 6 B, left). When mitochondria were incubated with carboxyatractyloside, a specific inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocator on the inner membrane (27LaNoue K.F. Schoolworth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and then ATP and RNA were added, import was inhibited (Fig. 6 B, right). This suggests that accumulation of ATP in the matrix via the adenine nucleotide translocator is important. Mitochondria preloaded with ATP, washed, and subsequently challenged with RNA in the presence of carboxyatractyloside were also inhibited (Fig. 6 B, right). Because external ATP is absent and matrix ATP is prevented from translocating to the intermembrane space by carboxyatractyloside, this result is consistent with the requirement of ATP in the intermembrane space or at the outer membrane. The effect of ATP hydrolysis on the intramitochondrial distribution of tRNATyr was examined (Fig. 6 C). Addition of ATP caused a 7-fold increase in the level of RNA in the matrix but only a 1.6-fold increase in the level of inner membrane-bound RNA. In the presence of AMPPCP, translocation into the matrix was reduced to negligible levels, whereas 84% remained associated with the inner membrane. Taken together, these results demonstrate the requirement of ATP hydrolysis for transfer of RNA through both the outer and inner membranes. Many mitochondrial transport processes are energetically driven by the electromotive force across the inner membrane generated by vectorial proton movement coupled to respiratory electron transport. These include translocation of proteins (28Schleyer M. Schmidt B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Gasser S.M. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13034-13041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of various low molecular weight metabolites (27LaNoue K.F. Schoolworth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). A conceivable role of ATP in RNA import is to generate a proton gradient by the hydrolytic activity of the oligomycin-sensitive F1F0 ATPase, which subsequently drives transfer through the membrane. This possibility was tested by observing the effect of various respiratory inhibitors on ATP-dependent total uptake, as well as the intramitochondrial distribution of tRNATyr. Initial titrations with the protonophore CCCP, which dissipates the proton gradient (30Kleinsmith L.J. Kish V.M. Principles of Cell Biology. Harper Collins, New York1988: 208-247Google Scholar) and hence the electromotive force, revealed only insignificant inhibition (less than 2-fold) of total uptake even at high inhibitor concentrations (up to 200 μm),2 suggesting that outer membrane transfer does not require an electromotive force. However, more than 90% of the internalized RNA was restricted to the inner membrane, very little being found in the matrix (Fig.7 A); the membrane-bound form was located on the outer surface, exposed to the intermembrane space.2 Clearly, insertion through the inner membrane requires a proton gradient. Oligomycin, at a concentration of up to 50 μm, which is 50–100 times the dose for 50% inhibition of leishmania mitochondrial ATPase (31Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Das A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), could inhibit total uptake about 2-fold, but it caused a 10-fold reduction in inner membrane translocation (Fig.7 B), indicating a role of the F1F0ATPase in transfer to the matrix. The electromotive force consists of two components: the membrane potential (Δψ), caused by charge separation across the membrane, and the pH gradient (ΔpH), due to the difference in proton concentration on the two sides (30Kleinsmith L.J. Kish V.M. Principles of Cell Biology. Harper Collins, New York1988: 208-247Google Scholar). In the presence of valinomycin, a K+ ionophore that reduces Δψ but not ΔpH (30Kleinsmith L.J. Kish V.M. Principles of Cell Biology. Harper Collins, New York1988: 208-247Google Scholar), transfer of tRNATyr into the matrix was inhibited (Fig.7 B). Nigericin, which carries out an electroneutral K+-H+ exchange, thereby reducing ΔpH without any effect on Δψ (30Kleinsmith L.J. Kish V.M. Principles of Cell Biology. Harper Collins, New York1988: 208-247Google Scholar), had a similar inhibitory effect (Fig.7 B). The results suggest that both the electrical and chemical components of the electromotive force are necessary for translocation of tRNA through the inner membrane. We describe here a modified import assay that monitors the distribution of internalized RNA in different submitochondrial compartments. Several modifications of previous assay methods (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Mahapatra S. Adhya S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were introduced. The import incubation was carried out at 37 instead of 25 °C. At the higher temperature, the rate but not the yield of import in vitro was higher, and entry into the matrix was facilitated (Fig. 3). The broad temperature range over which import is active may be a reflection of the adaptability of the parasite to grow at different temperatures as it passes through invertebrate and mammalian hosts. The postimport RNase treatment was also carried out at 37 °C using only 2.5% of the concentration of RNase previously employed (Fig. 1); these conditions were sufficient to digest excess RNA and at the same time minimized the risk of RNA degradation during subsequent fractionation steps. Third, the combination of digitonin and freeze-thaw lysis of mitoplasts allows the intramitochondrial compartments to be rapidly and easily separated (Fig. 2) without the need for prolonged ultracentrifugation steps. Selective permeabilization of the outer membrane with digitonin or by hypotonic shock revealed the presence of a significant fraction of internalized tRNA associated with the outer side of the inner membrane, i.e. facing the intermembrane space (Fig. 3). The kinetics of accumulation of this membrane-bound form (Figs. 3 and 5) are consistent with it being an intermediate in matrix translocation and not merely a nonfunctional bye-product. Moreover, there was no consistent evidence of any membrane-associated RNA of less than full-length size, as would be expected of a membrane-spanning intermediate. Full length and complete accessibility to RNase of the membrane-bound RNA are incompatible with concerted models of import that predict translocation intermediates spanning both membranes and enclosed in a transport pore consisting of inner and outer membrane proteins. This type of general insertion pore located at inner membrane-outer membrane contact sites conducts cytoplasmic proteins into the mitochondrial matrix (33Hannavy K. Rospert S. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In concerted models of import, the responsibility for selection of the correct import substrate lies with receptors located at the outer membrane, which recognize appropriate import signals. Thus, misrecognition at this step should lead to entry of the inappropriate substrate into the matrix. Our previous studies showed that the outer membrane system can discriminate between tRNATyr and tRNAGln(CUG), but not absolutely (19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the residual level of tRNAGln passing through the outer membrane is almost exclusively restricted to the inner membrane (Fig.4). In contrast, derivatives of tRNATyr retaining the conserved D arm import signal (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) pass into the matrix at least as effectively as the entire molecule (Fig. 4). Because this matrix targeting sequence interacts with TAB, a protein located on the outer membrane (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), one possibility is that the TAB-D arm complex passes through the outer membrane and subsequently interacts with the inner membrane channel for matrix entry. According to this scenario, RNAs, such as tRNAGln, that do not interact with TAB on the mitochondrial surface (18Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) would be effectively excluded from the matrix. Although ATP hydrolysis is required for translocation of RNA through both the outer and inner membranes (Fig. 6), the roles of ATP at these two steps are different. Notably, inhibition of the proton-pumping F1F0 ATPase with oligomycin, or dissipation of the proton gradient with CCCP or nigericin, results in severe inhibition of inner membrane translocation but only a marginal effect on transfer through the outer membrane (Fig. 7). Because nigericin, through electroneutral K+-H+ exchange, affects only the chemical component (ΔpH) of the electromotive force (30Kleinsmith L.J. Kish V.M. Principles of Cell Biology. Harper Collins, New York1988: 208-247Google Scholar), it is likely that transfer of RNA through the inner membrane is driven by the excess proton concentration in the intermembrane space. Symport of polyanionic RNA with protons would be an effective charge-balancing mechanism necessary to pump the RNA against the membrane potential (negative inside) of respiring mitochondria. An analogous example is that of the inner membrane phosphate transporter, which is coupled to the proton gradient by Pi-H+ symport (27LaNoue K.F. Schoolworth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The inhibition of inner membrane translocation by valinomycin (Fig. 7), which neutralizes the K+ gradient and thus reduces membrane potential (Δψ), exposes the paradoxical situation that a negatively charged membrane is required for transfer of negatively charged RNA. Several possibilities may be considered to explain this. 1) Import of RNA is coupled to export of some other anion such that the process is electrogenic, with the matrix losing net negative charge. An example of this type of transport is the Δψ-requiring exchange of matrix ATP for cytoplasmic ADP catalyzed by the adenine nucleotide translocator (27LaNoue K.F. Schoolworth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). 2) RNA is complexed with a positively charged protein factor that moves electrophoretically into the negatively charged matrix. This mechanism has been invoked to explain the transfer of the amphipathic helix constituting the import signal of matrix-targeted proteins (33Hannavy K. Rospert S. Schatz G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whereas most inner membrane transport processes, including that of proteins, require either the Δψ or ΔpH component of the electromotive force, transport of tRNA may be unusual in requiring both. This is probably a consequence of the high negative charge of the molecule as well as of its sequence-specific interaction with a positively charged species. According to this hypothesis, Δψ would be required for initiation, and ΔpH for completion of transfer of the phosphodiester backbone through the inner membrane. The co-import model of mitochondrial tRNA uptake (34Nagley P. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 67-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) is a concerted mechanism involving the passive transfer of RNA bound to a matrix-targeted carrier protein through the general insertion pore. However, the results presented here support a stepwise mechanism of import of tRNA through the two mitochondrial membranes. The first step consists of TAB-D arm recognition at the outer membrane followed by ATP-dependent transfer to the intermembrane space. The RNA then rapidly associates with the outer surface of the inner membrane. We assume that inner membrane binding is fast, because significant accumulation of RNA in the intermembrane space fraction was not observed, even at early times of incubation (Figs. 3 and 5). Subsequently, the RNA (possibly as an RNP complex) is transferred to the matrix by a process requiring the D arm signal as well as both the chemical and electrical components of the electromotive force. Attempts to define the biochemical components of the membrane-bound machinery are currently in progress.

https://openalex.org/W1993552295,"We have identified sites for epitope insertion in the murine secretory component (SC) by replacing individual surface-exposed loops in domains I, II, and III with the FLAG sequence (Crottet, P., Peitsch, M. C., Servis, C., and Corthésy, B. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31445–31455). We had previously shown that epitope-carrying SC reassociated with dimeric IgA (IgAd) can serve as a mucosal delivery vehicle. When analyzing the capacity of SC mutants to associate with IgAd, we found that all domain II and III mutants bound specifically with immobilized IgAd, and their affinity for IgAd was comparable to that of the wild type protein (IC50 ∼ 1 nm). We conclude that domains II and III in SC are permissive to local mutation and represent convenient sites to antigenize the SC molecule. No mutant bound to monomeric IgA. SC mutants exposing the FLAG at their surface maintained this property once bound to IgAd, thereby defining regions not required for high affinity binding to IgAd. Association of IgAd with SC mutants carrying a buried FLAG did not exposede novo the epitope, consistent with limited, local changes in the SC structure upon binding. Only wild type and two mutant SCs bound covalently to IgAd, thus implicating domains II and III in the correct positioning of the reactive cysteine in SC. This establishes that the integrity of murine SC domains II and III is not essential to preserve specific IgAd binding but is necessary for covalency to take place. Finally, SC mutants existing in the monomeric and dimeric forms exhibited the same IgAdbinding capacity as monomeric wild type SC known to bind with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We have identified sites for epitope insertion in the murine secretory component (SC) by replacing individual surface-exposed loops in domains I, II, and III with the FLAG sequence (Crottet, P., Peitsch, M.

The latter is transported by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)1 from submucosal sites into the lumen. The pIgR is expressed by epithelial cells in a variety of mucosal tissues and in rodents is further implicated in transport into bile through the liver (1Mestecky J. McGhee J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1987; 40: 515-519Google Scholar). The receptor can bind dimeric IgA (IgAd), polymeric IgA (IgAp), and IgM (which are produced by subepithelial plasma cells) but not monomeric IgA (IgAm) or IgG. The complex is internalized at the basolateral surface of the epithelium and transcytosed to the apical plasma membrane, where the extracellular portion of the receptor called secretory component (SC) is released by proteolytic cleavage and remains bound to IgA within a complex termed secretory IgA (sIgA) (2Brandtzaeg P. Krajci P. Lamm M.E. Kaetzel C.S. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. McGhee J.R. Bienenstock J. Handbook of Mucosal Immunology.

All three loops, referred to as B-C, D-E, and F-G in domain I are particularly implicated in binding to IgA (4Bakos M.-A. Kurosky A. Czerwinski E.W. Goldblum R.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1346-1352PubMed Google Scholar, 5Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in addition, some residues of loop E-F in the opposite face appear to be important for IgA binding. In contrast, deletion of domains II and III or individual deletion of domain IV and V of rabbit pIgR did not prevent binding to IgA in a qualitative cell-ligand binding assay (5Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A natural variant of rabbit SC lacking domains II and III can bind to IgA, although only in a noncovalent fashion (6Solari R. Kühn L. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1141-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Fonck C. Jaton J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1712-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human sIgA, a disulfide bridge within domain V is also involved in covalent binding to the Cα2 domain of IgA through a disulfide exchange mechanism (8Cunningham-Rundles C. Lamm M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1987-1991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lindh E. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Fallgreen-Gebauer E.

Species variations in the level of covalency between pIgR and IgA have been reported (11Knight K.L. Vetter M.L. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 595-598PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tamer C.M. Lamm M.E. Robinson J.K. Piskurich J.F. Kaetzel C.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 707-714PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that although not critical for the initial recognition of IgA, domains II to IV appear to position domain V such that disulfide exchange with IgA can take place. The mechanism for the selective recognition of IgAd over IgAm remains an additional open question. We have generated murine SC mutants with predicted exposed loops of domains I, II, and III replaced with the FLAG epitope (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to evaluate their IgA binding properties. We show that although the affinity of these mutants for IgA and the selectivity for IgAd over IgAm are both preserved, covalent binding is lost in all mutants but one. Given the pinpointing strategy designed here, this suggests that domains II and III are essential to the proper positioning of domain V. However, because binding to the anti-FLAG mAb is preserved in both free and IgAd-bound reactive SC mutants, we postulate that minor structural changes occur upon IgAd-mSC interactions. Dimeric SC-FLAG mutants were shown to be as good IgAdbinders as their monomeric counterparts. In the same assay, we found by direct comparison of mSC and pIgR mutants that mSC binds to IgAd with much reduced stringency. We conclude that mSC-FLAG mutants are useful 1) to study the topology of SC·IgAd complexes, 2) as short epitope carrier once combined with IgAd, 3) to tackle the binding specificity and stoichiometry of SC/pIgR IgAdcomplexes.

The buffer was changed to PBS containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide using a Centricon-50 filtration unit. Proteins were stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks following biotinylation. Purified IgAd from hybridoma ZAC3 (250 μg) was biotinylated using the same procedure with the exception that 10 mm sodium periodate was used for oxidation of the sugar moieties. Two mg each of purified rabbit IgG against unfolded mSC, respectively against the native form of mSC, were biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer and recovered and stored as indicated above for the mSC and IgAd proteins. The wells of Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates were coated with 50 μl of either purified IgAd (5 μg/ml) or IgAm (2.5 μg/ml) dissolved in PBS. Control wells were coated with murine IgG (Sigma, 2 μg/ml) or left uncoated. Wells were blocked with 0.2 ml of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl (pH 7.5)) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (Bio-Rad). Murine SC prepared by concanavalin A lectin chromatography (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at saturating concentration (500 ng/ml) in 0.1 ml of PBS were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, either rabbit IgG was applied to native mSC (10 μg/ml) or mAb M2 was applied to the FLAG sequence (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) with 1,2-phenylenediamine as the chromogen. Reactions were stopped with one volume of 2 m H2SO4, and plates were read at 492 nm using 620 nm as the reference wavelength. Microwells were coated with IgAd and blocked as indicated above. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. 0.1 ml of biotinylated mSC-FLAG:Cterm (100 ng/ml) was added to each well, and serial 2-fold dilutions of mSC-FLAG mutants were rapidly pipetted from a 20 μg/ml stock before incubation for 1 h. Control wells were incubated without competitor or without biotinylated SC. After washing, the bound biotinylated mSC was detected with HRP-conjugated ExtrAvidin diluted 1:1,000 (Sigma). After the last wash, the plate was brought to room temperature and developed as above. Results in Fig. 2 are expressed as percent of maximal biotinylated SC binding, which was obtained in the absence of competitor. The IC50 of the various proteins were defined as the concentration of competitor that inhibited by 50% the binding of biotinylated mSC-FLAG:Cterm. 500 ng of mSC-FLAG mutants were incubated for 1 h on ice in 50 μl of PBS in the presence of either mAb M2 or the murine IgGκ MOPC-31c as a control, both at 40 μg/ml. The SC-FLAG·Ab complexes were then applied to microwells coated with IgAd, blocked as described above, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, 50 μl of biotinylated IgG was applied to native mSC (40 μg/ml, protein A, purified) for 1 h at 4 °C and detected with HRP-coupled ExtrAvidin at 1:1,000 dilution. Identical amounts (corresponding to 200 ng of protein) of mSC mutants purified by concanavalin A-agarose chromatography were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated IgAd in 50 μl of PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Such conditions have been shown to permit full covalent association of SC·IgAd in vitro (16Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The volume was adjusted to 500 μl, 80 μl of streptavidin-agarose slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS was added, and the tubes were rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed four times with TENT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) before boiling in gel-loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol). Samples were separated in nonreducing, denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels before analysis by immunoblotting using rabbit antiserum to mSC and HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG and the chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Murine SC-FLAG mutant samples were diluted with 1 volume of gel-loading buffer (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol), boiled for 3 min, and fractionated in nonreducing, denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P (Millipore) was carried out with transfer buffer lacking SDS. Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) and 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v). Membranes carrying mSC-FLAG mutants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified IgAd at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in blocking buffer. Specific binding of IgAd was detected using biotinylated goat IgG to murine α chain (1:2,000 dilution) followed by HRP-coupled ExtrAvidin (Sigma; 1:3,000 dilution). Cell lysates containing mpIgR or mpIgR-FLAG:D2:BC mutant were subjected to the same protocol except that biotinylated IgAd was incubated in the overlay in place of IgAd. We have generated a series of mSC molecules wherein loops predicted to be surface-displayed had been replaced with the FLAG epitope (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The IgA binding capacity of the various mSC-FLAG mutants was determined by ELISA. IgAd or IgAmpurified from the mouse hybridoma ZAC3 (14Lüllau E. Heyse S. Vogel H. Marison I. von Stockar U. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16300-16309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was coated onto microwells and incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of the various SC-FLAG. Equilibrium was achieved within 1 h of incubation. 2P. Crottet, unpublished data. Fig.1 A shows that all mutants and wild type mSC were able to recognize IgAd, with the exception of mSC-FLAG:D1:FG, used as a negative control. Given that mutation of rabbit pIgR domain I loop F-G abolishes binding to IgA (5Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the selective binding of other mutants validates the option to select for substitution sites in domains II and III and reflects the sensitivity of the assay. Thus, the loops of mSC that carry the FLAG do not contain essential determinants necessary for specific recognition of IgAd despite their superficial localization in the molecular models. Furthermore, the lack of binding of the mutants to immobilized IgAm indicates that specific recognition of IgAd is preserved (Fig. 1 A). We next tested using ELISA whether the FLAG epitope was still displayed on the surface when the mutants are bound to IgAd. Fig. 1 B shows that the epitope was detectable in mSC-FLAG:Cterm, mSC-FLAG:D2-D3, or mSC-FLAG:D2:BC associated with IgAd to an extent similar to the free form (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other mutants not reacting with the anti-FLAG mAb M2 as unbound material remained undetectable. No signal was obtained with mSC-FLAG:D1:FG, since the latter does not bind to coated IgAd. This observation together with the absence of anti-FLAG reactivity following coating with IgAm2 demonstrates the specificity of the assay. Results in Fig. 1 A and these data show that we have designed mutant SC proteins that can both carry epitopes exposed or buried in recombinant sIgA. In terms of assembly, this indicates that the environmental changes induced by the epitope do not alter the binding of the mutants to IgAd, most likely reflecting a remote location with respect to the IgA polypeptides. To quantitatively determine the relative affinity of the various SC mutants for IgAd, we next performed competition ELISAs (16Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using mixtures of a fixed amount of biotinylated mSC-FLAG:Cterm and increasing amounts of each individual mutant. Fig. 2 shows that mutants displaying the FLAG sequence within domains II and III or at the carboxyl terminus were as good inhibitors as wild type recombinant mSC. Murine SC-FLAG:D1:FG was not inhibitory at the highest concentration tested, in agreement with data in Fig. 1. The concentration needed to reach 50% inhibition of binding of biotinylated mSC-FLAG:Cterm (IC50) was about 1 nm for wild type mSC and 1–2 nm for all the mutants except mSC-FLAG:D2-D3, which had a slightly lower affinity (6 nm; Table I). These results are consistent with domains II and III not being required for high affinity recognition of IgAd (Fig. 1, A–B; Refs. 5Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol.

None of the proteins bound significantly to IgAm. mo, mSC monomer; di, mSC dimer; −, no signal; +, intermediate signal; ++/+++, strong signal; ND, not determined. Some mutants did not expose the FLAG, neither in the free form nor when bound to IgAd. However, the interaction with IgAd was not prevented (Figs. 1 and2), suggesting that both the FLAG and neighboring residues are distant to the contact area with IgAd. We therefore tested whether binding to IgAd could be impaired by preincubation of the mutants with a 4-fold molar excess of mAb M2. Subsequent binding to immobilized IgAd was assessed by ELISA. Fig.3 shows that binding was not inhibited in any case and was even significantly enhanced for mutant mSC-FLAG:D3:DE. The lack of inhibition seen for mSC-FLAG:Cterm, mSC-FLAG:D2-D3, and mSC-FLAG:D2:BC is consistent with the FLAG being at the surface before and after binding to IgAd and domains II and III exhibiting a degree of flexibility not affecting IgAd recognition. As expected, mutants not recognized by the mAb M2 as free proteins keep binding IgAd efficiently. The increased binding of mSC-FLAG:D3:DE in the presence of mAb M2 can be explained by the formation of a ternary complex (IgAd·SC·M2), as detected by sieving chromatography under native (PBS) conditions, 3B. Corthésy, unpublished data. with M2 having induced conformational changes favoring association. In sIgA isolated from mouse milk, 70–80% of mSC is covalently linked to IgAd (19Parr E.L. Bozzola J.J. Parr M.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We thus examined to which extent SC-FLAG mutants can form covalent complexes with IgAd. Equimolar amounts of biotinylated IgAd and wild type mSC or mSC-FLAG mutants were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature before precipitation with streptavidin beads. Bound material was resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and the presence of free and IgAd-associated mSC-FLAG was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Monomers and dimers of all mutants were co-immunoprecipitated with IgAd, confirming that data in Fig. 1 reflect the actual binding of both species. Specificity was confirmed by the absence of signal for mSC-FLAG:D1:FG. No signal arose either when wild type mSC was immunoprecipitated in the absence of biotinylated IgAd or in the presence of IgAm.2 A higher M r band was detected in the case of mSC-FLAG:D3:DE, mSC-FLAG:Cterm, and wild type mSC, corresponding to covalent IgAd SC-FLAG complexes. Immunoprecipitation was quantitative, as reflected by the very similar signals seen for IgAd upon detection with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Thus, even though data in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 demonstrate preserved IgAd binding, long range effects cannot be excluded that are not compatible with covalent binding through a reactive disulfide bond in domain V of human SC. It is likely then that despite a preserved capacity to recognize each other, mSC mutants and IgAd polypeptides do not optimally position domain V for the disulfide interchange reaction to take place (9Lindh E. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Dimerization could be an additional barrier to the flexibility of the mSC molecule, and significantly, no mSC-FLAG mutant that makes dimers (Fig. 4 and Table I) associates with IgAd in a covalent manner, yet they exhibit the same binding capacity as their monomeric counterparts. The relative inaccessibility of the FLAG to immunodetection after SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transfer (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggests that partial renaturation of SC occurs on the blotting membrane. This raises the possibility of examining, using an overlay assay, whether IgAd in solution reassociates preferentially with either mutant SC monomers, dimers, or both. Fig.5 A shows that several mSC mutants could be recognized by IgAd. No signal was detected when IgAm was present in the overlay.2IgAd recognized both dimeric and monomeric mSC-FLAG:D2:BC, monomeric mSC-FLAG:D2:DE, dimeric and to a lesser extent monomeric mSC-FLAG:D2-D3, mSC-FLAG:Cterm, and wild type mSC. The pattern of proteins present was verified after stripping of the membrane and immunoblotting with IgG to mSC.2 The partial discrepancy with binding data obtained using mSC-FLAG proteins in solution (Figs. 1and 2) together with the efficiency of the assay when using wild type or mSC-FLAG:Cterm suggests that the mere presence of the FLAG precludes renaturation of a selection of mSC mutants. The assay is, however, reliable and convenient to rapidly test supernatants containing recombinant SC or mutant pIgR in cell extracts. We then tested the binding of IgAd to wild type mpIgR and the mpIgR-FLAG:D2:BC mutant. Although the SC counterpart of both proteins was recognized by IgAd, only the wild type pIgR can serve as a binding site on the membrane (Fig. 5 B). After stripping, immunodetection of the same blot with IgG to mSC detected both proteins, including monomeric and dimeric mpIgR-FLAG:D2:BC.2 This result is at variance with the recognition by IgAd of both monomeric and dimeric mSC-FLAG:D2:BC (Fig. 5 A) and argues in favor of a reduced binding stringency of SC as compared with pIgR. Thus, it appears that the mode of recognition of SC and of the complete receptor may differ. The presence of the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol during culture did not alter the ability of mSC-FLAG mutants to form dimers but changed the immunoreactivity of the epitope in some instances (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We determined the effect of this treatment on IgAd binding properties of the mutants. As seen in Fig.6 A, mSC-FLAG:D2-D3 was the only mutant whose ability to bind immobilized IgAd was affected significantly by this treatment. The control mutant mSC-FLAG:D1:FG did not bind to IgAd, and no mutants bound above background levels to IgAm. Fig. 6 B shows a similar experiment using mAb M2 for detection of the FLAG in mSC mutants bound to IgAd. Strikingly, the FLAG was well detected in IgAd-bound mSC-FLAG:D2-D3 despite the poor binding detected using the antibody to mSC, suggesting an exacerbated surface exposure of the FLAG. A strong signal was also obtained with mSC-FLAG:D3:CC′, in sharp contrast to what was seen when the protein was produced under normal conditions (Fig. 1 B). In this case, however, the treatment also increased the immunoreactivity of the FLAG in the free protein (13Crottet P. Peitsch M. Servis C. Corthésy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the C-C′ loop is no longer constrained b"
https://openalex.org/W2013094655,"The most common cause of severely elevated homocysteine or homocystinuria is inherited disorders in cystathionine β-synthase. The latter enzyme is a unique hemeprotein that catalyzes pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine, thus committing homocysteine to catabolism. A point mutation, V168M, has been described in a homocystinuric cell line and is associated with a B6-responsive phenotype. In this study, we have examined the kinetic properties of this mutant and demonstrate that the mutation affects the PLP but not the heme content. The ∼13-fold diminution in activity because of the mutation corresponds to an ∼7-fold decrease in the level of bound PLP. This may be explained by half of the sites activity associated with cystathionine β-synthase. The addition of PLP results in partial but not full restoration of activity to wild type levels. Elimination of the C-terminal quarter of the mutant protein results in alleviation of the catalytic penalty imposed by the V168M mutation. The resulting truncated protein is very similar to the corresponding truncated enzyme with wild type sequence and is now able to bind the full complement of both heme and PLP cofactors. These results indicate that the V168M mutation per se does not affect binding of PLP directly and that interactions between the regulatory C terminus and the catalytic N terminus are important in modulating the cofactor content and therefore the activity of the full-length enzyme. These studies provide the first biochemical explanation for the B6-responsive phenotype associated with a cystathionine β-synthase-impaired homocystinuric genotype.

These studies provide the first biochemical explanation for the B6-responsive phenotype associated with a cystathionine β-synthase-impaired homocystinuric genotype. Elevated levels of homocysteine constitute an independent risk factor for two apparently unrelated pathologies: neural tube defects (1Mills J.L. McPartlin J.M. Kirke P.N. Lee Y.J. Conle M.R. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1995; 345: 149-151Abstract PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and cardiovascular diseases (2Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). Severe hyperhomocysteinemia results from autosomal recessive mutations in enzymes that metabolize intracellular homocysteine. Of these, the most common cause of homocystinuria is a functional deficiency in cystathionine β-synthase (3Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York1995Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine.

In addition, the enzyme is regulated by the allosteric activator, AdoMet (5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.J. Pick A.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The role of the PLP, in analogy with related enzymes that catalyze β-replacement reactions, is to anchor serine and activate it for thiolate addition following elimination of the hydroxyl group (6Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The binding site for PLP is in the N terminus extending from residues 68–209 and is readily identified by the significant homology to other PLP proteins (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The PLP is bound as an internal aldimine to lysine 119 (8Kery V. Poneleit L. Meyer J.D. Manning M.C. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2710-2724Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The addition of serine to the enzyme results in fluorescence changes that are consistent with the formation of an unprotonated external aldimine and a second species that is tentatively identified as an aminoacrylate intermediate (9Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The role of the heme is less obvious. It is predicted to be bound to a sequence extending from residues 241–341 that is distantly related to other hemeproteins such as cytochrome P450 and sulfide dehydrogenase (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Reduction of the ferric enzyme is correlated with a decrease in enzyme activity (10Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), indicating that heme-linked oxidation state changes may regulate the activity of the enzyme. In addition, kinetic evidence indicates that the heme ligand, CO, binds competitively with respect to homocysteine, thus the binding of homocysteine must occur in the proximity of heme (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the small changes that are reported to occur in the heme Soret band upon addition of homocysteine (8Kery V. Poneleit L. Meyer J.D. Manning M.C. Kraus J.P.

A truncated and highly active form of the enzyme, CBSΔC143 (lacking the C-terminal 143 amino acids), has been described recently (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat.

Both the full-length and truncated forms of cystathionine β-synthase bind half the equivalents of serine relative to PLP suggesting half of the sites activity (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R.

About 50% of these mutations result in a pyridoxine-responsive clinical phenotype,i.e. treatment with high doses of the PLP precursor, pyridoxine, is clinically effective (13Kraus J.P. Mato J.M. Caballero A. III Workshop on Methionine Metabolism. Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain1996: 12-19Google Scholar). One such mutation is V168M (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) in which a substitution in the predicted PLP binding domain (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Kery V. Poneleit L. Meyer J.D. Manning M.C. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2710-2724Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is detrimental to catalysis (Fig. 1). Remarkably, this mutation can be suppressed by a second one that causes premature termination at codon 409 and leads to the elimination of 143 amino acid residues from the C terminus (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The activity of this truncated mutant enzyme, designated hereafter as V168M-ΔC143 (Fig. 1), is sufficient to functionally complement the cystathionine β-synthase deficiency in yeast and is reported to be 13-fold higher than that of the full-length mutant, V168M (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for the alleviation of the penalty imposed by a mutation in the catalytic domain, by deletion of the regulatory domain, is unknown. In this study, we have characterized the V168M and V168M-ΔC143 forms of cystathionine β-synthase and report on how interactions between the catalytic and regulatory domains dictate the PLP content of the enzyme. These studies provide the first biochemical explanation for pyridoxine responsiveness, a phenotype observed in a large number of homocystinuric patients. Bovine serum albumin, PLP, thrombin, 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzene), l-homocysteine thiolactone, dithiothreitol, DEAE-Sepharose, and glutathione were obtained from Sigma. [14C]serine (158 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GlutathioneS-transferase-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose (fast flow) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Homocysteine was prepared from l-homocysteine thiolactone as reported previously (14Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). AdoMet 1,4-butane disulfonate was a generous gift from Knoll Farmaceutici Spa (Milano, Italy). The full-length and truncated forms of the V168M mutant of human cystathionine β-synthase were purified as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins using recombinant expression systems (pGEXCBS1364 and pGEXCBS1364S, respectively) reported previously (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The constructs were a generous gift from Warren Kruger (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia). The recombinantEscherichia coli were grown, and the enzymes were purified as described previously (10Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. The cells were grown at 25 °C, and the initial pH of the Luria broth growth medium was adjusted to 8.5 with sodium hydroxide. The enzyme activity was assayed under aerobic conditions using 30 mm radiolabeled serine and 15 mm homocysteine as described previously (10Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For the V168M enzyme, severe substrate inhibition was observed beyond 10 mm homocysteine concentration. Therefore, only for the assays involving V168M, homocysteine was lowered from 15 mm, the concentration used in the standard assay, to 8 mm. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of stock homocysteine solution was determined immediately before the experiments by titration with dithiobis(nitrobenzene) and estimated using ε412 of 13,600 m−1cm−1. Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed in the aerobic assay as described previously (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μg of enzyme rather than homocysteine. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for either 30 min or 1 h for assays containing V168M-CBSΔC143 and V168M, respectively. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The radiolabeled product,14C-labeled cystathionine, was separated from14C-labeled serine as described previously (10Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PLP was removed by incubating the enzyme (1.1 and 1.3 mg for V168M and V168M-CBSΔC143, respectively) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 13 and 15 mm hydroxylamine (for V168M and V168M-CBSΔC143, respectively) for 3 days at 4 °C. The released oxime was separated from the protein by Centricon filtration, and the concentration of PLP in the filtrate was determined using a fluorimetric method described previously (9Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The metal content of CBS preparations was analyzed by plasma emission spectroscopy (15Jones J.B.J. Commun. Soil. Sci. Plant Anal. 1977; 8: 349-365Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) at the Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia, Athens. Twenty metal ions including the common transition metal ions are detectable by plasma emission spectroscopy. The full-length and truncated V168M mutants were purified using the procedures developed for the corresponding wild type enzymes (TableI). Significant differences were observed in the levels of expression of the two mutant proteins. The final yield from a 6-liter cell culture for V168M was ∼7 versus 23 mg for the full-length wild type enzyme. In contrast, the truncated protein carrying a mutation, V168M-ΔC143, was obtained in a significantly higher yield (220 mg) than the truncated wild type enzyme (70 mg) (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The basis for the apparent differences in expression of the wild type and mutant enzymes is not known. The proteins used in these studies were ≥ 90% pure. The specific activities for the mutants reported in Table I were determined using the standard assay (containing 15 mm homocysteine) in which the enzyme is preincubated with serine (10Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the wild type but not the mutant enzymes operate under V maxconditions (see below).Table IPurification summary for wild type and mutant cystathionine β-synthaseProcedureWild typeaData for the wild type enzyme were obtained from Ref.10.V168MV168M-ΔC143S.A.bS.A. is specific activity expressed as μmol of cystathionine formed/h/mg at 37 °C.Protein (mg)S.A.Protein (mg)S.A.Protein (mg)Sonicate6.525070.7228074257Q-Sepharose151597.3675631176GlutathioneS-transferase186692468111413Thrombin204553271152333DEAE27823356.7200220a Data for the wild type enzyme were obtained from Ref.10Taoka S.

Open table in a new tab The full-length and truncated enzymes exhibit different oligomeric organizations with the former being a homotetramer and the latter a homodimer (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cofactor stoichiometry is reported per oligomeric unit in TableII. Fluorimetric titrations were employed to determine the PLP content of the full-length and truncated V168M mutant forms. The dimeric V168M-ΔC143 enzyme binds two PLPs like the truncated wild type enzyme, whereas the full-length mutant, V168M, has 0.6 PLPs versus 4 PLPs in wild type enzyme. The heme content of the two mutants was estimated from their UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 2) and by plasma emission spectroscopy. Both mutant forms exhibit prominent Soret bands at 428 nm consistent with the presence of low spin, six coordinate ferric heme. The heme α/β bands in the absorption spectrum are free from contributions from the bound PLPs, permitting direct quantitation of the bound hemes. From this analysis (using ε549 = 23 mm−1cm−1 for two hemes in the wild type tetramer), a stoichiometry of 2 hemes/tetramer is estimated for V168M, which is the same as for the wild type enzyme (Table II). The truncated enzymes with and without the V168M mutation exhibit very similar UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 2). Based on an ε428 of 185 mm−1 cm−1 (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a stoichiometry of 2 hemes/dimer is calculated for V168M-ΔC143 (Table II). The heme content of the mutant enzymes was confirmed by plasma emission spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of 2 hemes/tetramer in V168M and 2 hemes/dimer in V168M-ΔC143, as has been observed for the corresponding proteins with wild type sequences (7Taoka S.

Open table in a new tab Because the V168M mutation was described in a B6-responsive homocystinuric patient, the effect of exogenous PLP on the activity of the enzyme was examined (TableIII). The wild type enzyme is already completely saturated with PLP, so further addition of this cofactor to the assay mixture has no effect on enzyme activity as expected. In contrast, the activity of V168M, which is partially saturated with this cofactor, increased 2-fold upon the addition of 250 μmPLP. The activity of V168M was measured under standard assay conditions, except that the concentration of homocysteine was reduced from 15 to 8 mm because of substrate inhibition. Because the order of substrate addition affects the activity of cystathionine β-synthase (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the assays used in these analyses were initiated by the addition of enzyme rather than homocysteine. The activity of the truncated mutant form, V168M-ΔC143, is virtually unaffected by the addition PLP, consistent with it being completely saturated with this cofactor (Table III). The V168M mutant displays saturation kinetics in response to increasing concentrations of PLP (Fig.3) yielding an estimated apparentK act for PLP of ∼62 μm.Table IIIComparison of the effect of PLP and AdoMet additions to wild type and V168M cystathionine β-synthaseAdditionsSpecific activityaSpecific activity is reported as μmol of product formed/h/mg protein.V168M-ΔC143V168MWild typebData for the wild type enzyme were repeated under the same assay conditions as for the mutants in which the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme rather than homocysteine.None531 ± 622 ± 0.2244 ± 9PLP583 ± 1047 ± 5207 ± 14AdoMet571 ± 932 ± 1.7445 ± 48PLP and AdoMet522 ± 2678 ± 0.3359 ± 15a Specific activity is reported as μmol of product formed/h/mg protein.b Data for the wild type enzyme were repeated under the same assay conditions as for the mutants in which the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme rather than homocysteine. Open table in a new tab The allosteric effector, AdoMet, elicits an ∼1.6-fold increase in the specific activity of the V168M mutant that is similar to the ∼1.8-fold increase seen with the wild type enzyme (Table III). Enhancement of enzyme activity by PLP and AdoMet is independent of each other; together their effects are additive. The truncated mutant, V168M-ΔC143, is unaffected by the presence of AdoMet, consistent with the loss of the allosteric effector binding domain upon elimination of the C-terminal end (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The concentration dependencies of the V168M and wild type enzyme activities on AdoMet were examined (Fig. 4). TheK act value is too low to be estimated reliably. However, no significant differences were observed between the wild type and V168M mutant enzymes, indicating that the mutation spares AdoMet-dependent allosteric regulation of cystathionine β-synthase. The steady-state kinetic behavior of V168M was distinct from that of the corresponding full-length wild type enzyme. Notably, severe substrate inhibition was observed at moderately high homocysteine concentrations (Fig.5). Because of the steep inhibition of enzyme activity above 10 mm homocysteine, we were unable to fit the data to an equation incorporating the term for substrate inhibition in a sequential bisubstrate reaction (16Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London1995Google Scholar). TheK m for serine (determined at 8 mmhomocysteine concentration) for the full-length enzyme is 14 ± 3 mm. In contrast, the kinetic properties of the truncated mutant, V168M-ΔC143, were similar (data not shown) to those reported for the corresponding wild type protein (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutation of V168 to methionine in cystathionine β-synthase is correlated with homocystinuria (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This residue resides in the putative PLP binding domain (Fig. 1) that is predicted based on the high level of homology between cystathionine β-synthase and related PLP enzymes such as tryptophan synthase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The single mutation, V168M, has a profound influence on the PLP content and, consequently, the catalytic activity of cystathionine β-synthase. The PLP content is ∼7-fold lower than in the wild type enzyme. This decrease is reflected in the 13-fold lower activity of V168M (32 and 22 μmol/h/mg with and without AdoMet, respectively) versus the wild type (445 and 244 μmol/h/mg with and without AdoMet, respectively) enzyme measured in the absence of added PLP (Table III). This could be explained by half of the sites activity that is exhibited by cystathionine β-synthase (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 9Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The addition of PLP results in only partial restoration of enzyme activity. The extent of PLP saturation of cystathionine β-synthase has been demonstrated to be dependent on the extent of heme saturation (17Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because V168M has the same complement of heme as the wild type enzyme, the lack of full restoration of enzyme activity in the presence of PLP cannot be explained by low heme occupancy. In principle, the V168M mutant may be expected to exhibit the same level of activity as the wild type enzyme in the presence of PLP. However, under in vitro conditions, the specific activity of V168M that is measured is ∼4-fold lower than that of the wild type enzyme under similar conditions (Table III). This lower activity could be because of the severe substrate inhibition by homocysteine at concentrations beyond 10 mm, which is not seen with the wild type enzyme. The basis for this inhibition is presently unknown. On the other hand, we have been unable to fully reconstitute even wild type cystathionine β-synthase depleted of PLP by subsequent addition of this cofactor (9Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the limited PLP-dependent recovery of activity may be a general property of cystathionine β-synthase that is common to both the wild type and the V168M enzyme forms. The effect of the V168M mutation on PLP saturation does not result from direct interactions between this residue and the cofactor whose binding it affects. This is clearly demonstrated by the alleviation of the binding and associated catalytic penalties imposed by the mutation by truncation of the C-terminal regulatory domain. The shortened and dimeric enzyme thus generated, V168M-ΔC143, is virtually indistinguishable from the truncated wild type enzyme with identical boundaries. The kinetics of the truncated wild type enzyme have been characterized in detail recently (7Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (in press)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It contains two hemes and two PLPs as does V168M-ΔC143 and displays both higherV max and higher K m values for the two substrates. Hence, removal of the C-terminal quarter of the protein that includes the regulatory AdoMet binding domain mitigates the adverse consequences of the V168M mutation on the full-length protein. These data lead us to propose that V168 is involved in interactions between the catalytic and regulatory domains and that this interplay is important in wild type cystathionine β-synthase for determining the PLP saturation and therefore activity (Fig.6). The PLP domain of cystathionine β-synthase is likely to be very similar in organization to the corresponding domains in threonine deaminase and tryptophan synthase whose structures are known (18Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In threonine deaminase from E. coli, the corresponding valine is conserved at position 108, whereas in tryptophan synthase, the analogous residue is tyrosine 133. Other PLP enzymes, such as threonine synthase (Thrc Brela) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (1a1d Psesp) also have conserved valines in this position. The β-sheet containing Val-108 in threonine deaminase is not in direct contact with the PLP or the lysine involved in Schiff base formation (18Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and its location therefore suggests an indirect influence on the binding of PLP, consistent with the model proposed in Fig. 6. In summary, these data provide the first biochemical explanation for the B6-responsive phenotype associated with a particular homocystinuric genotype. The approximately 7-fold lower saturation of the enzyme with PLP in V168M leads to a 13-fold lower level of enzyme activity. Addition of exogenous PLP leads to a partial but not full rescue of catalytic activity. These studies provide intriguing insight into the interactions between the C-terminal regulatory and the N-terminal catalytic domains that modulate cofactor binding to the protein. The detrimental effects of a number of mutations in cystathionine β-synthase have been reported to be alleviated by C-terminal truncation (11Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The scattered locations of these mutations lead us to speculate that they, like Val-168, may be involved in interactions between the regulatory and catalytic domains. Deletion of the regulatory domain in the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent heme protein cystathionine β-synthase alleviates the defect observed in a catalytic site mutant.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 275Issue 11PreviewPage 31256, right-hand column, seventh line from the bottom: This sentence should read: “A recently described cystathionine-synthase mutation is V168M (11) in which a substitution in the predicted PLP binding domain (7, 8) is detrimental to catalysis (Fig. 1).

To load recombinant secretory IgA with multiple B and T epitopes and extend its biological functions, we selected, based on molecular modeling, five surface-exposed sites in domains II and III of murine SC. Loops predicted to be exposed at the surface of SC domains were replaced with the DYKDDDDK octapeptide (FLAG). Another two mutants were obtained with the FLAG inserted in between domains II and III or at the carboxyl terminus of SC. As shown by mass spectrometry, internal substitution of the FLAG into four of the mutants induced the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers. Three of the dimers and two of the monomers from SC mutants could be affinity-purified using an antibody to the FLAG, mapping them as candidates for insertion. FLAG-induced dimerization also occurred with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and might reflect the so-far nondemonstrated capacity of the receptor to oligomerize. By co-expressing in COS-7 cells and epithelial Caco-2 cells two pIgR constructs tagged at the carboxyl terminus with hexahistidine or FLAG, we provide the strongest evidence reported to date that the pIgR dimerizes noncovalently in the plasma membrane in the absence of polymeric IgA ligand.

Hence, the biological properties of a monoclonal IgA and of the cognate SC-IgA complex can now be tested in parallel in different systems.

Mice immunized orally with this complex developed an antibody response directed at both the heterologous SC and the epitope, which was surface-exposed.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This unexpected drawback prompted us to identify other potential sites of insertion for linear epitopes that will not affect secretion or association with IgAd. We concentrated our mapping analysis on domains II and III of SC because they do not play any documented role in IgA binding and are even missing in certain rabbit alleles coding for a truncated, yet active, pIgR (17Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Solari R. Kühn L. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1141-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domain I of rabbit SC exhibits two antiparallel β-pleated sheets shaped by nine rigid successive β-strands connected by protruding flexible loops (17Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular models of mSC domains II and III were constructed and shown to fold with a similar pattern. A selection of loops was replaced by the FLAG octapeptide for two major reasons. 1) The peptide is highly hydrophilic and thus more prone to remain exposed on the molecule surface; 2) recognition of the peptide by the commercial monoclonal antibody M2 confirms its surface exposure. To facilitate the interpretation of the data, target sites were modified individually. Surprisingly, epitope substitution in most locations inside SC domains II and III induced the formation of SC homodimers through disulfide bridges. In the SC dimer, structural constraints or buried residues modulate the M2 reactivity against each mutant differentially, yielding clues about its topology of association. This implies that several insertion sites in the new dimeric SC we have generated and analyzed either expose a peptide to (ideal for B epitopes) or hide it from (valuable for T epitopes) the external medium. The unexpected tendency of mSC-FLAG mutants to dimerize prompted us to extend the analysis to the full-length pIgR carrying the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic regions missing in SC. We found that the pIgR counterpart of one mutant substituted in the second domain formed covalent dimers as the corresponding SC, reflecting the so-far undetected dimeric nature of the receptor. We then examined the behavior of the intact pIgR with either the 6xHis or the FLAG tag sequence fused at the carboxyl terminus. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that pIgR exists as noncovalent homodimers in the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells and Caco-2 cells in the absence of polymeric IgA ligand. Molecular models of domain I and of the domain II-domain III module of wild type and mutant mSC were constructed as described by Coyne et al. (17Coyne R.S. Siebrecht M. Peitsch M.C. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31620-31625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their quality was assessed by the three-dimensional/one-dimensional profile matching procedure of Lüthy et al. (19Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar). The 3095-base pair-long cDNA-encoding murine pIgR (20Piskurich J.F. Blanchard M.H. Youngman K.R. France J.A. Kaetzel C.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1735-1747PubMed Google Scholar), a gift of Dr. Charlotte S. Kaetzel (Case Western Reserve University), was cloned into the EcoRI site of Bluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). Because the authentic carboxyl terminus of mSC has not yet been precisely mapped, we chose, based on comparison with human SC (21Eiffert H. Quentin E. Wiederhold M. Hillemeir S. Decker J. Weber M. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), to stop the translation of the protein after Arg596. The 3′ region coding for the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail was replaced by the double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for the amino acids Pro589 to Arg596 containing half of a 5′ SmaI site and a 3′ stop codon, an EcoRI site, and half of a 3′ NotI site (Fig.1 A). The resulting plasmid was named pBSmSC. The same approach served to generate the construct pBSmSC-FLAG:Cterm using a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG octapeptide. Oligonucleotides were all obtained from Microsynth GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). The 5′-untranslated region of the murine pIgR cDNA in pCB6 (22Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was deleted according to the strategy described in Fig. 1 B, using primers mSCBglMet(+) and mSCKpn1(−) (TableI), yielding plasmid pCB6mpIgR(-5′). To allow expression of wild type mSC and mSC-FLAG:Cterm, the 3′KpnI-EcoRI fragment of the constructs in Fig.1 A was introduced into pCB6mpIgR(-5′) cut with the same two enzymes.Table IList of primers used for PCR engineering of mSC/mplgR sequencesmSCBglMet (+)5′–CCAGATCTCACAAGCAATGAGGCTCTACTTGmSCKpn1 (−)5′–CCGGTACCCAGGCCACACTTGmSCKpn1 (+)5′–GGGAGCTACAAGTGTGGCCTGGmSCNhe1 (−)5′–TAAAGCAGCTCTGGCTCAGGCGmSCNhe1 (+)5′–GAATGTTGACCTCCAGGTGCpCB6 (−)5′–GGCCAGGAGAGGCACTGGGGAGFLD1cdr3 (+)5′–GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTGTCCTTCGATGTCAGCCTGGAGFLD1cdr3 (−)5′–CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCACACTTGTAGCTCCCAGTGTCGTCFLD2cdr1 (+)5′–GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGAAGAAATCCCTGTGTAAGAAGACFLD2cdr1 (−)5′–CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCATTCAATGGTCACATTTCTGCCFLD2cdr2 (+)5′–GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGTATTCTATGTCAACATTAGTCACFLD2cdr2 (−)5′–CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAAGTTTTGCTCTGCCTATATAGCD3D2FLin (−)5′–CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAACATTCTTCTTATCAGCACTAGGD3D2FLout (−)5′–CAGGCGCTAGCACCTGGAGGTCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCFLD3op2 (+)5′–GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGTGATGTGATCATTAACACCCFLD3op2 (−)5′–CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCACAGATATTTGGCCTCGTTTGCFLD3cdr2 (+)5′–GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTTCAGTGTGTTGATCACAGGCCTGFLD3cdr2 (−)5′–CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTATCAGGATCCTGCCCTCAAAGTCmSCSma1 (+)5′–CAAAGCCATTCCAAATCCCGGmplgFLin (−)5′–TCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCGTGGACCTGTGCAGCmplgFLout (−)5′–GCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCmplgH6in (−)5′–ATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGACCTGTGCAGCTATGGmplgH6out (−)5′–GCTCTAGACTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGACSee “Experimental Procedures” for the various PCR strategies involved.

Nucleotides within restriction sites are underlined. We used recombinant PCR (23Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) to introduce into pCB6mSC(-5′) one copy of the FLAG coding sequence at sites defined according to the molecular models (Table II and Fig.2). “Inside” primers were designed to contain the FLAG coding sequence as the overlapping region,e.g. primers FLD1cdr3(−) and FLD1cdr3(+) (Table I). “Outside” primers were designed to permit the amplification of products exhibiting restriction sites adapted to the substitution of wild type mSC sequences in pCB6. The pairs of outside primers and restriction enzymes used were: mSCBglMet(+) and mSCNhe1(−), withBglII and NheI (domain I mutant); mSCKpn1(+) and mSCNhe1(−), with KpnI and NheI (domain II mutants); mSCNhe1(+) and pCB6(−), with NheI andEcoRI (domain III mutants). The FLAG coding sequence was inserted between domains II and III (between residues 215 and 216) by using two successive PCRs. The product amplified with primers mSCKpn1(+) and D3D2FLin(−) was recovered from an agarose gel and reamplified with primers mSCKpn1(+) and D3D2FLout(−) to elongate the domain II carboxyl terminus by the FLAG sequence and a NheI site. Insertion of the Kpn I-NheI-digested product resulted in the generation of plasmid pCB6mSC-FLAG:D2-D3(-5′). The regions that have been amplified by PCR were sequenced (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). All the mSC constructs, although keeping the original Kozak and signal peptide sequences, lack both the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. The plasmid encoding the mpIgR with the FLAG sequence replacing loop B-C of domain II (pCB6mpIgR-FLAG:D2:BC(-5′)) was obtained by cloning theKpnI-NheI fragment obtained from the mSC-FLAG:D2:BC(-5′) construct into pCB6mpIgR(-5′).

Boldface residues are conserved after replacement with the FLAG sequence given in the lower line. For tagging the receptor with a FLAG epitope following Asp748 (deleting the last five residues), mpIgR coding sequences were first amplified by PCR using primers mSCSma1(+) and mpIgFLin(−) (Table I). The gel-purified PCR fragment was reamplified using primers mSCSma1(+) and mpIgFLout(−), digested withXmaI and XbaI, and cloned into Bluescript II carrying the mpIgR KpnI/EcoRI fragment cut with the same enzymes. This cloning intermediate was then treated withKpnI and XbaI, and the resulting mSC fragment was substituted for the wild type fragment in pCB6mpIgR(-5′) described above, yielding plasmid pCB6mpIgR:FLAG(-5′). The same strategy was followed to append five histidine residues after His747 of pIgR (deleting the last six residues), using primers mSCSma1(+), mpIgH6in(−), and mpIgH6out(−) in the two sequential PCR amplifications, yielding plasmid pCB6mpIgR:His6(-5′). The production of rabbit antiserum to denatured mSC has been described previously (25Hendrickson B.A. Rindisbacher L. Corthésy B. Kendall D. Waltz D.A. Neutra M.R. Seidman J.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 750-754PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of rabbit antiserum against the native conformation of mSC and affinity purification of derived IgGs is decribed elsewhere (54Crottet P. Cottet S. Corthésy B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rabbit IgGs were batch-purified using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2 mg of rabbit IgG to native mSC were biotinylated with biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified mAb M2 and agarose-bound M2 (M2 affinity gel) were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co., and penta-HisTM mAb was from Qiagen. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) was supplied by Sigma, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was bought from Cappel. COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). All DNAs were prepared using the MaxiPrep kit of Qiagen and used without further purification. Two series of 107 cells in 0.4 ml of PBS were transfected by electroporation (400 V, 250 microfarads) for about 10 ms in 0.4-cm cuvettes (Bio-Rad) with 25 μg of the pCB6mSC constructs. Transfection of COS-7 cells with FLAG and 6xHis-tagged pCB6mpIgR constructs was performed with 20 μg of DNA when a single construct was used or with 10 μg of each DNA when they were used in combination. To allow expression of mSC and mpIgR derivatives, cells were then seeded into 15-cm dishes (∼ 2 × 107 cells in 20 ml of medium), the medium was replaced after 20 h, and cultures were maintained in fresh medium for 4 more days. Caco-2 cells (obtained from Dr. Eric Pringault, Pasteur Institute, Paris) were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Glutamax-I supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed), 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mmHEPES, 1% nonessential amino acids, 0.1% transferrin (Life Technologies), and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. 2 × 107cells were transfected with FLAG and 6xHis-tagged pCB6mpIgR constructs in several batches using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacter's instructions. To allow expression of mpIgR derivatives, cells were then seeded into a 175-cm2 T-flask (∼2 × 107 cells in 20 ml of medium), and cultures were maintained in complete medium for 7 days. Supernatants containing mSC proteins were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and supplemented with 1% (v/v) Trasylol® (aprotinin; Bayer) and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. Proteins were purified within 2 days after storage at 4 °C. To analyze intracellular contents, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed by scraping in the presence of 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and Complete™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reconstituted from 1 pellet in 50 ml of buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were stored at −20 °C until use. For expression conducted in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, fresh medium containing 2.5 mm of the reducing agent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added the day after transfection, and cells were left for 36 h. Supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and supplemented with 1% (v/v) Trasylol®, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 30 mm iodoacetamide. To recover pIgR proteins, cells were washed twice with PBS before incubation for 5 min in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2). Swollen cells were lyzed by scrapping in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer complemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), 1 mm leupeptin, and 50 μl of CompleteTM reconstituted from 1 pellet in 50 ml of PBS. The addition of leupeptin was required to preserve the integrity of the pIgR (see “Results”). The cell lysate was transferred to a fresh siliconized 1.5-ml tube, and cell debris and nuclei were pelleted at 3,000 × g by centrifugation. Aliquots of the clarified lysate were stored at −20 °C before use. All chromatographic steps were performed at 4 °C. Glycosylated recombinant mSC-FLAG proteins were enriched from COS-7 cell-conditioned media on individual 2-ml ConA-agarose (Vector Laboratories) columns equilibrated in binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2). After extensive washing, elution was performed following an overnight incubation at 4 °C with binding buffer containing 0.5 mα-methyl-mannopyranoside (Sigma), and the eluates were concentrated using Centricon-50 cartridges in PBS containing 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. A portion of each preparation was then applied to individual 1-ml M2 affinity gel columns equilibrated in TBS buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl (pH 7.5)). After extensive washing with TBS, mSC-FLAG proteins were eluted with 7 column volumes of TBS containing 50 μg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK; synthesized at the Institut de Biochimie, Université de Lausanne, Switzerland). The peptide was washed out by repeated passages over a Centricon-50 cartridge (Amicon), whereas the buffer was exchanged for PBS containing 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. Purified proteins were stored at 4 °C until further use. The columns could be used several times after sequential treatment with 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.0) and 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) without loss of binding capacity. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C. To study the monomeric or polymeric nature of mSC-FLAG polypeptides, 0.2-ml samples were injected into a 30 × 1-cm Superose 12 HR 10/30 column coupled to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and run in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 250 μl were recovered, and 15-μl aliquots were analyzed by immunodetection using the antisera described above. The wells of Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of affinity-purified IgG to native mSC (54Crottet P. Cottet S. Corthésy B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (2 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium carbonate/bicarbonate (pH 9.6)). Wells were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2 ml of TBS buffer containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.05% (w/v) Tween-20 (Bio-Rad). Samples containing mSC proteins were serially diluted into 50 μl of PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 50 μg/well of purified mSC-FLAG:Cterm (0 to 200 ng/ml) was used as a standard. After washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, bound mSC was detected using biotinylated IgG (40 μg/ml) to native mSC. HRP-coupled ExtrAvidin (Sigma; 1:1,000) was developed with 50 μl of 1,2-phenylenediamine as a chromogen. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and plates were read at 492 nm using 620 nm as reference wavelength. Crude lysates, mSC-FLAG preparations, affinity-purified proteins, or immunoprecipitated materials were separated in 6 or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels with or without 0.1 mdithiothreitol. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described in Rindisbacher et al. (8Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

Primary antibodies used were the rabbit IgG to denatured or native mSC (5 μg/ml, purified on protein A-Sepharose) or the mAb M2 to FLAG (0.75 μg/ml). Bound antibodies were detected using appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary reagents (all used at 1:3,000 dilution) and the ECL reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was obtained from Aldrich, HPLC grade trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Pierce; HPLC grade water came from Romil Ltd (Cambridge, U.K.), and acetonitrile was provided by Biosolve Ltd (Barneveld, Netherlands). All the other chemicals were of the highest purity and were used without further purification. The buffer of protein samples was exchanged against 50 mmammonium bicarbonate using a Centricon-50 cartridge, lyophilized, and dissolved in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at a concentration of 12.5 pmol/μl. 1 μl of the protein solution was mixed with 9 μl of sinapinic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H20:acetonitrile (2:1 v/v). 1 μl of the mixture was applied on the gold-plated target and air-dried before transfer into the source of the mass spectrometer. MALDI mass spectra were obtained on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager RPTM mass spectrometer using a 337-nm nitrogen laser, a 25-kV accelerating potential, and a delayed extraction time of 300 ns. Samples were optically controlled using a video camera. External calibration of the MALDI spectra in the linear mode was carried out using bovine serum albumin. Identical amounts of each mSC protein were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C under gentle rocking with 0.5 ml of TBS buffer containing 60 μl of M2 affinity gel. After centrifugation, beads were washed with TBS and eluted overnight at 4 °C with 45 μl of TBS containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. 15-μl aliquots of eluate were removed and boiled with 1 volume of gel-loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol) for immunoblotting with rabbit IgG to denatured mSC. Cell lysates were diluted 6-fold with cold TBS (final volume 480 μl) and combined in siliconized 2.2-ml tubes with 60 μl of anti-FLAG slurry (M2 affinity gel) equilibrated in TBS, 0.02% sodium azide. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with TENT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), and the beads were specifically eluted with 50 μg/ml FLAG peptide DYKDDDDK. The eluate was mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer with or without dithiothreitol, boiled for 3 min, and loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and after blocking in TBS-0.05% Tween 20, the blot was sequentially incubated with 0.1 μg/ml Penta-HisTM mAb and 1:3,000 goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific), HRP-conjugated. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to visualize the precipitated receptors. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 μg/ml Penta-HisTM mAb. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the pIgR-antibody complexes were precipitated with 60 μl of precleared protein G-Sepharose bead slurry (Ame"
https://openalex.org/W1966376121,"A 1532-base pair 5′-flanking region of the gene encoding rat type III hexokinase has been cloned and sequenced. The total sequence includes positions −1548 to −17 (A of the translational start ATG as position +1). Using luciferase reporter constructs transfected into PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) and L2 (rat lung) cells, basal promoter activity has been associated with sequence between −182 and −89. This includes a single transcriptional start site, an adenine at position −134 identified by primer extension. Together with previously cloned cDNA sequence, this accounts for an mRNA of approximately 3.9 kilobases, found by Northern blotting of RNA from rat lung and kidney. Sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site was devoid of canonical TATA and CAAT elements. An octamer 1 (Oct-1) binding site, located between positions −166 and −159 was shown by deletion analysis and site-directed mutation to be critical for promoter activity. Nuclear extracts from PC12 cells contained a protein (or proteins) specifically binding the octamer sequence, and supershift experiments with anti-Oct-1 indicated involvement of this ubiquitously expressed transcription factor in the complex. Sequence including the Oct-1 site and immediately adjacent regions was protected from DNase I digestion in footprinting experiments with nuclear extracts from PC12 cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that levels of type III hexokinase mRNA in rat tissues increased in the order brain"
https://openalex.org/W1976321853,"The complex of the murine class II histocompatibility molecules I-Ak with high affinity binding peptides were resistant to denaturation when examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at various pH levels. In contrast, complexes made with low affinity binding peptides were highly sensitive to denaturation by SDS. This effect was more pronounced at low pH. Placing a photoactivatable probe at the amino terminus of the peptides resulted in their covalent linkage to soluble I-Akmolecules. We found an inverse relationship between the capacity of peptides to form SDS-stable complexes with I-Ak and their extent of covalent association with either the α or β chain. The relationship held true for three different peptides in which the main anchor residues were changed so as to affect their binding affinity for I-Ak molecules. Thus, high affinity peptides generate a complex in which the motion of their amino termini was restricted, whereas complexes of low affinity peptides are more flexible. In agreement with this observation, complexes of I-Ak with high affinity peptides were highly resistant to proteolysis, in contrast to those formed with weakly binding peptides, which were more likely to be cleaved.

Complexes with low affinity peptides generate a structure with enhanced flexibility as compared with complexes with high affinity peptides. major histocompatibility complex antigen-presenting cell polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline iodoazidosalicylic acid 4- morpholineethanesulfonic acid We have been examining the interaction of peptides with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 molecules, attempting to relate binding interactions to biological responses. Here, we examine the degree to which a peptide has conformational flexibility when bound to a class II MHC molecule. This aspect can be important to its fate during intracellular traffic and during its interaction with a T cell. To examine this point, we analyzed peptide-MHC complexes using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), evaluating the effects of pH on the resistance or susceptibility to denaturation. Importantly, we used photoactivatable peptides, to examine their restriction or freedom to covalently link to MHC molecules. Finally, we also examined the protease sensitivity of various peptide-MHC complexes. We, as well as other laboratories, examined the behavior of the ternary complexes of peptides with the α plus β chains of class II MHC molecules under various physicochemical conditions, such as pH, temperature, and denaturing agents such as SDS. Early studies indicated that class II molecules were resistant to denaturation under SDS-PAGE conditions, if they contained bound peptides of high binding affinity (1Sadegh-Nasseri S. Germain R.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 2Germain R.N. Hendrix L.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3Stern L.J. Wiley D.C.

A. 1993; 90: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Studying the I-Ak class II molecules, we found that peptides resulted in either stable or unstable complexes with I-Ak, i.e. SDS-resistant or SDS-sensitive complexes (4Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (The complexes of peptide-class II molecules resist or are sensitive to dissociation if subjected to the SDS-PAGE at room temperature, i.e. stable and unstable complexes, respectively; at 100 °C the components of the complex always dissociate.) The conditions that determined stable or unstable SDS complexes were related to the presence of high affinity binding peptides in which, first, a critical P1 anchor residue was represented by an appropriate amino acid side chain (with I-Ak, that of aspartic acid or glutamine) and, second, the polypeptide chain was of appropriate length (∼16 residues). Actually, polyalanine peptides containing only one aspartic acid residue bound to I-Akproteins and formed stable SDS complexes, but the length of the chain was highly critical (6Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Young S.P. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, binding affinity depended on two critical interactions, that between the peptide backbone and conserved residues on the α and β chains of I-Ak and that between the amino acid side chain with the allele-specific site in P1 (7Fremont D.H. Monnaie D. Nelson C.A. Hendrickson W.A. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1998; 8: 305-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). (Similar results have been found for the human HLA-DR molecules (8Jardetzky T. Gorga J. Busch R. Rothbard J. Strominger J. Wiley D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,9Natarajan S.K. Stern L.J. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3463-3470PubMed Google Scholar).) The correlation, however, between binding affinity and SDS stability was not absolute (5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Verreck F.A. Vermeulen C. Poel A.V. Jorritsma P. Amons R. Coligan J.E. Drijfhout J.W. Koning F. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In our experience, we found peptides that bound with good affinity but were highly SDS-unstable as a result of unfavorable residues interacting with the other pockets of the I-Ak peptide-binding site (for a complete review, see Nelson et al. (5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The biological significance of the two sets of SDS complexes is uncertain. We correlated the time of persistence of the complexes in the antigen-presenting cell (APC) with the SDS state (11Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Carrasco-Marı́n E. Shimizu J. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 450-458PubMed Google Scholar). For example, using metabolically labeled I-Ak, the time of persistence of a peptide-MHC complex was the result of two components: a long t 12 was represented in the SDS-stable fraction, whereas a short t 12 (about 13less) was represented in the SDS-unstable component. The averaget 12 in APCs (∼20 h) was accounted by the ratio of SDS-stable and SDS-unstable complexes. Curiously, thek off of peptides bound to I-Ak in solution did not correlate strictly with the time of persistence of the complexes in APCs. We now describe further analysis of a dominant antigenic peptide, the peptide at residues 48-61 of hen egg white lysozyme, when bound to I-Ak molecules. This peptide (DGSTDYGILQINSR) binds strongly to I-Ak as a result of the interaction of Asp-52 (underlined above) with the P1 binding site of I-Ak(6Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Young S.P. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fremont D.H. Monnaie D. Nelson C.A. Hendrickson W.A. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1998; 8: 305-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We examined peptides in which we changed this P1 anchor residue from aspartic acid to other amino acids that reduced their binding strength and SDS-PAGE behavior. These peptides were bound to I-Ak, and the complexes were tested, first, for the effects of the pH on their SDS resistance or susceptibility and, second, for their interaction using photoactivatable 48–61 peptides. These analysis suggest that the complexes of peptide-I-Ak have two structural states of interaction, as was revealed by the extent of freedom of the amino terminus of the peptide bound to I-Ak. In one, the peptide is bound in a more fixed structure resistant to SDS denaturation, in which the amino terminus of the peptide binds poorly to the I-Ak class II molecule. In the second, the peptide is bound in a structure sensitive to SDS denaturation in which the peptide has freedom at its amino terminus and efficiently binds the I-Ak molecule. The I-Ak peptide complexes resistant to SDS denaturation are likewise highly resistant to proteolytic enzymes, in contrast to those sensitive to SDS denaturation. The class II molecule I-Ak was purified from the cell line T-2 expressing I-Ak. I-Ak molecules were isolated from cell lysates by affinity chromatography, using Sepharose 4B coupled with 40F (anti-I-Ak) antibody as described previously (13Luescher I.F. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 135: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Eluted material was purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Bio-gel TSK 250 filtration column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mm Mega 8, 20 mm Mega 9. Peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) technology on an Applied Biosystem peptide synthesizer, purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 Vidac column and analyzed by mass spectrometry (6Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Young S.P. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were labeled with Na125I to a specific activity of 2–4 × 109 cpm/μmol by the chloramine T method and purified on reverse phase HPLC using a C18 Vidac column. N-Hydrosysuccinidimyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA) (Pierce) was labeled with Na125I by the chloramine T method. The radiolabeled compound was covalently conjugated at the peptide amino terminus, as described previously (13Luescher I.F. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 135: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Luescher I.F. Allen P.M. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

Med. 1997; 185: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the complex (IASA-peptide) was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 Vidac column. The main radioactive peak was collected, dried, dissolved in PBS, and used for binding assays. Purified I-Ak (25 nmol) was incubated for 48 h at room temperature with 25 pmol of radiolabeled peptide in a solution of PBS containing 20 mmMega 8, 20 mm Mega 9, 5 mmlysophosphatidyl-choline, 300 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 5.5, in a final volume of 25 μl (14Luescher I.F. Allen P.M. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Complexes were recovered by gel filtration using a Bio-Spin P6 column (6-kDa cut-off) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm Mega 8, 20 mm Mega 9. Then, 10 μl of the complexes (usually 1000–1500 cpm/μl) were incubated with 10 μl of a solution containing 40 mm MES at the indicated pH (from 5.5 to 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature; 20 μl of a 2% SDS aqueous solution was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, complexes were neutralized with 40 μl of a solution containing 250 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1.44m 2 β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue and run under SDS-PAGE conditions at either 100 °C or to room temperature. Gels were fixed for 5 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Under nonboiled SDS-PAGE conditions, the stable complexes were resistant to dissociation and the radiolabeled peptide migrated together with the αβ chains (at ∼50 kDa); in the unstable complex, the peptide dissociated and ran to the front of the gel. The percentage of stable/unstable complexes was quantified with a PhosphorImager system densitometer (425E Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In some experiments, complexes were recovered as described above, buffered at pH 5.5 or 7.5 with 40 mm MES, incubated with SDS at a final concentration of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2% for 30 min or 6 h, neutralized, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Purified I-Ak(25 nmol) was incubated for 48 h at room temperature with 25 pmol of IASA-peptide in a solution of PBS containing 20 mm Mega 8, 20 mm Mega 9, 5 mm lysophosphatidylcholine, 300 mm MES, pH 5.5, in a final volume of 25 μl. The complexes (∼106 cpm) were recovered by gel filtration on a column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 20 mmMega 8, 20 mm Mega 9, ultraviolet light-irradiated for 2 min at 340 nm, and then immunoprecipitated with 40F antibody (11Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Luescher I.F. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 135: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) followed by protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose-bound I-Ak-peptide complexes were eluted at room temperature for 1 h with 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.77 m2-β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue. Half of the sample was boiled at 100 °C for 2 min and half of the sample was kept at ambient temperature before SDS-PAGE analysis. Bands were analyzed using a PhosphorImager system densitometer to quantify the percentage of photolabeled peptide under boiled and nonboiled conditions. Under nonboiling conditions, a photolabeled peptide that is covalently linked to an SDS-stable complex will migrate at around 50 kDa, the position of the αβ-peptide complex. When boiled, the covalently bound peptide will remain associated with the free α or β chain or with both. However, a covalently bound peptide that forms part of an SDS-unstable complex will migrate with the free α or β chain under both nonboiling and boiling conditions. A peptide not covalently linked to the α or β chain will migrate as part of an SDS-stable complex in the position of αβ dimer when not boiled, but it will appear at the front of the gel under boiling conditions (i.e. the peptide dissociates from the complex and migrates freely). A peptide not covalently linked to an SDS-unstable complex will appear at the front under either condition. Three assays were set up. First, 125I-labeled 48–61 peptides were incubated with I-Ak, as described above. After 48 h, the I-Ak peptide complex was separated from free peptide using a Bio-Rad P6 column and placed at 37 °C in appropriate buffer solution with or without the following enzymes: chymotrypsin (Sigma product C7762), in 0.5 m Tris buffer with 1% Triton X-100, at pH 7.8; Cathepsin B (Sigma product C6286) in 50 mmsodium acetate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 5.5, and cathepsin D (Sigma product C31381) in 50 mm sodium acetate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5. The final incubation was done in 100–150 μl of solution that contained 50 μg of the I-Ak molecule per ml with the enzymes at the concentrations stated in the figures. At various time points, the complexes were again passed through a BioSpin P6 column to determine the amount of radioactivity associated with I-Ak. In the second assay, the complexes were isolated after 2 h of incubation in chymotrypsin using the monoclonal antibody 40F-bound to Sepharose 4B. (To 500 μl solution containing about 2 nmol of I-Ak was added 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of the 40F antibody bound to Sepharose 4B. The beads had been conjugated using cyanogen bromide with 10 mg/ml protein to 1 ml of Sepharose 4B slurry.) After 2 h, the Sepharose particles were washed twice and placed in 500 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Beads were removed, and the radioactive peptide examined by reverse phase HPLC in a Waters system with a C18 reverse phase column (Vidac 2187P54, Hespevia, CA), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a gradient of acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid (from 0 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, for 60 min). Third, the I-Ak molecules from APCs were labeled with [35S]methionine and then examined by SDS-PAGE. Cells from a B lymphoma line that expresses both I-Ak molecules and hen egg white lysozyme (5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium lacking methionine and cysteine and containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated with 200 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (Trans-35S-label from ICN, Irvine, CA) in 1 ml for 1 h, after which the culture was made in 1 mg/ml methionine, 0.5 mg/ml cysteine, and 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 4 h more. Cells were harvested and lysed in PBS containing 20 mm Mega 8, 20 mm Mega 9, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with the antibody 40F-Sepharose 4B. The I-Ak molecules were eluted with a buffer solution of 0.1 m diethylamine, 0.15m sodium chloride, and 20 mm each Mega 8 and Mega 9 at pH 10.65. The eluate was concentrated in a Centricon 30 tube (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and incubated with chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. The material was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, as described above. The intensity of each band was quantitated in a PhosphorImager. Most of the results shown in this study were made using the 48–61 peptide of hen egg white lysozyme (DGSTDYGILQINSR) bound to I-Ak, using variants in which the main anchor residue for the P1 pocket was changed in order to weaken the affinity of the peptide for the I-Ak class II molecule (i.e. Asp at 52). In general, peptides with a weak anchor residue yielded a complex with I-Ak that was less stable under SDS-PAGE conditions. A summary of our previous results (4Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R.

Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as those obtained in this study, is shown in TableI. We first report on the SDS-PAGE stability of the various I-Ak-peptide complexes and the influence that pH has on this assay. We next consider the use of peptides containing a photoactivatable probe: we examine the extent of covalent linkage of the peptides to I-Ak using the SDS-PAGE readout. Finally, we examine the protease sensitivity of the complexes.Table IProperties of the complexes of IAk peptidesPeptideBinding strengthSDS-PAGEPhotocross-linkingSensitivity to acid pHSensitivity to proteasesRIC−1% stable%HEL (48–61): (DGSTDYGILQINSR) Wild type: Asp-521>959ResistantVery resistant Ser at 5284840SensitivePartially resistant Thr at 52413347SensitiveND Leu at 5246549NDSensitive Ala at 52150676SensitiveSensitiveHsp-70 28–41: (IIANDQGNRTTPS) Wild type: Asp-32196612NDND Ala at 3232950NDNDRyudocan 84–101: (EPLVPLDNHIPENAQPG) Wild type: Asp-9021916NDND Ala at 90257765NDNDThe results of the first two columns were taken from Refs. 4Nelson C.A.

Purified I-Akmolecules were incubated with radiolabeled peptides at pH 5.5, the optimal pH for their binding (17Harding C.V. Roof R.W. Allen P.M. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), for 48 h; the complexes were isolated by gel filtration, incubated at the indicated pH solution for 15 min and then for 45 min with 1% SDS, and finally subjected to the SDS-PAGE. (Note that in all these assays, the complex of I-Ak with peptides was not subjected to a 100 °C temperature. Boiling the complex resulted in the dissociation of the α and β chains and the peptide. Unless otherwise stated, the results reported with SDS-PAGE represent protein complexes not subjected to 100 °C.) Fig. 1, top panels, shows that the peptide 48–61 bound to I-Ak forms highly SDS-stable complexes, independent of the pH of incubation. In other experiments, we found that the stability of these complexes persisted in 2% SDS for as long as 6 h. In contrast, complexes formed with 48–61 having a substitution of leucine for aspartic acid at residue 52 (Table I) (4Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were highly SDS-unstable (Table I), regardless of pH, SDS concentration, and time of incubation (Fig. 1, bottom panels). We analyzed three other 48–61 peptides having serine, threonine, or glutamine at position 52, which led to intermediate binding affinities to I-Ak molecules (Table I). As shown in Fig.2, the SDS stability of the three complexes was influenced by pH. At mildly acidic pH (5.5–6.5), the complexes were mostly unstable (0–31%). At pH 7.0 or 7.5, the complexes became resistant to denaturation (58–84%) (Fig. 2). Peptides were conjugated at the amino terminus with the radiolabeled photoactivatable probe IASA. The IASA-48–61 peptide and its variants at residue 52 were incubated with I-Ak: the complexes were recovered and subjected to ultraviolet irradiation, in order to covalently cross-link the peptide into the class II molecule, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In a previous study, we showed that IASA-46–61 bound to I-Ak was cross-linked to the α2 (residues 115–134) and β2 (residues 109–138) domains (15Luescher I.F. Crimmins D.L. Schwartz B.D. Unanue E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11177-11184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an indication that the amino terminus of the peptide was clearly extending beyond the peptide-binding groove. We had also shown that the IASA probe at the amino terminus (i.e. linked to residue 46) did not interfere with the binding specificity of the core portion of the peptide (residues 52–61) to I-Ak molecules. Peptides that did not bind to I-Ak were not covalently linked by the IASA group to I-Ak (15Luescher I.F. Crimmins D.L. Schwartz B.D. Unanue E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11177-11184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, a photolabeled-bound peptide that forms an SDS-unstable complex runs by SDS-PAGE in the position of the α or β chain if covalently bound to it, and in the front of the gel if not bound. Thus, when the peptide bound to I-Ak was 48–61 Ala-52 (which is unstable on SDS-PAGE) (Table I), most of the complexes migrated at the position of α or β chain (when not boiled). This indicates that the unstable complexes were extensively cross-linked by the amino-terminal bound photoprobe. After boiling, the photoprobe remained attached to the α or β chain, confirming its covalent linkage. The same results were found with 48–61 Leu-52. A photolabeled-bound peptide that forms an SDS-stable complex (i.e. with 48–61 or 46–61) will run at the position of the stable αβ dimer regardless of whether it is covalently bound by the photoprobe (under conditions in which the complex is not boiled). However, after boiling, the peptide will be found associated with the α or β chain if covalently bound, or at the front if not bound. As it is shown in Fig. 3 (NB (nonboiled)) peptide 48–61 or 46–61 formed stable complexes with I-Ak, but most of them were not covalently bound to the α or β chain, and appeared in the front of the gel (Fig. 3, lanes B (boiled)). This different capacity between the stable and unstable complexes to cross-link was more dramatically shown with the 48–61 Ser-52 or 48–61 Thr-52 peptides. These peptides were subjected to SDS-PAGE as a mixture of stable and unstable complexes (Fig. 3). Only a percentage of the complexes were covalently associated with the β chain. These corresponded mostly with the unstable complex (i.e. the percentage remaining in the position of the α or β chain did not increase after boiling: see legend to Fig. 3). (The 48–61 Ser-52 peptide despite being pure showed some interaction with the gel as indicated by the extra band. Note that when the sample was boiled a fraction of the peptide from the stable complex again had an abnormal migration (Fig. 3).) Confirming the above results with 48–61 Asp-52 and 48–61 Ala-52, most of the peptide covalently associated with class II molecule (β-chain) was accounted by the unstable complexes, whereas only a small fraction of stable complexes were covalently bound (Fig. 3). Table I summarizes all the experiments. We also examined two other peptides that bind to I-Ak(4Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nelson C.A. Viner N.J.

This peptide also had an aspartic acid residue anchoring it to the P1 pocket, at residue 32, and when bound to I-Ak molecules ran stable by SDS-PAGE. As before the stable complexes were poorly cross-linked (Fig.4). Substituting an alanine at the P1 anchor site of residue 32 resulted in weak binding, and an increase in SDS unstable complexes, that was covalently linked to the α and β chain. The same findings applied to another self-peptide, that from ryudocan residues 84–101; the wild type peptide with an aspartic acid at residue 90 was SDS-stable but showed a poor covalent linkage to I-Ak molecules. Having the peptide with an alanine substitution at residue 90 resulted in an SDS-unstable complex that was covalently associated with I-Ak molecules. Considering the possible biological consequences of the two states of peptide-MHC complexes described above, we examined their degree of sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes. We reasoned that the SDS-stable complexes, which were assumed to have a more fixed or rigid structure, could be more resistant to proteolysis. In contrast, those with the SDS-unstable conformation, i.e. with a more flexible conformation, would be sensitive. If so, these states could reflect in the fate of the complexes in the proteolytic-rich vesicles of the APC. Radiolabeled peptides were bound to I-Ak, after which the complexes were isolated and then incubated at 37 °C with chymotrypsin or the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B or D. The time of dissociation of the peptide from I-Ak varied, in part dependent on the binding strength of the peptide, an issue studied before (5Nelson C.A. Viner N.J. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 81-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex of I-Ak-48–61 was highly resistant to each of the enzymes. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.5. Even the very large concentration of 10 mg/ml chymotrypsin did not change the time of dissociation of the peptide from the MHC molecule. Confirming previous results (18Donnermeyer D.L. Allen P.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1063-1068PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mouritsen S. Meldal M. Werdelin O. Hansen A.S. Buus S. J. Immunol. 1992; 194: 1987-1993Google Scholar), 48–61 bound to I-Ak was highly stable with prolonged time of dissociation. We proceeded to recover the peptide from I-Ak after 2 h in chymotrypsin and to examine it by HPLC: the I-Ak-peptide complex was recovered, isolated using antibodies bound to Sepharose beads, and washed; then, its components were dissociated, and the 125I peptide was examined by reverse phase HPLC. The peptide was not affected, eluting in the same fraction as the untreated peptide (Fig.6). Thus, in agreement with previous reports, the 48–61 peptide, which can be cleaved by chymotrypsin in free solution, is now resistant to the enzyme during the time that it is bound to I-Ak molecules. (Likewise, cathepsin B and cathepsin D, even at 10 units/ml, did not affect the amount of peptide bound after 3 h; i.e. relative to control, the amounts of 48–61 lost were 2.5 and 1.9%, respectively.Figure 6Peptides bound to I-Ak are resistant to chymotrypsin. In all the six panels,125I-labeled peptides bound to I-Ak were either not treated (open symbols) or treated with chymotrypsin (closed symbols) for a period of 2 h. The complex was isolated using monoclonal antibody 40F bound to Sepharose. The Sepharose beads were washed extensively and then placed in a solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; the supernatant was examined by reverse phase HPLC. a, elution of 125I-labeled 48–61 after incubation with 5 mg/ml chymotrypsin: the amount of complex recovered was 98% (untreated peptide migrated at fraction 29, and peptide after chymotrypsin migrated at fraction 21). b,elution of 48–61 Ser-52 after 1 mg/ml chymotrypsin: recovery of 88% (untreated and treated peptide eluted at fraction 29 and 21, respectively). Identical results were found using 5 mg/ml chymotrypsin.c, elution of 48–61 Ala-52 after 0.2 mg/ml chymotrypsin: recovery was 40% (untreated and treated peptide eluted at fractions 30 and 23, respectively). d, elution of 48–61 Leu 52 after 0.1 mg/ml chymotrypsin: recovery was 20% (untreated and treated peptide eluted at fractions 33 and 27, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The complex formed with 48–61 Ser-52 was slightly more sensitive to chymotrypsin and to the cathepsins (Fig. 5). Even at 5 mg/ml chymotrypsin, the amounts lost at 6 h did not exceed 25% of the bound peptide. As with 48–61, the peptide bound to I-Akwas shown not to be cleaved when recovered from I-Akmolecules (Fig. 6). (The amounts lost after 3 h in 10 units/ml cathepsin B or cathepsin D were 7.8 and 5.2%, respectively.) The complexes formed with 48–61 Leu-52 and 48–61 Ala-52 were highly sensitive to chymotrypsin (Fig. 5). Note in Fig. 5 that the loss of 48–61 Leu-52 was affected at a 10 μg/ml concentration of enzyme. Also to note is that the peptide that remained bound to I-Ak was still protected from chymotrypsin cleavage (Fig.6). (The complexes were likewise sensitive to cathepsin B and cathepsin D. Thus, about half of the complexes at 3 h were lost with a 10 unit/ml concentration of either cathepsin.) All of the peptides were protected from chymotrypsin action during the time that they remained associated with I-Ak, yet the enzyme dissociated the complexes, particularly with 48–61 Leu-52 and 48–61 Ala-52. Similar results were obtained with two synthetic peptides based on the 48–61 sequence but modified so as to make them resistant to chymotrypsin. Peptide AGSTDAGAAAQANSKY bound to I-Ak with about the same strength as 48–61 (relative inhibitory capacity−1 of 2) (see Table I), because of the aspartic acid at the fifth residue from the amino terminus. The complex of it with I-Ak was highly resistant to chymotrypsin, even at a 10 mg/ml concentration of enzyme. In contrast, a peptide that was similar but had a serine instead of the aspartic acid bound less well (relative inhibitory capacity−1 of 7.1). The complex was much more sensitive to chymotrypsin (Fig. 5). Thus, the loss of the peptide from I-Ak was independent of whether it is cleaved by the enzyme. We examined whether SDS-stable or unstable I-Ak molecules from APCs labeled with 35S showed a differential sensitivity to chymotrypsin. Cells were pulsed with35S-labeled methionine/cysteine and then incubated for 6 h, after which the I-Ak molecules were isolated and treated with the enzyme (Fig. 7). About half of the labeled molecules from untreated samples were SDS-stable, and this number increased when the protein was treated with chymotrypsin (from 58 to 87%). The absolute value of the SDS-stable band did not change after treatment with chymotrypsin. However, there was a selective loss of the SDS-unstable molecules when treated with the enzyme chymotrypsin. At 0.010 mg/ml chymotrypsin, 48% of the radioactive bands corresponding to the SDS-unstable component were already lost. This study emphasizes the influence that key amino acid anchor residues have on the properties of peptide-MHC complexes in which two sets of interactions were identified. One was represented by peptides that bound to I-Ak with low affinity and had a higher tendency for denaturation by SDS, particularly at low pH. Such peptides were extensively bound by the photoactivatable probe, placed at their amino terminus. In sharp contrast, the complexes of I-Akand high affinity binding peptides were resistant to SDS, regardless of the pH, and were poorly cross-linked by the photoprobe. These results indicate to us that the complexes formed with weak binding peptides have more conformational freedom: the amino end, which extends beyond the combining site, is free to search for binding sites during the time of their activation. In contrast, the high affinity binding peptides favor a more rigid structure that places the molecule in a more fixed conformation. In agreement with this interpretation are the results showing the differential sensitivity to proteases of the two sets of I-Ak-peptide complexes. The differences in SDS denaturation at low pH between the two sets of complexes might reflect a higher or lesser exposure of hydrophobic residues brought about by the pH change (20Caflisch A. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 672-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Goto Y. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 22Kim P.S.

A. 1994; 91: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the nature of the P1 anchor residue of the peptide profoundly influences the SDS susceptibility to low pH, probably because the free energy of unfolding depends on the binding affinity between a peptide side chain and the corresponding I-Ak site. Complexes with the high affinity 48–61 peptide with a strong P1 anchor were highly resistant to pH and denaturation, in marked contrast to the complexes with substitution that have a weak P1 anchor site. These results are in agreement with previous reports in showing that the susceptibility to denaturation by SDS-PAGE increased considerably at low pH (24Runnels H.A. Moore J.C. Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) The transition along the pH from unstable to stable complexes was interpreted as a conformational change from a protonated class II at low pH to an unprotonated class II at neutral pH based on its increase uptake of aminonapthalene (24Runnels H.A. Moore J.C. Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The stable complexes of I-Ak bearing the strong binding peptides were highly resistant to proteolysis. In contrast, those with a weaker anchor residue were highly sensitive. It was previously shown that peptides bound to class II molecules were protected from cleavage by proteolytic enzymes. We confirm this effect but add two important new features. The resistance or sensitivity of the peptide bound to I-Ak was independent of its susceptibility to enzyme cleavage. Rather, the binding strength of the peptide with I-Ak dictated whether the MHC molecules in the complex were sensitive to enzymatic degradation; this result agrees with the studies on pH and photocross-linking. (A previous study on class I MHC molecules reported that peptide-empty molecules were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (26Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).) We agree here that the propensity for SDS denaturation truly reflects a conformational state found with complexes in solutions or in APCs. The two conformational states may reflect in the biology of peptide presentation by APCs. We previously showed the marked differences in the time of persistence of SDS-stable or SDS-unstable forms of the I-Ak molecule in APCs (11Nelson C.A. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Carrasco-Marı́n E. Shimizu J. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 450-458PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cell sensed the two conformational states, one of which was retained longer and translated in higher immunogenicity than the other (12Carrasco-Marı́n E. Shimizu J. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 450-458PubMed Google Scholar). Knowing now that the SDS test truly reads out a physiological state adds much credence to these results. Indeed, the survival and time of persistence of a MHC-peptide complex in the proteolysis rich environment of an APC may well depend on the state of the molecule dictated by the binding features of the peptide. Finally, another issue to consider is that the more open conformation may well favor peptide exchange. A peptide bound with low affinity, and in the loose, or SDS-unstable, state will maintain the integrity of the dimer but allows for exchange and reutilization by a new peptide (27Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the high affinity, highly SDS-stable complex is not interchangeable."
https://openalex.org/W2073040586,"For deoxyribonucleotide synthesis during anaerobic growth, Escherichia coli cells depend on an oxygen-sensitive class III ribonucleotide reductase. The enzyme system consists of two proteins: protein α, on which ribonucleotides bind and are reduced, and protein β, of which the function is to introduce a catalytically essential glycyl radical on protein α. Protein β can assemble one [4Fe-4S] center per polypeptide enjoying both the [4Fe-4S]2+ and [4Fe-4S]1+ redox state, as shown by iron and sulfide analysis, Mossbauer spectroscopy (δ = 0.43 mm·s−1, ΔE Q = 1.0 mm·s−1, [4Fe-4S]2+), and EPR spectroscopy (g = 2.03 and 1.93, [4Fe-4S]1+). This iron center is sensitive to oxygen and can decompose into stable [2Fe-2S]2+ centers during exposure to air. This degraded form is nevertheless active, albeit to a lesser extent because of the conversion of the cluster into [4Fe-4S] forms during the strongly reductive conditions of the assay. Furthermore, protein β has the potential to activate several molecules of protein α, suggesting that protein β is an activating enzyme rather than a component of an α2β2 complex as previously claimed."

When removed from the membrane, F1 is an ATPase containing six nucleotide binding sites. Three are catalytic sites that are predominantly on β subunits at α/β interfaces. The three other sites, called noncatalytic sites, are located predominantly on α subunits at different α/β interfaces (1Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The crystal structures of the bovine heart and rat liver mitochondrial F1-ATPases as well as that of the α3β3 subcomplex of the TF1-ATPase have been determined (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R.

In the crystals of the bovine heart enzyme (BH-MF1),1 which form in media containing AMP-PNP, ADP, Mg2+, and N3−, noncatalytic sites are homogeneously liganded with MgAMP-PNP, whereas catalytic sites are heterogeneously liganded (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). One, designated βT, contains MgAMP-PMP, another, designated βD, contains MgADP and the third catalytic site, designated βE, is empty. Except for small differences in the regions of the terminal phosphates of bound nucleotides, the arrangements of functional amino acid side chains in catalytic sites in βT and βD are essentially identical. In contrast, these residues are arranged differently in βE. In the crystals of the α3β3 subcomplex of TF1 that form in media free of Mg2+ and nucleotides, the α subunits are in closed conformations corresponding to the liganded α subunits of the mitochondrial enzymes. The β subunits in the α3β3 structure are in open conformations corresponding to βE of BH-MF1 (5Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y.

In the crystals of the rat liver F1-ATPase (RL-MF1), which form in media containing ATP, Pi, and EDTA, noncatalytic sites are homogeneously occupied with MgATP. In contrast to the crystals of BH-MF1, all three catalytic sites of RL-MF1 contain bound nucleotides in the absence of Mg2+ (6Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). One catalytic site contains ADP alone, whereas the other two contain ADP and Pi. Since Mg2+ is not associated with ADP and Pi bound to catalytic sites of RL-MF1, side chains in catalytic sites that interact with the Mg2+ ion in the crystal structure of BH-MF1 are arranged differently in the crystal structure of RL-MF1. However, these differences are minor compared with the difference between the closed conformations of βD and βT and the open conformation of βE in BH-MF1. In the crystal structure of RL-MF1, the conformations of all three β subunits resemble the closed conformation of βD and βT in the crystal structure of BH-MF1. Bianchet et al. (6Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) suggest that the open conformation of βE in the crystal structure of BH-MF1 is the consequence of low concentrations of nucleotides in the crystallization medium. Extending this argument, they propose that the RL-MF1 structure with three closed β subunits plays a central role in catalysis, whereas the BH-MF1 structure with two closed β subunits and one open β subunit exists transiently during catalysis when products dissociate and substrates rebind. To determine which of these structures is more consistent with properties of F1-ATPases in solution, we took advantage of pairs of amino acid residues in β subunits that do not contribute to catalytic sites in BH-MF1 that have side chains within interaction distance in βD and βT but are considerably distant from each other in βE. For example, the carboxylate of β-Asp315 is within 3.0 and 3.7 Å of the guanidinium of β-Arg337, in βT and βD, respectively, whereas these side chains are 10.3 Å apart in βE. Other pairs of amino acid residues that meet these criteria are β-Ala158/β-Tyr311; β-Met167/β-Phe183, and β-Lys175/β-Ser203. Double mutants of the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 (7Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were prepared in which residues corresponding to β-Asp315/β-Arg337, β-Ala158/β-Tyr311, β-Met167/β-Phe183, and β-Lys175/β-Ser203 of BH-MF1were substituted with cysteine. The aim of preliminary studies was to find a double mutant that was stable and also could be converted reversibly between an oxidized, inactive form and a reduced, active form. Of the four double mutants generated, only the α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ double mutant corresponding to the β-Asp315/β-Arg337 pair in BH-MF1 met these criteria.

Each isolated enzyme subcomplex was treated with CDTA before assays were performed. This procedure removes endogenous MgADP from a catalytic site of the purified, wild-type α3β3γ subcomplex (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The βA160C/Y307C double mutant was isolated in an inactive form that could not be activated by treatment with DTT before assay or by including DTT in the assay medium. Lauryl dimethylamine oxide, which stimulates ATPase activity of the wild-type and certain other mutant subcomplexes did not activate the α3(βA160C/Y307C)3γ subcomplex in the presence or absence of DTT. Defective assembly was not responsible for the lack of ATPase activity. A normal pattern of α, β, and γ subunits was observed in a 3:3:1 ratio after the mutant subcomplex was submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The α3(βQ177C/S205C)3γ double mutant had negligible ATPase activity in the absence of activation with dithiothreitol. When 10 mm DTT was included in the assay medium, its specific activity for hydrolyzing 2 mm ATP increased to 0.8 μmol of ATP mg−1 min−1. ATPase activity was stimulated about 10-fold when 0.03% lauryl dimethylamine oxide was present in the assay medium. Lauryl dimethylamine oxide stimulates the ATPase activity of the wild-type α3β3γ subcomplex by a factor of 3–4 (8Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the α3(βQ169C/F185C)3γ double mutant was 7 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed mg−1 min−1 in the absence of activation with DTT. Prior treatment with DTT or the inclusion of 10 mm DTT in the assay medium did not stimulate ATPase activity of this mutant. Surprisingly, including lauryl dimethylamine oxide in the assay medium in the concentration range of 0.01–0.06% lowered the ATPase activity to less than 0.07 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed mg−1 min−1. The ATPase activity of this double mutant was inactivated by 2 mm o-iodosobenzoate with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 1.4 × 10−2 min–1. It was inactivated much more slowly by 2 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The rate of inactivation of the α3(βQ169C/F185C)3γ subcomplex byo-iodosobenzoate or 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was attenuated by ADP or ATP with or without Mg2+ present. After oxidation with o-iodosobenzoate, the α3(βQ169C/F185C)3γ subcomplex could not be reactivated by treatment with 10 mm DTT. Fig. 1 A shows that the isolated α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex has negligible ATPase activity unless the assay medium is supplemented with DTT or another thiol. Whereas traces a andc of Fig. 1 A were obtained in the absence of thiols, trace b shows the time-dependent activation of ATPase activity observed when the assay medium contained 10 mm DTT. Fig. 1 B shows that after reduction as described under “Experimental Procedures” the α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex was inactivated during assay unless DTT or 0.1 mm EDTA was included in the assay medium. Trace a in Fig. 1 Billustrates assay of the enzyme in the absence of DTT or EDTA.Traces b and c of Fig. 1 B represent assays conducted in the presence of 10 mm DTT or 100 μm EDTA, respectively. The dependence of protection against oxidation on EDTA concentration revealed that maximal protection was achieved with 50 μm EDTA. Other experiments indicated that a contaminant in the MgCl2 was responsible for oxidation in the absence of EDTA. Therefore, 100 μm EDTA was included in the assay medium in experiments with the reduced α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex. Since the presence of EDTA in the assay medium does not affect ATPase activity of the isolated enzyme, illustrated bytrace c of Fig. 1 A, the isolated α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex exists in the oxidized form. Following reduction of the α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex with 1 mm DTT for 30 min, the addition of iodoacetate to 4 mm led to 80% inactivation of ATPase activity within 10 min followed by slower inactivation, illustrated in Fig.2. The addition of increasing concentrations of ADP plus Mg2+ to the reduced subcomplex prior to adding iodoacetate slowed the rate of inactivation in both phases. Fig. 3 correlates the mol of [3H]acetate incorporated per mol of the α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex with the extent of inactivation observed during inactivation of the reduced, mutant enzyme with iodo[3H]acetate. It is clear from Fig.3 that multiple hits are required to cause full inactivation. To reconcile this unusual stoichiometry, it is possible that modification of a single cysteine in a given β subunit wounds the enzyme, and modification of both Cys311 and Cys333 in the same β subunit wounds the enzyme to a greater extent. The introduced cysteines appear to be the only residues that were appreciably carboxymethylated. The wild-type subcomplex was not inactivated when treated with iodo[3H]acetate under the same conditions and incorporated no more than 0.3 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme in the absence of nucleotides and much less than that in the presence of MgADP. The wild-type subcomplex, like the mutant, contains α-Cys193 that is resistant to modification by iodoacetate.Figure 3Correlation of inactivation of α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex by iodo[3H]acetate with the amount of reagent covalently incorporated. DTT was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to 500 μl of the CDTA-treated α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 μm EDTA, pH 8.0. This solution was then incubated at 23 °C for 30 min, at which time [3H]iodoacetate (14 cpm/pmol) was added to a final concentration of 4 mm. Samples (5 μl each) of the reaction mixture were assayed for residual ATPase activity at the times indicated in the presence of 10 mm DTT using the ATP regeneration system. At the same intervals, 50-μl samples of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and passed through 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G50 (9Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. The effluents were submitted to liquid scintillation counting to determine incorporation of [3H]acetate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complete carboxymethylation lowered the capacity of the α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex to bind ADP in the presence of Mg2+. This was established as follows. After carboxymethylation of the nucleotide-depleted mutant subcomplex by treatment with 4 mm iodoacetate in the presence of 1 mm DTT for 16 h, the modified enzyme was passed through a 1-ml centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, to remove excess iodoacetate and DTT. The gel-filtered subcomplex was then incubated with 200 μm [3H]ADP plus 2 mmMgCl2 for 30 min, at which time it was passed through two successive centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50. Determination of radioactivity and protein concentration in the second effluent showed that the carboxymethylated α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex retained 0.2 mol of [3H]ADP/mol. When treated under the same conditions, the wild-type subcomplex retained 0.9 mol of [3H]ADP/mol. Modification of the ATPase activity of the α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex by sulfhydryl reagents other than iodoacetate was also explored. Treatment of the reduced subcomplex with N-ethylmaleimide or [(1-trimethylammonium)methyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide, a reagent that derivatizes cysteine residues with a quarternary ammonium cation, using the same protocol described for iodoacetate, caused slower inactivations that were partially protected by MgATP or MgADP. In contrast, carboxamidomethylation of the subcomplex with excess iodoacetamide in the presence of DTT converted the enzyme to a form that no longer required DTT or EDTA in the assay medium to retain constant activity. This is illustrated in Fig.1 C. Trace a of Fig. 1 C represents ATP hydrolysis by the reduced, mutant subcomplex in the absence of DTT or EDTA after treating it exhaustively with iodoacetamide. In the absence of carboxamidomethylation, the reduced enzyme is inactivated during assay in the absence of DTT or EDTA as illustrated by trace a of Fig. 1 B. The rate of conversion of the reduced mutant subcomplex to a more active form by iodoacetamide was not affected by MgADP. When the subcomplex was treated with 4 mm iodoacetamide in the presence of 1 mm DTT, 50% conversion was observed within 2 min. Maximal conversion occurred within 60 min. The addition of ADP with or without MgCl2 during treatment with iodoacetamide did not affect the rate of conversion. The reduced α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex is rapidly inactivated in the presence of CuCl2, tetrathionate,o-iodosobenzoate, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or H2O2. To determine the number of β subunits containing disulfide bonds on conversion of the reduced to the oxidized form, the reduced α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex was inactivated with CuCl2 in the presence or absence of MgADP. In each case, complete inactivation was observed within 5 min. The reaction mixtures were then incubated an additional 2 h to allow further oxidation. After removing CuCl2, free ADP, and Mg2+, inactivated enzyme was treated with iodo[3H]acetate or iodo[14C]acetamide for 16 h to derivatize free sulfhydryl groups. These experiments are summarized in Table II. The results obtained when iodo[14C]acetamide was used to monitor residual free sulfhydryl groups, strongly indicate that disulfide bonds are formed in only two β subunits during inactivation. In this case, nearly two sulfhydryl groups were derivatized after inactivating the enzyme with CuCl2. The slightly lower values of free sulfhydryl groups titrated with iodo[3H]acetate may reflect charge repulsion encountered during carboxymethylation of Cys311 and Cys333 in the same β subunit that does not occur during carboxamidomethylation with iodoacetamide.Table IILabeling of the reduced and oxidized forms of the α3 (βD311C/R333C)3 γ double mutant with iodo[3H]acetate and iodo[14 C]acetamideLabeling reagentReduced mutantOxidized mutantOxidized mutant plus MgADPmol/molIodo[3H]acetate6.3 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1Iodo[14C]acetamide6.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.1The reduced α3(βD311C/R333C)3γ subcomplex was prepared in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 100 μm EDTA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The oxidized subcomplex was prepared by treating the reduced subcomplex at 1 mg/ml with 200 μm CuCl2 in the presence or absence of 1 mm ADP plus 2 mm MgCl2 for 2 h, at which time the reaction mixture was passed through a centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 column (9Penefsky H.S.

In contrast, when MgADP was loaded onto two catalytic sites or when the subcomplex was incubated with excess ADP plus Mg2+, MgADP-fluoroaluminate complexes formed rapidly in two catalytic sites after the addition of Al3+ and F−.

It is estimated that over 500 million individuals are hepatitis B carriers worldwide and about 1 million deaths are attributed annually to the effects of HBV1 infection (1Beasley R.P. Lin C.-C. Hwang L.Y. Chen C.S. Lancet. 1981; 2: 1129-1133Abstract PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). There is a strong correlation between chronic hepatitis B infection and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunization against HBV has been effective in reducing the number of new infections. Additionally interferon and nucleoside analog treatments have been employed for HBV-infected individuals with limited success. Approaches other than the vaccine have not been successful in eradicating the disease entirely. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative therapeutic methods and effective drug treatments to combat and or reduce the onset of chronic liver disease. Human hepatitis B virus contains a small 3.2-kilobase DNA genome and is a member of the hepadnaviridae family, a group of viruses with a strong tropism for the liver (2Nassal M. Schaller H. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Other members are found in woodchucks, ground squirrels, and several avian species. At least four proteins (surface protein, core protein, polymerase, and HBx) are translated from the mammalian HBV genome. HBV utilizes the strategy of replication via reverse transcription. The polymerase (pol) protein encoded by HBV consists of three domains: terminal protein (TP), pol/reverse transcriptase (RT), and RNase H (RH). TP domain is separated from the other two domains by a spacer or tether sequence. The pol activity is utilized during HBV replication to convert a greater than genome-length RNA intermediate, known as pregenome RNA, into an asymmetric or partially duplex DNA that is maintained in a circular conformation. The details of HBV replication have emerged from the work of several laboratories (3Tavis J.E. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4107-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Lanford R.E. Notvall L.

According to these reports, the first step of HBV replication appears to be the recognition of pregenomic RNA by polymerase at a stem loop structure termed ε located within its own mRNA (7Seeger C. Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Science. 1986; 232: 447-484Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Bartenschlager R. Junker-Neipmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of in vitro translated (4Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and yeast transposon-derived duck HBV-like virus pol (3Tavis J.E. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4107-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) provided the first clues by revealing that a novel protein priming reaction initiates the minus strand DNA synthesis. This priming step yielded a discrete 3–4-deoxyribonucleotide oligomer that is covalently linked to the TP domain of HBV pol protein. The dNTPs are polymerized onto a tyrosine 63 acceptor residue located in the N-terminal priming TP domain. Priming is templated by a bulge within the ε stem-loop structure located near the 5′ end of the pregenomic RNA. The ε motif and an additional 10–11-nucleotide sequence termed DR are also found in the 3′ end of the terminally redundant pregenome RNA. This redundancy facilitates the translocation of initiated DNA-protein complex to the 3′ end of pregenomic RNA and ensures the continuation of minus strand synthesis. The pol covalently linked to initial minus strand DNA upon translocation to a complementary sequence in the 3′ end of pregenome RNA resumes minus strand DNA synthesis. RNaseH activity of pol protein hydrolyzes the pregenome RNA following its reverse transcription. A ribonucleotide primer of 15 nucleotides including the CAP structure is recruited to initiate plus strand DNA synthesis at the DR2 sequence near the 3′ end. The series of reactions result into a DNA product that has a circular conformation. Core particles in which these reactions occur are either recycled through nucleus or enveloped with surface antigen to bud off as mature virion particles from cell surface (2Nassal M. Schaller H. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription has been observed in a wide variety of genetic elements including all retroviruses, transposons, bacteria, animals, and plants (9Levin H.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Yeast has several classes of endogenous retrotransposons (Ty) elements that transpose through RNA intermediate, and their replication is dependent upon Ty element-encoded reverse transcriptase (23Boeke J.D. Devine S.E. Cell. 1998; 26: 1087-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hybrid Ty and other retroelements have been used to demonstrate the RT activity of duck HBV-like virus (3Tavis J.E. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4107-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), human long interspersed nuclear elements (10Dombroski B, A. Fengm Q. Mathias S.L. Sassaman D.M. Scott A.F. Kazazian H.H. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4485-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and long interspersed nuclear element-like elements from trypanosomatids (11Mathias S.L. Scott A, F. Kazazian H.H. Boeke J.D. Gabriel A. Science. 1991; 254: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Although the retroviruses reverse transcription is understood in great detail, the biochemical dissection of HBV pol has been hampered by failure to obtain enzymatically active protein from nucleocapsids. In this report, we have employed a genetic selection scheme recently described for HIV RT that utilizes a Ty1 element-based expression system inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (18Nissley D.V. Garfinkel D.J. Strathern J.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Nissley D.V. Boyerm P.I. Garfinkel D.J. Hughes S.H. Strathern J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13905-13910Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the construct pTy1/HBVRT, the Ty1 RT (TyB) coding sequences were substituted with HBV pol open reading frame. For genetic selection HIS marker was added in the construct that exists in an antisense orientation. Reverse transcription yields a cDNA copy of the hybrid element carrying a functional HIS gene. The conversion of Ty1 RNA into DNA occurs within the virus-like particles known as VLPs. Upon transposition in yeast chromosome either by homologous recombination or via Ty1 integrase-mediated insertion, expression of HIS gene leads to histidine prototrophy. Thus, the expression of hismarker in the present system totally relies on the HBV pol activity. Although our biochemical analyses and genetic selection support the functional activities of HBV pol, the system was also capable of detecting the failure of HBV RT activity in the presence of a nucleoside triphosphate 3TC on solid medium. Thus this approach suggests the feasibility of the system for large scale screening of inhibitors of HBV RT/RH activities. 3TC is a known inhibitor of HBV pol activities (12Fourel I. Saputell J. Schaffer P. Mason W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strain 1052 (Matα ura-167 trp1-GB spt3-101 hisΔ200 Rad52) was used to monitor reverse transcription of hybrid Ty1/HBVRT retroelement. Thespt3 mutation blocks the expression of endogenous TY element. The His3-Δ200 mutation deletes the entire HIS3gene. Rad52 mutation blocks the integration of plasmid borne Ty element into chromosome by homologous recombination. The genotype of JSS5611-B (spt+ yeast strain) is Matα gal+CanLr cvys his 3ΔI trp-7 leu-112 ura3-52. A 2.4-kilobase fragment flanked by theClaI and SmaI restriction sites encompassing the entire HBV open reading frame including TP, RT, and RNase H domains was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from plasmid pNET. This fragment was cloned into the ClaI and SmaI sites of plasmid pHART to generate a hybrid construct Ty1/HBVRThis3AI(pTy1/HBVRT). Galactose-regulated Ty-his3AI plasmid pNuvec08 was used as a control (19Nissley D.V. Boyerm P.I. Garfinkel D.J. Hughes S.H. Strathern J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13905-13910Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Both pHART and pNuvec08 were kind gifts of Drs. Dwight Nissley, David Garfinkel, and Jeffrey Strathern of ABL of the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). pHART contains the Ty1 protease, an integrase, and HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) domain (18Nissley D.V. Garfinkel D.J. Strathern J.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,19Nissley D.V. Boyerm P.I. Garfinkel D.J. Hughes S.H. Strathern J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13905-13910Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The plasmid Ty1/HBVRT was constructed by replacing the HIV RT sequences in the pHART plasmid. The junctions of Ty integrase with HBV pol open reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two deletion mutants of HBV pol open reading frame were generated. pTy1/HBΔRT contains a deletion of an 1.4-kilobase BamHI fragment that includes a major part of RT domain. The second deletion mutant pTy1/HBVΔRH contains a 70-base pair NcoI-SstII deletion fragment encompassing the RNase H domain of the pol protein. Yeast cultures containing the appropriate constructs were grown in YMIN medium with 2% glucose, lacking uracil. Saturated yeast culture were then harvested and pellet washed in sterile water. Cells were grown for 1–2 h with 2% raffinose. For induction of reverse transcription, 1 ml of yeast culture was then grown in YMIN medium with 2% galactose, 2% glycerol, and 2% ethanol at either 30 or 20 °C for 12–16 h. After induction the yeast cells were diluted in water and simultaneously plated on plates with histidine for cell counts and without histidine for scoring His+ prototrophs. The ratio of His+colonies/total number of yeast colonies is shown in Table I.Table IActivity of Ty1/HBVRT hybrid retroelement in yeastFrequency of His+30 °C20 °Cspt3RAD52spt3rad52spt3RAD52spt3rad52Ty1/HBVRT1.8 × 10−32.2 × 10−41.1 × 10−31.5 × 10−3Ty1/HBVΔRT1.0 × 10−72.3 × 10−71.3 × 10−61.5 × 10−7Ty1/HBVΔRH5.5 × 10−76 × 10−71.6 × 10−61.2 × 10−7Ty1/pGEM743.2 × 10−72.0 × 10−71.3 × 10−61.5 × 10−7pYES-22.7 × 10−71.7 × 10−81.3 × 10−71.5 × 10−7The frequency of reverse transcription mediated by HBVRT/RH was monitored by selection of histidine prototrophy after the induction of yeast carrying pTy/HBVRT with 2% galactose.

Ty virus-like particles were isolated by a modification of the method of Mathias et al. (11Mathias S.L. Scott A, F. Kazazian H.H. Boeke J.D. Gabriel A. Science. 1991; 254: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Yeast strain 1052 containing Ty-derived plasmids or their derivatives were grown in 2000 ml of YMIN synthetic medium with 2% glucose to anA 590 of 2. Cells were collected and diluted 2.5-fold in SC-ura medium (0.16% yeast nitrogen base and 0.5% ammonium sulfate) with 2% raffinose and grown for 2–3 h. Cultures were induced by the addition of 2% galactose, 2% glycerol, and 2% ethanol and grown for 16–24 h. Cells were collected and suspended in 6 ml of B/EDTA buffer (15 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.8, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 unit/ml aprotenin. Cells were lysed by vortex mixing with glass beads (12 gm) for 3–5 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in Sorvall SW34 rotor for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a step gradient of 20%/30%/70% sucrose in B/EDTA (18 ml/6 ml/5 ml) and centrifuged for 3 h in SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm. The fractions were collected from 30%/70% interphase and diluted in B/EDTA buffer and further centrifuged for 1 h at 45,000 rprm in SW55. The pellet was resuspended in B/EDTA containing 5% sucrose and stored at −70 °C. For Western blotting yeast cells were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with appropriate sera. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminiscence procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti HBVpol was a generous gift of Dr. R. Lanford (Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX). VLPs extracts were partially purified as above, and 10 μg of protein was incubated for 75 min at 24 C in 30 μl containing [α-32P]dCTP and 10 μm dGTP, dATP, and dTTP each, in 60 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol. Where indicated VLPs were incubated with 10 units of micrococcal nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 7 mmCaCl2 for 30 min to remove the endogenous DNA within VPLs prior to labeling reaction. Micrococcal nuclease activity was terminated by adding 15 mm EGTA. Actinomycin D (100 μg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the reaction mixture. Where indicated the labeled products of the polymerase reaction were treated with mung bean nuclease at 10 units/reaction for 90 min at 37 °C after completion of labeling. An HBV pol inhibitor lamivudine 3TC triphosphate was included in the RT reaction. The RT product was separated on 1.5% agarose gel containing 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0. The running buffer contained 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0. For the protein priming reaction, 10 μg of protein was incubated with 1 μCi of [32P]dGTP in the absence of RT buffer (60 mmTris, pH 8.0, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors). In this study, we used yeast Ty1 retrotransposon-based chimeric construct to express the functional HBV pol protein. Ty1 retrotransposition is a replicative process involving reverse transcription of Ty1 mRNA and integration of Ty cDNA into the yeast genome. Yeast Ty1 elements carry two overlapping genes, TyA and TyB, expressed from a single genomic mRNA (15Boeke J.D. Garfinkel D.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1985; 40: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 23Boeke J.D. Devine S.E. Cell. 1998; 26: 1087-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TyA encodes a structural protein that directs the formation of virus like particles. TyB encodes a multiprotein product with protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase activities. TyB is initially expressed as TyA-TyB polyprotein by ribosome frameshifting (15Boeke J.D. Garfinkel D.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1985; 40: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 23Boeke J.D. Devine S.E. Cell. 1998; 26: 1087-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This protein along with the mRNA is incorporated into VLPs where the protease activity encoded by the N terminus of TyB liberates TyB reverse transcriptase/RNaseH protein. An in vivo assay was developed by Curcio and Garfinkel (17Curcio M.J. Garfinkel D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 936-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) for the selection of RNA intermediate-transposition of the Ty1 element, in which aHIS3 gene interrupted by an artificial intron in the antisense orientation was tagged to Ty genome at the 3′ end. The intron is located in the sense orientation to Ty1 RNA. Splicing and retrotransposition of marked Ty1 transcripts leads to expression of histidine marker, which is scored as his+ colonies on solid medium lacking histidine amino acid. Recently, this strategy was employed to express HIV RT activity (18Nissley D.V. Garfinkel D.J. Strathern J.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Nissley D.V. Boyerm P.I. Garfinkel D.J. Hughes S.H. Strathern J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13905-13910Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized a similar strategy to express HBV reverse transcriptase activity. The coding region of HBV pol was cloned in frame with the TyA protein immediately 3′ to the protease and integrase domain to produce the plasmid pTy1/HBVRT (Fig.1 A). Two additional constructs, Ty1/HBVΔRT and Ty1/HBVΔRH, were developed to serve as negative controls, in which RT or RH domains were deleted, respectively (Fig. 1 B). All constructs were regulated by Gal1 promoter. To reduce RT activity attributable to expression of endogenous Ty1 and Ty2 elements, a spt3 mutant host strain was used. Upon galactose induction, yeast carrying these Ty1 plasmids produce and accumulate large amounts of VLPs (15Boeke J.D. Garfinkel D.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1985; 40: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). By using this assay, we estimated the Ty1/HBVRT transposition rate between 1 × 10−4 and 1.5 × 10−4 transpositions per Ty1/HBVRT hybrid element per generation (TableI). Variations in the transposition rate of individual hybrid Ty1/HBVRT elements may be due to the relative abundance of their transcripts. Table I summarizes the production of His prototroph colonies by different constructs at 20 and 30 °C, respectively. It is important to note that the His3 reporter gene was active only if marked Ty1/HBVRT RNA was spliced prior to reverse transcription carried out by HBV pol protein. To demonstrate the presence of HBV pol, VLPs purified from both spt− and spt+ yeast strains were examined by immunoblotting. The presence of TyA protein was readily detectable by Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblotting using TyA antibodies (data not shown). The separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with a polyclonal antiserum directed against human HBV pol. An expected ∼96-kDa (also includes amino acid residues derived from TyB protein and HIV integrase domain) mature HBV pol protein was detected only after induction of spt− (Fig.2 A, lane 4) and spt+ (Fig. 2 B, lane 6) yeast strains with wild type Ty1/HBVRT particles. This band was absent in uninduced spt− and spt+ yeast strains (Fig. 2,A, lane 5, and B, lane 1, respectively). The RT and RH deletion mutant VLPs showed no band (Fig.2, A, lanes 2 and 3, and B,lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Uninduced yeast containing wild type hybrid Ty1/HBVRT element and induced yeast containing Ty1/HBVΔRT and Ty1/HBVΔRH (deletion mutants of HBV RT and RH, respectively) produced no VLPs as tested by immunoblotting using the TyA antibodies (data not shown). Therefore, for immunoblotting and subsequent analysis, we used an equal amount of precipitated protein fraction in 5% sucrose/B/EDTA, which was previously collected from the interphase of 30%/70% stepwise sucrose gradient. HBV pol antibodies also showed weak cross-reactivity to HIV RT (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Although the same amounts (10 μg) of VLPs were analyzed for immnoblotting, the expression of HBV pol in spt+ strain appears to be much higher (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 of A with lane 6 ofB). This suggests that encapsidation of HBV pol in the VLPs within spt+ yeast strain may be facilitated by endogenous Ty reverse transcriptases. Collectively these results suggest that HBV pol (reverse transcriptase/RNaseH) is contained within the VLPs isolated from histidine prototrophs. In this system, as mentioned earlier, the production of His + colonies entirely relies on the reverse transcription function provided by HBV pol protein. A highly unusual behavior of HBV pol is its ability to prime the DNA synthesis. In doing so the first nucleotide (dGTP) is covalently linked to the tyrosine 63 residue. This causes the attached (−) DNA to partition into the phenol phase. In the present analysis, the HBV pol protein becomes radiolabeled by the transfer of the first [32P]dGTP. VLPs were incubated in the RT buffer containing only the α-32P-labeled dGTP in the reaction. The HBV pol trans-labeled product of this reaction was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 A). A radiolabeled HBV pol protein band of expected molecular mass was observed (Fig.3 A, lane 1). No 32P-dGTP-labeled proteins were observed in uninduced (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) or induced yeast cells expressing Ty1/HIVRT (lane 3). HIV RT like other retroviruses utilizes a tRNA molecule for priming minus strand synthesis (9Levin H.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A weak priming activity could be seen when [α-32P]dCTP was included in the HBV pol reaction (data not shown). These results clearly support the conclusion that the HBV pol protein in the VLPs is functional and is able to initiate priming reaction with dGTP. Next, we examined an RNA-dependent DNA synthesis initiated by the HBV pol protein within the VLPs. This was accomplished by incubating the VLPs in RT buffer in the presence of dNTPs including α-32P-labeled dCTP without supplying an exogenous primer/template. The resulting nucleic acid covalently linked to the pol protein products were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and examined by 8% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B). A radiolabeled protein band containing the extended minus DNA strands was observed only in the galactose-induced yeast cells (Fig. 3 B, lane 7), whereas deletion mutants lacking either the RT or RNaseH domains was unable to produce this pattern (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4and 5). Similarly, HIV RT (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) and Ty1-his3AI (lane 2) failed to produce any radiolabeled bands. This experiment further confirms that newly synthesized labeled DNA is covalently linked to HBV pol, a unique characteristic of hepandaviruses polymerases. To monitor the extent of DNA synthesis, partially purified VLPs fractions were incubated with dNTPs containing α-32P-labeled dCTP. Reactions were terminated by incubating with proteinase K for 90 min. Proteins were removed by phenol-chloroform extraction, and labeled DNA products were resolved by either 4% urea-polyacrylamide or 1.5% alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis. Where indicated RNase (10 units), actinomycin D (100 μm), and micrococcal nuclease (0.1 μg/ul) were used prior to DNA synthesis. A series of controls were included in this analysis to establish the bona fide HBV pol activity. The RT products analyzed by 4% urea-PAGE gel electrophoresis are shown in Fig. 4 A. A prominent DNA band was observed in an induced yeast culture (lane 2) and was absent in uninduced cells (lane 1). Micrococcal nuclease treatment of the VPLs prior to RT reaction yielded an enhanced DNA synthesis (lanes 5 and 6). This increase may have resulted due to the digestion of the synthesized DNA by micrococcal nuclease within VLPs (compare lanes 3 and 6). Although RNA-dependent DNA synthesis is sensitive to actinomycin D, at concentrations used here a dramatic reduction was seen (lane 4), which is consistent with its previously observed inhibitory activities against viral polymerases and reverse transcriptases (6Seifer M. Stranding D.N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4513-4520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Summers J. Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Most importantly, these DNA products disappeared from the aqueous phase during phenol extraction if proteinase K digestion was omitted (compare lanes 2–7 and10). Acetone precipitation was performed to recover the DNA from phenol phase (lane 13). No RT products were observed in the absence of Mg2+ or when VLPs were treated with RNase prior to RT reaction (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and9). In the reaction with RNase treatment, Mg2+was included. These data suggest that an authentic reverse transcription reaction has occurred within the purified VLPs. Absence of a band in the mung bean nuclease treated reaction indicates that the RT product is a single-stranded DNA (lane 11). The addition of dideoxy-NTPs did not completely obliterate the RT activity (lane 12). This is consistent with the observation of others that a pool of sufficient amount of nucleotides is present in the VLPs to initiate the RT reaction (6Seifer M. Stranding D.N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4513-4520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3TC is a known inhibitor of reverse transcriptase activities of HIV and HBV. Here, we have used 3TC triphosphate (10 μm) to examine its influence on HBV pol activity. As shown in lane 14, 3TC inhibited this reaction. Collectively, these results show that the RT activity is authentically initiated by the HBV polymerase in accordance with the known characteristics of this protein. Further, this also rules out the concerns that endogenous yeast RT activity may have co-purified with the VLPs. To precisely determine the size of the DNA fragments in the RT reactions within the VLPs purified from pTy1"
