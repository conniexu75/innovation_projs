https://openalex.org/W2519209219,"The dismal success rate of clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) motivates us to develop model systems of AD pathology that have higher predictive validity. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allows us to model pathology and study disease mechanisms directly in human neural cells from healthy individual as well as AD patients. However, two-dimensional culture systems do not recapitulate the complexity of neural tissue, and phenotypes such as extracellular protein aggregation are difficult to observe. We report brain organoids that use pluripotent stem cells derived from AD patients and recapitulate AD-like pathologies such as amyloid aggregation, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and endosome abnormalities. These pathologies are observed in an age-dependent manner in organoids derived from multiple familial AD (fAD) patients harboring amyloid precursor protein (APP) duplication or presenilin1 (PSEN1) mutation, compared to controls. The incidence of AD pathology was consistent amongst several fAD lines, which carried different mutations. Although these are complex assemblies of neural tissue, they are also highly amenable to experimental manipulation. We find that treatment of patient-derived organoids with β- and γ-secretase inhibitors significantly reduces amyloid and tau pathology. Moreover, these results show the potential of this model system to greatly increase the translatability of pre-clinical drug discovery in AD."

The targeting of multiple genomic sites at once raises concerns about the efficiency and specificity in targeting. The model Arabidopsis thaliana is widely used in basic plant research. Previous work has suggested that the Cas9 off-target rate in Arabidopsis is undetectable. Here we use deep sequencing on pooled plants simultaneously targeting 14 distinct genomic loci to demonstrate that multiplex targeting in Arabidopsis is highly specific to on-target sites with no detectable off-target events. In addition, chromosomal translocations are extremely rare. The high specificity of Cas9 in Arabidopsis makes this a reliable method for clean mutant generation with no need to enhance specificity or adopt alternate Cas9 variants."
https://openalex.org/W2521036148,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is histologically described by the deposition of α-synuclein, whose accumulation in Lewy bodies causes dopaminergic neuronal death. Although most of PD cases are sporadic, point mutations of the gene encoding the α-synuclein protein cause inherited forms of PD. There are currently six known point mutations that result in familial PD. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have also been described as early events associated with dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in PD. Though it is known that microglia are activated by wild-type α-synuclein, little is known about its mutated forms and the signaling cascades responsible for this microglial activation. The present study was designed to investigate consequences of wild-type and mutant α-synuclein (A53T, A30P and E46K) exposure on microglial reactivity. Interestingly, we described that α-synuclein-induced microglial reactivity appeared to be peptide-dependent. Indeed, the A53T protein activated more strongly microglia than the wild-type α-synuclein and other mutants. This A53T-induced microglial reactivity mechanism was found to depend on phosphorylation mechanisms mediated by MAPKs and on successive NFkB/AP-1/Nrf2 pathways activation. These results suggest that the microgliosis intensity during PD might depend on the type of α-synuclein protein implicated. Indeed, mutated forms are more potent microglial stimulators than wild-type α-synuclein. Based on these data, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic strategies may be valid in order to reduce microgliosis but also to subsequently slow down PD progression, especially in familial cases."
https://openalex.org/W2518737296,"Background In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used for a variety of purposes. The occurrence of contamination and poisoning for farmers is highly reported due to unsafe handling practices and their usage. We assessed knowledge, attitudes and experiences of previous pesticide exposure, and related health problems among farmers who use irrigation in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among farmers living in the zone. Respondents were 796 irrigation farmers from 20 kebeles (lowest administration unit) in Jimma Zone. Data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire via face-to-face interviews. Both descriptive and inferential statistics analysis were performed. A binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with attitudes of farmers towards the safe use of pesticides at P value of ≤ 0.05 in the final model. Results Among the participants, 54.4% (95%CI, 50.7–58%) knew at least one pesticide control method and 53.7% had positive attitudes towards safe use of pesticide. The mean score of attitudes was found to be 3.9(±0.4). Knowledge including each of the following: the names of the pesticides (AOR, 0.41; 95%CI, 0.25–0.67), methods of pest control and the use of gloves during pesticide exposure (AOR, 1.52; 95%CI, 1.07–2.16) was found to be independent predictor of the farmers’ attitudes about safe use of pesticides. Past exposure of pesticide was reported by 89.6% of farmers. Participants reported ingestion (88.9%) and inhalation (90.4%) as possible mechanisms of pesticide exposure. Nearly 42% of farmers had never used any personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves against pesticide exposure. Farmers reported several health complications, which were perceived as complications of pesticide exposure, including: headache, nausea and vomiting, skin rash and irritation and abdominal pain. Conclusions The study exposed the existence of high probability of pesticide exposure, the low safe use of pesticide and the low use of PPE. However, but farmers had positive attitudes towards safe use of pesticides. These findings appeal for the development of effective public health strategies to improve farmers’ awareness and safe use of PPE. In addition, there is a need to inform farmers about integrated pest management to prevent severe health complications, which may occur as a result of unsafe and inappropriate use of pesticides."

The endocannabinoid-like compounds oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) play an important role in digestive regulation, and we hypothesized they would also modulate intestinal permeability. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured in human Caco-2 cells to assess permeability after application of OEA and PEA and relevant antagonists. Cells treated with OEA and PEA were stained for cytoskeletal F-actin changes and lysed for immunoassay. OEA and PEA were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. OEA (applied apically, logEC50 25.4) and PEA (basolaterally, logEC50 24.9; apically logEC50 25.3) increased Caco-2 resistance by 20–30% via transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-a. Preventing their degradation (by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase) enhanced the effects of OEA and PEA. OEA and PEA induced cytoskeletal changes and activated focal adhesion kinase and ERKs 1/2, and decreased Src kinases and aquaporins 3 and 4. In Caco-2 cells treated with IFNg and TNFa, OEA (via TRPV1) and PEA (via PPARα) prevented or reversed the cytokine-induced increased permeability compared to vehicle (0.1% ethanol). PEA (basolateral) also reversed increased permeability when added 48 or 72 h after cytokines (P <0.001, via PPARα). Cellular and secreted levels of OEA and PEA (P <0.001–0.001) were increased in response to inflammatory mediators. OEA and PEA have endogenous roles and potential therapeutic applications in conditions of intestinal hyperpermeability and inflammation.—Karwad, M.

https://openalex.org/W2518853827,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial pathological event in cancer, particularly in tumor cell budding and metastasis. Therefore, control of EMT can represent a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer. Here, we introduce an innovative three-dimensional (3D) high-throughput screening (HTS) system that leads to an identification of EMT inhibitors. For the establishment of the novel 3D-HTS system, we chose NanoCulture Plates (NCP) that provided a gel-free micro-patterned scaffold for cells and were independent of other spheroid formation systems using soft-agar. In the NCP-based 3D cell culture system, A549 lung cancer cells migrated, gathered, and then formed multiple spheroids within 7 days. Live cell imaging experiments showed that an established EMT-inducer TGF-β promoted peripheral cells around the core of spheroids to acquire mesenchymal spindle shapes, loss of intercellular adhesion, and migration from the spheroids. Along with such morphological change, EMT-related gene expression signatures were altered, particularly alteration of mRNA levels of ECAD/CDH1, NCAD/CDH2, VIM and ZEB1/TCF8. These EMT-related phenotypic changes were blocked by SB431542, a TGF-βreceptor I (TGFβR1) inhibitor. Inside of the spheroids were highly hypoxic; in contrast, spheroid-derived peripheral migrating cells were normoxic, revealed by visualization and quantification using Hypoxia Probe. Thus, TGF-β-triggered EMT caused spheroid hypoplasia and loss of hypoxia. Spheroid EMT inhibitory (SEMTIN) activity of SB431542 was calculated from fluorescence intensities of the Hypoxia Probe, and then was utilized in a drug screening of EMT-inhibitory small molecule compounds. In a pilot screening, 9 of 1,330 compounds were above the thresholds of the SEMTIN activity and cell viability. Finally, two compounds SB-525334 and SU9516 showed SEMTIN activities in a dose dependent manner. SB-525334 was a known TGFβR1 inhibitor. SU9516 was a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitor, which we showed also had an EMT-inhibitory activity. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SB-525334 and SU9516 were 0.31 μM and 1.21 μM, respectively, while IC50 of SB431542 was 2.38 μM. Taken together, it was shown that this 3D NCP-based HTS system was useful for screening of EMT-regulatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2520241843,"Characterizing trophic networks is fundamental to many questions in ecology, but this typically requires painstaking efforts, especially to identify the diet of small generalist predators. Several attempts have been devoted to develop suitable molecular tools to determine predatory trophic interactions through gut content analysis, and the challenge has been to achieve simultaneously high taxonomic breadth and resolution. General and practical methods are still needed, preferably independent of PCR amplification of barcodes, to recover a broader range of interactions. Here we applied shotgun-sequencing of the DNA from arthropod predator gut contents, extracted from four common coccinellid and dermapteran predators co-occurring in an agroecosystem in Brazil. By matching unassembled reads against six DNA reference databases obtained from public databases and newly assembled mitogenomes, and filtering for high overlap length and identity, we identified prey and other foreign DNA in the predator guts. Good taxonomic breadth and resolution was achieved (93% of prey identified to species or genus), but with low recovery of matching reads. Two to nine trophic interactions were found for these predators, some of which were only inferred by the presence of parasitoids and components of the microbiome known to be associated with aphid prey. Intraguild predation was also found, including among closely related ladybird species. Uncertainty arises from the lack of comprehensive reference databases and reliance on low numbers of matching reads accentuating the risk of false positives. We discuss caveats and some future prospects that could improve the use of direct DNA shotgun-sequencing to characterize arthropod trophic networks."
https://openalex.org/W2519858336,"Our study demonstrates the repeated isolation of vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses from different species of wild birds across four continents from 1997 through 2014. The data indicate that at least 17 species from ten avian orders occupying different habitats excrete vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses. The most frequently reported isolates were detected among individuals in the order Columbiformes (n = 23), followed in frequency by the order Anseriformes (n = 13). Samples were isolated from both free-ranging (n = 47) and wild birds kept in captivity (n = 7). The number of recovered vaccine-derived viruses corresponded with the most widely utilized vaccines, LaSota (n = 28) and Hitchner B1 (n = 19). Other detected vaccine-derived viruses resembled the PHY-LMV2 and V4 vaccines, with five and two cases, respectively. These results and the ubiquitous and synanthropic nature of wild pigeons highlight their potential role as indicator species for the presence of Newcastle disease virus of low virulence in the environment. The reverse spillover of live agents from domestic animals to wildlife as a result of the expansion of livestock industries employing massive amounts of live virus vaccines represent an underappreciated and poorly studied effect of human activity on wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W2520804110,"Endothelial barrier function is tightly regulated by plasma membrane receptors and is crucial for tissue fluid homeostasis; its dysfunction causes disease, including sepsis and inflammation. The ubiquitous activation of Ca2+ signaling upon phospholipase C-coupled receptor ligation leads quite naturally to the assumption that Ca2+ signaling is required for receptor-regulated endothelial barrier function. This widespread hypothesis draws analogy from smooth muscle and proposes the requirement of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-generated Ca2+ signaling in activating the endothelial contractile apparatus and generating interendothelial gaps. Notwithstanding endothelia being non-excitable in nature, the hypothesis of Ca2+-induced endothelial contraction has been invoked to explain actions of GPCR agonists that either disrupt or stabilize endothelial barrier function. Here, we challenge this correlative hypothesis by showing a lack of causal link between GPCR-generated Ca2+ signaling and changes in human microvascular endothelial barrier function. We used three endogenous GPCR agonists: thrombin and histamine, which disrupt endothelial barrier function, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which stabilizes barrier function. The qualitatively different effects of these three agonists on endothelial barrier function occur independently of Ca2+ entry through the ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ entry channel Orai1, global Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, and Ca2+ release from internal stores. However, disruption of endothelial barrier function by thrombin and histamine requires the Ca2+ sensor stromal interacting molecule-1 (STIM1), whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated enhancement of endothelial barrier function occurs independently of STIM1. We conclude that although STIM1 is required for GPCR-mediated disruption of barrier function, a causal link between GPCR-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases and acute changes in barrier function is missing. Thus, the cytosolic Ca2+-induced endothelial contraction is a cum hoc fallacy that should be abandoned.

The endothelial layer of blood vessels is a highly regulated barrier between the bloodstream and the interstitial tissue, controlling transvascular passage of fluids, solutes, and cells. A significant contribution to endothelial permeability resides in the paracellular diffusion pathway facilitated via intercellular gaps (1.Amado-Azevedo J. Valent E.T. Van Nieuw Amerongen G.P.

Paracellular permeability is essentially mediated by cell-cell junctional proteins, which are in turn regulated by intracellular signaling pathways that impact on cytoskeletal architecture (2.Beckers C.M. van Hinsbergh V.W. van Nieuw Amerongen G.P.

The balance between competing tethering and disassembling mechanisms determines the degree of endothelial barrier function and thus the extent of vascular leakage. Disruption of endothelial barrier function causes increased vascular permeability and is associated with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and disassembly of adherens junctions which are contributed by vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)·catenin 2The abbreviations used are: VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; Thr, thrombin; His, histamine; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; STIM1, stromal interacting molecule-1; HDMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; ECIS, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; BTP2, N-[4-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl]-4-methylthiadiazole-5-carboxamide; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; ROCK, Rho kinase; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; siNT, non-targeting siRNA; ANOVA, analysis of variance; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution. complexes (2.Beckers C.M. van Hinsbergh V.W. van Nieuw Amerongen G.P.

These events are under the control of various signaling pathways that are activated by diverse paracrine and autocrine mediators in blood and interstitial tissue, many of which act on heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) or receptor tyrosine kinase and play crucial roles in the control of vascular permeability, tone, angiogenesis and inflammation (2.Beckers C.M. van Hinsbergh V.W. van Nieuw Amerongen G.P.

Barrier disrupting GPCR agonists including thrombin and histamine activate downstream signaling that regulate actin reorganization and VE-cadherin localization triggered by activation of the small GTPase RhoA (1.Amado-Azevedo J. Valent E.T. Van Nieuw Amerongen G.P.

Driving Rho GTPase activity in endothelial cells regulates barrier integrity.Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 103: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GPCR-mediated activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gα12/13 family subtype causes the association and activation of p115Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p115RhoAGEF), leading to RhoA activation (1.Amado-Azevedo J.

Driving Rho GTPase activity in endothelial cells regulates barrier integrity.Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 103: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). RhoA then activates Rho kinase (ROCK), which phosphorylates the regulatory subunit of the myosin light chain phosphatase and inhibits its activity. This in turn enhances the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), causing actin-myosin interactions and disruption of endothelial barrier function (5.Terry S. Nie M. Matter K. Balda M.S. Rho signaling and tight junction functions.Physiology. 2010; 25: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ROCK can directly phosphorylate MLC to cause barrier disruption (6.Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Phosphorylation and activation of myosin by Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase).J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways activated downstream barrier-stabilizing GPCR agonists such as the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are less understood. S1P acts on heteromultimeric Gαi proteins leading to the activation of the small GTPase Rac and focal adhesion kinase, thus promoting formation of focal adhesions, cortical actin, and adherens junction assembly (3.Mehta D. Malik A.B. Signaling mechanisms regulating endothelial permeability.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 279-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 7.Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A.

Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Although it is obvious that endothelial cells develop force in response to barrier-disrupting agonists such as thrombin and histamine, the tension developed by endothelial cells in response to the most powerful agonist thrombin is at least 50-fold weaker than the bona fide tension generated by smooth muscle cells during contraction (8.Kolodney M.S. Wysolmerski R.B. Isometric contraction by fibroblasts and endothelial cells in tissue culture: a quantitative study.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, during the past three decades Ca2+-dependent endothelial contraction, a concept extrapolated from studies on muscle cells, has been invoked to explain changes in endothelial barrier function downstream GPCR agonists. Barrier disrupting GPCR agonists such as thrombin and histamine activate Gαq,11 protein and induce the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) through the action of phospholipase C. This will result in Ca2+ release from the IP3-sensitive internal stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activation of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane through the ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway activated by ER store depletion (9.Putney Jr., J.W. A model for receptor-regulated calcium entry.Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). It is now appreciated that ER store depletion causes the ER-resident Ca2+ sensor stromal-interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) to move toward ER-plasma membrane junctional spaces to trap and directly activate Orai1 Ca2+ entry channels (10.Trebak M.

According to the Ca2+-dependent model, the sustained Ca2+ entry signal thus generated (but not Ca2+ release) activates a key Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent kinase, the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) leading to MLC phosphorylation, formation of actin stress fibers, and endothelial contraction resulting in formation of intercellular gaps (3.Mehta D.

In a recent study, we have challenged the hypothesis that SOCE is required for endothelial contraction in response to the powerful barrier-disrupting agonist thrombin (23.Shinde A.V. Motiani R.K.

We demonstrated using molecular tools that thrombin-mediated endothelial barrier disruption required the ER-resident STIM1 protein but occur independently of SOCE, Orai1, and MLCK (23.Shinde A.V.

Signal. 2013; 6: ra18Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We also showed that STIM1 is required for RhoA activation, MLC phosphorylation, actin reorganization, and disruption of intercellular adhesions (23.Shinde A.V. Motiani R.K. Zhang X. Abdullaev I.F. Adam A.P. González-Cobos J.C. Zhang W. Matrougui K. Vincent P.A. Trebak M. STIM1 controls endothelial barrier function independently of Orai1 and Ca2+ entry.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra18Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the current study, we set out to determine whether these findings are unique to thrombin or shared by other barrier-altering or barrier-enhancing GPCR agonists and whether Ca2+ release from the ER is required for agonist-mediated effects on endothelial barrier function. We thus used high throughput impedance measurements to determine the role of Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry mechanisms in regulating endothelial barrier function downstream of three GPCR agonists, namely thrombin, histamine, and S1P. Thrombin and histamine are two typical inflammatory agonists that cause transient barrier disruption, whereas the platelet-derived agonist S1P enhances endothelial barrier function. These three agonists are of major relevance to vascular pathologies such as inflammation, allergy, and atherosclerosis. We compared side by side the effects of these three agonists on endothelial barrier function using electrical measurements and fluorescence microscopy. We also monitored the Ca2+ release from stores and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane induced by these agonists. We report that although Ca2+ signaling in response to these agonists coincides with changes in barrier function, neither Ca2+ entry nor Ca2+ release are necessary for GPCR-mediated disruption or enhancement of barrier function. We show that Orai1 plays no significant role in thrombin-, histamine-, and S1P-induced changes in endothelial barrier function. However, STIM1 is required for disruption of endothelial barrier function by thrombin and histamine but is not involved in S1P-mediated enhancement of endothelial barrier function. Impedance measurements were performed in monolayers of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) before and after addition of GPCR agonists using ECIS protocols as described in methods and outlined in details recently (26.Stolwijk J.A. Matrougui K. Renken C.W. Trebak M. Impedance analysis of GPCR-mediated changes in endothelial barrier function: overview and fundamental considerations for stable and reproducible measurements.Pflugers Arch. 2015; 467: 2193-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of confluent HDMEC monolayers with GPCR agonists, thrombin, histamine, and S1P, each agonist showed a typical response as shown in Fig. 1. Although thrombin and histamine lead to a transient disruption of endothelial barrier function (Fig. 1, A and B), S1P enhanced (or stabilized) endothelial barrier function (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the barrier-disrupting response of HDMEC monolayers to thrombin and histamine differed in severity and kinetics; thrombin effects were more profound, and the barrier took over an hour to recover, whereas the histamine effects were modest in comparison, and recovery of the barrier to pre-agonist levels occurred within 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B). Changes in electrical resistance on ECIS electrodes are caused by changes in cell morphology and changes at the intercellular junctions caused by rearrangements of actin and adherens junction proteins. The opening of cell-cell junctions increases paracellular current flow and thus causes decreases in resistance. Reciprocally, strengthening of cell-cell junctions reduces paths for current flow and leads to resistance increases. These results are consistent with cell morphology changes that were assessed microscopically: immunofluorescence staining for actin (green) and VE-cadherin (red) under control conditions and 2 min after addition of the respective agonists showed that although thrombin caused a disruption of adherens junctions, spanning the full length of cell-cell contact sites, histamine caused localized small oval-shaped openings that seem lacking VE-cadherin staining (Fig. 1D). S1P on the other hand led to increased VE-cadherin staining at the cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1D). To illustrate the changes in VE-cadherin and actin distribution during the time course of HDMEC response to thrombin and histamine, cell layers were stained at specific time points after agonist addition as indicated by red arrows in Fig. 1E for thrombin and Fig. 1F for histamine. HDMEC immunofluorescence images representing time points at 2, 5, 10, and 30 min after thrombin stimulation and 1, 5, and 20 min after histamine stimulation are shown in Fig. 1 (G and H), respectively. For comparison, typical control non-stimulated HDMEC monolayers are shown in Fig. 1I. According to the Ca2+-induced contractility model, tension produced through actin stress fiber formation upon agonist stimulation of endothelial cells is required for barrier disruption (3.Mehta D. Malik A.B. Signaling mechanisms regulating endothelial permeability.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 279-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The fluorescence micrographs show that within the first 2–5 min after thrombin stimulation, actin redistributes into the cytosol away from cell-cell contacts, which also leaves a staining pattern of interrupted VE-cadherin/actin co-localization (yellow) at the cell borders (Fig. 1G). Increased proportion of distinct actin bundles became visible after 10 min of thrombin stimulation, during the monolayer recovery phase (Fig. 1G). Additional quantification of fluorescence intensity from actin and VE-cadherin across cell cross-sections reveals actin accumulation in central regions of the cell at 2–10 min after thrombin stimulation, whereas in untreated and S1P-stimulated cell layers actin is predominantly co-localized with VE-cadherin at the cell borders, as indicated by overlap of intensity peaks (Fig. 1J). After 30 min of thrombin stimulation, at which time HDMEC monolayer resistance was typically restored by ∼80% of basal levels (Fig. 1E), accumulation of actin toward the cell borders was evident (Fig. 1, G and J). Similarly, in HDMEC monolayers stimulated with histamine, the appearance of stress fibers occurred 20 min after agonist stimulation (Fig. 1H), but was clearly absent in early stages, where decrease in resistance was maximal (Fig. 1F) and fluorescence intensity of actin and VE-cadherin staining decreased at the cell borders (Fig. 1J). These data suggested to us that the rapid decrease in barrier function in response to thrombin and histamine precedes stress fiber formation. Initial breakdown of endothelial barrier might be rather due to redistribution of actin away from the cell-cell junctional sites, thereby weakening junctional complexes. In turn, actual actin fiber formation might be more important during the barrier recovery phase when actin redistributes back toward the cell junctions for their stabilization. Thus, actin stress fiber tension might not be necessary for GPCR-mediated barrier breakdown. We tested whether Ca2+ signaling is activated in HDMECs by our three model agonists and whether Orai1 and STIM1 mediate SOCE in response to these agonists as was shown for virtually all cell types, including endothelial cells (10.Trebak M.

Like thrombin, the other two GPCR agonists considered under this study (histamine and S1P) also couple to phospholipase C activation with generation of IP3, activation of Ca2+ release from internal stores, and subsequent activation of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane presumably through the SOCE pathway. One of the most common means to activate SOCE without stimulating membrane receptors and without generating second messengers is to passively deplete the internal Ca2+ stores using the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (29.Takemura H.

There are a few studies that assessed the effects of YHS in pain assays; however, none of these studies has systematically compared its activities in the different pain animal modes namely: acute, inflammatory and chronic pain. Furthermore, little is known about the mechanism of YHS activity in these assays. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the antinociceptive properties of YHS by testing it in four standardized pain assays and to investigate its mechanism. YHS antinociceptive properties were analyzed in the tail flick, the formalin paw licking, the von Frey filament and the hot box assays after spinal nerve ligation, which monitors acute nociceptive, persistent inflammatory and chronic neuropathic pain, respectively. YHS pharmacological profile was determined by screening it against a battery of G-protein coupled receptors and its mechanism of action was studied using knock-out mice. Our study shows that YHS, at a non-sedative dose, increases the tail flick latency in the tail flick assay without resulting in development of tolerance. YHS also decreases paw licking time in the formalin assay. Further, YHS increases paw withdraw threshold and latency in the von Frey filament and the hot box assays, respectively. In vitro, YHS exhibits prominent dopamine receptor antagonistic properties. In dopamine D2 receptor knockout mice, its antinociceptive effects are attenuated in acute and neuropathic pain but not inflammatory pain assays. Our results therefore indicate that YHS effectively attenuates acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, without causing tolerance. The effects on acute and neuropathic pain, but not inflammatory pain, are at least partially mediated through dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Since YHS is a dietary supplement commercially available in the United States, our data suggest that it might be a candidate for alternative pain treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2520748933,"Human exposure to relatively low levels of methylmercury is worrying, especially in terms of its genotoxicity. It is currently unknown as to whether exposure to low levels of mercury (below established limits) is safe. Genotoxicity was already shown in lymphocytes, but studies with cells of the CNS (as the main target organ) are scarce. Moreover, disturbances in the cell cycle and cellular proliferation have previously been observed in neuronal cells, but no data are presently available for glial cells. Interestingly, cells of glial origin accumulate higher concentrations of methylmercury than those of neuronal origin. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the possible genotoxicity and alterations in the cell cycle and cell proliferation of a glioma cell line (C6) exposed to a low, non-lethal and non-apoptotic methylmercury concentration. Biochemical (mitochondrial activity) and morphological (integrity of the membrane) assessments confirmed the absence of cell death after exposure to 3 μM methylmercury for 24 hours. Even without promoting cell death, this treatment significantly increased genotoxicity markers (DNA fragmentation, micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds). Changes in the cell cycle profile (increased mitotic index and cell populations in the S and G2/M phases) were observed, suggesting arrest of the cycle. This delay in the cycle was followed, 24 hours after methylmercury withdrawal, by a decrease number of viable cells, reduced cellular confluence and increased doubling time of the culture. Our work demonstrates that exposure to a low sublethal concentration of MeHg considered relatively safe according to current limits promotes genotoxicity and disturbances in the proliferation of cells of glial origin with sustained consequences after methylmercury withdrawal. This fact becomes especially important, since this cellular type accumulates more methylmercury than neurons and displays a vital role protecting the CNS, especially in chronic intoxication with this heavy metal."
https://openalex.org/W2518747732,"Genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rDNA) are universal key constituents of eukaryotic genomes, and the nuclear genome harbours hundreds to several thousand copies of each species. Knowledge about the number of rDNA loci and gene copy number provides information for comparative studies of organismal and molecular evolution at various phylogenetic levels. With the exception of seed plants, the range of 45S rDNA locus (encoding 18S, 5.8S and 26S rRNA) and gene copy number variation within key evolutionary plant groups is largely unknown. This is especially true for the three earliest land plant lineages Marchantiophyta (liverworts), Bryophyta (mosses), and Anthocerotophyta (hornworts). In this work, we report the extent of rDNA variation in early land plants, assessing the number of 45S rDNA loci and gene copy number in 106 species and 25 species, respectively, of mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Unexpectedly, the results show a narrow range of ribosomal locus variation (one or two 45S rDNA loci) and gene copies not present in vascular plant lineages, where a wide spectrum is recorded. Mutation analysis of whole genomic reads showed higher (3-fold) intragenomic heterogeneity of Marchantia polymorpha (Marchantiophyta) rDNA compared to Physcomitrella patens (Bryophyta) and two angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tomentosifomis) suggesting the presence of rDNA pseudogenes in its genome. No association between phylogenetic position, taxonomic adscription and the number of rDNA loci and gene copy number was found. Our results suggest a likely evolutionary rDNA stasis during land colonisation and diversification across 480 myr of bryophyte evolution. We hypothesise that strong selection forces may be acting against ribosomal gene locus amplification. Despite showing a predominant haploid phase and infrequent meiosis, overall rDNA homogeneity is not severely compromised in bryophytes."

Although differential expression of coding genes underlying development of myopia has been a subject of intense investigation, the role of non-coding genes such as microRNAs in the development of myopia is largely unknown. In this study, we explored myopia-associated miRNA expression profiles in the retina and sclera of C57Bl/6J mice with experimentally induced myopia using microarray technology. We found a total of 53 differentially expressed miRNAs in the retina and no differences in miRNA expression in the sclera of C57BL/6J mice after 10 days of visual form deprivation, which induced -6.93 ± 2.44 D (p < 0.000001, n = 12) of myopia. We also identified their putative mRNA targets among mRNAs found to be differentially expressed in myopic retina and potential signaling pathways involved in the development of form-deprivation myopia using miRNA-mRNA interaction network analysis. Analysis of myopia-associated signaling pathways revealed that myopic response to visual form deprivation in the retina is regulated by a small number of highly integrated signaling pathways. Our findings highlighted that changes in microRNA expression are involved in the regulation of refractive eye development and predicted how they may be involved in the development of myopia by regulating retinal gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2519665324,"Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) contains high concentrations of benzylglcosinolate. We found that a hydrolysis product of benzyl glucosinolate—the benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC)—modulates the intracellular localization of the transcription factor Forkhead box O 1 (FOXO1). FoxO transcription factors can antagonize insulin effects and trigger a variety of cellular processes involved in tumor suppression, longevity, development and metabolism. The current study evaluated the ability of BITC—extracted as intact glucosinolate from nasturtium and hydrolyzed with myrosinase—to modulate i) the insulin-signaling pathway, ii) the intracellular localization of FOXO1 and, iii) the expression of proteins involved in gluconeogenesis, antioxidant response and detoxification. Stably transfected human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS) with constitutive expression of FOXO1 protein labeled with GFP (green fluorescent protein) were used to evaluate the effect of BITC on FOXO1. Human hepatoma HepG2 cell cultures were selected to evaluate the effect on gluconeogenic, antioxidant and detoxification genes and protein expression. BITC reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) and FOXO1; promoted FOXO1 translocation from cytoplasm into the nucleus antagonizing the insulin effect; was able to down-regulate the gene and protein expression of gluconeogenic enzymes; and induced the gene expression of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. Knockdown analyses with specific siRNAs showed that the expression of gluconeogenic genes was dependent on nuclear factor (erythroid derived)-like2 (NRF2) and independent of FOXO1, AKT and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1). The current study provides evidence that BITC might have a role in type 2 diabetes T2D by reducing hepatic glucose production and increasing antioxidant resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2519972072,"In the reproduction process of male and female fish, pituitary derived gonadotropins (GTHs) play a key role. To be able to specifically investigate certain functions of Luteinizing (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii; st), we produced recombinant variants of the hormones using the yeast Pichia pastoris as a protein production system. We accomplished to create in vitro biologically active heterodimeric glycoproteins consisting of two associated α- and β-subunits in sufficient quantities. Three dimensional modelling of both GTHs was conducted in order to study the differences between the two GTHs. Antibodies were produced against the unique β-subunit of each of the GTHs, in order to be used for immunohistochemical analysis and to develop an ELISA for blood and pituitary hormone quantification. This detection technique revealed the specific localization of the LH and FSH cells in the sturgeon pituitary and pointed out that both cell types are present in substantially higher numbers in mature males and females, compared to immature fish. With the newly attained option to prevent cross-contamination when investigating on the effects of GTH administration, we compared the steroidogeneic response (estradiol and 11-Keto testosterone (11-KT) in female and males, respectively) of recombinant stLH, stFSH, and carp pituitary extract in male and female sturgeon gonads at different developmental stages. Finally, we injected commercially available gonadotropin releasing hormones analog (GnRH) to mature females, and found a moderate effect on the development of ovarian follicles. Application of only testosterone (T) resulted in a significant increase in circulating levels of 11-KT whereas the combination of GnRH + T did not affect steroid levels at all. The response pattern for estradiol demonstrated a similar situation. FSH levels showed significant increases when GnRH + T was administered, while no changes were present in LH levels."

The activity of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), medial hamstrings (HS), tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius soleus (GAS) muscles was recorded and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The overall muscle activity in the children with DMD was significantly different from that of the control group. Percentage activation amplitudes of RF, HS and TA were greater throughout the gait cycle in the children with DMD and the timing of GAS activity differed from the control children. Significantly greater muscle coactivation was found in the children with DMD. There were no significant differences between sides. Since the motor command is normal in DMD, the hyper-activity and co-contractions likely compensate for gait instability and muscle weakness, however may have negative consequences on the muscles and may increase the energy cost of gait. Simple rehabilitative strategies such as targeted physical therapies may improve stability and thus the pattern of muscle activity."

An adapter in this pathway, insulin-receptor substrate (IRS)-1, has been implicated in the diabetic osteopathy provoked by impaired insulin signaling. To further investigate IRS-1's role in the bone metabolism, we generated Irs-1-deficient Irs-1smla/smla mice. These null mice developed a spontaneous mutation that led to an increase in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) in 12-mo-old, but not in 2-mo-old mice. Analyses of the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from these mice revealed their differential expression of osteogenesis-related genes and miRNAs. The expression of miR-342, predicted and then proven to target the gene encoding collagen type Iα2 (COL1A2), was reduced in BMSCs derived from Irs-1-null mice. COL1A2 expression was then shown to be age dependent in osteoblasts and BMSCs derived from Irs-1smla/smla mice. After the induction of osteogenesis in BMSCs, miR-342 expression correlated inversely with that of Col1a2 Further, Col1a2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and inhibited BMSC differentiation into osteocyte-like cells, both in wild-type (WT) and Irs-1smla/smla mice. Conversely, in Irs-1smla/smla osteocytes overexpressing COL1A2, ALP-positive staining was stronger than in WT osteocytes.

Herein, we determine that TGFBI localizes within organized fibrillar structures in mesothelial-derived ECM. We determined that suppression of SPARC expression by shRNA decreased the deposition of TGFBI in mesothelial-derived ECM, without affecting its overall protein expression or secretion. Conversely, overexpression of SPARC increased TGFBI deposition. A SPARC-YFP fusion construct expressed by the Met5a cell line co-localized with TGFBI in the cell-derived ECM. Interestingly, in vitro produced SPARC was capable of precipitating TGFBI from cell lysates dependent on an intact SPARC carboxy-terminus with in vitro binding assays verifying a direct interaction. The last 37 amino acids of SPARC were shown to be required for the TGFBI interaction while expression of a SPARC-YFP construct lacking this region (aa 1–256) did not interact and co-localize with TGFBI in the ECM. Furthermore, ovarian cancer cells have a reduced motility and decreased response to the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel when plated on ECM derived from mesothelial cells lacking SPARC compared to control mesothelial-derived ECM. In conclusion, SPARC regulates the fibrillar ECM deposition of TGFBI through a novel interaction, subsequently influencing cancer cell behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2518931328,"Tendons are composed of collagen fibrils and proteoglycan predominantly consisting of decorin. Decorin is located on the d-band of collagen fibrils, and its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains have been observed between collagen fibrils with transmission electron microscopy. GAG chains have been proposed to interact with each other or with collagen fibrils, but its three-dimensional organization remains unclear. In this report, we used focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy to examine the three-dimensional organization of the GAG chain in the Achilles tendon of mature rats embedded in epoxy resin after staining with Cupromeronic blue, which specifically stains GAG chains. We used 250 serial back-scattered electron images of longitudinal sections with a 10-nm interval for reconstruction. Three-dimensional images revealed that GAG chains form a ring mesh-like structure with each ring surrounding a collagen fibril at the d-band and fusing with adjacent rings to form the planar network. This ring mesh model of GAG chains suggests that more than two GAG chains may interact with each other around collagen fibrils, which could provide new insights into the roles of GAG chains.

Tendon is primarily composed of collagen fibrils and the non-collagen matrix (1.Watanabe T. Imamura Y. Suzuki D. Hosaka Y. Ueda H. Hiramatsu K. Takehana K.

Decorin and biglycan belong to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family and consist of a core protein containing leucine repeats with a covalently attached chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 2The abbreviations used are:GAG, glycosaminoglycan; FIB-SEM, focused ion beam scanning electron microscope; TEM, transmission electron microscope. chain. The majority (>90%) of the tendon proteoglycan is decorin, while tendon also contains small amounts of biglycan (3.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G.

The decorin core protein binds to the surface of collagen fibrils by non-covalent binding and the attached decorin GAG chain extends from the core protein to associate closely with another decorin GAG chain on an adjacent fibril surface (4.Redaelli A.

Huang T.F. Kazam E. Iozzo R.V. Birk D.E. Soslowsky L.J. Influence of decorin and biglycan on mechanical properties of multiple tendons in knockout mice.J. Biomech. Eng. 2005; 127: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some researchers also reported that decorin might restore the alignment of the collagen fibrils deformed under load, rather than contribute to the transmission of forces (14.Ahmadzadeh H. Connizzo B.K. Freedman B.R. Soslowsky L.J. Shenoy V.B. Determining the contribution of glycosaminoglycans to tendon mechanical properties with a modified shear-lag model.J.

The structure of decorin GAG chains among collagen fibrils was observed by ultrathin sections of a sample stained with Cupromeronic blue and the critical electrolyte concentration technique, which was used to reveal the sulfated GAGs under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (5.Scott J.E.

Nomura et al. (18.Nomura Y. Structural change in decorin with skin aging.Connect. Tissue Res. 2006; 47: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) proposed the “binding model” of decorin GAG chains in which a GAG chain adheres to the surface of a collagen fibril. On the other hand, radial arrangement of decorin GAG chains between collagen fibrils was suggested in tendon (11.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G.

Thus, the three-dimensional structure of GAG chains is still unclear. In this study, we used a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) to observe the three-dimensional structure of proteoglycan GAG chains in the Achilles tendon of rats. Observation of the surface of resin embedded biological samples using backscattered electron imaging of SEM provides an image that is similar to TEM results (19.Ohta K. Sadayama S. Togo A. Higashi R.

Horstmann H. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct three-dimensional tissue nanostructure.PLos Biol. 2004; 2: 1900-1909Crossref Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Recently, as an alternative for obtaining TEM serial sectioning images, two serial sectioning techniques, using a microtome or focused ion beam (FIB) integrated inside a SEM, known as serial block-face SEM (SBF-SEM) (20.Denk W. Horstmann H. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct three-dimensional tissue nanostructure.PLos Biol. 2004; 2: 1900-1909Crossref Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) or FIB-SEM (21.Knott G. Marchman H. Wall D. Lich B. Serial section scanning electron microscopy of adult brain tissue using focused ion beam milling.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), respectively, have been developed. These techniques allow reconstruction of a three-dimensional image using software from the hundreds of SEM images obtained by repeated sectioning and observation, and have proved to be successful for biological studies, such as following axons and synaptic connections (21.Knott G. Marchman H. Wall D. Lich B. Serial section scanning electron microscopy of adult brain tissue using focused ion beam milling.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and clarifying mitochondrial fusion and fission (22.Dahl R. Larsen S. Dohlmann T.L. Qvortrup K. Helge J.W. Dela F. Prats C. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the human skeletal muscle mitochondrial network as a tool to assess mitochondrial content and structural organization.Acta Physiol. 2015; 213: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In a study on tendon, SBF-SEM revealed new extensive fine structural information of tendon quantifying tenocyte shape and cell-cell interactions as well as estimating the number and organization of individual collagen fibrils (23.Kalson N.S. Lu Y. Taylor S.H. Starborg T. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. A structure-based extracellular matrix expansion mechanism of fibrous tissue growth.Elife. 2015; (10. 7554/eLife. 05958)Google Scholar). We employed the FIB-SEM technique herein because it is more suitable than SBF-SEM for thin milling to observe fine GAG chains. The GAG chains were found to form a ring mesh-like, planar network structure at the d-band of collagen fibrils. The d-band structure of collagen fibrils was not identified in TEM images because samples were not subjected to electron staining in this study. However, GAG chains were observed in the region presumed to be the d-band of the collagen fibrils separated by an interval of approximately 67 nm (Fig. 1). Most GAG chains were arranged orthogonally between adjacent collagen fibrils. The block-face images from FIB-SEM were identical to TEM images of GAG chains and collagen fibrils. However, the d-band of the collagen fibrils could be observed in block-face images with the back-scattered electron detector. A series of block-face images showed that the GAG chains on the d-band were arranged to surround collagen fibrils (Fig. 2, supplemental Movie S1).FIGURE 2.Serial block-face images taken using FIB-SEM. Serial block-face images were taken with 10-nm intervals (a-l). The GAG chains appeared to attach at the d-band of a collagen fibril (arrow in a). These serial images were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the GAG chains. Filled arrowheads from a to f show that the GAG chains become longer and finally both ends of the GAG chains are connected to each other. Open arrowheads from g to l show the reverse of a to f.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three-dimensional images of the GAG chains were reconstructed from 250 serial block-face images obtained by FIB-SEM. The reconstructed image showed that the GAG chains formed a planar network and surrounded collagen fibrils (supplemental Movie S2). This planar network developed at every d-band region. The GAG chains were not distributed like a bridge/chuck-form that connects adjacent collagen fibrils, but they formed a ring mesh-like structure among collagen fibrils (Fig. 3). This network had overlapping thick areas that appeared green-red, probably consisting of multiple GAG chains that were presumed to be the binding site of adjacent collagen fibrils. This is the first report of the three-dimensional structure of GAG chains reconstructed from FIB-SEM images. The GAG chains were found to form a ring mesh-like structure (Fig. 4a) and surrounded collagen fibrils at the d-band of collagen fibrils in the tendon (Fig. 4b). The majority (>90%) of tendon proteoglycan has been reported to be decorin, whereas tendon also contains small amounts of another chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, biglycan (3.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G. Evidence against proteoglycan mediated collagen fibril load transmission and dynamic viscoelasticity in tendon.Matrix Biol. 2009; 28: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although proteoglycans with keratan sulfate such as fibromodulin and lumican are also expressed in tendon, their distribution differs from that of decorin/biglycan (3.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G.

Snedeker J.G. Evidence against proteoglycan mediated collagen fibril load transmission and dynamic viscoelasticity in tendon.Matrix Biol. 2009; 28: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of GAG chains observed in this study can be considered to be decorin GAG chains; although, small amounts of biglycan GAG chains may also be involved. In a longitudinal thin section of Cupromeronic blue-stained collagen fibrils, GAG chains will give different images according to a particular model. In the “shape module model” (3.Fessel G.

Anat. 1992; 180: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar) in which two GAG chains of decorin form the antiparallel duplex, GAG chains will be observed between collagen fibrils (Fig. 5a). In the “binding model” (18.Nomura Y. Structural change in decorin with skin aging.Connect. Tissue Res. 2006; 47: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25.Li Y. Liu Y. Xia W. Lei D. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Age-dependent alterations of decorin glycosaminoglycans in human skin.Sci. Rep. 2013; (10. 1038/srep02422)Google Scholar) where GAG chains adhere to the surface of collagen fibrils, GAG chains will appear on both sides or on the center of a collagen fibril (Fig. 5b). If decorin GAG chains are arranged radially between adjacent collagen fibrils, GAG chains will be observed between collagen fibrils in some longitudinal sections (Fig. 5c), but not in others (Fig. 5d) depending on the orientation of the tissue section. In contrast, in the ring mesh-like model, GAG chains will be observed between or on collagen fibrils in every section, as shown in Fig. 1 (Fig. 5, e and f). Thus, the “ring mesh model” is consistent with previously observed two-dimensional TEM images of decorin GAG chains (1.Watanabe T. Imamura Y. Suzuki D. Hosaka Y. Ueda H. Hiramatsu K. Takehana K.

Supramolecular organization of extracellular-matrix glycosaminoglycans, in vitro and in the tissues.FASEB. 1992; 6: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17.Scott J.E.

Tissue Res. 2006; 47: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) could be combined to account for three-dimensional structure of the GAG chains in the ring mesh model. The results presented also suggest that more than two GAG chains may bind together because a thick binding area was observed where collagen fibrils are in close contact. How multiple GAG chains interact represents a new study that will be addressed. In the dermis of the skin, decorin GAG chains were suggested to surround collagen fibrils (18.Nomura Y. Structural change in decorin with skin aging.Connect. Tissue Res. 2006; 47: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25.Li Y. Liu Y. Xia W. Lei D. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Age-dependent alterations of decorin glycosaminoglycans in human skin.Sci. Rep. 2013; (10. 1038/srep02422)Google Scholar), though the ring mesh-like structure has not been explicitly proposed. In contrast, in the tendon, decorin GAG chains are assumed to have a radial arrangement between collagen fibrils (11.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G. Equivalent stiffness after glycosaminoglycan depletion in tendon - an ultra-structural finite element model and corresponding experiments.J. Theor. Biol. 2011; 268: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14.Ahmadzadeh H. Connizzo B.K. Freedman B.R. Soslowsky L.J. Shenoy V.B. Determining the contribution of glycosaminoglycans to tendon mechanical properties with a modified shear-lag model.J. Biomech. 2013; 46: 2497-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 5, c and d. However, the present study indicates that decorin GAG chains in the tendon are not radially arranged but surround collagen fibrils. This discrepancy about the structure of decorin GAG chains between the dermis and the tendon may be attributable to the thickness of collagen fibrils. The general thickness of ultrathin sections for TEM observation is ∼70 nm. The diameter of collagen fibrils in the dermis is approximately 60 nm (25.Li Y. Liu Y. Xia W. Lei D. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Age-dependent alterations of decorin glycosaminoglycans in human skin.Sci. Rep. 2013; (10. 1038/srep02422)Google Scholar), whereas the tendon contains a large number of collagen fibrils > 100 nm in diameter, which form regular waves called crimps (23.Kalson N.S. Lu Y. Taylor S.H. Starborg T. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. A structure-based extracellular matrix expansion mechanism of fibrous tissue growth.Elife. 2015; (10. 7554/eLife. 05958)Google Scholar, 26.Franchi M. Ottani V. Stagni R. Ruggeri A. Tendon and ligament fibrillar crimps give rise to left-handed helices of collagen fibrils in both planar and helical crimps.J. Anat. 2010; 216: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27.Feitosa V.L.C. Reis F.P. Esquisatto M.A.M. Joazeiro P.P. Vidal B.C. Pimentel E.R. Comparative ultrastructural analysis of different regions of two digital flexor tendons of pigs.Micron. 2006; 37: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that decorin GAG chains in the tendon were not always observed to be straight but were assumed to be helical and wavy, making it difficult to observe GAG chains surrounding collagen fibrils. Previous studies suggested that decorin is involved in lateral binding of collagen fibrils. Zhang et al. (24.Zhang G.Y. Ezura Y. Chervoneva I. Robinson P.S. Beason D.P. Carine E.T. Soslowsky L.J. Iozzo R.V. Birk D.E. Decorin regulates assembly of collagen fibrils and acquisition of biomechanical properties during tendon development.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) reported that the collagen fibrils in the decorin-deficient flexor digitorum longus tendon are comparable to the wild-type control during the early developing stages between days 1 and 10 after birth; however, irregularly contoured fibrils were observed at day 90. This study also reported that biglycan expression increased substantially in decorin-deficient tendons for potential functional compensation. These data indicate that the absence of decorin is associated with dysfunctional regulation of fibril growth resulting in abnormal lateral fusion of collagen fibrils (24.Zhang G.Y. Ezura Y. Chervoneva I. Robinson P.S. Beason D.P. Carine E.T. Soslowsky L.J. Iozzo R.V. Birk D.E. Decorin regulates assembly of collagen fibrils and acquisition of biomechanical properties during tendon development.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The aberrant collagen fibrils due to uncontrolled lateral fusion were also observed for the tail tendon in decorin-deficient mice (28.Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. Targeted disruption of decorin leads to abnormal collagen fibril morphology and skin fragility.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). An In vitro study suggested that decorin GAG chains without the core protein may simply bind to the collagen fibril surface and regulate ties between two or more collagen fibrils (29.Raspanti M. Viola M. Forlino A. Tenni R. Gruppi C. Tira M.E. Glycosaminoglycans show a specific periodic interaction with type I collagen fibrils.J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 164: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, lateral binding of collagen fibrils is a key function of decorin GAG chains. The ring mesh model of GAG chains suggests that lateral binding is stronger than other models because multiple GAG chains are involved in binding between collagen fibrils in every direction. It was suggested that the majority of collagen fibrils in mature tendons are short and discontinuous, and that GAG chains transmit tensile strength through a matrix of these fibrils (4.Redaelli A. Vesentini S. Soncini M. Vena P. Mantero S. Montevecchi F.M. Possible role of decorin glycosaminoglycans in fibril to fibril force transfer in relative mature tendons - a computational study from molecular to microstructural level.J. Biomech. 2003; 36: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, other study suggested that most collagen fibrils in the tendon are long and that tensile strength is transferred directly through the fibrils (12.Provenzano P.P. Vanderby R. Collagen fibril morphology and organization: Implications for force transmission in ligament and tendon.Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). With regard to a role of GAG chains in mechanical properties of tendon, Provenzano and Vanderby (12.Provenzano P.P. Vanderby R. Collagen fibril morphology and organization: Implications for force transmission in ligament and tendon.Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) suggested that GAG chains in the tendon aid structural integrity by helping to guide collagen fibril maturation, maintaining hydration, and facilitating sliding between adjacent and intertwined fibrils during loading. Fessel and Snedeker (11.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G. Equivalent stiffness after glycosaminoglycan depletion in tendon - an ultra-structural finite element model and corresponding experiments.J. Theor. Biol. 2011; 268: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) enzymatically removed 80% of GAG chains from the tendon and found that its mechanical properties did not change compared with intact specimens. They concluded that the GAG content did not seem to be necessary for elastic tensile mechanics, and tendon GAG chains seem not to act as mechanical crosslinks but rather act to promote collagen fibril sliding under tension (30.Rigozzi S. Müller R. Stemmer A. Snedeker J.G. Tendon glycosaminoglycan proteoglycan sidechains promote collagen fibril sliding-AFM observations at the nanoscale.J.

The ring mesh model of GAG chains is compatible with these ideas if interactions between GAG chains are not rigid and provide a flexible structure between collagen fibrils. Recent studies (11.Fessel G. Snedeker J.G. Equivalent stiffness after glycosaminoglycan depletion in tendon - an ultra-structural finite element model and corresponding experiments.J. Theor.

However, these schematic models of GAG chains assumed the radial arrangement of GAG chains around a collagen fibril. Because we found that the decorin GAG chain makes the ring mesh-like planar structure at every d-band of collagen fibrils, further computational analysis of the ring mesh model of GAG chains may reveal their novel functions. The present study clarified that GAG chains form a ring mesh-like planar structure in the normal adult tendon. However, organization of collagen fibrils and decorin changes under different physiological conditions of tissue. Further studies on the decorin GAG chain in normal and diseased tissues using FIB-SEM may reveal novel aspects of the dynamic functions of the decorin GAG chain. The left or right Achilles tendon of four male Sprague-Dawley rats (about 300 g, 12 w: Hokudo Co. Ltd., Sapporo, Japan) were used. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Ethical Guideline for Sapporo Medical University (No. 192, Jan. 17, 2008). The rats were euthanized by overdose of pentobarbital sodium (120 mg/kg, i.p.: Somnopentyl, Kyoritsu Seiyaku, Japan). Tissue samples were obtained from the central one-third of the middle of the Achilles tendon. These samples were sliced into small cubes of ∼1 mm3 under a dissecting microscope, and fixed and stained with 0.05% Cupromeronic blue (w/v) (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in 0.025 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) containing 3% glutaraldehyde (v/v: TAAB, Berks, UK) and 0.1 m MgCl2 for 5 days at 4 °C. Residual stain was removed by rinsing three times in 0.025 m sodium acetate buffer containing 0.1 m MgCl2, and the samples were further stained with 0.034 m Na2WO4 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing twice in 50% ethanol containing 0.034 m Na2WO4, samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and transferred to QY-1 (Nisshin EM, Tokyo, Japan) according to standard procedures. Samples were embedded in epoxy resin (Quetol 812, Nisshin EM) and sliced longitudinally. For TEM analysis, ultrathin sections were prepared using an ultramicrotome (Super nova; Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria) and mounted on copper grids. The remaining resin block was placed on a holder and used for FIB-SEM observation. Ultrathin sections were examined under a TEM (JEM 1400; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV without electron staining. We observed longitudinal sections of collagen fibrils because GAG chains on the d-band can be observed clearly in this orientation. The observation position of the sample block was identified under FIB-SEM (Helios Nanolab 650, FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) at a high voltage of 20 kV. A new surface for serial block-face imaging was generated by FIB-milling at an 83 pA beam current, where gallium ions were accelerated at a voltage of 30 kV. Serial block-face images were obtained with a back-scattered electron detector at an acceleration voltage of 2 kV and working distance of 4 mm; 250 block-face images were obtained (field of view: 5.08 × 5.08 μm, 10-nm interval). These images were transferred to the 8-bit gray scale tiff image (3072 × 2048 pixels) for a 3.0 μs dwell time. The voxel size was 1.65 nm/pixel wide, 3.14 nm/pixel high and a depth of 10 nm/pixel. The contrast of the images was inversed. Three-dimensional reconstruction and segmentation of GAG chains were performed by 3D imaging software (AMIRA 5.6, Maxnet Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The Amira software was used to perform three-dimensional reconstruction from two-dimensional FIB-SEM data sets, which allows reconstructed image evaluation from various angles. T. W. and K.

https://openalex.org/W2521028580,"Deficiency of mitochondrial complex I is encountered in both rare and common diseases, but we have limited therapeutic options to treat this lesion to the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Idebenone and menadione are redox-active molecules capable of rescuing OXPHOS activity by engaging complex I-independent pathways of entry, often referred to as “complex I bypass.” In the present study, we created a cellular model of complex I deficiency by using CRISPR genome editing to knock out Ndufa9 in mouse myoblasts, and utilized this cell line to develop a high-throughput screening platform for novel complex I bypass factors. We screened a library of ~40,000 natural product extracts and performed bioassay-guided fractionation on a subset of the top scoring hits. We isolated four plant-derived 1,4-naphthoquinone complex I bypass factors with structural similarity to menadione: chimaphilin and 3-chloro-chimaphilin from Chimaphila umbellata and dehydro-α-lapachone and dehydroiso-α-lapachone from Stereospermum euphoroides. We also tested a small number of structurally related naphthoquinones from commercial sources and identified two additional compounds with complex I bypass activity: 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4,-naphthoquinone. The six novel complex I bypass factors reported here expand this class of molecules and will be useful as tool compounds for investigating complex I disease biology."
https://openalex.org/W2520511949,"Dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to the development of many diseases and pathological conditions through the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and, where studied, ablation of p66Shc (p66) was beneficial. p66 translocates to the mitochondria and oxidizes cytochrome c to yield H2O2, which in turn initiates cell death. PKCβ-mediated phosphorylation of serine 36 in p66 has been implicated as a key regulatory step preceding mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and cell death, and PKCβ thus may provide a target for therapeutic intervention. We performed a reassessment of PKCβ regulation of the oxidoreductase activity of p66. Although our experiments did not substantiate Ser36 phosphorylation by PKCβ, they instead provided evidence for Ser139 and Ser213 as PKCβ phosphorylation sites regulating the pro-oxidant and pro-apoptotic function of p66. Mutation of another predicted PKCβ phosphorylation site also located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain, threonine 206, had no phenotype. Intriguingly, p66 with Thr206 and Ser213 mutated to glutamic acid showed a gain-of-function phenotype with significantly increased ROS production and cell death induction. Taken together, these data argue for a complex mechanism of PKCβ-dependent regulation of p66 activation involving Ser139 and a motif surrounding Ser213."
https://openalex.org/W2520827557,"When treated with nerve growth factor, PC12 cells will differentiate over the course of several days. Here, we have followed changes during differentiation in the cellular levels of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) and its activator, Gαq, which together mediate Ca2+ release. We also followed changes in the level of the novel PLCβ binding partner TRAX (translin-associated factor X), which promotes RNA-induced gene silencing. We find that the level of PLCβ increases 4-fold within 24 h, whereas Gαq increases only 1.4-fold, and this increase occurs ∼24 h later than PLCβ. Alternately, the level of TRAX remains constant over the 72 h tested. When PLCβ1 or TRAX is down-regulated, differentiation does not occur. The impact of PLCβ on differentiation appears independent of Gαq as down-regulating Gαq at constant PLCβ does not affect differentiation. Förster resonance energy transfer studies after PLCβ association with its partners indicate that PLCβ induced soon after nerve growth factor treatment associates with TRAX rather than Gαq. Functional measurements of Ca2+ signals to assess the activity of PLCβ-Gαq complexes and measurements of the reversal of siRNA(GAPDH) to assess the activity of PLCβ-TRAX complexes additionally suggest that the newly synthesized PLCβ associates with TRAX to impact RNA-induced silencing. Taken together, our studies show that PLCβ, through its ability to bind TRAX and reverse RNA silencing of specific genes, plays a key role in switching PC12 cells to their differentiated state.

https://openalex.org/W2520260056,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an active neurotrophin abundantly expressed throughout the nervous system. It plays an important role in synaptic transmission, plasticity, neuronal proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death. The Bdnf gene in rodents has eight non-coding exons and only a single coding exon (IX). Despite its recognized regulation by neuronal activity, relatively little is known about its transcriptional regulation, and even less about the transcription factor candidates that may play such a role. The goal of the present study was to probe for such a candidate that may regulate exon IX in the rat Bdnf gene. Our in silico analysis revealed tandem binding sites for nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) on the promoter of exon IX. NRF-2 is of special significance because it co-regulates the expressions of mediators of energy metabolism (cytochrome c oxidase) and mediators of neuronal activity (glutamatergic receptors). To test our hypothesis that NRF-2 also regulates the Bdnf gene, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), promoter cloning, and site-directed mutagenesis, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting analysis. Results indicate that NRF-2 functionally regulates exon IX of the rat Bdnf gene. The binding sites of NRF-2 are conserved between rats and mice. Overexpressing NRF-2 up-regulated the expression of Bdnf exon IX, whereas knocking down NRF-2 down-regulated such expression. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that NRF-2, in addition to regulating the coupling between neuronal activity and energy metabolism, also regulates the expression of BDNF, which is intimately associated with energy-demanding neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2519675996,"Recent studies have implicated thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in cone photoreceptor viability. Using mousemodels of retinal degeneration, we found that antithyroid treatment preserves cones. This work investigates the significance of targeting intracellular TH components locally in the retina. The cellular TH level is mainly regulated by deiodinase iodothyronine (DIO)-2 and −3. DIO2 converts thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), which binds to the TH receptor, whereas DIO3 degrades T3 and T4. We examined cone survival after overexpression of DIO3 and inhibition of DIO2 and demonstrated the benefits of these manipulations. Subretinal delivery of AAV5- IRBP/GNAT2-DIO3, which directs expression of human DIO3 specifically in cones, increased cone density by 30–40%in a Rpe65−/− mouse model of Lebers congenital amaurosis (LCA) and in a Cpfl1 mouse with Pde6c defect model of achromatopsia, comparedwith their respective untreated controls. Intravitreal and topical delivery of the DIO2 inhibitor iopanoic acid also significantly improved cone survival in the LCA model mice. Moreover, the expression levels of DIO2 and Slc16a2 were significantly higher in the diseased retinas, suggesting locally elevated THsignaling.

https://openalex.org/W2520543337,"Residents are required to learn a multitude of skills during their microsurgical training. One such skill is the judicious application of force when handling delicate tissue. An instrument has been developed that indicates to the surgeon when a force threshold has been exceeded by providing vibrotactile feedback. The objective of this study was to validate the use of this ""smart"" force-limiting instrument for microsurgery. A laboratory and an in vivo experiment were performed to evaluate the force-limiting instrument. In the laboratory experiment, twelve novice surgeons were randomly allocated to use either the force-limiting instrument or a standard instrument. Surgeons were then asked to perform microsurgical dissection in a model. In the in vivo experiment, an intermediate surgeon performed microsurgical dissection in a stepwise fashion, alternating every 30 seconds between use of the force-limiting instrument and a standard instrument. The primary outcomes were the forces exerted and the OSATS scores. In the laboratory experiment, the maximal forces exerted by novices using the force-limiting instrument were significantly less than using a standard instrument, and were comparable to intermediate and expert surgeons (0.637N versus 4.576N; p = 0.007). In the in vivo experiment, the maximal forces exerted with the force-limiting instrument were also significantly less than with a standard instrument (0.441N versus 0.742N; p <0.001). Notably, use of the force-limiting instrument did not significantly impede the surgical workflow as measured by the OSATS score (p >0.1). In conclusion, the development and use of this force-limiting instrument in a clinical setting may improve patient safety."

The etiological agents Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani cause active and asymptomatic diseases. Effective drugs to treat VL exist but unfortunately, post-treatment relapses are common. Little is known why drugs are non-sterilizing or how these intracellular pathogens can escape treatment. Here, using a murine model of VL we found that CD271+/Sca1+ bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are readily infected in vitro and in vivo by L. infantum. Because BM-MSCs express potent drug efflux pumps, e.g., ABCG2 it is possible that this unique intracellular infectious niche could allow L. infantum to escape anti-parasite drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2519485578,"Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1) was originally identified as a protein that binds to the Huntington disease protein, huntingtin. Growing evidence has shown that Hap1 participates in intracellular trafficking via its association with various microtubule-dependent transporters and organelles. Recent studies also revealed that Hap1 is involved in exocytosis such as insulin release from pancreatic β-cells. However, the mechanism underlying the action of Hap1 on insulin release remains to be investigated. We found that Hap1 knock-out mice had a lower plasma basal insulin level than control mice. Using cultured pancreatic β-cell lines, INS-1 cells, we confirmed that decreasing Hap1 reduces the number of secreted vesicles and inhibits vesicle exocytosis. Electrophysiology and imaging of intracellular Ca2+ measurements demonstrated that Hap1 depletion significantly reduces the influx of Ca2+ mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels (Cav). This decrease is not due to reduced expression of Cav1.2 channel mRNA but results from the decreased distribution of Cav1.2 on the plasma membrane of INS-1 cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed a defective movement of Cav1.2 in Hap1 silencing INS-1 cells. Our findings suggest that Hap1 is important for insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells via regulating the intracellular trafficking and plasma membrane localization of Cav1.2, providing new insight into the mechanisms that regulate insulin release from pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2520352983,"The periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria includes a variety of molecular chaperones that shepherd the folding and targeting of secreted proteins. A central player of this quality control network is DegP, a protease also suggested to have a chaperone function. We serendipitously discovered that production of the Bordetella pertussis autotransporter virulence protein pertactin is lethal in Escherichia coli ΔdegP strains. We investigated specific contributions of DegP to secretion of pertactin as a model system to test the functions of DegP in vivo. The DegP chaperone activity was sufficient to restore growth during pertactin production. This chaperone dependency could be relieved by changing the pertactin signal sequence: an E. coli signal sequence leading to co-translational inner membrane (IM) translocation was sufficient to suppress lethality in the absence of DegP, whereas an E. coli post-translational signal sequence was sufficient to recapitulate the lethal phenotype. These results identify a novel connection between the DegP chaperone and the mechanism used to translocate a protein across the IM. Lethality coincided with loss of periplasmic proteins, soluble σE, and proteins regulated by this essential stress response. These results suggest post-translational IM translocation can lead to the formation of toxic periplasmic folding intermediates, which DegP can suppress."
https://openalex.org/W2496811804,"Spatial resolution is an important factor for human pattern recognition. In particular, low resolution (blur) is a defining characteristic of low vision. Here, we examined spatial (field of view) and temporal (stimulus duration) requirements for blurry object recognition. The spatial resolution of an image such as letter or face, was manipulated with a low-pass filter. In experiment 1, studying spatial requirement, observers viewed a fixed-size object through a window of varying sizes, which was repositioned until object identification (moving window paradigm). Field of view requirement, quantified as the number of ""views"" (window repositions) for correct recognition, was obtained for three blur levels, including no blur. In experiment 2, studying temporal requirement, we determined threshold viewing time, the stimulus duration yielding criterion recognition accuracy, at six blur levels, including no blur. For letter and face recognition, we found blur significantly increased the number of views, suggesting a larger field of view is required to recognize blurry objects. We also found blur significantly increased threshold viewing time, suggesting longer temporal integration is necessary to recognize blurry objects. The temporal integration reflects the tradeoff between stimulus intensity and time. While humans excel at recognizing blurry objects, our findings suggest compensating for blur requires increased field of view and viewing time. The need for larger spatial and longer temporal integration for recognizing blurry objects may further challenge object recognition in low vision. Thus, interactions between blur and field of view should be considered for developing low vision rehabilitation or assistive aids."

Three hundred and nine Seoul residents aged 20-49 years who used Android-based smartphones were recruited, and the subjects installed a special application that we developed for this study. This application collected information on sound and geographical location every 10 min for 7 days. Using GIS, we were able to construct various types of noise maps of Seoul (e.g., daytime/nighttime and weekdays/weekends) using the information on sound and geographical location obtained via the users' smartphones.

https://openalex.org/W2519640648,"The acquisition of drug resistance mediated by the interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM), commonly referred to as cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR), has been observed not only in hematopoietic tumor cells but also in solid tumor cells. We have previously demonstrated that a 22-mer peptide derived from fibronectin, FNIII14, can inhibit cell adhesion through the inactivation of β1 integrin; when coadministered with cytarabine, FNIII14 completely eradicates acute myelogenous leukemia by suppressing CAM-DR. In this study, we show that our FNIII14 peptide also enhances chemotherapy efficacy in solid tumors. Coadministration of FNIII14 synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and aclarubicin in mammary tumor and melanoma cells, respectively. The solid tumor cell chemosensitization induced by FNIII14 is dependent upon the upregulation and activation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Furthermore, the metastasis of tumor cells derived from ventrally transplanted mammary tumor grafts is suppressed by the coadministration of FNIII14 and doxorubicin. These results suggest that the coadministration of our FNIII14 peptide with chemotherapy could achieve efficient solid tumor eradication by increasing chemosensitivity and decreasing metastasis. The major causes of tumor recurrence are the existence of chemotherapy-resistant primary tumor cells and the establishment of secondary metastatic lesions. As such, coadministering FNIII14 with anti-cancer drugs could provide a promising new approach to improve the prognosis of patients with solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2518716948,"Although a few studies have investigated the integration between some types of unconscious stimuli, no research has yet explored the integration between unconscious emotional stimuli. This study was designed to provide behavioral evidence for the integration between unconsciously perceived emotional faces (same or different valence relation) using a modified priming paradigm. In two experiments, participants were asked to decide whether two faces in the target, which followed two subliminally presented faces of same or different emotional expressions, were of the same or different emotional valence. The interstimulus interval (ISI) between the prime and the target was manipulated (0, 53, 163 ms). In Experiment 1, prime visibility was assessed post-experiment. In Experiment 2, it was assessed on each trial. Interestingly, in both experiments, unconsciously processed valence relation of the two faces in the prime generated a negative priming effect in the response to the supraliminally presented target, independent of the length of ISI. Further analyses suggested that the negative priming was probably caused by a motor response incongruent relation between the subliminally perceived prime and the supraliminally perceived target. The visual feature incongruent relation across the prime and target was not found to play a role in the negative priming. Because the negative priming was found at short ISI, an attention mechanism as well as a motor inhibition mechanism were proposed in the generation of the negative priming effect. Overall, this study indicated that the subliminal valence relation was processed, and that integration between different unconsciously perceived stimuli could occur."

In this model, the outer domain is set with a 25 km resolution and the inner one, with a 9 km resolution. Calculations are performed on the inner domain. The model is forced at the sea surface by climatological monthly mean wind stress, freshwater (evaporation minus precipitation), and heat fluxes. Momentum and tracers (such as temperature and salinity) are prescribed in addition to the tidal heights and currents extracted from the Oregon State University TOPEX/Poseidon Global Inverse Solution (TPXO7.2) at the open boundaries. The results are validated against observed tidal amplitudes and phases at 19 locations. Results show that the mean average power energy spectrum (in unit m2/s/cph) for diurnal tides at the southern end of the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia is approximately 43% greater than that in the East Malaysia region located in northern Borneo. In contrast, for the region of northern Borneo the semidiurnal power energy spectrum is approximately 25% greater than that in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. This implies that diurnal tides are dominant along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia while both diurnal and semidiurnal tides dominate almost equally in coastal East Malaysia. Furthermore, the diurnal tidal energy flux is found to be 60% greater than that of the semidiurnal tides in the southern South China Sea. Based on these model analyses, the significant tidal mixing frontal areas are located primarily off Sarawak coast as indicated by high chlorophyll-a concentrations in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2519032381,"The Southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a threatened species, central to the tourism appeal of private game reserves in South Africa. Privately owned reserves in South Africa tend to be smaller than government run reserves such as Kruger National Park. Because of their relatively small size and the often heterogeneous nature of the landscape private game reserve managers benefit from detailed knowledge of white rhinoceros terrain selection preferences, which can be assessed from their ranging behaviours. We collected adult and sub-adult white rhinoceros distribution data over a 15 month period, calculating individual range size using kernel density estimation analysis within a GIS. From this, terrain selectivity was calculated using 50% and 95% kernels to extract terrain composition values. Jacob’s correction of the Ivlev’s selectivity index was subsequently applied to the terrain composition of each individual to identify trends in selectivity. Results reveal that adult males hold exclusive territories considerably smaller than those found in previous work conducted in “open” or large reserves. Similarly, results for the size of male versus female territories were also not in keeping with those from previous field studies, with males, rather than females, having the larger territory requirement. Terrain selection for both genders and age classes (adult and sub-adult) showed a strong preference for open grassland and avoidance of hill slope and riparian terrains. This research reveals white rhinoceros terrain selection preferences and how they influence range requirements in small, closed reserves. We conclude that this knowledge will be valuable in future white rhinoceros conservation management in small private game reserves, particularly in decisions surrounding removal of surplus individuals or augmentation of existing populations, calculation of reserve carrying capacity and future private reserve acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2519654118,"An unfused tetanus of a motor unit (MU) evoked by a train of pulses at variable interpulse intervals is the sum of non-equal twitch-like responses to these stimuli. A tool for a precise prediction of these successive contractions for MUs of different physiological types with different contractile properties is crucial for modeling the whole muscle behavior during various types of activity. The aim of this paper is to develop such a general mathematical algorithm for the MUs of the medial gastrocnemius muscle of rats. For this purpose, tetanic curves recorded for 30 MUs (10 slow, 10 fast fatigue-resistant and 10 fast fatigable) were mathematically decomposed into twitch-like contractions. Each contraction was modeled by the previously proposed 6-parameter analytical function, and the analysis of these six parameters allowed us to develop a prediction algorithm based on the following input data: parameters of the initial twitch, the maximum force of a MU and the series of pulses. Linear relationship was found between the normalized amplitudes of the successive contractions and the remainder between the actual force levels at which the contraction started and the maximum tetanic force. The normalization was made according to the amplitude of the first decomposed twitch. However, the respective approximation lines had different specific angles with respect to the ordinate. These angles had different and non-overlapping ranges for slow and fast MUs. A sensitivity analysis concerning this slope was performed and the dependence between the angles and the maximal fused tetanic force normalized to the amplitude of the first contraction was approximated by a power function. The normalized MU contraction and half-relaxation times were approximated by linear functions depending on the normalized actual force levels at which each contraction starts. The normalization was made according to the contraction time of the first contraction. The actual force levels were calculated initially from the recorded tetanic curves and subsequently from the modeled curves obtained from the summation of all models of the preceding contractions (the so called ""full prediction""). The preciseness of the prediction was verified by two coefficients estimating the error between the modeled and the experimentally recorded curves. The proposed approach was tested for 30 MUs from the database and for three additional MUs, not included in the initial set. It was concluded that this general algorithm can be successfully used for modeling of a unfused tetanus course of a single MU of fast and slow type."

Participants were required to stand on a force platform while, with one hand, they pulled a string that was fastened at the other end to a 2-kg or to a 4-kg force in the opposite direction at a random order. The number of times the participants lost their balance and motions of center of pressure (COP) when the string was suddenly released were recorded. The results demonstrated that although the loss of balance rates for each pulling force condition did not differ between groups, older adults with CLBP had poorer postural responses: delayed reaction, larger displacement, higher velocity, longer path length, and greater COP sway area compared to the older controls. Furthermore, both groups showed larger postural responses in the 4-kg pulling force condition. Although aging is generally believed to be associated with declining balance and postural control, these findings highlight the effect of CLBP on reactive balance when responding to an externally generated force in an older population. This study also suggests that, for older adults with CLBP, in addition to treating them for pain and disability, reactive balance evaluation and training, such as reaction and movement strategy training should be included in their interventions. Clinicians and older patients with CLBP need to be made aware of the significance of impaired reactive balance and the increased risk of falls when encountering unexpected perturbations."

They might also function as an epigenetic memory by remaining bound to mitotic chromosomes. Both proteins are made from the same gene. They differ in their N-terminal 80 amino acids, which contain single DNA-binding BED fingers. The remaining 200 amino acids are identical in the two proteins. The structure and function of the middle region of 120 amino acids is unknown, while the C-terminal region of 80 amino acids has a putative leucine zipper and a BESS domain and mediates BEAF-BEAF interactions. Here we report a further characterization of BEAF. We show that the BESS domain alone is sufficient to mediate BEAF-BEAF interactions, although the presence of the putative leucine zipper on at least one protein strengthens the interactions. BEAF-32B is sufficient to rescue a null BEAF mutation in flies. Using mutant BEAF-32B rescue transgenes, we show that the middle region and the BESS domain are essential. In contrast, the last 40 amino acids of the middle region, which is poorly conserved among Drosophila species, is dispensable. Deleting the putative leucine zipper results in a hypomorphic mutant BEAF-32B protein. Finally, we document the dynamics of BEAF-32A-EGFP and BEAF-32B-mRFP during mitosis in embryos. A subpopulation of both proteins appears to remain on mitotic chromosomes and also on the mitotic spindle, while much of the fluorescence is dispersed during mitosis. Differences in the dynamics of the two proteins are observed in syncytial embryos, and both proteins show differences between syncytial and later embryos. This characterization of BEAF lays a foundation for future studies into molecular mechanisms of BEAF function."
https://openalex.org/W2520465409,"Pathway analysis has become popular as a secondary analysis strategy for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most of the current pathway analysis methods aggregate signals from the main effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes within a pathway without considering the effects of gene-gene interactions. However, gene-gene interactions can also have critical effects on complex diseases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been used to define gene pairs for the gene-gene interaction tests. Incorporating the PPI information to define gene pairs for interaction tests within pathways can increase the power for pathway-based association tests. We propose a pathway association test, which aggregates the interaction signals in PPI networks within a pathway, for GWAS with case-control samples. Gene size is properly considered in the test so that genes do not contribute more to the test statistic simply due to their size. Simulation studies were performed to verify that the method is a valid test and can have more power than other pathway association tests in the presence of gene-gene interactions within a pathway under different scenarios. We applied the test to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium GWAS datasets for seven common diseases. The most significant pathway is the chaperones modulate interferon signaling pathway for Crohn's disease (p-value = 0.0003). The pathway modulates interferon gamma, which induces the JAK/STAT pathway that is involved in Crohn's disease. Several other pathways that have functional implications for the seven diseases were also identified. The proposed test based on gene-gene interaction signals in PPI networks can be used as a complementary tool to the current existing pathway analysis methods focusing on main effects of genes. An efficient software implementing the method is freely available at http://puppi.sourceforge.net."

Methods Data were drawn from six survey waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health 1973–78 birth cohort. Self-reported general and mental health scores derived from the SF-36 scale were compared for women with a history of IPV living in metropolitan, regional and rural areas. Multivariable generalised estimating equations were constructed adjusting for income hardship, number of children, education, social support, age and marital status. Results Women with a history of IPV living in regional and rural areas had no significant differences in self-reported general health scores compared to their metropolitan counterparts. Rural women affected by IPV had slightly better self-reported mental health than equivalent women living in metropolitan or regional areas. The socio-demographic factors with the strongest association with self-reported health were income, education, social support, and number of children. Conclusions Women in regional and rural areas were no more disadvantaged, in terms of self-reported general health or mental health, than IPV affected women living in major cities in Australia."

Tu is an essential protein present in all kingdoms of life. It is among the most abundant proteins in any given cell, representing up to 5% of the total cellular protein in Escherichia coli (1.Arike L. Valgepea K. Peil L. Nahku R. Adamberg K. Vilu R.

Despite the critical cellular role of EF-Ts, its sequence is highly divergent among different bacterial species. Poor conservation of the primary sequence within bacterial EF-Ts sequences may give rise to differences in the enzymatic properties, raising the question of how and if the enzymatic properties are maintained among different bacterial EF-Tu·EF-Ts pairs. This is particularly interesting because the structure of the eukaryotic exchange factor is completely unrelated to its bacterial counterpart, whereas the respective structure for eEF1A remains similar to EF-Tu (12.Andersen G.R.

These two gram-negative bacterial species share 84 and 55% sequence identity between their respective EF-Tu and EF-Ts, enabling us to investigate the conservation of the overall enzymatic strategy for nucleotide exchange and the respective kinetic parameters among closely related species. In particular, it is interesting that EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa contains an extended C-terminal helix that interacts with a low conservation region on EF-Tu and that may play a functional role during nucleotide exchange. Prior to a detailed investigation of the kinetic mechanism of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts mediated nucleotide exchange reaction, we first conducted a comparative analysis of the nucleotide binding properties of P. aeruginosa EF-Tu and E. coli EF-Tu. Rate constants for guanine nucleotide association and dissociation were determined using the stopped flow technique by measuring FRET between a single tryptophan in P. aeruginosa EF-Tu (Trp-40) or E. coli EF-Tu (Trp-184) and fluorescent methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled guanine nucleotides (13.Dahl L.D.

Nucleotide dissociation rate constants were obtained in a chase experiment by mixing EF-Tu·mant-GTP/GDP with excess unlabeled guanine nucleotide. Consistent with a first-order reaction, dissociation of guanine nucleotides from EF-Tu occurs with an observed single-exponential decay (Fig. 2, A and B). Rate constants (k−5 and k−1 for GTP and GDP) were directly obtained by fitting the observed time courses with a single-exponential function (Equation 1 under “Experimental Procedures”) and are summarized in Table 1. Despite the high degree of sequence conservation between P. aeruginosa and E. coli EF-Tu, dissociation of GDP and GTP from P. aeruginosa EF-Tu (k−1 = 0.0007 ± 0.0001 s−1, k−5 = 0.007 ± 0.001 s−1) is slightly slower than from E. coli EF-Tu (k−1 = 0.0018 ± 0.0001 s−1, k−5 = 0.013 ± 0.001 s−1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters governing the nucleotide interaction with EF-Tu Open table in a new tab To determine the rate constants of GTP and GDP association, guanine nucleotide association was measured using a constant concentration of nucleotide-free EF-Tu and increasing concentrations of mant-GTP or mant-GDP (Fig. 2, C and D). The respective apparent rate constants (kapp) at different nucleotide concentrations were determined from the obtained fluorescence time courses by fitting with a single-exponential function (Equation 1). The linear dependence of kapp on the concentration of mant-GTP/mant-GDP was used to determine the respective association rate constants (k5 and k1) from the slope of the concentration dependence. The values for P. aeruginosa and E. coli EF-Tu are summarized in Table 1 and indicate a 3-fold faster rate of mant-GTP association (k5) for P. aeruginosa EF-Tu but no difference in the mant-GDP association (k1) rate constants. These rate constants reveal 5- and 2.8-fold higher affinities (Kd) of mant-GTP and mant-GDP for P. aeruginosa EF-Tu when compared with E. coli EF-Tu (summarized in Table 1). To maintain in vivo rates of protein synthesis, EF-Ts is required to enhance the low intrinsic rate of guanine nucleotide dissociation from EF-Tu. This becomes even more relevant for P. aeruginosa EF-Tu with its tighter binding to nucleotides compared with E. coli EF-Tu. The interaction of EF-Tu·GTP or EF-Tu·GDP with EF-Ts can be described as two consecutive steps: the formation of the EF-Tu·nucleotide·EF-Ts ternary complex followed by the release of the bound guanine nucleotide (Fig. 1). To study the EF-Ts-catalyzed dissociation of guanine nucleotides from EF-Tu, experiments were carried out using mant-GTP/mant-GDP. Upon mixing of the respective preformed EF-Tu·mant-nucleotide complexes with EF-Ts, a single exponential fluorescence decrease reflecting the mant-GTP/mant-GDP dissociation was observed. At low concentrations of EF-Ts, kapp increases linearly with the EF-Ts concentration, consistent with the formation of the EF-Tu·mant-GTP/mant-GDP·EF-Ts ternary complex. At high concentrations of EF-Ts, the rate of the reaction reaches saturation and equals the rate constant of nucleotide dissociation, i.e. k−7 (GTP) or k−4 (GDP) (Fig. 3). To assess the interchangeability of EF-Ts from either E. coli or P. aeruginosa, the experiment was also performed with EF-Tu·mant-GTP/mant-GDP from each species in the presence of EF-Ts from E. coli or P. aeruginosa. (summarized in TABLE 2, TABLE 3). Consistent with previous reports, E. coli EF-Ts stimulates the dissociation of mant-GTP and mant-GDP from its EF-Tu more than 9,000-fold (k−7/k−5) and more than 130,000-fold (k−4/k−1), respectively. Similar to the E. coli system, mant-GTP and mant-GDP dissociation from P. aeruginosa EF-Tu is efficiently catalyzed by its own EF-Ts, more than 5000-fold (k−7/k−5) and 50,000-fold (k−4/k−1), respectively. However, dissociation of mant-GTP and mant-GDP from P. aeruginosa EF-Tu is accelerated only 700-fold (k−7/k−5) and 14,000-fold (k−4/k−1) by the E. coli exchange factor. In contrast to this, the P. aeruginosa exchange factor is able to stimulate the dissociation of mant-GTP and mant-GDP from E. coli EF-Tu. more than 21,000-fold (k−7/k−5) and 270,000-fold (k−4/k−1), respectively.TABLE 3Rate constants for the kinetic mechanism of nucleotide exchange in P. aeruginosa EF-TuStepEF-Ts (E. coli)EF-Ts (P. aeruginosa)EF-Ts (Q283M)EF-Ts (Δ283)EF-Ts (chimera)s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1k−410 ± 140 ± 10>403 ± 1>40k−75 ± 140 ± 2190 ± 500.9 ± 0.125 ± 2 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Rate constants for the kinetic mechanism of nucleotide exchange in E. coli EF-Tu Open table in a new tab It is surprising that P. aeruginosa EF-Ts is able to catalyze the dissociation of guanine nucleotides from E. coli EF-Tu. more efficiently than the corresponding E. coli exchange factor. This is particularly astonishing because the interaction surface between EF-Tu and EF-Ts is highly conserved between the two species (Fig. 4A). The only exceptions to this are variations found within the C-terminal module (helix 13) of EF-Ts, pointing at a putative role for this helix during EF-Ts stimulated nucleotide dissociation from the EF-Tu·nucleotide·EF-Ts complex. The difference in sequence is subtle and includes a two-amino acid extension of helix 13 (Fig. 4B). The increased helix length and variation in its sequence might provide additional interactions between domain I of EF-Tu and helix 13 of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts that are not possible with the shorter E. coli helix. To dissect the role of helix 13 for the nucleotide exchange mechanism in EF-Tu, a C-terminal truncation variant, EF-Ts (Δ283), of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts (Fig. 4B) was constructed, and the kinetic parameters describing the interactions between EF-Tu, the EF-Ts variants, and guanine nucleotides were determined using the approach described above (summarized in Table 3). Consistent with a role of the C-terminal extension of helix 13 during EF-Ts-mediated nucleotide dissociation, the C-terminal truncation variant of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts (EF-Ts(Δ283)) stimulated GTP and GDP dissociation from P. aeruginosa EF-Tu 44-fold (k−7/k−7) and 13-fold (k−4/k−4) less efficiently than wild type EF-Ts, respectively (Fig. 5 and TABLE 2, TABLE 3). A similar effect (47- and 16-fold for GTP and GDP, respectively) was also observed for EF-Ts(Δ283)-mediated nucleotide dissociation from E. coli EF-Tu. Similar to the P. aeruginosa system, the effect is strongest for GTP dissociation, suggesting that this is a common feature of the C-terminal extension present in P. aeruginosa EF-Ts. The conserved relative effect is particularly interesting because this EF-Ts is able to facilitate 6–10-fold faster GTP (k−7/k−7) and GDP (k−4/k−4) dissociation in E. coli EF-Tu then in its P. aeruginosa counterpart. Overall the P. aeruginosa EF-Ts-stimulated nucleotide dissociation from E. coli EF-Tu was twice as fast (k−7/k−7 and k−4/k−4, respectively) as when stimulated by its own EF-Ts (Table 2). Thus, the C-terminal extension of helix 13 in EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa affects nucleotide dissociation from both its own EF-Tu and that of the E. coli to a similar extent, independent of the nucleotides present. To further investigate the role of the C-terminal extension for the nucleotide exchange mechanism, we replaced the last four residues in E. coli EF-Ts (SKQS) with the last six residues (VAATKQ) from P. aeruginosa, constructing a chimera of EF-Ts (EF-Ts(Chimera); Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the dissociation rate constants describing EF-Ts(Chimera)-catalyzed mant-GTP/mant-GDP from E. coli EF-Tu are k−7 = 120 ± 20 s−1 and k−4 = 380 ± 50 s−1 (Table 2) and are similar to wild type E. coli EF-Ts. However, the EF-Ts(Chimera) reduces the association rate constants for mant-GTP/mant-GDP binding (k7 and k4, respectively) to the EF-Tu.·EF-Ts complex 25- and 10-fold (Table 2). This effect is comparable with what we determined for k7 and k4 in the presence of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts (15- and 5-fold reduction, respectively), suggesting a role of the C-terminal helix in modulating the nucleotide association kinetics. Ultimately, given the unchanged dissociation rate constant, replacing the C-terminal residues in E. coli EF-Ts with those from P. aeruginosa lowers the nucleotide affinity for mant-GTP/mant-GDP (K7 and K4) to the EF-Tu.·EF-Ts complex 24- and 16-fold, making it similar to the affinity for the E. coli EF-Tu P. aeruginosa EF-Ts complex (Table 2). This is consistent with the fact that the EF-Ts(Chimera) is able to catalyze dissociation of mant-GTP/mant-GDP from P. aeruginosa EF-Tu more like the EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa. (Table 3), despite the fact that 98% of its sequence is identical to E. coli EF-Ts. When comparing the interactions of the helix 13 residues in the structure of the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex from E. coli (16.Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. The structure of the Escherichia coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex at 2.5 Å resolution.Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) with the sequence of the P. aeruginosa factors, we observed that Met-278 within helix 13 of E. coli EF-Ts makes a number of hydrophobic contacts with Ala-29 and Thr-25 located close to the magnesium ion binding site in domain I of EF-Tu (16.Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. The structure of the Escherichia coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex at 2.5 Å resolution.Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These interactions might promote nucleotide binding through supporting the coordination of the magnesium ion by Thr-25. We therefore substituted Gln-283 in P. aeruginosa EF-Ts (which is the corresponding residue to E. coli Met-278) with Met (EF-Ts (Q283M); Fig. 4B). This substitution resulted in only slightly increased nucleotide dissociation rate constants for P. aeruginosa EF-Tu (Fig. 4B and TABLE 2, TABLE 3). Interestingly, the nucleotide association was 3-fold (k4) faster for mant-GDP and 32-fold faster (k7) for mant-GTP (Table 2). Therefore, the substitution of Gln-283 mainly affects the association step and is most pronounced for GTP. To determine whether helix 13 has a mechanistic role in the dissociation of EF-Ts from the EF-Tu·GTP/GDP·EF-Ts complex, a GTP/GDP titration against a fixed concentration of purified EF-Tu·EF-Ts complexes was performed similar to previous studies (13.Dahl L.D. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Knudsen C.R. The importance of P-loop and domain movements in EF-Tu for guanine nucleotide exchange.J. Biol.

The observed change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of EF-Tu reflects the dissociation of EF-Ts from the transiently formed EF-Tu·GTP/GDP·EF-Ts complex. The rates of EF-Ts dissociation were determined from time courses using a single-exponential fit and plotted as a function of increasing guanine nucleotide concentration (Fig. 6). At saturating concentrations of guanine nucleotide, where rebinding of EF-Ts is negligible and EF-Ts dissociation is not limited by guanine nucleotide binding, the rate constants for EF-Ts dissociating from the EF-Tu·GTP/GDP·EF-Ts ternary complex (k−6 and k−3) can be determined (Fig. 1 and Table 2). From the slope of the concentration dependence, the corresponding association rate constants (k6 and k3) can be calculated (9.Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Kinetic mechanism of elongation factor Ts-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in elongation factor Tu.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The location of the tryptophan residue within P. aeruginosa EF-Tu did not allow for a detectable change in the tryptophan signal upon GDP-induced dissociation of the Tu·Ts complex. Therefore, k−3, k3, and k4 could not be determined for the respective P. aeruginosa EF-Tu-containing complexes. Using E. coli EF-Tu, we were able to compare the rate constants for dissociation of P. aeruginosa and E. coli EF-Ts from ternary EF-Tu·nucleotide·EF-Ts complexes. For both EF-Tu·GTP·EF-Ts and EF-Tu·GDP·EF-Ts complexes, the rates of EF-Ts dissociation (k−6 and k−3) were 2-fold slower than E. coli EF-Ts. A similar 2–3-fold (k3 and k6) effect was observed for the association rate constants for the binding of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts to both E. coli EF-Tu·GDP and EF-Tu·GTP (Table 2). Interestingly, the removal of the C-terminal extension in P. aeruginosa EF-Ts, EF-Ts(Δ283), increases the rate constants for dissociation from the GTP and GDP-complexes 19- and 13-fold (k−6 and k−3), respectively. When compared with wild type E. coli EF-Ts, the rate constants are 10- and 6-fold faster. These effects on the dissociation rate constants are stronger than for the association rate constants, where a 4-fold increase (k6) in association rate constant for the P. aeruginosa EF-Ts binding to E. coli EF-Tu·GTP suggests a role for helix 13 in the interaction with the GTP conformation of EF-Tu. Surprisingly, grafting the C-terminal six amino acid residues from P. aeruginosa on EF-Ts from E. coli has no effect on either the association or dissociation rate constants to the GTP (k6 and k−6) or GDP (k3 and k−3) conformation of E. coli EF-Tu (Table 2). However, substitution of Gln-283 with Met reduces the rate constant of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts dissociation from the EF-Tu·GTP·EF-Ts complex 5-fold (k−6) and increases the rate constant for binding 2-fold (k6), which results in a 10-fold increased affinity (K6) of EF-Ts(Q283M) to the E. coli EF-Tu·GTP complex. A similar 5-fold (k−3) decrease in the dissociation rate constant is also observed for the GDP containing ternary complex, which is accompanied by a small 1.5-fold (k3) reduction in the association rate constant. Based on this, the affinity of EF-Ts(Q283M) for the GDP-bound E. coli EF-Tu is affected in the similar direction by this single amino acid substitution in helix 13 but is less pronounced than for the GTP-containing complex and only 3-fold (K3) higher than wild type P. aeruginosa EF-Ts. To investigate how the effects of altered C-terminal sequences in EF-Ts relate to the formation of the nucleotide-free binary EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex, we used the same approach as above monitoring the change of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of E. coli EF-Tu (Fig. 7). The obtained values for k2 and k−2 are summarized in Table 2. In agreement with previously published data (9.Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Kinetic mechanism of elongation factor Ts-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in elongation factor Tu.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), k2 for the EF-Tu and EF-Ts complex from E. coli is 19 ± 5 × 106 m−1 s−1. On the other hand, the association rate constant for E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa is slightly reduced (3.8-fold). The dissociation rate constant (k−2) for the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complexes can be calculated from the remaining rate constants in the kinetic mechanism (9.Gromadski K.B. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. Kinetic mechanism of elongation factor Ts-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in elongation factor Tu.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15.Wieden H.J. Mercier E.

J. 2010; 99: 3735-3743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, k−2 for the E. coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts and the complex containing E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa were 0.05 ± 0.04 s−1 and 0.0006 ± 0.0002 s−1, respectively (Table 2). This results in an affinity (K2) for the mixed E. coli/P. aeruginosa complex of 0.12 nm, which is 25-fold higher than for the E. coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex (K2 = 3 nm). Consistent with a role of the C-terminal extension in increasing the affinity of EF-Ts for EF-Tu, removing the last six amino acids from P. aeruginosa EF-Tu (K2 = 200 nm) reduces the affinity 1600-fold. This is mainly due to a 1000-fold increased dissociation rate constant (k−2) without a change in the corresponding association rate constant (Table 2). This trend is continued in the EF-Ts variant containing the last six amino acids of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts. Although the effect is less pronounced, the affinity of the EF-Ts(Chimera) to EF-Tu from E. coli is still 6-fold higher (K2) than wild type E. coli EF-Ts, mainly because of a 6-fold (k−2) decreased dissociation rate constant. Interestingly, the identity of the amino acid in position 283 of P. aeruginosa EF-Ts is not responsible for this effect, because this substitution variant has only a 2-fold lower (K2) affinity than wild type EF-Ts from P. aeruginosa. Based on our kinetic analysis above, it is evident that the C-terminal module of EF-Ts (helix 13) strongly modulates the interaction between EF-Tu and guanine nucleotides. To obtain a structural understanding of this effect, all-atoms models of E. coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts and EF-Tu·EF-Ts (Chimera) were constructed and simulated using molecular dynamics similar to our previous studies (15.Wieden H.J. Mercier E. Gray J. Steed B. Yawney D. A combined molecular dynamics and rapid kinetics approach to identify conserved three-dimensional communication networks in elongation factor Tu.Biophys.

Chem. 2015; 290: 18650-18661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After constructing a model of the EF-Tu·EF-Ts(Chimera) complex, the C terminus of EF-Ts(Chimera) was subjected to simulated annealing to investigate which regions of EF-Tu it may interact with. Based on 20 independent annealing simulations, the C-terminal module of EF-Ts(Chimera) likely contacts EF-Tu either at the switch I region or helix F (near the base-side interactions of the nucleotide-binding pocket; Fig. 4A). Evidence suggests, however, that the switch I region of EF-Tu is disordered when bound to EF-Ts (16.Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. The structure of the Escherichia coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex at 2.5 Å resolution.Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the structural dynamics between E. coli EF-Tu·EF-Ts and EF-Tu·EF-Ts(Chimera) complexes that can account for the observed differences in nucleotide interaction in vitro likely originate in the helix F region (Fig. 4A). The MD simulations of these models were stable after 5 ns based on backbone root mean square deviation and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations (Fig. 8, A and B), and the overall dynamics of the complexes are largely similar (Fig. 8B). Throughout both simulations the C-terminal helix of EF-Ts remains in contact with the G-domain of EF-Tu. Interestingly, the amino acids following the C-terminal helix of EF-Ts show different dynamics in the E."
https://openalex.org/W2519921940,"Purpose To measure cerebral metabolite levels in perinatally HIV-infected youths and healthy controls using the accelerated five dimensional (5D) echo planar J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (EP-JRESI) sequence, which is capable of obtaining two dimensional (2D) J-resolved spectra from three spatial dimensions (3D). Materials and Methods After acquisition and reconstruction of the 5D EP-JRESI data, T1-weighted MRIs were used to classify brain regions of interest for HIV patients and healthy controls: right frontal white (FW), medial frontal gray (FG), right basal ganglia (BG), right occipital white (OW), and medial occipital gray (OG). From these locations, respective J-resolved and TE-averaged spectra were extracted and fit using two different quantitation methods. The J-resolved spectra were fit using prior knowledge fitting (ProFit) while the TE-averaged spectra were fit using the advanced method for accurate robust and efficient spectral fitting (AMARES). Results Quantitation of the 5D EP-JRESI data using the ProFit algorithm yielded significant metabolic differences in two spatial locations of the perinatally HIV-infected youths compared to controls: elevated NAA/(Cr+Ch) in the FW and elevated Asp/(Cr+Ch) in the BG. Using the TE-averaged data quantified by AMARES, an increase of Glu/(Cr+Ch) was shown in the FW region. A strong negative correlation (r < -0.6) was shown between tCh/(Cr+Ch) quantified using ProFit in the FW and CD4 counts. Also, strong positive correlations (r > 0.6) were shown between Asp/(Cr+Ch) and CD4 counts in the FG and BG. Conclusion The complimentary results using ProFit fitting of J-resolved spectra and AMARES fitting of TE-averaged spectra, which are a subset of the 5D EP-JRESI acquisition, demonstrate an abnormal energy metabolism in the brains of perinatally HIV-infected youths. This may be a result of the HIV pathology and long-term combinational anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Further studies of larger perinatally HIV-infected cohorts are necessary to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2519956821,"Aim Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), a marker of glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus, is also related with the incidence of cardiometabolic risk in populations free of disease. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of HbA1c levels according to early-life and contemporary factors in adolescents and adults without diabetes mellitus. Methods HbA1c was measured in adults aged 30 years and adolescents aged 18 years who are participants in the 1982 and 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohorts, respectively. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to describe the HbA1c mean values according to early-life and contemporary characteristics collected prospectively since birth. Results The distribution of the HbA1c was approximately normal in both cohorts, with a mean (SD) 5.10% (0.43) in the 1982 cohort, and 4.89% (0.50) in the 1993 cohort. HbA1c mean levels were significantly higher in individuals self-reported as black/brown skin color compared to those self-reported as white in both cohorts. Parental history of diabetes was associated with higher HbA1c mean in adults, while stunting at one year old presented an inverse relation with the outcome in adolescents. No other early and contemporary factors were associated with HbA1c levels in adults or adolescents. Conclusions We found a consistent relationship between HbA1c and skin color in both cohorts. Further research is needed to understand the role of genomic ancestry on levels of HbA1c concentrations which may inform policies and preventive actions for diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2520458216,"Gradual alterations in cardiac energy balance, as assessed by the myocardial PCr/ATP-ratio, are frequently associated with the development of cardiac disease. Despite great interest for the follow-up of myocardial PCr and ATP content, cardiac MR-spectroscopy in rat models in vivo is challenged by sensitivity issues and cross-contamination from other organs.Here we combined MR-Imaging and MR-Spectroscopy (Bruker BioSpec 9.4T) to follow-up for the first time in vivo the cardiac energy balance in the SHR, a genetic rat model of cardiac hypertrophy known to develop early disturbances in cytosolic calcium dynamics.We obtained consistent 31P-spectra with high signal/noise ratio from the left ventricle in vivo by using a double-tuned (31P/1H) surface coil. Reasonable acquisition time (<3.2min) allowed assessing the PCr/ATP-ratio comparatively in SHR and age-matched control rats (WKY): i) weekly from 12 to 21 weeks of age; ii) in response to a bolus injection of the ß-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol at age 21 weeks.Along weeks, the cardiac PCr/ATP-ratio was highly reproducible, steady and similar (2.35±0.06) in SHR and WKY, in spite of detectable ventricular hypertrophy in SHR. At the age 21 weeks, PCr/ATP dropped more markedly (-17.1%±0.8% vs. -3,5%±1.4%, P<0.001) after isoproterenol injection in SHR and recovered slowly thereafter (time constant 21.2min vs. 6.6min, P<0.05) despite similar profiles of tachycardia among rats.The exacerbated PCr/ATP drop under ß-adrenergic stimulation indicates a defect in cardiac energy regulation possibly due to calcium-mediated abnormalities in the SHR heart. Of note, defects in energy regulation were present before detectable abnormalities in cardiac energy balance at rest."
https://openalex.org/W2520928837,"In the present study, we aimed to examine the impact of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on expression and function of NOD1 and NOD2 in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), in an attempt to clarify whether NOD1 and NOD2 signaling is involved in the modulation of host innate immunity against postoperative infection in pediatric CHD patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from pediatric CHD patients at five different time points: before CPB, immediately after CPB, and 1, 3, and 7 days after CPB. Real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA were performed to measure the expression of NOD1 and NOD2, their downstream signaling pathways, and inflammatory cytokines at various time points. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF-α levels in response to stimulation with either the NOD1 agonist Tri-DAP or the NOD2 agonist MDP were significantly reduced after CPB compared with those before CPB, which is consistent with a suppressed inflammatory response postoperatively. The expression of phosphorylated RIP2 and activation of the downstream signaling pathways NF-κB p65 and MAPK p38 upon Tri-DAP or MDP stimulation in PBMCs were substantially inhibited after CPB. The mRNA level of NOD1 and protein levels of NOD1 and NOD2 were also markedly decreased after CPB. Our results demonstrated that NOD-mediated signaling pathways were substantially inhibited after CPB, which correlates with the suppressed inflammatory response and may account, at least in part, for the increased risk of postoperative infection in pediatric CHD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2520621752,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease worldwide. The non-neutralizing antibody response that targets CA16 VP1 remains poorly elucidated. In the present study, antibody responses against CA16 VP1 in Shanghai blood donors and Shanxi individuals were analyzed by ELISA and inhibitory ELISA using five CA16 VP1 antigens: VP11-297, VP141-297, VP11-60, VP145-58 and VP161-297. The correlation coefficients for most of the reactions against each of the five antigens and the inhibition of the anti-CA16 VP1 antibody response produced by the various antigens were higher in Shanghai blood donors compared to those in Shanxi individuals. VP11-297 and VP141-297 strongly inhibited the anti-CA16 VP1 response in serum samples from both populations, while VP145-58 and VP161-297 intermediately and weakly inhibited the anti-CA16 VP1 response, respectively, in only Shanghai group. A specific type of inhibition (anti-CA16 VP1 was completely inhibited by both VP11-60 and VP141-297) characterized by high neutralizing antibody titers was identified and accounted for 71.4% of the strongly reactive samples from the Shanghai group. These results indicate that the Shanghai blood donors exhibited a consistent and specific antibody response, while the Shanxi individuals showed an inconsistent and non-specific antibody response. These findings may improve the understanding of host humoral immunity against CA16 and help to identify an effective approach for seroepidemiological surveillance and specific diagnosis of CA16 infection based on normal and competitive ELISA."
