https://openalex.org/W1994638693,"The lack of specific markers has raised problems in documenting the precise manner by which the lymphatic system develops. Here we report that the homeobox gene Prox1 is expressed in a subpopulation of endothelial cells that by budding and sprouting give rise to the lymphatic system. The initial localization of these cells in the veins and their subsequent budding are both polarized, suggesting that unidentified guidance signals regulate this process. In Prox1 null mice, budding and sprouting is arrested, although vasculogenesis and angiogenesis of the vascular system is unaffected. These findings suggest that Prox1 is a specific and required regulator of the development of the lymphatic system and that the vascular and lymphatic systems develop independently."
https://openalex.org/W2149858533,"Maturation of the visual cortex is influenced by visual experience during an early postnatal period. The factors that regulate such a critical period remain unclear. We examined the maturation and plasticity of the visual cortex in transgenic mice in which the postnatal rise of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was accelerated. In these mice, the maturation of GABAergic innervation and inhibition was accelerated. Furthermore, the age-dependent decline of cortical long-term potentiation induced by white matter stimulation, a form of synaptic plasticity sensitive to cortical inhibition, occurred earlier. Finally, transgenic mice showed a precocious development of visual acuity and an earlier termination of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. We propose that BDNF promotes the maturation of cortical inhibition during early postnatal life, thereby regulating the critical period for visual cortical plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2171852242,"We present evidence that phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of Rb by Cdk4/6 initiates successive intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal region and the central pocket. The initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the pocket, blocking active transcriptional repression by Rb. This facilitates a second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by Cdk2 and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk4/6 and Cdk2. Cdk4/6 is activated early in G1, blocking active repression by Rb. However, it is not until near the end of G1, when cyclin E is expressed and Cdk2 is activated, that Rb is prevented from binding and inactivating E2F."
https://openalex.org/W2107870109,"The X-ray crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase reveals a ""crab claw""-shaped molecule with a 27 A wide internal channel. Located on the back wall of the channel is a Mg2+ ion required for catalytic activity, which is chelated by an absolutely conserved motif from all bacterial and eukaryotic cellular RNA polymerases. The structure places key functional sites, defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, on the inner walls of the channel in close proximity to the active center Mg2+. Further out from the catalytic center, structural features are found that may be involved in maintaining the melted transcription bubble, clamping onto the RNA product and/or DNA template to assure processivity, and delivering nucleotide substrates to the active center."

https://openalex.org/W1989461823,"Transcription factors of the Myc proto-oncogene family promote cell division, but how they do this is poorly understood. Here we address the functions of Drosophila Myc (dMyc) during development. Using mosaic analysis in the fly wing, we show that loss of dMyc retards cellular growth (accumulation of cell mass) and reduces cell size, whereas dMyc overproduction increases growth rates and cell size. dMyc-induced growth promotes G1/S progression but fails to accelerate cell division because G2/M progression is independently controlled by Cdc25/String. We also show that the secreted signal Wingless patterns growth in the wing primordium by modulating dMyc expression. Our results indicate that dMyc links patterning signals to cell division by regulating primary targets involved in cellular growth and metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1983636619,"A multisubunit cohesin complex holds sister chromatids together after DNA replication. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we detected cohesin association with centromeres and with discrete sites along chromosome arms from S phase until metaphase in S. cerevisiae. Short DNA sequences (130-280 bp) are sufficient to confer cohesin association. Cohesin association with a centromere depends on Mif2p, the centromere binding factor CBF3, and a centromere-specific histone variant, Cse4p. Because only active centromeres confer cohesin association with centromeric DNA, we suggest that cohesin is recruited by the same chromatin structure that confers the attachment of microtubules. Propagation of this structure might be partly epigenetic. Finally, cohesion associated with ""minimal"" centromeres is insufficient to resist the splitting force exerted by microtubules and appears to be reinforced by cohesion provided by their flanking DNA sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1529117373,"Angiogenesis inhibitors produced by a primary tumor can create a systemic anti-angiogenic environment and maintain metastatic tumor cells in a state of dormancy. We show here that the gallbladder microenvironment modulates the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a multifunctional cytokine that functions as an endogenous anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor factor in a cranial window preparation. We found that a wide variety of human gallbladder tumors express TGF-beta1 irrespective of histologic type. We implanted a gel impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor or Mz-ChA-2 tumor in the cranial windows of mice without tumors or mice with subcutaneous or gallbladder tumors to study angiogenesis and tumor growth at a secondary site. Angiogenesis, leukocyte-endothelial interaction in vessels and tumor growth in the cranial window were substantially inhibited in mice with gallbladder tumors. The concentration of TGF-beta1 in the plasma of mice with gallbladder tumors was 300% higher than that in the plasma of mice without tumors or with subcutaneous tumors. In contrast, there was no difference in the plasma levels of other anti- and pro-angiogenic factors. Treatment with neutralizing antibody against TGF-beta1 reversed both angiogenesis suppression and inhibition of leukocyte rolling induced by gallbladder tumors. TGF-beta1 also inhibited Mz-ChA-2 tumor cell proliferation. Our results indicate that the production of anti-angiogenesis/proliferation factors is regulated by tumor-host interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2001545434,"The p16 gene expresses two alternative transcripts (p16alpha and p16beta) involved in tumor suppression via the retinoblastoma (Rb) or p53 pathways. Disruption of these pathways can occur through inactivation of p16 or p53, or activating mutations of cyclin dependant kinase 4 gene (Cdk4). We searched for p16, Cdk4 and p53 gene mutations in 20 squamous cell carcinomas (SSCs), 1 actinic keratosis (AK), and 28 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), using PCR-SSCP. A deletion and methylation analysis of p16 was also performed. Six different mutations (12%) were detected in exon 2 of p16 (common to p16alpha and p16beta), in five out of 21 squamous lesions (24%) (one AK and four SCCs) and one out of 28 BCCs (3.5%). These included four (66%) ultraviolet (UV)-type mutations (two tandems CC : GG to TT : AA transitions and two C : G to T : A transitions at dipyrimidic site) and two transversions. P53 mutations were present in 18 samples (37%), mostly of UV type. Of these, only two (one BCC and one AK) harboured simultaneously mutations of p16, but with no consequence on p16beta transcript. Our data demonstrate for the first time the presence of p16 UV induced mutations in non melanoma skin cancer, particularly in the most aggressive SCC type, and support that p16 and p53 are involved in two independent pathways in skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2124265514,"The structure of an actively transcribing complex, containing yeast RNA polymerase II with associated template DNA and product RNA, was determined by electron crystallography. Nucleic acid, in all likelihood the ""transcription bubble"" at the active center of the enzyme, occupies a previously noted 25 A channel in the protein structure. Details are indicative of a roughly 90 degrees bend of the DNA between upstream and downstream regions. The DNA apparently lies entirely on one face of the polymerase, rather than passing through a hole to the opposite side, as previously suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2313683437,"The signal-transducing Ras proteins are important driving forces of diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, neoplastic transformation, differentiation and growth inhibition. As a step toward understanding the complex mechanisms underlying cellular responses, gene expression patterns were examined in two phenotypically normal fibroblast lines which differ in their sensitivity toward oncogene-mediated transformation. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to establish a subtracted cDNA library specific for the REF52 cell line which, like normal diploid fibroblasts, is refractory toward neoplastic transformation induced by mutated HRAS oncogenes. In contrast, rat 208F control cells can be efficiently transformed by HRAS. The nucleotide sequence of 549 subtracted cDNA clones (‘REF52 minus 208F’) was determined. We identified 93 preferentially expressed gene fragments in resistant REF52 cells as compared to 208F cells. Seventeen of the 52 known genes (32.6%) are capable of inhibiting cell proliferation or of adversely affecting oncogenic signal transduction pathways. These results suggest that the anti-oncogenic properties of resistant REF52 cells are determined by multiple negative growth regulators. The preneoplastic state expressed in 208F cells is characterized by impairment of unexpectedly redundant control mechanisms. Our results also demonstrate that SSH is a powerful method for identifying specific transcriptional patterns in closely related cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2314789439,"Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor, involved in cell growth regulation, pathogen response and immune activation. To identify novel gene targets that may contribute to IRF-1 mediated activities, RNA fingerprinting was performed using NIH3T3 cells that inducibly express a hybrid form of IRF-1 under tetracycline regulated control. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) - a regulator of inflammation and an inhibitor of the LPS response - was identified as a gene repressed after doxycycline induced IRF-1 expression. Preliminary analysis of the human SLPI promoter identified an ISRE-like site located within the -221 to -200 region to which IRF-1 binds and a second, putative IRF-1 binding site upstream of the TATA box. Furthermore, co-transfection studies demonstrated that SLPI expression was inhibited by IRF-1 co-expression. The identification of SLPI as a target of IRF-1 regulation reveals a unique involvement of IRF-1 in repression of gene transcription and assigns a novel role for IRF-1 in inflammation."
