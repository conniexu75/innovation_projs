https://openalex.org/W2040834490,"The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene is the prototype for a class of recessive human cancer genes in which loss of activity of both normal alleles is thought to be associated with tumorigenesis. Sixteen of 40 retinoblastomas examined with a complementary DNA probe shown to be the Rb gene had identifiable structural changes of the Rb gene including in some cases homozygous internal deletions with corresponding truncated transcripts. An osteosarcoma also had a homozygous internal deletion with a truncated transcript. In addition, possible hot spots for deletion were identified within the Rb genomic locus. Among those tumors with no identifiable structural changes there was either absence of an Rb transcript or abnormal expression of the Rb transcript. Comparison of the structural changes in the tumor cells and fibroblasts of certain patients provided support for Knudson's two-hit hypothesis for the development of retinoblastoma at the molecular level. The ability to detect germline structural deletions in fibroblasts from some patients with bilateral retinoblastoma also indicates that the isolated gene is useful for diagnostic purposes."

https://openalex.org/W2097145517,"The Drosophila segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is expressed in a pattern of seven stripes at the blastoderm stage. Two cis-acting control elements are required for this expression: the zebra element, which confers the striped pattern by mediating the effects of a subset of segmentation genes; and the upstream element, an enhancer element requiring ftz+ activity for its action. Fusion of the upstream element to a basal promoter results in activation of the heterologous promoter in a ftz-dependent striped pattern, supporting the idea that ftz regulates itself by acting through its enhancer. The upstream element can also confer expression patterns similar to that of the homeotic gene Antennapedia, suggesting that a similar element may play a role in the activation of Antennapedia."

https://openalex.org/W2052956756,"The drug, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), depletes striatal dopamine levels in primates and certain rodents, including mice, and produces parkinsonian-like symptoms in humans and nonhuman primates. To investigate the consequences of grafting adrenal medullary tissue into the brain of a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, a piece of adult mouse adrenal medulla was grafted unilaterally into mouse striatum 1 week after MPTP treatment. This MPTP treatment resulted in the virtual disappearance of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers and severely depleted striatal dopamine levels. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after grafting, dense tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the grafted striatum, while only sparse fibers were seen in the contralateral striatum. In all cases, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers appeared to be from the host rather than from the grafts, which survived poorly. These observations suggest that, in mice, adrenal medullary grafts exert a neurotrophic action in the host brain to enhance recovery of dopaminergic neurons. This effect may be relevant to the symptomatic recovery in Parkinson's disease patients who have received adrenal medullary grafts."
https://openalex.org/W1664552158,"Experimental modulation of cellular glutathione levels has been used to explore the role of glutathione in cadmium toxicity. Mice treated with buthionine sulfoximine [an effective irreversible inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.2) that decreases cellular levels of glutathione markedly] were sensitized to the toxic effects of CdC12. Mice pretreated with a sublethal dose of Cd2+ to induce metallothionein synthesis were not sensitized to Cd2+ by buthionine sulfoximine. Mice sensitized to Cd2+ by buthionine sulfoximine were protected against a lethal dose of Cd2+ by glutathione mono isopropyl ester (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycylisopropyl ester), but not by glutathione. These results are in accord with studies that showed that glutathione mono esters (in contrast to glutathione) are efficiently transported into cells and converted intracellularly to glutathione. The findings indicate that intracellular glutathione functions in protection against Cd2+ toxicity, and that this tripeptide provides a first line of defense against Cd2+ before induction of metallothionein synthesis occurs. The experimental approach used here in which cellular levels of glutathione are decreased or increased seems applicable to investigation of other types of metal toxicity and of other glutathione-dependent biological phenomena.— Singhal, R. K.; Anderson, M. E.; Meister, A. Glutathione, a first line of defense against cadmium toxicity. FASEB J. 1: 220-223; 1987."

https://openalex.org/W2011353877,"A polygenic basis for susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice has been established by outcross to a related inbred strain, nonobese normal (NON). Analysis of first and second backcross progeny has shown that at least three recessive genes are required for development of overt diabetes. One, Idd-1s, is tightly linked to the H-2K locus on chromosome 17; another, Idd-2s, is localized proximal to the Thy-1/Alp-1 cluster on chromosome 9. Segregation of a third, Idd-3s, could be shown in a second backcross. Neither Idd-1s nor Idd-2s could individually be identified as the locus controlling insulitis; leukocytic infiltrates in pancreas were common in most asymptomatic BC1 mice. Both F1 and BC1 mice exhibited the unusually high percentage of splenic T lymphocytes characteristic of NOD, suggesting dominant inheritance of this trait. The polygenic control of diabetogenesis in NOD mice, in which a recessive gene linked to the major histocompatibility complex is but one of several controlling loci, suggests that similar polygenic interactions underlie this type of diabetes in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1483652639,"The photoaffinity reagent 8-azido-α-[32P]ATP was used to label a protein of 170 kDa in membrane vesicle preparations from a highly multidrug-resistant cell line, KB-V1, but not from the drug-sensitive parental cell line KB-3-1. The 170-kDa labeled protein was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (MRK-16) to P glycoprotein. Both ATP and GTP inhibited labeling by 8-azido-α-[52P]ATP. Labeling of P170 was not inhibited by 5 mM ADP, 5 mm ribose-5-phosphate, or 100 μm vinblastine. These data directly demonstrate that P glycoprotein has a nucleotide-binding site that could supply energy for drug transport.— Cornwell, M. M.; Tsuruo, T; Gottesman, M. M.; Pastan, I.

https://openalex.org/W1842213437,"Photoaffinity labeling with native NAD, a method employed earlier with diphtheria toxin (DT), was used to identify an active site residue of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA). An enzymically active fragment (Mr 27,000), derived by partial digestion of ETA with thermolysin, was irradiated with ultraviolet light (254 nm) in the presence of various radiolabeled preparations of NAD. Label from the nicotinamide moiety was efficiently transferred to the protein (maximally 0.79 mol/mol), and the label was exclusively located at position 553. This position, like that photolabeled in DT (position 148), corresponds to glutamic acid in the native protein. Chromatographically identical photo-products were generated at these positions in the two toxins. Glu-553 lies in a cleft in domain III that is believed to represent the active site of ETA, and other evidence supports the notion that Glu-553 of ETA and Glu-148 of DT are directly involved in catalysis. When Glu-553 of ETA was aligned with Glu-148 of DT, we found similarities of local primary structure not detected earlier. These results suggest that the catalytically active domains of ETA and DT may be evolutionarily related, and they provide information that should prove useful for preparing vaccines against ETA by recombinant DNA methods."
https://openalex.org/W1579015292,"The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptor of bovine adrenal cortex was solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified by sequential chromatography on ANF-(99-126)-agarose, GTP-agarose, and wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. Two subtypes of ANF receptors were isolated, both of which showed specific ANF binding, whereas one of the ANF receptor subtypes also possessed significant cyclase activity. Both of the receptors showed high capacities (Bmax = 5.7-6.8 nmol/mg of protein) and high affinities (Kd = 54-68 pM) for ANF-(99-126). The cyclase-free receptor had high affinity (Ki = 150-220 pM) to C-terminal truncated ANF analogs, whereas the cyclase-containing receptor had a much weaker affinity (Ki = 10(6)-10(7) pM). When treated with dithiothreitol, the purified cyclase-containing and cyclase-free ANF receptors migrated as a single band at Mr 135,000 and 62,000, respectively, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified cyclase-free receptor is not a product derived from the cyclase-containing receptor because (i) two proteins with Mr of 135,000 and 62,000 were specifically labeled with 4-azidobenzoyl 125I-ANF-(102-126) in nonsolubilized intact membranes; (ii) the truncated ANF analogs (10(4) pM) prevented the photolabeling of the 62,000-dalton protein but not that of the 135,000-dalton protein; and (iii) two-dimensional peptide mapping showed more than 90% difference between the profiles of the two purified ANF receptor subtypes. This study provides first direct evidence for the existence of two distinct ANF receptors which are different not only in their pharmacological properties but also in their primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1534442482,"The proton-ATPase of chromaffin granules was purified so as to maintain its proton-pumping activity when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The purification procedure involved solubilization with polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether, hydroxylapatite column, precipitation by ammonium sulfate, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. The protease inhibitor mixture used in previous studies inhibited the proton-pumping activity of the enzyme; therefore, the protein was stabilized by pepstatin A and leupeptin. The enzyme was purified at least 50-fold with respect to both ATPase and proton-pumping activity. The ATP-dependent proton uptake activity of the reconstituted enzyme was absolutely dependent on the presence of Cl- or Br- outside the vesicles, whereas sulfate, acetate, formate, nitrate, and thiocyanate were inhibitory. Sulfate inhibition seems to be due to competition with Cl- on the anion-binding site outside the vesicles, whereas nitrate and thiocyanate inhibited only from the internal side. As with the inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, the proton-pumping activity was much more sensitive to nitrate than the ATPase activity. About 20 mM nitrate were sufficient for 90% inhibition of the proton-pumping activity while 100 mM inhibited only 50% of the ATPase activity both in situ and in the reconstituted enzyme. The possible regulatory effect of anions on the ATP-dependent proton uptake in secretory granules is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2154654003,"The topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin induces the formation of covalent topoisomerase I-DNA intermediates in vitro. In vivo these intermediates are produced upon administration of camptothecin to FTO-2B cells, as demonstrated by the occurrence of single-stranded DNA breakages that have protein covalently associated with the free 3' end and by the covalent association of approximately 50% of nuclear topoisomerase I with DNA. We have analyzed the frequency and distribution of camptothecin-induced topoisomerase I strand cleavages in the transcriptionally active rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene. Cleavages are largely confined to the transcribed region and occur predominantly on the lower strand. Increasing the transcriptional activity of the gene with either glucocorticoids or cAMP increases the intensity but does not change the position of camptothecin-induced cleavages. Camptothecin treatment decreases tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA levels and inhibits transcription. These observations suggest that topoisomerase I participates in transcriptional elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2097526250,"Genomic DNA fragments encompassing the human Thy-1 or mouse Thy-1.1 gene have been microinjected into pronuclei of mouse embryos homozygous for the Thy-1.2 allele. In the resulting transgenic mice, the human gene is expressed in a pattern characteristic of normal human tissues, and is not influenced by the pattern of endogenous mouse Thy-1 expression. The mouse Thy-1.1 gene fragment is expressed in a pattern typical of mouse Thy-1, although it is more limited in its distribution. The results indicate the presence of multiple cis-acting regulators of Thy-1 gene expression that have changed in both their character and arrangement over the course of Thy-1 gene evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1668450698,"The regulation of pineal phospholipase A2 activity was studied indirectly by measuring the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled tissue in organ culture and the formation of radiolabeled lysophosphatidylcholine by glands labeled with 32Pi or [14C]choline. Glands were transferred sequentially through a series of 10-min incubations in label-free medium. Norepinephrine (10(-5) M) stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release by 2-fold; release peaked during the first 10 min and returned to basal levels during the third incubation period. Studies with selective alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenergic agents indicated that norepinephrine was acting through alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Ca2+ appears to play a critical role because the effects of norepinephrine were mimicked by treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and inhibited by inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers or EGTA; other [Ca2+]i elevating treatments also stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release. The possibility that protein kinase C may be involved was studied because it is activated by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine in the pineal gland (Sugden, D., Vanecek, J., Klein, D. C., Thomas, T. P., and Anderson, W. B. (1985) Nature 314, 359-361). Three protein kinase C activators stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release with the same relative potency as that established for activation of protein kinase C (4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate greater than 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate greater than 1-oleoyl 2-acetylglycerol). The effects of norepinephrine, A23187, and protein kinase C activators appear to be mediated by phospholipase A2 because the effects of these compounds on [3H]arachidonic acid release are blocked by an established inhibitor of this enzyme, mepacrine, and because these compounds stimulate the formation of 32P- and 14C-labeled lysophosphatidylcholine by glands incubated with 32Pi or [14C]choline. In addition, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase, another enzyme which generates arachidonic acid, did not inhibit the stimulation of [3H]arachidonic acid release by norepinephrine, A23187, or a phorbol ester. Cyclic nucleotides do not appear to play an important role in the regulation of phospholipase A2 activity because dibutyryl cyclic AMP does not alter [3H]arachidonic acid release and also because the amounts of cAMP and cGMP in the culture medium are not consistently associated with [3H]arachidonic acid release. These findings suggest that pineal phospholipase A2 activity is controlled by norepinephrine acting via an alpha 1-adrenergic mechanism which might involve Ca2+ and protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2142447030,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of late onset, characterized by progressive motor disturbance, psychological manifestations, and intellectual deterioration. The HD gene has been genetically mapped by linkage to the DNA marker D4S10, but the exact physical location of the HD defect has remained uncertain. To delineate critical recombination events revealing the physical position of the HD gene, we have identified restriction fragment length polymorphisms for two recently mapped chromosome 4 loci, RAF2 and D4S62, and determined the pattern of segregation of these markers in both reference and HD pedigrees. Multipoint linkage analysis of the new markers with D4S10 and HD establishes that the HD gene is located in a very small physical region at the tip of the chromosome, bordered by D4S10 and the telomere. A crossover within the D4S10 locus orients this segment on the chromosome, providing the necessary information for efficient application of directional cloning strategies for progressing toward, and eventually isolating, the HD gene."
https://openalex.org/W1970755262,"The alpha 2 protein, the product of the MAT alpha 2 gene, is a regulator of cell type in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It represses transcription of a group of cell type-specific genes by binding to an operator located upstream of each target gene. Fifteen in-frame deletions within the coding region of the MAT alpha 2 gene were constructed. The deletion alleles were examined for phenotypes conferred in vivo, and the encoded mutant proteins were assayed for ability to bind specifically to the operator in vitro. This analysis has revealed that the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of alpha 2 is located within a region of 68 amino acids. This region of alpha 2 has significant homology with the homeo domain, a conserved sequence found in the products of several Drosophila homeotic and segmentation genes. In addition, there is a class of mutant alpha 2 proteins that binds tightly and specifically to the operator in vitro, but fails to repress transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1571075203,"A procedure was developed to purify large quantities of PII protein from an Escherichia coli strain which contains a multicopy plasmid harboring the structural gene of PII (the glnB gene). Ultraviolet spectra of uridylylated and unuridylylated PII were obtained using the purified PII and empirical formulas to calculate the concentration of protein and the average number of uridylylated subunits per molecule were derived. A continuous fluorometric assay for the measurement of uridylylated PII (PIID) and adenylyltransferase (ATase) was also established. Rate measurements at various concentrations of PIID and at a fixed concentration of ATase showed that a tetrameric PIID molecule interacts with only one ATase molecule at a time. The complete nucleotide sequence of the glnB gene was determined and parts of the deduced amino acid sequence were confirmed by the results of amino acid sequence analysis of peptides. The PII subunit consists of 103 amino acids (Mr = 11,580). Two tyrosines reside at positions 46 and 51, where Tyr51 is the site of uridylylation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the upstream region showed no obvious sites for the binding of RNA polymerase, indicating that the glnB gene is a part of an as yet unidentified operon."
https://openalex.org/W1826343793,"The effect of high concentrations of oxygen on cellular proteins was examined in hepatocytes isolated from rats exposed to 100% oxygen for 0, 24, 48, or 54 h. Previous studies have demonstrated that protein oxidation mediated by mixed-function oxidase systems is accompanied by the formation of protein carbonyl derivatives that can be detected by the formation of protein hydrazone derivatives on treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). In these studies the levels of DNPH-reactive proteins increased steadily during 48 h of continuous oxygen treatment and then decreased to control levels by 54 h. Although the specific activity of two hepatic enzymes, glutamine synthetase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, decreased during oxygen treatment, antibody titration of each enzyme indicated that the levels of immunological cross-reactive protein either remained constant or increased slightly during 48 h of oxygen treatment. After 54 h of oxygen exposure the levels of immunologically cross-reactive material were significantly reduced. These results suggest that exposure of rats to high concentrations of oxygen leads to the oxidative inactivation of enzymes and the accumulation of oxidized proteins that are subsequently degraded."

https://openalex.org/W1519428830,"Catecholamine neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and related catecholamine derivatives reduce nitroheterocyclic drugs such as nitrofurantoin, nifurtimox, nifuroxime, nitrofurazone, misonidazole, and metronidazole in slightly alkaline solutions. Drugs which contain 5-nitrofurans are reduced at lower pH than drugs which contain 2- and 5-nitroimidazoles. 5-Nitroimidazole derivatives such as metronidazole and ronidazole are known to be more difficult to reduce than 2-nitroimidazole derivatives, due to their lower redox potential. Catecholamines, when reducing nitro drugs, undergo concomitant oxidation to form semiquinone radicals. Both semiquinone radicals and nitro anion radicals formed in a reaction of nitro drug and catecholamine derivative were detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Oxygen consumption studies in solutions containing nitro drug and catecholamine derivative showed that nitro anion radicals formed under aerobic conditions reduce oxygen to form the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. Quinones formed in the reaction of catecholamine and nitro drug were detected by optical spectroscopy. Biosynthetic precursors and some metabolic products of catecholamines were also used in these studies, and they all exhibited reactions similar to catecholamines. Bovine chromaffin granules which synthesize and store catecholamines produced the nitrofurantoin anion radical when intact granules were treated with nitrofurantoin. These radicals formed inside the granules were observed by ESR spectroscopy. The formation of nitrofurantoin radical, semiquinone radicals of catecholamines, and oxygen-derived radicals by chromaffin granules is proposed to cause damage to adrenal medulla, and this process may lead to neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1532932107,"A DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism has been found immediately 3' to the human apoB gene. Digestion of many different human DNAs at sites flanking the region and Southern blotting analysis reveal that this region can vary in length by approximately 300 base pairs with five alleles readily distinguishable. The length polymorphism is due to a unique AT-rich minisatellite that consists primarily of a 30-base pair tandem repeat with two structurally related subunit sequences, x (ATAATTAAATATTTT) and y (ATAATTAAAATATTT). In general, the sequences repeat in an x-y order. The AT-rich region also contains variant x and y sequences that result from C or G for A substitution. Sequence analysis of one large allele revealed the expected increased number of xy repeats. In addition, similar analysis of three different smaller alleles with the same apparent size on Southern blotting analysis showed that all were of slightly different size due to minor differences in the number of xy repeats. The heterogeneity of this AT-rich minisatellite provides the basis for a highly informative restriction fragment length polymorphism of the apoB gene and should be very useful in association and linkage analysis studies of the contribution of this locus to atherosclerosis susceptibility."

https://openalex.org/W1596954902,"The selective processing activity which generates both the NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of the octacosapeptide somatostatin-28 (S-28) was investigated. Separation into two distinct proteolytic activities was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography. An endoprotease cleaving either the substrate Pro-Arg-Glu-Arg-Lys-Ala-Gly-Ala-Lys-Asn-Tyr-NH2, i.e. [Ala17,Tyr20]S-28-(10-20)-NH2 (peptide I), or the octacosapeptide somatostatin-28, on the NH2 side of the Arg-Lys doublet was separated from an aminopeptidase B-like activity. Whereas the endoprotease cleaves a single peptide bond, between Glu12 and Arg13 of S-28, the aminopeptidase B-like enzyme removes both Arg13 and Lys14 stepwise from the NH2 terminus of the corresponding COOH-terminal fragment. This endoprotease activity peaks around pH 8.5, whereas the optimal aminopeptidase B-like activity is in the pH range 6.2-8.5. Combination of both enzymes resulted in the recovery of the overall S-28 convertase activity with an optimal pH at 7. In addition, this endoprotease appears to be very sensitive to divalent cations since it is strongly inhibited by chelating agents. The use of selectively modified undecapeptides derived from the reference substrate peptide I by a single modification of the amino acids Glu12, Arg13, and Lys14 at the cleavage locus showed that both basic residues are critically important, whereas Glu12 is not. It is proposed that S-28 processing involves a divalent cation-sensitive endoprotease that is sensitive to thiol reagents, which cleaves before the Arg-Lys doublet, which is not trypsin-like, and whose action is coupled to an aminopeptidase B-like enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2135877083,"Promastigotes of the protozoan parasite Leishmania major exhibit high affinity uptake of folate (Kt = 0.7 microM) and methotrexate (MTX) (Kt = 1.8 microM) which is saturable and sensitive to metabolic poisons. Influx of folate and MTX is competitively inhibited by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and p-aminobenzoic acid-glutamate, but not by 4-deoxy-4-amino-10-methylpteroate, biopterin, or pteroate. A single carrier is inferred for both folate and MTX transport, as the Ki of each inhibitor for both folate and MTX influx is the same, and the apparent affinities (Kt) of the substrates folate and MTX are identical to their respective Ki values for inhibition of MTX and folate uptake. Folate influx is specifically regulated according to cellular growth phase, as stationary phase cells exhibit 7% of the Vmax of log phase cells, while energy-dependent glucose uptake is only moderately reduced in stationary phase. Folate influx is also regulated by external folate levels, as cells grown in 5 microM folate exhibit 30% of the Vmax of cells grown in folate-depleted medium. Comparison of bacterial, mammalian, and Leishmania folate transport activities indicates considerable diversity in both biochemical and regulatory properties, and suggests the possibility that selective inhibition or manipulation of folate transport may be exploited in parasite chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1577530019,"Abstract Six mutant uncD alleles, affecting essential residues of the beta-subunit of Escherichia coli proton-ATPase, have been identified by intragenic complementation mapping, cloning, and DNA sequencing. Five of the mutations impair catalysis but do not cause structural perturbation of F1-ATPase. The amino acid substitutions found were as follows: uncD412, Gly-142----Ser; uncD430 and uncD431, both Arg-246----Cys; uncD478, Ser-174----Phe; and uncD484, Met-209----Ile. Kinetic characteristics of each corresponding mutant F1-ATPase are described or reviewed. In each case, the major determinant of impaired catalysis appears to be an attenuation of positive catalytic site cooperativity. Additionally, each mutation affects intrinsic properties of the catalytic site, including affinity for ATP, the ratio between unisite-bound substrate and products, and the rate of release of product inorganic phosphate under unisite ATP hydrolysis conditions. These effects are discussed in terms of a structural model of the catalytic nucleotide-binding domain of beta-subunit proposed recently (Duncan, T.M., Parsonage, D., and Senior, A.E. (1986) FEBS Lett. 208, 1-6). Each of the mutations lies within that domain. The uncD409 allele abolishes normal assembly of F1-ATPase. The amino acid substitution is Gly-214----Arg, which is suggested to affect a beta-turn connecting a beta-strand and an alpha-helix in the predicted nucleotide-binding domain of the beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1550821426,"Transglutaminases are a class of enzymes capable of covalently cross-linking both intracellular and extracellular proteins. The activity of tissue transglutaminase is known to decrease precipitously following neoplastic transformation, and it has been hypothesized that transglutaminase may be involved in growth regulation. We have found that the differentiation promoter sodium butyrate is able to cause a marked increase in transglutaminase activity in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This increased transglutaminase activity is associated with growth arrest, as well as with striking morphological changes including increased cell adhesion. The transglutaminase induced by sodium butyrate appears to be tissue transglutaminase, based on its cytosolic localization, thermal lability at basic pH, and elution profile on anion-exchange chromatography. Untreated PC12 cells contain only small amounts of transglutaminase which resembles epidermal transglutaminase, an enzyme previously described only in skin. In contrast to sodium butyrate, nerve growth factor did not stimulate tissue transglutaminase in PC12 cells, although it, too, caused growth arrest. It is hypothesized that transglutaminase may be involved in certain morphological changes accompanying cellular differentiation and neoplastic transformation, rather than in growth regulation per se."
https://openalex.org/W1637066823,"Abstract The characteristics of ATP hydrolysis at a single catalytic site of the bovine heart F1-ATPase (MF1) as originally described by Grubmeyer et al. (Grubmeyer, C., Cross, R.L., and Penefsky, H.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12092-12100) were compared with those of various chemically modified preparations of MF1 in which the steady state activity was severely attenuated. Although it was not necessary to age our preparations of native MF1 in the presence of 2 mM Pi to observe the same characteristics of single site catalysis, such aging did shift the equilibrium of bound substrate and bound products at the single catalytic site in favor of ATP. After loading a single catalytic site on the enzyme with substoichiometric [alpha,gamma-32P]ATP, the addition of 5-20 microM ATP or ADP was effective in promoting both the hydrolysis of bound [alpha,gamma-32P]ATP and release of radioactive products. Under these conditions, the 5-20 microM ATP added as promoter was hydrolyzed at a rate commensurate with the turnover rate of the enzyme, whereas the promoted hydrolysis of the [alpha,gamma-32P]ATP, preloaded at a single catalytic site, was considerably slower. Therefore, the high affinity, single catalytic site loaded first does not directly contribute to steady state ATP hydrolysis. That the single, high affinity catalytic site is not a normal catalytic site is supported by the properties of enzyme modified by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine which exhibits only slightly altered characteristics of single site catalysis and promoted single site catalysis, despite exhibiting severely attenuated steady state turnover. Other modified forms of the enzyme in which the steady state activity was severely attenuated by derivatization with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylinosine, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazan, or 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene also bound substoichiometric ATP at a single catalytic site. However, the characteristics of single site hydrolysis by these modified forms of the enzyme differed considerably from those of native MF1."
https://openalex.org/W1577723117,"Abstract Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) specifically bound to 100,000 X g pellet prepared from bovine adrenal medulla, and [3H]PGE2-bound proteins were solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. The dissociation of bound [3H]PGE2 from the proteins was enhanced by GTP. [3H]PGE2-specifically bound proteins were adsorbed onto a wheat germ agglutinin column and GTP treatment decreased the amount of [3H]PGE2 retained on the column. When [3H]PGE2-bound proteins were cross-linked in the membrane by dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and solubilized, bound [3H]PGE2 was no longer dissociated by GTP treatment, suggesting that cross-linking produced a stable and high-affinity complex of PGE receptor with a GTP-binding protein. Covalent cross-linking of the complex was attested by adsorption of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)-treated [3H]PGE2-bound proteins to GTP-Sepharose, and co-elution of [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding activity and immunoreactivities of alpha o and beta subunits of a GTP-binding protein. The cross-linked [3H]PGE2-bound complex was eluted as an apparently single radioactive peak at the position of Mr = 200,000 by gel filtration. These results have demonstrated that PGE receptor is a glycoprotein with an approximate Mr of 110,000, assuming that the Mr of the GTP-binding protein is 90,000. PGE2 neither activated nor inhibited adenylate cyclase activity, and pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein) did not affect PGE2 binding and its GTP sensitivity. These results suggest that the PGE receptor may be functionally associated with a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein and is not coupled to the adenylate cyclase system in bovine adrenal medulla."

https://openalex.org/W1511527888,"Culture fluid of Clostridium perfringens contained an endoglycosidase releasing a galactosyl disaccharide from glycans derived from glycoproteins of teratocarcinoma OTT6050. The endoglycosidase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography. The structure of the disaccharide product was determined to be Gal alpha 1----3Gal. The enzyme also released the disaccharide from bovine thyroglobulin glycopeptide and from a pentaglycosyl ceramide (Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc-Cer). Therefore, we concluded that the enzyme was an endo-beta-galactosidase cleaving Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc linkage. Keratan sulfate and the antigenic determinant of blood group type B were resistant to the enzyme: the specificity of the enzyme is different from other endo-beta-galactosidases so far described. The enzyme could act on intact thyroglobulin and defucosylated ovarian cyst mucin."
https://openalex.org/W1620091220,"Previously, we have shown that a protein designated p36 is synthesized at a high rate during interleukin 2-driven proliferation of a cloned T lymphocyte, L2. Biosynthesis of p36 increases 1000-fold during the initial mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle and remains high while the cells proliferate. In this report, we show that p36 has the same migration pattern by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)/cyclin and that antiserum to PCNA/cyclin selectively immunoprecipitates p36. In addition, by indirect immunofluorescence, PCNA/cyclin accumulates in the nucleus of interleukin 2-stimulated L2 cells during proliferation and is not detectable prior to the initial S phase or after proliferation ceases. These data indicate that PCNA/cyclin expression is induced by interleukin 2 and that PCNA/cyclin accumulation is closely associated with T lymphocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1480430356,"Monoclonal antibodies which inhibited the enzymatic activity of bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase were mapped to two topographically separate regions of the enzyme surface using competitive binding assays. Three antibodies which all inhibited glutamine- and NH3-dependent synthesis of asparagine bound to a common antigenic region. A fourth monoclonal antibody which interfered with glutamine binding or cleavage but not with NH3-dependent synthesis of asparagine was mapped to a separate region of the enzyme surface. These findings suggest a topographical separation between the aspartyl-AMP and glutamine-binding sites of bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase. Three noninhibitory antibodies exhibited conformation-dependent binding and were mapped to a third region of the enzyme. Binding assays were used to demonstrate extensive cross-reaction of these antibodies with asparagine synthetases isolated from bovine liver and sheep pancreas. Substantial cross-reactions were also seen with the enzyme isolated from rat liver or pancreas, a human tumor cell line, and a mouse tumor cell line. Of the four antibodies that inhibited glutamine- and NH3-dependent synthesis of asparagine from ruminant species, only one bound to and inhibited the enzyme from rat liver or mouse cells, which suggests significant structural differences between the ruminant and rodent enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1564288048,"Tetranitromethane (TNM) was employed as an electrophilic reagent to probe for the lysyl oxidase-catalyzed processing of n-butylamine to an intermediate carbanion during the oxidation of this amine to n-butyraldehyde according to a prior description of the use of TNM to trap enzyme-generated carbanion intermediates (Christen, P. and Riordan, J. F. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 1531-1538). The addition of n-butylamine to assay mixtures containing lysyl oxidase and TNM markedly increased the background rate of nitroform release. The Km for n-butylamine was essentially the same whether determined from the rate of lysyl oxidase-catalyzed nitroform release or from the rate of n-butyraldehyde production in the absence of TNM, the latter assessed by measurements of the rate of H2O2 formation. The initial rate of substrate- and enzyme-dependent nitroform production was linearly related to functional active site content. These data are consistent with the enzyme-dependent abstraction of an alpha-proton from the substrate to form an intermediate enzyme-bound carbanion. Kinetic analyses of the oxidation of n-butylamine and 1,1-dideutero-n-butylamine by lysyl oxidase revealed kinetic isotope effects on Vmax and Vmax/Km parameters, consistent with a rate-contributing alpha-proton abstraction step. These and other available data are incorporated into a proposal for the mechanism of action of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1484430331,"Previously identified mutations in subunits a and b of the F0 sector of the F1F0-ATPase from Escherichia coli are further characterized by isolating detergent-solubilized, partially purified F1F0 complexes from cells bearing these mutations. The composition of the various F1F0 complexes was judged by quantitating the amount of each subunit present in the detergent-solubilized preparations. The composition of the F0 sectors containing altered polypeptides was determined by quantitating the F0 subunits that were immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against the F1 portion. In this way, the relative amounts of F0 subunits (a, b, c) which survived the isolation procedure bound to F1 were determined for each mutation. This analysis indicates that both missense mutations in subunit a (aser206----leu and ahis245----tyr) resulted in the isolation of F1F0 complexes with normal subunit composition. The nonsense mutation in subunit a (atyr235----end) resulted in isolation of a complex containing the b and c subunits. The bgly131----asp mutation in the b subunit results in an F0 complex which does not assemble or survive the isolation. The isolated F1F0 complex containing the mutation bgly9----asp in the b subunit was defective in two regards: first, a reduction in F1 content relative to F0 and second, the absence of the a subunit. Immunoprecipitations of this preparation demonstrated that F1 interacts with both c and mutant b subunits. A strain carrying the mutation, bgly9----asp, and the compensating suppressor mutation apro240----leu (previously shown to be partially unc+) yielded an F1F0 ++ complex that remained partially defective in F1 binding to F0 but normal in the subunit composition of the F0 sector. The assembly, structure, and function of the F1F0-ATPase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537883537,"Abstract Carbamoylcholine (carbachol) has been shown to inhibit somatostatin release from gastric D-cells. We observed that this dose-dependent inhibitory effect was accompanied by decreases in cellular cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) production and increases in parameters of membrane inositol phospholipid turnover. However, after pretreatment of D-cells with pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml), carbachol paradoxically stimulated basal somatostatin release and potentiated the secretagogue action of forskolin. Pertussis toxin pretreatment blocked the ability of carbachol to decrease cAMP production but changes in inositol phospholipid turnover were unaffected. Atropine reversed all of the observed changes induced by carbachol. These data suggest that muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate both stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of D-cells. The inhibitory effect may involve pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding proteins while the stimulatory effect may result from the consequences of membrane phosphoinositide turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2087540603,"Electrical and chemical synapses usually reinforce one another, but the pyloric late-to-lateral pyloric (PL-to-LP) neuronal connections in lobster stomatogastric ganglia create an inverted U-shaped transfer function between the two neurons: regardless of whether the PL membrane voltage swings positive or negative, the postsynaptic LP voltage will go negative. When the presynaptic cell voltage goes negative, the effect on the LP voltage is due to electrical coupling. During positive presynaptic voltages, the strong contribution of graded chemical inhibition from the PL to the LP neuron overrides the positive electrical coupling to produce net negativity."
https://openalex.org/W1617728059,"Measurement of the stereospecific release of the pro-S proton from C-4' of enzyme-bound pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate provides an experimental means to probe parts of the active site of aspartate aminotransferase independently of substrate turnover (Tobler, H. P., Christen, P., and Gehring, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7105-7108). The release of pro-S 3H from enzyme-bound [3H]pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate is 30,000 times faster than from free coenzyme. Enzyme-bound [3H]pyridoxine 5'-phosphate is not detritiated suggesting an essential role of the 4'-amino group. Formation of the unproductive complex of the [3H]pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-enzyme with aspartate or glutamate results in a 400-fold acceleration of 3H release. In contrast, addition of borohydride or cyanoborohydride immediately stops 3H release. Experiments with a fluorescent reporter group and with differential chemical modifications indicate that the activating effect of aspartate on the release of 3H is accompanied by a shift of the so-called open/closed conformational equilibrium of the enzyme (Kirsch, J.F., Eichele, G., Ford, G. C., Vincent, M.G., Jansonius, J.N., Gehring, H., and Christen, P. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 174, 497-525) toward the closed conformation; the inhibiting effect of borohydride and cyanoborohydride appears to be accompanied by a shift toward the open conformation. Apparently, at least part of the catalytic apparatus of aspartate aminotransferase becomes fully operative only in the closed conformation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532718958,"The binding of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and their effect on amino acid and neurotransmitter transport was studied in cultured human Y79 retinoblastoma cells. Y79 cells possess specific receptors for both insulin and IGF-I. Insulin binding to Y79 cells is characterized by a curvilinear Scatchard plot suggesting a two-site or two-affinity binding system. In contrast, IGF-I binding has a linear plot indicative of a one-site, one-affinity binding system. The uptake of glycine, a putative neurotransmitter in the retina occurs by a specific transport system in Y79 cells, independent of the uptake of other neutral amino acids. The uptake of glycine was increased 25-50% by either insulin or IGF-I. The response to insulin or IGF-I on glycine uptake is gradual and concentration dependent. The accumulation of other amino acids and putative retinal neurotransmitters by Y79 cells was not significantly affected by insulin of IGF-I. In addition, the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase was not influenced. The analysis of high affinity glycine uptake indicates that insulin and IGF-I are stimulating glycine transport by increasing the V'max without significantly affecting the K'm. Further analysis suggests that insulin and IGF-I are causing a recruitment of additional glycine transporters at the cell surface or activating otherwise nonfunctional transporters by an unexplained mechanism. Because of the implication that glycine responds as a neuroactive amino acid in Y79 cells these studies suggest that insulin and IGF-I may influence neuroactivity in the human retina by regulating the transport of glycine."
https://openalex.org/W1557445639,"We have recently described a mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells, termed G.7.1, that contains a temperature-sensitive, conditionally lethal mutation resulting in defective vacuolar acidification (Marnell, M. H., Mathis, L. S., Stookey, M., Shia, S.-P., Stone, D.K., and Draper, R. K. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 1907-1916). To further characterize the lesion, clathrin-coated vesicles were partially purified from wild type and G.7.1 cells, and the thermolabilities of vanadate and oligomycin-insensitive, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, H+-ATPase activity, 32Pi-ATPase exchange activity, and proton pumping were compared. All three parameters of H+ pump activity were markedly diminished by preincubation at 44 degrees C for vesicles harvested from the G.7.1 cells, but not for those from wild type cells. Phosphatidylserine did not protect against heat inactivation in vesicle fractions prepared from G.7.1 cells. The results suggest that the mutation responsible for defective acidification in G.7.1 cells is expressed at the level of the proton pump of organelles present in our clathrin-coated vesicle-enriched preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1589961064,"Illumination of chloroplast thylakoids activates ATP synthase-ATPase complex CF0 . CF1. The time course of ATP synthesis is linear if ADP and Pi are added before or simultaneously with illumination. ATP synthesis initiated by adding the substrates in the light exhibits a curvilinear time course with a low initial rate (Vi). Vi, but not the rate at a steady state, decreases with increasing preillumination time with a half-time of 2 s. Coincident with this decrease in Vi, activation of ATP hydrolysis takes place. In the postillumination dark, restoration of Vi is observed: Vi increases with increasing time intervals between the end of illumination and the addition of the substrates with simultaneous reillumination (half-time of 3 s). Coincident with this restoration of Vi, inactivation of ATP hydrolysis takes place. Such an increase in Vi in the postillumination dark is not observed in thylakoids pretreated with N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest the following: in the light, the ATP synthetically active, but ATP hydrolytically inactive state (Es) converts to the ATP hydrolytically active, but ATP synthetically inactive (or less active) state (Eh) in the absence of ADP and Pi. The N-ethylmaleimide pretreatment inhibits this process. In the postillumination dark, the reverse conversion takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1895986401,"The aim of this symposium on molecular biology in physiology was to introduce molecular biology to physiologists who had relatively little exposure to the new developments in this field, so that they can become conversant on this topic and contribute to the advancement of physiology by incorporating molecular biological approaches as a part of their research arsenal. After the discussion of the basic concepts, terminology, and methodology used in molecular biology, it was shown how these basic principles have been applied to the study of the genes encoding two membrane proteins that have important transport functions (band 3 and ATPase). The second half of the symposium consisted of papers on the state-of-the-art developments in the application of molecular biology to the studies of the atrial natriuretic factor and renin genes, adenylate cyclase-coupled adrenergic receptors, acetylcholine receptors and sodium channel, and long-term and short-term memories. The ultimate goal is that these examples will provide an impetus for the opening of new frontiers of research in physiology by taking advantage of the tools developed from recent advances in molecular biology."
