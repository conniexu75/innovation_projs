https://openalex.org/W1973107494,"Defensive genes in plants can be activated by several different types of nonpeptide signaling molecules. An endogenous polypeptide, consisting of 18 amino acids, was isolated from tomato leaves and was able at very low concentrations to induce the synthesis of two wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor proteins when supplied to young tomato plants. The sequence of the polypeptide was determined, and an identical polypeptide was synthesized that possessed full inducing activity. These data establish that a polypeptide factor can initiate signal transduction to regulate the synthesis of defensive proteins in plant tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1964157041,"Reports of declining amphibian populations in many parts of the world are numerous, but supporting long-term census data are generally unavailable. Census data from 1979 to 1990 for three salamander species and one frog species at a breeding pond in South Carolina showed fluctuations of substantial magnitude in both the size of breeding populations and in recruitment of juveniles. Breeding population sizes exhibited no overall trend in three species and increased in the fourth. Recent droughts account satisfactorily for an increase in recruitment failures. These data illustrate that to distinguish between natural population fluctuations and declines with anthropogenic causes may require long-term studies."
https://openalex.org/W1976693634,"The results of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on alkali fullerides KxC60 are reported. The NMR spectra demonstrate that material with 0 < x < 3 is in fact a two-phase system at equilibrium, with x = 0 and x = 3. NMR lineshapes indicate that C3–60 ions rotate rapidly in the K3C60 phase at 300 K, while C6–60 ions in the insulating K6C60 phase are static on the time scale of the lineshape measurement. The temperature dependence of the 13C spin-lattice relaxation rate in the normal state of K3C60 is found to be characteristic of a metal, indicating the important role of the C3–60 ions in the conductivity. From the relaxation measurements, an estimate of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level is derived."
https://openalex.org/W2036859582,"Snow feedback is expected to amplify global warming caused by increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. The conventional explanation is that a warmer Earth will have less snow cover, resulting in a darker planet that absorbs more solar radiation. An intercomparison of 17 general circulation models, for which perturbations of sea surface temperature were used as a surrogate climate change, suggests that this explanation is overly simplistic. The results instead indicate that additional amplification or moderation may be caused both by cloud interactions and longwave radiation. One measure of this net effect of snow feedback was found to differ markedly among the 17 climate models, ranging from weak negative feedback in some models to strong positive feedback in others."

https://openalex.org/W2052381633,"Impact of nanocrystalline alkali-halide clusters against solid surfaces causes them to fission exclusively into low surface-energy fragments. In time-of-flight scattering experiments, this process appears at an impact energy so low that it must result from a single-step cleavage of the nanocrystal along low surface-energy cleavage planes. At higher energies (more than 1 electron volt per atom), a crossover occurs to an entirely different behavior-evaporative cascades that proceed irrespective of the structureenergetic properties of the fragments. These cascades, and the approximately linear scaling of the crossover energy with cluster size, are characteristic of impact-induced transformation of the cluster to a molten state. Collision with the high-rigidity surface of silicon gives a substantially greater cleavage probability than the soft basal-plane surface of graphite."
https://openalex.org/W2068056863,"By means of an approach that employs alkali-metal alloys, bulk single-phase (RbxK1–x)3C60 superconductors have been prepared for all x between 0 and 1. For x = 1 it is shown that the maximum superconducting fraction, which approaches 100% in sintered pellets, occurs at a Rb to C60 ratio of 3:1. More importantly, single-phase superconductors are formed at all intermediate values of x, and it is shown that the transition temperature (Tc) increases linearly with x in this series of materials. The formation of a continuous range of solid solutions demonstrates that the rubidium- and potassium-doped C60 superconducting phases must be isostructural, and furthermore, suggests that the linear increase in Tc with x results from a chemical pressure effect."

https://openalex.org/W2004293134,A new type of cell has been found in the ganglion cell layer of the retinas of dogs and humans. Its axon and its terminal branches are intraretinal. From its structure it appears that this cell might play an associational role at the level of the ganglion cells.

https://openalex.org/W2029957763,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from rats and from humans was partially purified and was inactivated (dissociated) by removing triphosphopyridine nucleotide by repeated washing and dialysis, and then it was reactivated by addition of triphosphopyridine nucleotide and incubation at 25°C. When enzyme from each species was mixed with enzyme from the other during or after inactivation, a new electrophoretic band located between the fast-moving rat dehydrogenase and the slow-moving type B human enzyme appeared. This band is interpreted as representing a hybrid composed of polypeptide chains from each enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1988750323,"Molecular fragmentation of organic liquids was produced by cavitation due to ultrasound waves, even in the absence of water. The sonolysis of acetonitrile under argon yielded N(2), CH(4), and H(2); but under oxygen the products were N(2), CO, CO(2), and H(2)O. Pure nonaqueous carbon tetrachloride also underwent sonolytic decomposition under either argon or oxygen, with the production of elemental chlorine."

https://openalex.org/W1992985282,"Addition of tetanus toxoid to sensitized lymphocytes from normal subjects and patients with ""secondary"" acquired agammaglobulinemia resulted in an increased incorporation of tritiated uridine into RNA and this increase was sustained for 48 to 72 hours in vitro. In contrast, the quantity of H(3)-uridine incorporated into the RNA of lymphocytes from patients with ""primary"" acquired agammaglobulinemia decreased after 48 hours of exposure to specific antigen. Lymphocytes from patients with primary agammaglobulinemia were also distinguished by their subnormal and poorly sustained response to phytohemagglutinin and to rabbit antiserum to Iymphocytes. These data suggest that the defect in primary agammaglobulinemia involves, either as a primary phenomenon or as a secondary event, an abnormality of quantitative RNA synthesis or of RNA stability in the circulating lymphocyte."

https://openalex.org/W2091316794,"Hybridization measurements among the DNA's of six weakly tumorigenic strains of human adenovirus type 7 reveal that all six strains are very closely related (83- to 110-percent nucleotide sequence homology). The DNA homology between these six type 7 strains and nontumorigenic types 2 and 4 is 32 percent and 52 percent, respectively. The 10- to 20-percent homology between the type 7 DNA's and those of ""potent"" tumorigenic types 12 and 18 indicates a very low degree of genetic relatedness. These data indicate that, if the carcinogenic potential of adenovirus types 7, 12, and 18 lies in the possession of nucleotide sequences common to these three viruses, these regions represent a small portion of the total genome, approximately one to three viral cistrons."

The belt contains a rich fauna entirely new to Pakistan. Its presence indicates that this area was inundated in Silurian and Devonian times by seas bordered by reefs or containing reef platforms."
