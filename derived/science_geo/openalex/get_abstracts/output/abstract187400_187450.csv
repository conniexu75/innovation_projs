The sequence of events leading to apoptosis following proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is unclear. Bortezomib effects on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. With human H460 lung cancer cells, bortezomib exposure at 0.1 μm showed induction of apoptotic cell death starting at 24 h, with increasing effects after 48–72 h of treatment. After 3–6 h, an elevation in ROS generation, an increase in Δψm, and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, were observed in a time-dependent manner. Co-incubation with rotenone and antimycin A, inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III, or with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulted in inhibition of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, increase in Δψm, and cytochrome c release. Tiron, an antioxidant agent, blocked the bortezomib-induced ROS production, Δψm increase, and cytochrome c release. Tiron treatment also protected against the bortezomib-induced PARP protein cleavage and cell death. Benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of pan-caspase, did not alter the bortezomib-induced ROS generation and increase in Δψm, although it prevented bortezomib-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and apoptotic death. In PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells (with overexpression of Bcl-2), a reduction of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, Δψm increase was correlated with cellular resistance to bortezomib and the attenuation of drug-induced apoptosis. The transient transfection of wild type p53 in p53 null H358 cells caused stimulation of the bortezomib-induced apoptosis but failed to enhance ROS generation and Δψm increase. Thus ROS generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib-induced apoptotic cascade by mediation of the disruption of Δψm and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, shows substantial anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor cell lines, is in phase I, II, and III clinical trials and has recently been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. The sequence of events leading to apoptosis following proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is unclear. Bortezomib effects on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

The transient transfection of wild type p53 in p53 null H358 cells caused stimulation of the bortezomib-induced apoptosis but failed to enhance ROS generation and Δψm increase. Thus ROS generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib-induced apoptotic cascade by mediation of the disruption of Δψm and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Recent investigations have demonstrated that apoptosis is regulated by two major pathways (1Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H.

The first pathway is via the death receptors on the cell surface, such as TNFR1 and Fas/CD95/APO-1, that can directly activate capase-8 by a signaling complex that includes the cytoplasmic tail of the receptors and caspase-8 (4Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). The second pathway regulates the apoptotic cascades by the convergence of the signaling at the mitochondrion, such as those mediated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. This pathway is involved in the alteration of mitochondria membrane potentials, the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-9 (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinvasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). It also appears that the mitochondrial control mechanisms underlying apoptosis are involved in the disruption of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, and the alteration in mitochondrial membrane transition pores, leading to the release of protein effectors (6Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 7Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; DiOC6(3), 3,3′-dihexyloacarbocyanine; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; tiron, 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzendisulfonic acid disodium salt; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. which are the byproducts of normal cellular oxidative processes, have been suggested as regulating the process involved in the initiation of apoptotic signaling. Tan and coworkers (8Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Mather P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) showed that an increase in generation of ROS induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The mimicking of the ROS elevation in nerve growth factor-deprived sympathetic neurons with exposure to H2O2 resulted in the release of cytochrome c (9Kirkland R.A. Windelborn J.A. Kasprzak J.M. Franklin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6480-6490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the initial investigations of the Bcl-2 family of proteins have shown that these proteins play an important role in regulation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (10Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). For example, the overexpression of Bcl-2 can prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol in apoptotic cells (11Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiika W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In contrast, the overexpression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family, bax results in the facilitation of cytochrome c release and the enhancement of ROS generation (12Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 3668-3672Google Scholar). Recently, Li et al. (13Li P. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) reported that p53-induced apoptosis occurs via an increase in the generation of ROS and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential without affecting the release of cytochrome c. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is well known to be responsible for the degradation of the majority of intracellular proteins and relies on the concerted action of two ATP-dependent protein complexes, the ubiquitin system, and the proteasome (14Brooks P. Fuertes G. Murray R.Z. Bose S. Knecht E. Rechsteiner M.C. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. Dyson J. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). The target proteins that serve as the substrates for this system are generally ubiquitinated by a stepwise process, which involves the sequential reactions catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s). Then the polyubiquitinated proteins are further recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasomal multicatalytic protein complex. A number of proteins that have been identified as substrates for the ubiquitin-proteasome system include some short lived functional proteins (16Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition, other evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (17Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Based on these unique properties of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the targeting of its pathway has recently emerged as a promising approach for the development of anti-cancer agents. Bortezomib (Fig. 1) is part of a new generation of reversible proteasome inhibitors developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (18Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Maas J. Pien C.S. Prakash S. Elliott P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar). This compound displayed highly potent activity against the growth of several cancer cell lines in studies in vitro and in vivo and currently is undergoing evaluations in phase I, II, and III clinical trials (19Adams J.

Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 2FDA, available at www.fda.gov/cder/approval/index.htm., 3FDA, available at www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/whatsnew.htm. In previous work from our laboratories, we had found that bortezomib has significant potency against cellular proliferation in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and that this compound could block cell cycle progression at G2/M phase and caused the induction of apoptosis (28Ling Y.H. Liebes L. Jiang J.-D. Holland J.F. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Muggia F.M. Perez-Soler R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1145-1154PubMed Google Scholar). In this investigation, we have also used the human H460 non-small cell lung cancer cell line as a model to examine the molecular mechanisms of the effect of bortezomib on the induction of apoptosis. We describe a sequence of events related to the effects on the mitochondria by bortezomib exposure of H460 cells that starts within 3–6 h of exposure and increases with longer times. These include increases in mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. The studies reported below employed the co-incubation of bortezomib with rotenone and antimycin A, two inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and II (29Chauvin C. De Oliveira F. Ronot X. Mousseau M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41394-41398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Armstrong J.S. Jones D.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1263-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We also made use of a series of co-incubation studies with cyclosporine A (CsA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (31Chang L. Johnson M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The opening of the permeability transition pore has been implicated as an important mitochondrial event that occurs during apoptosis, and the degree of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization can be a rate-limiting step of drug-induced apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the BCL-2 family of proteins (31Chang L. Johnson M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Vieira H. Haouzi D. Harrel E.I. Jacotot E. Belzacq A.-S. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Cell Death Dffer. 2000; 7: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Studies with the use of these selective mitochondrial inhibitors should help in the elucidation of key mitochondria events related to the activity of bortezomib. Furthermore, we made use of the antioxidant agent tiron, which serves as an ROS scavenger (33Mohanraj P. Merola J. Wright V.P. Clanton T.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1960-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Yamada J. Yoshimura S. Yamakawa H. Saeada M. Nakagawa M. Shigeru H. Kaku Y. Iwama T. Naganawa T. Banno Y. Nakashima S Sakai N. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 45: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to follow whether bortezomib-induced ROS generation could be effected by the co-incubation of these two agents. The new data resulting from these studies indicate that ROS generation and an increase in Δψm are the early and necessary events for the initiation of bortezomib-induced apoptotic signaling. These findings should aid in the understanding of the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and provide a basis for the therapeutic use of this compound alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Chemicals—Bortezomib (VELCADE™), formerly known as PS-341, was supplied by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and was dissolved in Me2SO (10 mm) as a stock solution and diluted to the required concentration with PBS. Monoclonal anti-PARP, Bcl-2, and p53 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem (Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO). Cell Culture—Human H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. PC-3/vector and PC-3/Bcl-2 prostate carcinoma cells were a generous gift from Dr. McConkey (Department of Cancer Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (35Bondar V.M. McConkey D.J. Prostate. 2002; 5: 42-49Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). p53 Transfection—The liposomal vector and the liposomal vectorharbored human wild type p53 cDNA under the control of the human CMV promoter were prepared as described previously (36Zou Y. Zong G. Ling Y.H. Hao M.M. Lozano G. Hong W.K. Perez-Soler R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The human H358 non-small cell lung cancer cell line with the p53 null gene was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For p53 transfection, H358 cells (0.7 × 106cells/well) were plated in a 6-well plate and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The liposomal wild type p53 cDNA or vector was added into the cell culture. After 3 h of incubation, cells were washed with PBS solution, and reincubated in fresh medium in the presence of 0.05 μm bortezomib or with the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were taken from culture and prepared for the analysis of ROS production, alteration of Δψm, p53 expression, and apoptosis. Apoptosis Assay—Cells were treated with 0.1 μm bortezomib for the indicated times. After treatment, cells were harvested and the apoptotic cells were detected by phase-contrast microscopy, or the cells were stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide and the apoptotic cells (sub-G0/G1 DNA content) were assessed by FACS analysis (FACScan, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cell Viability and Cytotoxicity—Exponential growing cells were exposed to bortezomib for the indicated time. After exposure, the cell viability was assessed by typan blue exclusion. The drug-induced cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT assay. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were scraped from the culture, washed twice with PBS, and then suspended in 30 μl of immunoblotting lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% SDS at 0–4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C, the supernatants were collected, and the protein amount in each sample was measured by a Bio-Rad DC kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The equal amount of sample (50 μg of protein) was subject to electrophoresis on either 12% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, protein blots were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST solution, and incubated overnight with the corresponding primary antibodies in the blocking solution at 4 °C. After washing three times with TBST solution, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted with TBST solution (1:1000). The detected protein signals were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction system according to manufacturer's recommendation (Amersham Biosciences, Indianapolis, IN). Measurement of Δψ m and ROS Generation—The measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were performed as described by Marchetti et al. (37Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Macho A. Haeffner A. Hirsch F. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105/ml) were exposed to 0.1 μm bortezomib for the indicated times. After exposure, cells were incubated in 40 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarboxyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)), and 5 μm dihydroethidine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 15 min, and harvested by trypsinization and washed with cold PBS solution for three times. ROS and Δψm were determined by FACS analysis. Determination of Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria—H460 cells were treated with 0.1 μm bortezomib for the indicated times and harvested from culture. After washing with cold PBS, cells were incubated in the buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Following incubation for 10 min on an ice bath, the cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer for 20 strokes, and a buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added to the homogenates. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected and used as the cytosol fraction. The cytochrome c level in the cytosol fraction was detected by immunoblotting analysis. The quantitative analysis of cytochrome c protein in each sample was performed on a scanning densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-670 Imaging Densitometer). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of the number of experiments indicated. The comparisons were made with a t test and the difference was considered to be statistically significant if the p value was <0.05. Bortezomib Induces Apoptosis—In our recent studies, we had demonstrated that bortezomib exhibits highly significant activity against the proliferation of human H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells (28Ling Y.H. Liebes L. Jiang J.-D. Holland J.F. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Muggia F.M. Perez-Soler R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1145-1154PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we used this cell line as a model to determine whether the inhibition of cell growth evoked by this compound is due to an apoptotic death process. Initially, we exposed H460 cells to bortezomib at 0.1 μm, which is a concentration that correlates with the IC50 for a 72-h exposure of this cell line as assessed by a MTT assay in our previous report (28Ling Y.H. Liebes L. Jiang J.-D. Holland J.F. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Muggia F.M. Perez-Soler R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1145-1154PubMed Google Scholar). The apoptotic nature of cell death was verified morphologically by phase-contrast microscopy showing that 0.1 μm bortezomib exposed cells for 48 h exhibited a shrinkage in size, membrane blebbing, and the loss of their attachment to the substratum compared with that in untreated control cells (Fig. 2A). For quantitative assessment of drug-induced apoptosis, H460 cells were exposed to 0.1 μm bortezomib for the indicated times, and the extent of apoptotic death was assessed by the determination of sub-G0/G1 cell population following cells stained with propidium iodide as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2B shows that bortezomib exposure resulted in apoptotic cell death in a time-dependent manner, with apoptosis starting to occur at 24 h of exposure, and after 36–48 h of bortezomib exposure, a significant numbers of cells (38–48%) had progressed to sub-G0/G1 DNA content. By 60–72 h after bortezomib exposure, the sub-G0/G1 cell population reached a peak value (about 60%). To further confirm that the cell death by bortezomib was due to apoptosis, we assessed for the bortezomib-induced cleavage of PARP protein that is mediated by caspases, an event that is commonly used as an apoptotic hallmark. Fig. 2C shows that the PARP protein cleavage was also detected after 24 h of bortezomib exposure, and the extent of the PARP cleavage increased proportional with the duration of the exposure time. Effect of Bortezomib on Mitochondrial ROS Generation, Δψ m Increase, and Cytochrome c Release—Recent investigations have demonstrated that many apoptotic cascades utilize mitochondria as the nodal point where diverse apoptotic stimuli translate from initiation into execution (38Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar). Mitochondria undergo critical changes, including the collapse of the inner transmembrane potential (Δψm), the generation of ROS, and the release of cytochrome c. We proceeded to examine for the possibility that the bortezomib-induced apoptosis could be related to contributions from the mitochondrial pathway. H460 cells exposed to 0.1 μm bortezomib for the indicated time periods were examined for changes in ROS generation and Δψm, using the specific fluorescence probes, hydroethidine and DiOC6(3). Fig. 3 (A and B, top panels) contains typical fluorescence histograms showing that the exposure to 0.1 μm bortezomib induces a right shift of the hydroethidine and DiOC6(3) fluorescence curves. This is indicative that the bortezomib exposure induces an increase in the ROS generation and Δψm. Fig. 3 (A and B, bottom panels) shows that the relative levels of ROS and Δψm were elevated as early as 3–6 h after bortezomib exposure and gradually increased with exposure time. The levels of ROS and Δψm in untreated control cells were unchanged over all of the incubation time periods. We next explored the effect of bortezomib on the cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol. Starting at 3–6 h after 0.1 μm bortezomib exposure (Fig. 3C), a small amount of cytochrome c in the cytosol fraction was observed. The cytochrome c levels were gradually elevated with increasing exposure time, reaching a peak value at 24 h, and then decreased after 36–48 h. It is important to note that the level of cytochrome c in the cytosol fraction was barely detected at time 0. Effects of the Inhibitors of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain on Bortezomib-induced ROS Generation and Δψ m Increase—It has been suggested that the ROS generation is regulated by a mitochondrial electron transport chain (39Nowak G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43377-43388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the mitochondrial electron transport chain system in regulating bortezomib-induced ROS generation, we evaluated the effects of rotenone, antimycin A, and cyclosporine A (CsA) on ROS generation and the increase in Δψm after co-treatment for 24 h with 0.1 μm bortezomib. Fig. 4 (A and B) shows that the co-treatment with these inhibitors caused a blocking of the bortezomib-induced ROS generation and Δψm increase, as compared with that observed with bortezomib treatment alone. The treatment with these inhibitors alone did not significantly change the levels of ROS and Δψm as compared with that in the untreated control. To further explore whether the blockage of ROS generation and Δψm by rotenone, antimycin A, and CsA could protect against bortezomib-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol, a series of combination inhibitor plus bortezomib were completed. Fig. 4C shows that co-treatment with 1 μm rotenone, 10 μm antimycin A, or 1 μm CsA caused prevention of the bortezomib-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol. Effect of the Antioxidant Agent Tiron on Bortezomib-induced ROS Generation and Δψ m Increase—Because bortezomib treatment led to the enhancement of ROS generation, it is possible that alterations in the cellular superoxidant state could play a role in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. To examine this hypothesis, the antioxidant agent tiron was used to perturb the bortezomib-induced ROS generation and then to examine the consequent events. The data in Fig. 5 (A and B) show that co-treatment with 1 mm tiron for 24 h resulted in the complete restoration of bortezomib-induced right shift in the fluorescence curves of ROS and Δψm. The profiles are now indistinguishable with that of the untreated control, indicating that tiron exposure serves to protect against bortezomib-induced elevation of ROS generation and Δψm increase. We also found that the co-treatment with tiron could prevent the bortezomib-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The results in Fig. 5C show that bortezomib-induced cytochrome c release was inhibited starting at 9 h of co-incubation. The release of cytochrome c was almost completely abrogated after 12–24 h of co-incubation. Consequently, we sought to examine whether the abolishment of intracellular superoxide by tiron could rescue the borte"

The Raf-like kinase CTR1 functions downstream of the ethylene receptors as a negative regulator of ethylene signal transduction. CTR1 is shown here to be associated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum in Arabidopsis as a result of its interactions with ethylene receptors. Membrane association of CTR1 is reduced by mutations that eliminate ethylene receptors and by a mutation in CTR1 that reduces its ability to bind to the ethylene receptor ETR1. Direct evidence that CTR1 is part of an ethylene receptor signaling complex was obtained by co-purification of the ethylene receptor ETR1 with a tagged version of CTR1 from an Arabidopsis membrane extract. The histidine kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for its association with CTR1, based on co-purification of tagged ETR1 mutants and CTR1 after expression in a transgenic yeast system. These data demonstrate that CTR1 is part of an ethylene receptor signaling complex in Arabidopsis and support a model in which localization of CTR1 to the endoplasmic reticulum is necessary for its function. Additional data that demonstrate a post-transcriptional effect of ethylene upon the expression of CTR1 suggest that production of ethylene receptor signaling complexes may be coordinately regulated.

The simple gas ethylene serves as a diffusible hormone in plants (1Mattoo A.K. Suttle J.C. The Plant Hormone Ethylene. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton1991Google Scholar, 2Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd ed. Academic Press, San Diego1992Google Scholar). Ethylene regulates seed germination, seedling growth, leaf and petal abscission, organ senescence, ripening, and responses to stress and pathogens. Mutants affecting ethylene responses have been isolated in the plant Arabidopsis, and characterization of these mutants has led to the identification of ethylene receptors and several downstream components in the ethylene signal transduction pathway (3Solano R.

The ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis consists of five members: ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 (6Schaller, G. E., and Kieber, J. J. (2002) in The Arabidopsis Book (Somerville, C., and Meyerowitz, E., eds) DOI/10.1199/tab.0071, http://www.aspb.org/publications/arabidopsis/, American Society of Plant Biologists, Rock-ville, MDGoogle Scholar, 7Bleecker A.B. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 269-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). ETR1 was the first member of the receptor family identified and has been characterized in the most detail. The ethylene receptors have similar overall structures with transmembrane domains near their N termini and putative signaling motifs in their C-terminal halves. The receptors have three conserved transmembrane domains that based on genetic and biochemical evidence contain the ethylene binding site (8Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent studies of ETR1 indicate that the transmembrane domains also serve in localization of the receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PM, plasma membrane.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PM, plasma membrane. an unusual location for a hormone receptor but one compatible with the ready diffusion of ethylene in aqueous and lipid environments (11Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal half of each receptor are domains with similarity to histidine kinases and in some cases the receiver domains of response regulators. Histidine kinases and receiver domains are signaling elements originally identified in bacterial two-component phosphorelays and are now known to be present in plants, fungi, and slime molds (12Schaller G.E. Adv. Bot. Res. 2000; 32: 109-148Crossref Google Scholar). The ethylene receptors form two subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis and some shared structural features (6Schaller, G. E., and Kieber, J. J. (2002) in The Arabidopsis Book (Somerville, C., and Meyerowitz, E., eds) DOI/10.1199/tab.0071, http://www.aspb.org/publications/arabidopsis/, American Society of Plant Biologists, Rock-ville, MDGoogle Scholar, 7Bleecker A.B.

ETR1 and ERS1 belong to subfamily 1 and contain histidine kinase domains with all the conserved residues required for enzymatic activity. Histidine kinase activity has been demonstrated for ETR1 (14Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), but the function of this activity in signal output is still not clear (15Gamble R.L. Qu X. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1428-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Wang W. Hall A.E. O'Malley R. Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 belong to subfamily 2 and, although they contain histidine kinase-like domains, these domains lack residues considered essential for histidine kinase activity. Each member of subfamily 2 also has an additional hydrophobic domain at the N terminus that is predicted to function as a cleaved signal sequence for targeting to the secretory pathway (6Schaller, G. E., and Kieber, J. J. (2002) in The Arabidopsis Book (Somerville, C., and Meyerowitz, E., eds) DOI/10.1199/tab.0071, http://www.aspb.org/publications/arabidopsis/, American Society of Plant Biologists, Rock-ville, MDGoogle Scholar). Some of the receptors (ERS1, ERS2, and ETR2) are induced by ethylene at the transcriptional level (17Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), but this induction is not specific to either receptor subfamily. CTR1 is a protein kinase that functions downstream of the ethylene receptors based on genetic analysis (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of CTR1 is in the C-terminal half of the protein and shows the greatest similarity to the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 19Huang Y. Li H. Hutchison C.E. Laskey J. Kieber J.J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). CTR1 may function as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) in analogous fashion to Raf, and regulate signaling through a MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this possibility, ethylene stimulates MAPK activity in Arabidopsis (20Novikova G.V. Moshkov I.E. Smith A.R. Hall M.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Ouaked F. Rozhon W. Lecourieux D. Hirt H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in CTR1 result in constitutive ethylene responses, thereby indicating that CTR1 is a negative regulator, and that phosphorylation of substrates by CTR1 is apparently required to suppress ethylene responses (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 19Huang Y. Li H. Hutchison C.E. Laskey J. Kieber J.J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, the early steps of ethylene signal transduction combine signaling elements of disparate evolutionary origin, the receptors being related to the histidine kinases of prokaryotes but CTR1 being related to a serine/threonine kinase family found only in eukaryotes. Interestingly, CTR1 has been found capable of directly interacting with the ethylene receptors ETR1, ERS1, and ETR2 based on two-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding experiments (19Huang Y. Li H. Hutchison C.E. Laskey J. Kieber J.J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22Clark K.L. Larsen P.B. Wang X. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5401-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Cancel J.D. Larsen P.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The region of CTR1 involved in the interaction lies within the N-terminal half of the protein, a region that, based on the Raf kinase model, could be involved in regulation of kinase activity (19Huang Y. Li H. Hutchison C.E. Laskey J. Kieber J.J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22Clark K.L. Larsen P.B. Wang X. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5401-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). CTR1 was found capable of interacting with both the histidine kinase and receiver domains of ETR1, and the histidine kinase domain of ERS1 (which lacks a receiver domain) (22Clark K.L. Larsen P.B. Wang X. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5401-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of these interactions has remained unclear as no interaction between CTR1 and the ethylene receptors has been demonstrated in plants. In this study, we demonstrate that native CTR1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of Arabidopsis and that this localization arises due to interactions with ethylene receptors. Our data support the existence of a signaling complex involved in the initial steps of ethylene signal transduction and suggest that assembly of the signaling complex may be coordinately regulated. Membrane Fractionation—Microsomal and soluble fractions were isolated from either dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings (24Zhao X.C. Qu X. Mathews D.E. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture with an 18-h light period (11Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), using a homogenization buffer containing 30 mm Tris (pH 8.3 at 4 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol with protease inhibitors as described (11Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24Zhao X.C. Qu X. Mathews D.E. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, plant material was homogenized and then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting membrane pellet resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6 at 22 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol with protease inhibitors. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed as described (11Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) using 20–50% (w/w) sucrose gradients in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For analyses performed in the presence of Mg2+,5mm MgCl2 was added to homogenization, resuspension, and centrifugation buffers. Gradient fractions were analyzed for the presence of the ER, PM, mitochondrial inner membrane, and tonoplast by immunoblot using antibodies that recognized specific membrane markers. Thylakoid membranes were identified by spectrophotometric analysis of chlorophyll levels, and Golgi membranes were identified based on Triton X-100-stimulated UDPase activity (25Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Immunoblot Analysis—For preparation of the CTR1 antibody, a fusion protein was made of CTR1 with a His6 tag (CTR1–6His). A HindIII to BglII fragment of the CTR1 cDNA (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar), encoding Lys310 to Leu678 of CTR1, was cloned into the HindIII and BamH I sites of the expression vector pET15b (Novagen). The CTR1–6His protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and inclusion bodies isolated according to the manufacturer (Novagen) and used to prepare polyclonal antisera by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). The anti-CTR1 antibodies were affinity purified on Affi-Gel-15 columns (Bio-Rad) cross-linked with CTR1–6His that had been solubilized from inclusion bodies with 1.5% (w/v) Sarkosyl, 2% (w/v) Triton X-100. Antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Specific Arabidopsis membranes were identified by use of antibodies against the ER-markers ETR1, ACA2, and BiP (11Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the tonoplast-marker VM23 (31Maeshima M. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An antibody against the cytosolic heat shock protein Hsc-70 (StressGen) was used as a marker for soluble proteins in Arabidopsis. GST fusion proteins were identified by use of a polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (15Gamble R.L. Qu X. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1428-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by use of the BCA reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer after first adding 0.2 ml 0.4% (w/v) deoxycholate to solubilize membrane proteins. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard for protein assays. Prior to SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), protein samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h or ramped from 37 °C to 65 °C over 40 min using a thermocyler, so as to prevent the aggregation of integral membrane proteins that can occur with boiling (25Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Schaller G.E. Ladd A.N. Lanahan M.B. Spanbauer J.M. Bleecker A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12526-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon nylon membrane (Millipore) for immunoblotting. Immunodecorated proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer (Pierce Chemical). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Northern blot analysis was performed with Arabidopsis mRNA isolated as previously described (24Zhao X.C. Qu X. Mathews D.E. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Preparation and Purification of TAP-tagged CTR1—A binary vector (pCAMBIA2380-myc-TAP) was prepared for expression of affinity-tagged proteins in Arabidopsis. Initially, the vector pCAMBIA1380 (GenBank™ accession no. AF234301) was modified by replacing the gene for hygromycin resistance with the NPT II gene for kanamycin resistance and the resultant vector designated pCAMBIA2380. The TAP tag was amplified from the vector pBS1479 (34Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotech. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) and cloned into the KpnI and HindIII restriction sites of the vector 6-CMYC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center stock no. CD3–128) that contains a cassette encoding 6 copies of the c-Myc epitope tag. The region encoding the c-Myc and TAP tags was then amplified with primers that contained XhoI restriction sites and cloned into the XhoI site of pCAMBIA2380 to make pCAMBIA2380-myc-TAP. The region encoding CTR1 along with upstream promoter sequence was amplified from the Arabidopsis BAC clone F17C15 (GenBank™ accession no. AL162506) using 5′-primer GTCGACGGAGAAGTAGAAAAGAAAAC and 3′-primer GTCGACACAAATCCGAGCGGTTGG. The PCR product was cloned into the SalI site of pCAMBIA2380-myc-TAP to make pCAMBIA-CTR1-MT. Transformation and selection of Arabidopsis plants with pCAMBIA-CTR1-MT was performed as described (15Gamble R.L. Qu X. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1428-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of the CTR1-MT protein, microsomes were isolated from plants grown in liquid culture. Microsomes were brought to 1 mg/ml protein and incubated with 0.5% (w/v) lysophosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine from Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc.) for2hat4 °C, then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted to 0.25% LPC and incubated with Rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma) for4hat4 °C. The beads were washed with resuspension buffer to remove unbound proteins, and the bound proteins analyzed by immunoblot. Analysis of CTR1 Interaction with GST-ETR1 Fusion Proteins—For expression of GST and GST fusion proteins in yeast, the vector pEG(KT) was used (35Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This vector contains the GST domain under control of a Gal-inducible promoter and allows for uracil selection in yeast. The GST-ETR1 fusion proteins have been previously described (14Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Gamble R.L. Qu X. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1428-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For expression of CTR1 in yeast, the vector pYcDE-2 was used (36Hadfield C. Cashmore A.M. Meacock P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This vector has a constitutive ADH1 promoter and allows for Trp selection. A fragment of the CTR1 gene representing amino acids 1–698 was cloned into the EcoR I site of pYcDE-2. The pYcDE-2 construct and the pEG(KT) constructs were transformed together into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain EGY188 (MAT a ura3 his3 trp1 LexA-LEU2) (37Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Standard media and procedures were used for growth (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strohl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.0-13.7Google Scholar). For induction of GST fusion proteins, 0.5% galactose was used. GST fusion proteins were isolated from mid-log phase cultures by affinity purification with glutathione-agarose beads as previously described (14Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were visualized by immunoblotting using an anti-GST antibody. Co-purification of CTR1-(1–698) with the GST fusion proteins was assessed by using the anti-CTR1 antibody. Analysis of CTR1 Expression in Arabidopsis—To characterize the CTR1 protein in plants, we prepared a polyclonal antibody directed against CTR1. This antibody recognizes a protein of 92 kDa in Arabidopsis membranes, consistent with the calculated molecular mass of 90 kDa for CTR1 (Fig. 1A). As would be predicted, this protein is absent in the loss-of-function ctr1-2 mutant line. The ctr1-2 mutant has a 17-bp deletion that results in a frameshift within the coding region (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). The CTR1 protein was found to be ethylene-induced, based upon treatment of seedlings with the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC) or with ethylene itself (Fig. 1). The protein levels of CTR1 were 3-fold higher in ACC-treated seedlings compared with untreated seedlings (Fig. 1A). Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with 100 μl/liter ethylene resulted in an apparent increase in CTR1 levels within 15 min, with a maximal 4-fold increase in CTR1 levels observed 60 min after the initiation of ethylene treatment (Fig. 1B). Ethylene induction at the mRNA level has been previously noted for a CTR1-like gene from tomato (39Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latch A. Pech J.C. Bouzayen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Leclercq J. Adams-Phillips L.C. Zegzouti H. Jones B. Latche A. Giovannoni J.J. Pech J.C. Bouzayen M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1132-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but was not previously observed for Arabidopsis (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). To determine if ethylene induction of CTR1 in Arabidopsis occurred at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, transcript levels of CTR1 were determined by Northern blot in both ACC-treated and untreated plants (Fig. 1C). No change in transcript levels of CTR1 was detected, consistent with previous studies (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar), thereby indicating that the differences in CTR1 protein levels are likely due to post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation. Localization of CTR1 to the Endoplasmic Reticulum—Immunoblot analysis of microsomal and soluble protein extracts revealed that CTR1 was associated with the membrane fraction of Arabidopsis (Fig. 1), despite CTR1 itself lacking transmembrane domains or obvious sites for lipid modification (18Kieber J.J.

To resolve the subcellular membrane localization of CTR1, sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed on Arabidopsis microsomes (Fig. 2). Centrifugation was performed under conditions that would allow for the discrimination of ER-associated proteins, the ER being a logical membrane location for CTR1 based on the previous finding that the ethylene receptor ETR1 is localized to the ER (11Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Centrifugation was thus performed in the presence and absence of Mg2+. Association of ribosomes with the ER is Mg2+-dependent, so removal of Mg2+ results in dissociation of ribosomes from the ER and a diagnostic redistribution of ER from higher to lower density on the gradient (41Lord J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 542-558Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fractions from the sucrose gradient were analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of CTR1 as well as for markers specific for PM, mitochondria, tonoplast, and ER (Fig. 2). The majority of CTR1 exhibited a strong Mg2+-dependent density-shift from 40–41% to 32–36% (w/w) sucrose, similar to that observed for the ER markers ACA2 and ETR1. The distribution of CTR1 could be differentiated from the plasma membrane marker (H+-ATPase), the mitochondrial inner membrane marker (pM021), the tonoplast marker (VM23), and the chloroplast thylakoid marker (chlorophyll absorbance), which did not demonstrate the same Mg2+-induced shift. CTR1 could be differentiated from the Golgi marker (latent UDPase), which had a broader distribution than CTR1 in the Mg2+-containing gradient and fractionated as two peaks. Although the majority of CTR1 is associated with the ER based on sucrose density gradient centrifugation, a small amount of CTR1 did not demonstrate a Mg2+-dependent density-shift and may thus represent protein that resides at another membrane. Effect of Mutations in CTR1 upon its Membrane Association—Loss-of-function mutations have been isolated in CTR1 (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R.

Plant J. 2003; 33: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We analyzed these mutants for their effects upon the expression of CTR1 and the ability of CTR1 to associate with membranes. For this purpose, we performed one set of experiments using dark-grown seedlings because this is a growth condition that displays a pronounced and well-characterized ethylene response (4Chang C. Shockey J.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Stepanova A.N. Ecker J.R. Curr. Opin.

However, we were able to detect CTR1 only in the membrane fraction of dark-grown seedlings (Fig. 1A), potentially due to rapid turnover of any soluble CTR1. We therefore performed a second set of experiments using plants grown in liquid culture under lights, because with this growth condition CTR1 was detectable in the soluble fraction as well as in the membrane fraction. In both sets of experiments, plants were treated with ACC to induce the ethylene receptors and CTR1 to their maximal expression levels, thus helping to equalize expression of these ethylene-induced genes in the different genetic backgrounds. Results from these experiments are discussed below. Various ctr1 alleles were analyzed to determine if they produced stable ctr1 protein and if the mutation affected association with membranes. All the mutants examined displayed a constitutive ethylene response phenotype in both dark-grown seedlings and plants grown in liquid culture (19 and data not shown). The ctr1-2 is a 17-bp deletion that results in a frame-shift within the first third of the coding region (Fig. 3A) (18Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). No CTR1 protein was detected in ctr1-2 seedlings (Figs. 1 and 3), suggesting that the protein is absent or prematurely terminated. The ctr1-1 and ctr1-4 alleles are missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues of the k"

In human tumor tissues, VDUP1 expression was downregulated. Upon stimulation by growth-inhibitory signals such as TGF-β1 and 1,25(OH)2D3, its expression was rapidly upregulated as the cell growth was retarded. The transfection of VDUP1 in tumor cells reduced cell growth. The VDUP1 expression was also increased when the cell-cycle progression was arrested. Transfection of VDUP1 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, indicating that VDUP1 possesses a tumor-suppressive activity. In addition, it was found that VDUP1 interacted with promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger, Fanconi anemia zinc-finger, and histone deacetylase 1, which are known to be transcriptional corepressors. VDUP1 itself suppressed IL-3 receptor and cyclin A2 promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggest that VDUP1 is a novel antitumor gene which forms a transcriptional repressor complex."

Rev-Erbα mRNA is induced during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, and its expression is abundant in rat adipose tissue. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (NR1C3) is a nuclear receptor controlling adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity. Here we show that Rev-Erbα expression is induced by PPARγ activation with rosiglitazone in rat epididymal and perirenal adipose tissues in vivo as well as in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro.

In addition, the adipocyte differentiation and determination factor-1 (SREBP-1/ADD1) appears to promote adipocyte differentiation by activating the expression of PPARγ and increasing the synthesis of endogenous PPARγ ligands (13Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 14Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

Members of the PPAR family bind as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXR) to specific response elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) (for review see Ref. 16Barbier O. Torra I.P. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These PPREs usually consist of a direct repeat of the PuGGTCA motif spaced by one nucleotide (DR1). The transcriptional activity of the PPARs is activated by a number of different fatty acid metabolites, most notably products of the cycloxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. In addition, a large number of synthetic compounds are known to be potent and subtype specific PPAR ligands. For example, thiazolidinedione compounds used as insulin sensitizers in the treatment of type II diabetes are high affinity PPARγ ligands (17Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Rev-Erbα (NR1D1) is another nuclear receptor, the expression of which is induced during adipocyte differentiation (18Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rev-Erbα is highly expressed in adipose tissue but also in skeletal muscle, liver and brain (18Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol.

Cell. 1989; 57: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Since no ligand has been identified so far, Rev-Erbα is considered as an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Rev-Erbα has been shown to act as a negative regulator of transcription (22Laudet V. Adelmant G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 124-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) binding either as monomer on nuclear receptor half-site motifs flanked 5′ by an A/T rich sequence (A/T PuGGTCA), or as a homodimer to a direct repeat of the PuGGTCA motif spaced by two nucleotides (DR2). We have previously shown that PPARα activates the expression of Rev-Erbα through an atypical PPRE, a DR-2 element, in the Rev-Erbα promoter (23Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Laudet V. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by PPARγ through a DR-2 element has so far not been reported. However, since Rev-Erbα is induced during the course of adipocyte differentiation, we decided to investigate whether PPARγ could be involved in transcriptional induction of Rev-Erbα expression in adipocytes. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether Rev-Erbα plays a modulatory role in the process of adipogenesis. Our results from both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone increases Rev-Erbα gene expression and that PPARγ activates Rev-Erbα transcription via the Rev-DR2 response element present in the human Rev-Erbα promoter. Finally, we show that ectopic expression of Rev-Erbα in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes significantly augments the adipogenic activity of the PPARγ selective ligand rosiglitazone. Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (10 weeks old) were treated for 14 days by gavage with rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg/d) suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose solution. Control animals received an equal volume (5 ml/kg/d) of carboxymethylcellulose solution. At the end of the experiments, animals were sacrified by exsanguination under ether anesthesia. Adipose tissues were removed immediately and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA Analysis—RNA extraction of mice adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells and Northern blot analysis were performed as previously described (24Staels B. van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler.

Cells were grown in DMEM, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. All transfections were carried out as described previously (23Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Laudet V. Staels B. Mol.

Luciferase activities were determined on total cell extracts using a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. In Vitro Translation and EMSAs—pSG5hPPARγ, pSG5mRXRα, and pSG5hRev-Erbα were in vitro transcribed with T7 polymerase and translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with Rev-Erbα, PPARγ, and/or RXRα were performed exactly as described previously (23Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V.

For competition experiments, increasing amounts of the indicated cold probe were added just before the labeled oligonucleotide. The complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed overnight at –70 °C to x-ray film (XO-MAT-AR, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Viral Production and Infection—GP+E86 virus-encapsidating cells (31Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Hyclone), 8 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified atmosphere. In order to generate cell lines that constitutively overexpress Rev-Erbα, the coding sequence of human Rev-Erbα was inserted in front of the internal ribosome entry site and the neomycin resistance gene (pCITE, Novagen) of the MFG retrovirus plasmid (32Dranoff G. Jaffee E. Lazenby A. Golumbek P. Levitsky H. Brose K. Jackson V. Hamada H. Pardoll D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A similar construction lacking the Rev-Erbα sequence was made and used throughout the study as a negative control (pMFG-Neo). The bicistronic construct was designed to allow separate expression of the Rev-Erbα protein and the neomycin resistance by the infected cells. GP+E86 cells (15,000/cm2) were transfected with the MFG plasmid constructs (2 μg) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and selected for resistance using the geneticin analog G418 (0.8 mg/ml, Invitrogen). 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the GP+E86-produced MFG-Neo or MFG-Rev viruses essentially as previously described (33Mattot V. Vercamer C. Soncin F. Calmels T. Huguet C. Fafeur V. Vandenbunder B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Geneticin-resistant infected cell pools were used for the studies within three passages after infection. Cell Culture and Differentiation—3T3-L1 cells were cultured in growth medium containing DMEM and 10% calf serum. The cells were differentiated by the method of Bernlohr et al. (34Bernlohr D.A. Angus C.W. Lane M.D. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5468-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 2 days post-confluent cells (designated day 0) were switched to differentiation medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 μm dexamethasone, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5 mm 3-methyl-1-isobutylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma)) for 2 days. Thereafter, the cells were cultured in post-differentiation medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, insulin) with or without rosiglitazone (1 μm). The medium was changed every day. Retroviral infected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured under the same conditions, but differentiated either with (standard differentiation conditions) or without (rosiglitazone-dependent differentiation conditions) dexamethasone. After treatment the cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma) or total RNA was extracted as described above (35Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PPARγ Increases Rev-Erbα mRNA Levels in Adipose Tissue—In order to determine whether PPARγ activation affects Rev-Erbα expression in vivo, rats were treated for 14 days with rosiglitazone, a highly specific and potent PPARγ ligand (36Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). The expression of Rev-Erbα was analyzed in epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue by Northern blot analysis. Compared with control treated rats, rosiglitazone treatment strongly increased Rev-Erbα mRNA levels both in epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue (Fig. 1), whereas no change in control β-actin mRNA levels was observed. These experiments demonstrate that PPARγ activators increase Rev-Erbα mRNA levels in adipose tissue in vivo. PPARγ Activation Induces Rev-Erbα mRNA in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—To study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this induction, we next investigated the regulation of Rev-Erbα mRNA expression by rosiglitazone in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. Cells were grown until confluency in medium containing calf serum. 2 days post-confluent cells (designated day 0), cells were transferred to medium containing fetal calf serum and differentiated with the classic differentiation mixture containing dexamethasone, IBMX, and insulin. From day 2, either 1 μm rosiglitazone or vehicle was added. RNA was harvested at day 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and used for Northern analysis. As previously reported (18Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rev-Erbα mRNA levels increased upon differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). However, compared with the standard differentiation treatment, Rev-Erbα mRNA levels were induced earlier in the presence of rosiglitazone. Moreover, Rev-Erbα mRNA levels were higher after 8 days in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with rosiglitazone compared with controls (Fig. 2, A and B). Rosiglitazone is known to be a potent inducer of differentiation, thus in order to distinguish between direct effects of rosiglitazone on Rev-Erbα gene expression and indirect effects mediated via increased differentiation, we investigated whether rosiglitazone was able to induce Rev-Erbα in fully differentiated day 10 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, rosiglitazone activated the expression of Rev-Erbα as well as the adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP/aP2), a well-characterized PPARγ target gene (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), in mature adipocytes. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide caused a superinduction of Rev-Erbα and could therefore not be used to investigate whether the induction of Rev-Erbα was mediated directly by PPARγ (data not shown). Nevertheless, these experiments demonstrate that activation of PPARγ increases Rev-Erbα mRNA during in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as well as in mature adipocytes. PPARγ Induces Rev-Erbα Expression at the Transcriptional Level—PPARα has previously been shown to activate the human Rev-Erbα promoter in hepatocytes via a DR-2 element (23Gervois P. Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Laudet V. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar), through which Rev-Erbα represses also its own transcription (29Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine whether this site also mediates the activation of the Rev-Erbα promoter by PPARγ in adipocytes, transfection assays were carried out using luciferase reporter constructs driven by the Rev-Erbα promoter. 3T3-L1 cells were cotransfected with the PPARγ expression vector (pSG5-hP-PARγ) or empty vector (pSG5) and treated with rosiglitazone or vehicle. Rev-Erbα promoter activity was induced by PPARγ cotransfection, an effect that was enhanced in the presence of rosiglitazone (Fig. 3). By contrast, Rev-Erbα promoter activity was unaffected by rosiglitazone in the absence of overexpressed PPARγ, probably due to the insufficient levels of endogenous PPARγ in non-confluent preadipocytes. These data indicate that Rev-Erbα gene transcription is induced by rosiglitazone via PPARγ. To further investigate the importance of the DR-2 element in the induction by PPARγ, Rev-Erbα promoter constructs in which the Rev-DR2 site was mutated, were tested next. Mutations affecting the 5′-AGGTCA motif (pGL2hRev-Erbα Δ as described (29Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A)) of the Rev-DR2 site resulted in the loss of Rev-Erbα promoter inducibility by rosiglitazone and PPARγ (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the Rev-DR2 site mediates the transcriptional induction of Rev-Erbα by PPARγ. To assess whether the Rev-DR2 site could also function as a PPARγ-responsive element in front of a heterologous promoter, transient transfection experiments were performed using constructs containing the wild-type or mutated versions of the Rev-DR2 site (Fig. 4B) cloned in front of the heterologous SV40 promoter (Rev-DR2, Rev-DR2M5′ and Rev-DR2M3′). In COS cells, cotransfection of pSG5-hPPARγ on the Rev-DR2 driven SV40 reporter vector led to a 2.5-fold induction of transcription activity compared with empty pSG5 vector cotransfection (Fig. 4C). This effect was enhanced in the presence of rosiglitazone. By contrast, PPARγ did not activate the Rev-DR2 site mutated in its 5′-AGGTCA half-site (Rev-DR2M5′). Furthermore, mutation of the 3′-half-site (Rev-DR2M3′) of the DR2 site also abolished transactivation by PPARγ. These results clearly demonstrate that the Rev-Erbα human promoter is regulated by PPARγ and that this induction is mediated via the Rev-DR2 site. PPARγ Binds as a Heterodimer with RXRα to the Rev-DR2 Site—To investigate whether PPARγ binds directly to the Rev-DR2 site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using in vitro synthesized PPARγ and RXRα proteins. Since the Rev-DR2 site was previously described as a Rev-Erbα response element, binding of Rev-Erbα was assayed as a control (Fig. 5A). As expected (29Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Rev-Erbα bound both as homo- and as monomer to the Rev-DR2 site. Furthermore, no binding was observed on the Rev-DR2 oligonucleotide carrying a mutation in the 5′-half-site (M5′), whereas Rev-Erbα bound only as a monomer to the Rev-DR2 carrying a mutation in the 3′-half-site (M3′) in accordance with previous observations (29Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RXRα or PPARγ alone did not bind to either wild-type or mutated Rev-DR2 sites confirming that PPARγ cannot bind as a monomer. By contrast, binding to the Rev-DR2 site was observed when PPARγ was incubated in the presence of RXRα. The binding was specific since it was competed out by excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 5A). The specificity of the binding complex was verified by the addition of a specific anti-PPARγ antibody (38Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), which inhibited formation of the PPARγ/RXRα complex. The binding was prevented by mutation of both the 5′-(M5′) or 3′-(M3′) half-sites of the Rev-DR2 element. To determine the relative binding affinity of the PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer for the Rev-DR2 site, cross-competition EMSA experiments were performed comparing binding of PPARγ/RXRα to the natural DR-1 site in the aP2 promoter (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) and the Rev-DR2 site. As shown in Fig. 5B, competition with the cold Rev-DR2 site decreased PPARγ/RXRα binding to both the radiolabeled Rev-DR2 and aP2 DR-1 sites. These experiments demonstrate that PPARγ binds as a heterodimer with RXRα to the Rev-DR2 site of the Rev-Erbα promoter, albeit with significantly lower affinity compared with the aP2 PPRE site (Fig. 5B). Rev-Erbα Increases the Adipogenic Activity of PPARγ Agonists—To assess a potential role of Rev-Erbα in adipogenesis, full-length human Rev-Erbα was cloned into a retroviral vector, and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were infected with the resulting virus (MFG-Rev) or the control MFG-Neo virus. Pools of cells stably transduced, but not clonal selected 3T3-L1 cells were subsequently cultured with an incomplete differentiation mixture, which requires PPARγ activation with rosiglitazone for optimal differentiation, and either rosiglitazone (1 μm) or vehicle was added from day 2 to day 8. The presence of Rev-Erbα in MFG-Neo or MFG-Rev infected cells was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 6A) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6B) of 3T3-L1 cells treated for 6 days with the differentiation mixture. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of ectopic expressed human Rev-Erbα protein in MFG-Rev infected, but not in the control cells (Fig. 6A). Since the antibody used was raised against a peptide, its affinity was too low to detect endogenous Rev-Erbα protein. However, both ectopic and endogenous Rev-Erbα expression was detected by Northern blot analysis in MFG-Rev cells, whereas MFG-Neo cells only expressed endogenous Rev-Erbα (Fig. 6B). The effect of ectopic Rev-Erbα on adipocyte differentiation was investigated using Oil Red O staining to assess triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells induced to differentiate in incomplete medium (Insulin and IBMX, but no dexamethasone). Under these conditions, full differentiation is dependent on the presence of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. In the absence of rosiglitazone, ectopic expression of Rev-Erbα induced only a slight increase in triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 6, C and D). However, when rosiglitazone was added, a major increase in triglyceride accumulation was observed in the cells expressing Rev-Erbα compared with control cells. These morphological changes were accompanied by a pronounced induction of mRNA levels of the adipocyte-specific marker, and PPARγ target gene, aP2, whose expression was strongly induced by rosiglitazone and Rev-Erbα (Fig. 7). Moreover, a strong increase in PPARγ mRNA levels was observed in MFG-Rev compared with MFG-Neo cells, which may be a reflection of the differentiation status of the cells. In addition, rosiglitazone treatment induced PPARγ expression due to PPARγ auto-induction (39Mueller E. Drori S. Aiyer A. Yie J. Sarraf P. Chen H. Hauser S. Rosen E.D. Ge K. Roeder R.G. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41925-41930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, mRNA levels of C/EBPα, another differentiation marker, were also induced by Rev-Erbα over-expression. Moreover, as expected, C/EBPα mRNA level was induced by rosiglitazone in MFG-Neo cells, likely due to the cross regulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα (40Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). However, in Rev-Erbα expressing cells, rosiglitazone treatment did not further enhance C/EBPα expression. Although the expression levels of C/EBPβ, an early inducer of adipocyte differentiation, and SREBP-1/ADD1 were higher upon rosiglitazone treatment, likely due to the optimal differentiation status of the cells under these conditions, the mRNA levels of these transcription factors were not influenced by Rev-erbα expression (Fig. 7). Next, the influence of Rev-Erbα on the expression of aP2, PPARγ and C/EBPα was determined when 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated under classical conditions (insulin, IBMX, and dexamethasone). As expected, induction levels of aP2, PPARγ, C/EBPα, and endogenous Rev-Erbα were more pronounced in the complete compared with the incomplete mixture without dexamethasone (compare Fig. 7 to Fig. 8). Induction levels of these adipogenic markers were identical between non-infected cells and MFG-Neo cells indicating that the retrovirus-infected cells differentiate normally (data not shown). Interestingly, Rev-Erbα infected cells expressed Rev-Erbα mRNA levels similar to th"

Tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins was observed under conditions of oxidative stress. We hypothesize that nitration of mitochondrial proteins is a common mechanism by which oxidative stress causes dysfunctional mitochondria. The putative mechanism of nitration in a diabetic model of oxidative stress and functional changes of nitrated proteins were studied in this work. As a source of mitochondria, alloxan-susceptible and alloxan-resistant mice were used. These inbred strains are distinguished by the differential ability to detoxify free radicals. A proteomic approach revealed significant similarity between patterns of tyrosine-nitrated proteins generated in the heart mitochondria under different in vitro and in vivo conditions of oxidative stress. This observation points to a common nitrating species, which may derive from different nitrating pathways in vivo and may be responsible for the majority of nitrotyrosine formed. Functional studies show that protein nitration has an adverse effect on protein function and that protection against nitration protects functional properties of proteins. Because proteins that undergo nitration are involved in major mitochondrial functions, such as energy production, antioxidant defense, and apoptosis, we concluded that tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins may lead to dysfunctional mitochondria in diabetes.

Protein tyrosine nitration is a common post-translational modification occurring under conditions of oxidative stress in a number of diseases (1Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Rad.

Diabetes is a state of oxidative stress (3Rosen P. Nawroth P.P. King G. Moller W. Tritschler H.-J. Packer L. Diabetes-Metab. Res.

Furthermore, the studies that associate altered free radical status with impaired mitochondrial function provide evidence of protein tyrosine nitration in mitochondria exposed to oxidative stress (9Radi R.

Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations may have important implications for the pathogenesis of diabetes if the protein targets of nitration, functional consequences of nitration, and pathways for the increase of protein tyrosine nitration in mitochondria were established. Over the past several years, substantial evidence has been accumulated that major pathways of protein tyrosine nitration in vivo include peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and heme peroxidase-dependent reactions (1Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Rad. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). A recent development points to the common nitrating species (nitrogen dioxide, ·NO2) formed from both pathways, which is responsible for the most nitrotyrosine generated (15Brennan M.-L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

Despite some progress in assessing the putative mechanism of in vivo nitration, the biological relevance of protein tyrosine nitration remains unclear. Very little is known about which specific proteins undergo nitration and whether disease-associated nitration contributes to the appearance of complications or whether it is merely a biomarker, reflecting the presence of complications. Our hypothesis is that nitration of mitochondrial proteins is a common mechanism by which oxidative stress causes dysfunctional mitochondria. As a source of mitochondria, alloxan-susceptible (ALS) 1The abbreviations used are: ALS, alloxan-susceptible; ALR, alloxanresistant; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; MPO, myeloperoxidase; ONOO–, peroxynitrite; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; SCOT, succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ALS, alloxan-susceptible; ALR, alloxanresistant; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; MPO, myeloperoxidase; ONOO–, peroxynitrite; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; SCOT, succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and alloxan-resistant (ALR) mice were used. These inbred strains are distinguished by the differential ability to detoxify free radicals (17Mathews C. Leiter E.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Mathews C. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to ALS mice, the ALR mice remain normoglycemic and do not develop diabetes after alloxan (AL) injection. These two closely related strains are especially useful in comparing the susceptibility to damage caused by oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to identify the nitrated proteins formed in mitochondria under different in vivo and in vitro conditions of oxidative stress and to elucidate the functional outcome of nitration. The data obtained in the present study point to a common nitrating species responsible for the majority of nitrotyrosine formed and concur with the hypothesis that nitration of mitochondrial proteins caused by oxidative stress may result in dysfunctional mitochondria. Animals and Treatment—The 7-week-old male ALS and ALR mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). AL was dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. Control mice received the corresponding volume of buffer. The blood glucose levels were monitored using Accu-Chek Advantage blood glucose monitor and test strips (Roche Applied Science). The AL-treated ALS and ALR mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after AL injection. Mitochondria and Treatment—Mitochondria from hearts were isolated using differential centrifugation (14Turko I.V. Marcondes S. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)/0.25 m sucrose/0.1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease and proteasome inhibitors: 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 20 μm proteasome inhibitor I, 20 μm lactacystin, and 20 μm MG-132. Finally, mitochondria were resuspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Mitochondria from untreated ALS and ALR mice were treated with either (i) 0.5 mm ONOO– or (ii) 0.5 mm NaNO2, 200 μg/ml glucose with 40 ng/ml glucose oxidase (to generate H2O2), and 100 nm myeloperoxidase (MPO) for 1 h at room temperature. Mitochondria were then sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The high-speed supernatant fraction includes mitochondrial soluble proteins. The high-speed pellet includes mainly mitochondrial membrane proteins. Total protein concentrations in these fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis— The first dimension was performed using the PROTEAN IEF cell (Bio-Rad). The 7-cm pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips were rehydrated with 130 μl of a solution (2 m thiourea, 7 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Biolytes 3–10, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue) that contained 100 μg of the total protein. Isoelectric focusing was conducted at 250 V/15 min, linearly increased over 2 h to a maximum of 4,000 V, and then run to accumulate a total of 20,000 V-h. For the second dimension, the IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue and then for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% iodoacetamide, and bromphenol blue. The strips were then embedded in 0.7% (w/v) agarose on the top of 10% acrylamide slab gels containing a 4% stacking gel. After completion of the second-dimension SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analysis with 1:2,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was performed as previously described (14Turko I.V. Marcondes S. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments for nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity were performed by preincubating (30 min at room temperature) the anti-nitrotyrosine antibody with 4 mm free 3-nitrotyrosine or with 4 mm free l-tyrosine prior to incubation with polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Identification of Nitrated Proteins—Nitrated proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-TOF/MS) of in-gel tryptic digest of nitrotyrosine immunopositive spots. MALDI-TOF/MS was performed using a Voyager-DE STR bioSpectrometry work station (PerSeptive Biosystems). Bradykinin fragment-(1–7) (MH+ 757.3997), angiotensin II (MH+ 1046.5423), synthetic peptide P14R (MH+ 1533.8582), and ACTH fragment-(18–39) (MH+ 2465.1989) were used for external calibration. All spectra were also calibrated internally on the trypsin peaks at 842.51 and 2211.0968. Peptide mass fingerprinting data were evaluated using the MASCOT software (www.matrixscience.com). Immunoprecipitation with Anti-nitrotyrosine Antibody—High-speed supernatant fractions from ALS mitochondria treated with ONOO– or NO 2– /H2O2/MPO were precleared with 60 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged to pellet the beads. The supernatant fractions were incubated with 3 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated from both samples with 60 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose by rotating the suspension for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation the beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)/0.5 M NaCl/0.1% Tween 20. The beads were finally resuspended in sample loading buffer containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, and supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Westerns were performed using the rabbit anti-succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) serum (14Turko I.V. Marcondes S. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the rabbit anti-Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD2) antibody (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) or the goat anti-Grp75 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantification of 24-kDa Subunit—A quantitative method based on alkylation of cysteine residues with isotopically normal and heavy acrylamide (19Sechi S. Rapid Commun.

Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. 0.2 mg of the high-speed mitochondrial membrane fractions from ALS and ALR hearts were dissolved in 200 μl of 2 m thiourea/7 m urea/4% CHAPS/40 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The mitochondrial pellet fraction from ALS mice was then alkylated with 400 mm light (non-deuterated) acrylamide, whereas the mitochondrial pellet fraction from ALR mice was alkylated with 400 mm heavy (deuterated) acrylamide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA) for 5 h at room temperature. The ALS and ALR fractions were then mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The combined sample was resolved on two-dimensional PAGE. The Coomassie-stained spot corresponding to the 24-kDa subunit was excised and in-gel digested with trypsin. The extracted peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS. A peptide from 24-kDa subunit with two cysteine residues (YHIQVCTTTPCMLR) was used for calculation of relative abundance of 24 kDa in the ALS and ALR mitochondria. Catalytic Activities—SCOT catalytic activity in the soluble mitochondrial fraction was measured spectrophotometrically by following the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA at 313 nm (21Williamson D.H. Bates M.W. Page M.A. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm succinyl-CoA, 0.2 mm acetoacetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm iodoacetamide, and 50 μg of soluble protein. The activity of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) in the membrane mitochondrial fraction was measured spectrophotometrically following the oxidation of NADH (12Riobo N.A. Clementi E. Melani M. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Moncada S. Poderoso J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCN, 0.2 mm NADH, and 20 μg of membrane protein. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.15 mm coenzyme Q1 and recorded for 4 min at 340 nm. All measurements were performed for n = 6 animals. The results were analyzed using unpaired Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Tyrosine Nitration of Mitochondrial Proteins—We undertook a study to compare the outcome of in vitro and in vivo nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Our in vitro approach includes treatment of purified heart mitochondria from ALS mice with ether ONOO– or NO 2– /H2O2/MPO. Our in vivo approach to generate nitrated proteins includes treatment of ALS mice with AL that caused type I diabetes. In addition, whole mitochondria in all control and treated groups were sonicated and separated into two fractions, which represent soluble mitochondrial proteins and membrane mitochondrial proteins, respectively. Soluble (Fig. 1) and membrane (Fig. 2) mitochondrial proteins were then separately resolved by a two-dimensional PAGE. Following matching of nitrotyrosine immunopositive spots on Western and Coomassie-stained spots on the gel, the gel pieces were manually excised for protein identification by MALDI-TOF/MS. All tyrosine-nitrated spots were excised and processed. However, not all the proteins were identified. The major reason for this was a low recovery of peptides from particular spots. Probably, several strong nitrotyrosine positive spots seen in Figs. 1 and 2 represent low-abundance mitochondrial proteins, which could not be identified without prefractionation of complex protein mixtures before loading on two-dimensional PAGE.Fig. 2Two-dimensional gel patterns for nitrated membrane proteins in heart mitochondria from ALS mice. Western blot analyses with monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody are shown for mitochondria treated with ONOO– (A) or NO 2– /H2O2/MPO (B) and for mitochondria from AL-treated mice (C).

Seven identical proteins were found nitrated in the soluble fraction from ONOO–- and MPO-treated mitochondria. This includes aconitase 2, Grp75, albumin, SCOT, creatine kinase, peroxiredoxin 3, and SOD2 (Fig. 1, A and B, spots 1–7). Three of them, SCOT, creatine kinase, and peroxiredoxin 3, were also found nitrated in the diabetic mitochondria (Fig. 1C, spots 4–6). The membrane fraction was contaminated with trace amounts of nitrated aconitase 2, Grp75, albumin, and creatine kinase (Fig. 2, A and B). Two more proteins in this fraction were identified as a β-subunit of trifunctional protein (Fig. 2, spot 8) and a 24-kDa subunit of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Fig. 2, spot 9). Both these proteins are involved in membrane-bound mitochondrial complexes. Several nitrotyrosine-positive spots were observed in the membrane fraction from the diabetic mitochondria. Spot 8 represents the β-subunit of trifunctional protein, the nitrated protein found in in vitro experiments. Another one was identified (Fig. 2C, spot 10) as a voltage-dependent anion channel 1.Table IMitochondrial proteins in nitrotyrosine immunoreactive gel spots in Figs. 1 and 2SpotProteinMassPeptide matchesSequence coverageScoreAccession number (GI)kDa%1Aconitase 2, mitochondrial85.51321178 [66]180793392Grp75, precursor73.7817102 [66]21197263Albumin68.71020122 [66]197054314Succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)56.051789 [66]182666805Creatine kinase, sarcomeric mitochondrial precursor47.4827121 [66]1253136Peroxiredoxin 328.152188 [62]66806907Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), mitochondrial precursor24.732161 [53]73055118Trifunctional protein, β-subunit51.41125165 [66]208248549NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, 24-kDa subunit, precursor27.3944123 [63]2017801210Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC-1)32.3746137 [66]6755963 Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitations are traditionally used to reconfirm the correct spot assignments on two-dimensional PAGE and MALDI-TOF identifications. We have immunoprecipitated SCOT, Grp75, and SOD2 with anti-nitrotyrosine antibody from soluble mitochondrial fractions treated with ONOO– or NO 2–/H2O2/MPO and proved the identity of these proteins by Western immunoblots with anti-SCOT, anti-Grp75, and anti-SOD2 antibodies, respectively (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we have screened the MALDI-TOF mass spectra generated for immunoprecipitated nitrated proteins and found direct proof of Grp75 nitration for both treatments used, ONOO– and NO 2–/H2O2/MPO (Fig. 3B). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the tyrosine-containing tryptic fragment corresponding to residues 188–202 of Grp75 showed a +45 mass unit ion shift from [M + H]+ m/z 1694.8 to [M + H]+ m/z 1739.8. Two additional peaks were also observed and most likely represent a fragmentation and/or chemical reaction of the nitrogroup during the desorption/ionization process. [M + H]+ m/z 1723.8 can represent a loss of one oxygen atom from the nitrogroup and [M + H]+ m/z 1709.8 can represent reduction of the nitrogroup to the amine. The same pattern of MALDI-TOF mass peaks (MH+, MH+ + 15, MH+ + 29, and MH+ + 45) was published recently for tyrosine-nitrated peptides recovered from nitrated albumin (22Petersson A.-S. Steen H. Kalume D.E. Caidahl K. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 616-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and actin (23Aslan M. Ryan T.M. Townes T.M. Coward L. Kirk M.C. Barnes S.

Protection Against Nitration in ALR Mitochondria—In addition to the ALS mice, ALR mice were used in the present report. ALS and ALR mice are inbred strains. However, in contrast to ALS mice, ALR mice do not develop diabetes after AL injection. The studies reported (17Mathews C. Leiter E.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Mathews C. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that the differential ability to detoxify free radicals is an important discriminator that distinguishes these two closely related strains. ALR mice possess constitutively elevated free radical defense status and are a useful control strain to compare susceptibility to free radical-mediated damage. Fig. 4 shows Western blot analysis with anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. Comparison between ALS and ALR groups shows an obvious protection against an in vitro tyrosine nitration in the ALR mitochondria. This effect was observed (i) in both mitochondrial fractions, soluble (Fig. 4A) and membrane (Fig. 4B) and (ii) for both nitrations used, ONOO–- and MPO-dependent. Regarding in vivo protein nitration in the diabetic conditions, AL treatment caused an appearance of several nitrated bands in mitochondria from ALS mice (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 4), whereas no nitration was detected in mitochondria from AL-treated ALR mice (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 4). The efficiency of in vitro and in vivo nitration is substantially different in our experiments. In order to visualize in vivo nitrated proteins, a longer film exposure is shown for soluble (Fig. 4C) and membrane (Fig. 4D) mitochondrial proteins from ALS mice treated with AL. Functional Analysis—Functional analysis of the tyrosinenitrated proteins was performed for a SCOT and for a membrane-bound mitochondrial protein complex (Complex I). SCOT is the rate-determining enzyme in ketolysis (21Williamson D.H. Bates M.W. Page M.A. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Ketolysis occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and is the process of ketone body acetoacetate conversion to acetyl-CoA. Recently, we found that SCOT underwent tyrosine nitration in the rat heart following streptozotocin administration (14Turko I.V. Marcondes S. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, it was the first study to identify increased tyrosine nitration of a specific mitochondrial protein in a rat model of diabetes. Now, it has been confirmed using a mouse model of diabetes as well as by in vitro nitration. Using anti-SCOT antibody we found the same level of SCOT expression in ALS and ALR mitochondria (Fig. 5A). This finding permitted normalization of measured SCOT activity to total protein (Fig. 5B). Complex I is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is one of the energy metabolism enzymes that catalyzes the transport of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone for ATP synthesis. Complex I consists of more than 40 subunits (24Smeitink J. Sengers R. Trijbels F. van den Heuvel L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), including a 24-kDa subunit, which was found nitrated. We were not able to obtain antibodies specific to the 24-kDa subunit of Complex I to verify expression levels of this protein in the ALS and ALR mitochondria. Instead of this, we used a method of quantitative proteomics. This approach is based on the use of light (non-deuterated) and heavy (deuterated) acrylamide to alkylate cysteine residues in proteins before their separation by two-dimensional PAGE and subsequent analysis by MALDI-TOF/MS. To estimate the relative amount of a 24-kDa subunit in ALS and ALR mitochondria, the ALS mitochondria were labeled with the light acrylamide and the ALR mitochondria were labeled with heavy acrylamide. Heavy acrylamide has 3 deuteriums instead of 3 protons and is 3 mass units heavier than light acrylamide. From the chemical point of view, there is no difference between light and heavy forms of acrylamide. This results in equal efficiency of alkylation in separate samples and, after mixing, the co-migration of the same proteins from separate samples on two-dimensional PAGE (19Sechi S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 1416-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Gehanne S. Cecconi D. Carboni L. Righetti P.G. Domenici E. Hamdan M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 24-kDa subunit was then in-gel digested with trypsin and identified using MALDI-TOF/MS. The following quantitative profiling was accomplished by comparing a ratio between the intensities of the light and heavy mass components of the cysteine-containing peptide. Fig. 6A shows that peptide containing two cysteine residues, YHIQVCTTTPCMLR, from the 24-kDa subunit is represented by two isotopic envelopes that are separated by 6 mass units (3 mass units per each cysteine residue). The first isotopic envelope represents the 24-kDa subunit from ALS mitochondria. The second isotopic envelope represents the 24-kDa subunit from ALR mitochondria. ALS and ALR samples were mixed at 1:1 ratio. Because the intensities of [M + H]+ m/z 1807.78 and [M + H]+ m/z 1813.83 are equal, we concluded that the expression level of the 24-kDa subunit is the same in ALS and ALR mitochondria. This finding permitted normalization of Complex I catalytic activity (Fig. 6B) to the total protein in the mitochondrial membrane fraction. Figs. 5B and 6B show that SCOT and Complex I activities were significantly lower in both ONOO– and NO 2– /H2O2/MPO-treated ALS mitochondria compared with untreated ALS mitochondria. SCOT activity was approximately decreased 73 and 61% after ONOO– and NO 2– /H2O2/MPO treatment, respectively. Complex I activity was approximately decreased 46 and 53%, respectively. Under the same conditions in the ALR mitochondria, we observed no statistically significant changes in either of the activities. Both activities were also measured following AL treatment. In mitochondria from ALS mice, which develop diabetes upon AL treatment, SCOT activity was ∼28% lower than in control. At the same time, SCOT activity was unchanged in the mitochondria from AL-treated ALR mice. The ALR mice remain normoglycemic and do not develop diabetes after AL treatment. Complex I activity did not differ significantly from the activity in controls for any of the AL-treated groups. It is generally accepted that oxidative stress can lead to dysfunctional mitochondria, and dysfunctional mitochondria may generate further free radicals contributing to the oxidative stress, thus accelerating cellular dysfunction in chronic and age-related diseases. Of particular relevance are reports of tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins associated with oxidative stress (9Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 10MacMillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Ahkl K.M. Sanders P.W. Thompson J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that nitration of mitochondrial proteins is a common mechanism by which oxidative stress causes dysfunctional mitochondria. Here we compared the patterns of nitrated proteins in heart mitochondria generated with ONOO–- or MPO-dependent reactions in vitro to those generated in heart mitochondria in vivo by diabetes. Because the local environment of the targeted tyrosine residue may also play a key role in determining the rate of nitration and eventually the final outcome of the reaction (16Zhang H. Bhargava K. Keszler A. Feix J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8969-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Free Rad. Res. 1999; 31: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), mitochondrial soluble and mitochondrial membrane proteins were analyzed separately. The two-dimensional PAGE patterns of in vitro nitrated proteins were found remarkably similar for ONOO–- and MPO-dependent reactions in both soluble (Fig. 1, A and B) and membrane (Fig. 2, A and B) mitochondrial fractions. Our data are consistent with an earlier observation (26Sampson J.B. Ye Y.Z. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) that ONOO– and the NO 2– /H2O2/MPO mixture nitrated many of the same protein bands in rat heart homogenate. This tempted us to support a conclusion (15Brennan M.-L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M.

Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8969-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that a single nitrating species (presumably ·NO2) may be formed, which is common for both reactions. The conclusion is further supported by the notion that mitochondrial proteins from ALR mice were protected against nitration. The mitochondria have a multicomponent antioxidant defense system, and though identification of a specific component responsible for observed protection was beyond the scope of this study, the similar protection against nitration, no matter which in vitro reaction was used to cause nitration, points to a single nitrating species involved. Comparison of the patterns of nitrated proteins generated in the diabetic mitochondria in vivo revealed some obvious similarity with in vitro nitrations for both mitochondrial fractions (Figs. 1 and 2). At least four proteins, SCOT, creatine kinase, peroxiredoxin 3, and trifunctional protein, were found nitrated in all treatments used. Several nitrotyrosine immunopositive spots, which were not identified, also have the same positions in all treatments used. Taken together, these data also suggest a common nitrating species, which may derive from different nitrating pathways and be responsible for the majority of nitrotyrosine formed. However, in addition to the strong similarities, we also observed some clear differences between in vitro and in vivo patterns, especially for membrane proteins. This presumably reflects an additional in vivo reaction(s), which was not mimicked by the in vitro treatments used in this study. Two-dimensional PAGE separation in combination with MALDI-TOF/MS identification is a powerful proteomic approach to analyze a pattern of nitrated proteins in specific conditions. However, this experimental approach also has some limitations, especially in respect to the resolution of low-abundance and hydrophobic proteins (27Lopez M.F. Melov S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are about 2,000 proteins in mitochondria, many of which are membrane-bound or have a low molecular weight and/or have very alkaline pIs. We were not able to match several nitrotyrosine immunopositive spots on Western blots to particular Coomassie-stained spots on gels. We also probably lost some nitrated proteins based on their properties. These experimental limitations may contribute to some inconsistency between the in vitro and in vivo studies. Apart from the mechanism of tyrosine nitration, its biological significance is a subject of great interest. Protein tyrosine nitration alters the structure and function of proteins and may prevent tyrosine phosphorylation (1Greenacre S.A.B. Ischiropoulos H. Free Rad. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 2Turko I.V. Murad F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 28Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used two closely related strains of mice, ALS and ALR, that possess different abilities to dissipate free radical-mediated adverse processes (17Mathews C. Leiter E.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Mathews C. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that in vitro tyrosine nitration of SCOT or Complex I in heart mitochondria from ALS mice results in a decrease of their catalytic activity. The observation is consistent with recent publications that show the vulnerability of SCOT and Complex I to the conditions favorable for protein nitration (12Riobo N.A. Clementi E. Melani M. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Moncada S. Poderoso J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Turko I.V. Marcondes S. Murad F. Am. J.

Transm. 2002; 109: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Studies with heart mitochondria from ALR mice revealed that ALR mitochondria possess some specific features that protect proteins against tyrosine nitration. Furthermore, the protection against nitration also protects the functional properties of these proteins, at least with SCOT or Complex I. This is well correlated with in vivo data obtained for diabetic hearts from ALS and ALR mice. Although we observed nitration and inactivation of SCOT in the diabetic hearts from ALS mice, there was no nitration or inactivation of SCOT in the hearts from ALR mice. For Complex I, we observed neither significant inactivation nor nitration in the in vivo experiments performed. In summary, the remarkable similarity between patterns of tyrosine-nitrated proteins generated in heart mitochondria under different in vitro and in vivo conditions of oxidative stress points to a common nitrating species responsible for the majority of nitrotyrosine formed. We also provide direct evidence that nitration affects properties of some mitochondrial proteins. The alterations in activity of other nitrated proteins, if any, warrant further investigation. Because specific proteins nitrated in vivo under diabetic conditions are involved in major mitochondrial functions, such as energy production (SCOT and creatine kinase), antioxidant defense (peroxiredoxin 3), and apoptosis (voltage-dependent anion channel-1), this study supports a general conclusion that nitration of mitochondrial proteins may cause dysfunctional mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1977649999,"Cell motility during wound healing and inflammation is often dependent on the ability of the cell to sense a gradient of agonist. The first step in this process is the extension of a pseudopod in the direction of the agonist, and a diverse set of signals mediate pseudopod extension by different receptors. We have reported previously that protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a proinflammatory receptor that is highly expressed in motile cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and tumor cells, is one of a growing family of receptors that utilizes a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism for activation of the 42–44-kDa members of the MAPK family (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; ERK1/2). β-Arrestin-bound PAR-2 serves as a scaffold to sequester a pool of activated ERK1/2 in the cytosol; however, a specific role for the sequestered kinase activity has not been established. We now show that PAR-2 activation promotes ERK1/2- and β-arrestin-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, polarized pseudopodia extension, and chemotaxis. Using subcellular fractionation, confocal microscopy, and physical isolation of pseudopodial proteins, we demonstrate that the previously identified PAR-2/β-arrestin/ERK1/2 scaffolding complex is enriched in the pseudopodia, where it appears to prolong ERK1/2 activation. These studies suggest that the formation of a β-arrestin/ERK1/2 signaling complex at the leading edge may be involved in localized actin assembly and chemotaxis and provide the first example of a distinct cellular consequence of β-arrestin-sequestered ERK1/2 activity.

These studies suggest that the formation of a β-arrestin/ERK1/2 signaling complex at the leading edge may be involved in localized actin assembly and chemotaxis and provide the first example of a distinct cellular consequence of β-arrestin-sequestered ERK1/2 activity. A number of stimuli are able to promote cytoskeletal reorganization and random migration, but directed migration (or chemotaxis) is dependent upon the ability of the cell to sense and respond to a gradient of agonist (1Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The first step in chemotaxis is the formation of a leading edge, where a pseudopod is extended in the direction of the gradient. Receptors that promote chemotaxis must then be able to communicate with actin machinery to direct the formation of a leading edge. A number of common signaling proteins are implicated in pseudopod extension and chemotaxis, including members of the MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ARR-GFP, GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1; ARR319–418-GFP, dominant negative β-arrestin-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERK-KR, dominant negative ERK2; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor; MI, migration index; PAR, protease-activated receptor; P2AP, PAR-2 activating peptide; p-ERK, phosphorylated ERK1/2; P1AP, PAR-1 activating peptide; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; HLB, Hypotonic lysis buffer; MES, 4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acid; CT, Celltracker; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride hydrate.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ARR-GFP, GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1; ARR319–418-GFP, dominant negative β-arrestin-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERK-KR, dominant negative ERK2; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor; MI, migration index; PAR, protease-activated receptor; P2AP, PAR-2 activating peptide; p-ERK, phosphorylated ERK1/2; P1AP, PAR-1 activating peptide; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; HLB, Hypotonic lysis buffer; MES, 4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acid; CT, Celltracker; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride hydrate. family: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and p38 MAPK. ERK1/2 phosphorylation of one member of the Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome family of proteins (Wave-1/Scar-1) and myosin light chain kinase have been implicated in platelet-derived growth factor, integrin, and lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell motility (2Miki H.

Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49212-49219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). More recently, localization of ERK1/2 to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts was shown to be involved in lysophosphatidic acid-induced pseudopod extension, although the mechanism by which it is localized is unclear (4Brahmbhatt A.A. Klemke R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13016-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the nuclear effects of ERK1/2 on gene regulation are more widely studied, an understanding of how ERK1/2 activity is controlled in the cytosol by association with different scaffolding complexes is emerging. Recent studies suggest that the cytosolic effects of ERK1/2 may not occur in response to any signal that converges on this pathway and are not a default result of ERK1/2 that is leftover in the cytosol (6Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This model would require that an additional level of control over MAPK activity be exerted. Studies on a number of cell surface receptors have demonstrated a role for components of the endocytotic machinery, such as the clathrin adaptor protein, β-arrestin, in both the activation and subcellular localization of MAPKs (7Miller W. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that these “endosomal scaffolds” can both link activation of MAPKs to specific receptors and determine the ultimate subcellular localization of the active kinases (7Miller W. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent genetic studies (5Sun Y. Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49212-49219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Fong A.M. Premont R.T. Richardson R.M. Yu Y.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Patel D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) have suggested that β-arrestins are required for immune cell chemotaxis, and an enticing hypothesis is that endosomal scaffolds can restrict kinase activity to the leading edge to promote localized actin assembly and filament organization. One of the first examples of β-arrestin-dependent localization of MAPKs came from work on protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a member of the recently identified family of G protein-coupled receptors that are self-activated by tethered ligands exposed upon proteolytic cleavage of their extracellular N termini. PAR-2 is cleaved and activated by pancreatic trypsin, mast cell tryptase, coagulation factors (factor VII/Xa) and a membrane-bound serine protease (MBSPII) to mediate proinflammatory responses (9Camerer E.

A synthetic peptide (PAR-2 activating peptide or P2AP), corresponding to the tethered ligand sequence, will specifically activate PAR-2 in the absence of enzymatic cleavage (12Dery O. Corvera C.U.

Our early studies showed that ERK1/2 activation by PAR-2 is facilitated by β-arrestin and involves the formation of a large scaffolding complex (Stokes radius ∼6–7 nm) that sequesters the activated kinases in the cytosol, thus preventing their nuclear translocation and presumably leading to specific phosphorylation of cytosolic or membrane-associated proteins. PAR-2 also uses a ras-independent pathway to activate ERK1/2, in contrast to the classic pathway used by receptor tyrosine kinases and many G protein-coupled receptors (13DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Similar results have been observed for angiotensin AT1a receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (14Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L.

Surprisingly, other β-arrestin-dependent pathways of ERK1/2 activation, such as demonstrated for β2-adrenergic receptor, neurokinin-1 receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R), do the opposite, facilitating nuclear transport (18Luttrell L.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Still other receptors, such as the thrombin receptor, PAR-1 (structurally similar to PAR-2), do not require β-arrestin for activation of ERK1/2 (21Goel R. Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, one cannot make assumptions about the specific effects of MAPK activation by a given receptor as they vary depending on cell type, mechanism of activation, and scaffolding complexes with which the kinases associate. PAR-2 is highly expressed in neutrophils, mast cells, and tumor cells, where it has been suggested to promote cytoskeletal reorganization, but the mechanism by which it does so remains unclear (22Kamath L. Meydani A. Foss F. Kuliopulos A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5933-5940PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PAR-2 induces chemotaxis through the formation of a scaffolding complex, retaining ERK1/2 and possibly other kinases near the membrane where they can activate actin machinery and lead to polarized pseudopod formation. Here, we focus on the regulation of ERK1/2 pathway and show the following: 1) that PAR-2 activation results in actin reorganization, pseudopod formation, and chemotaxis whereas two other receptors that activate ERK1/2 by different mechanisms (IGF-1R and PAR-1) do not; 2) that MEK1/2 inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin or ERK2 prevent PAR-2-mediated chemotaxis but not IGF-1R-induced random migration; and 3) that phosphorylated ERK1/2 is enriched along with β-arrestin-bound PAR-2 in the pseudopodia, where its activity is prolonged. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher Biotech unless stated otherwise. Human and mouse P2AP, SLIGKV-NH2, and SLI-GRL-NH2 were synthesized and purified by Sigma Genosys. Human PAR-1 activating peptide (P1AP) was synthesized and purified by the Peptide Synthesizing Facility (University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Both peptides were high pressure liquid chromatography purified, and composition was confirmed by amino acid and mass spectral analysis. FLAG/HA.11-tagged human PAR-2 and GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1 (ARR-GFP) and GFP-tagged ERK2 have been described previously (13DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Rat β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-1319–418 cDNA were gifts from Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center); human PAR-2 cDNA, GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1, and GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1319–418 were gifts from Dr. Nigel Bunnett (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Dominant negative ERK2 (ERK-KR) was a gift from Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). GFP-tagged ERK-KR was made by PCR amplification of ERK-KR coding sequence and insertion into BamHI sites of EGFPN1 and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-ERK (p42/44MAPK) was from Cell Signaling; PAR-2 (SAM11), histone H1, and actin primary antibodies and protein A were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology; mouse monoclonal β-arrestin-1 was from Transduction Laboratories; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Pierce; and Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes Inc. Cell Culture and Construction of Stable Cell Lines—NIH3T3 cells were a gift from Dr. Nigel Bunnett (University of California, San Francisco, CA), and MDA MB-468 cells were from American Type Tissue Collection. NIH3T3 cells were grown in CellGro medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% Cosmic calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). MDA-MB-468 cells were grown in Leibowitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% Cosmic calf serum and 14 mm NaHCO3. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with FLAG/HA.11-tagged PAR-2 alone or with ARR-GFP by calcium phosphate precipitation followed by drug selection. Clonal cell lines were screened for expression by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence as described previously (13DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and Western blotting with antibodies to PAR-2 (SAM11) and β-arrestin-1. Three clones of each cell line were tested for trypsin and P2AP-stimulated colocalization with β-arrestin and internalization, as described previously (13DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and for membrane localization of phosphorylated ERK1/2. For transient transfections, Lipofectin (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoprecipitations—5 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish were grown for 24 h, serum-starved for 16 h, and treated with 50 μm P2AP, 50 μm P1AP, or 100 ng/ml insulin for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice and lysed by dounce homogenization (10 strokes) in 0.25 ml of Hypotonic lysis buffer (HLB; 10 mm triethanolamine-acetic acid, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose + 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min; crude nuclear pellets were washed one time in HLB and recentrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. Nuclear fractions were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to yield membrane and cytosolic fractions. Membrane fractions were resuspended in HLB + 1% Triton X-100. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with antibodies to phospho-ERK (p-ERK), actin (cytosolic control), and histone H1 (nuclear control). A small amount of actin immunoreactivity was observed in membrane and nuclear fractions, and some histone immunoreactivity was observed in membrane fractions, suggesting that minor cross-contamination of fractions occurred. For ERK/β–arrestin co-immunoprecipitations, cytosolic and membrane fractions were adjusted to contain 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in HLB and incubated with 1 μg of ERK2 antibody bound to 25 μl of protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—103 cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with 1 mg/ml extracellular matrix or poly-lysine, allowed to attach for 6 h, and serum-starved overnight. To observe p-ERK localization, NIH3T3-PAR-2 cells, treated with or without P2AP (50 μm) for 5 min or insulin (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked in 5% normal goat serum, and stained with anti-p-ERK (1:100) for 1 h at 25 °C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 1 h at 25 °C. During the second wash, 1 mg/ml DAPI was added to visualize nuclei. To observe actin-cytoskeletal reorganization, NIH3T3-PAR-2 + ARR-GFP cells were treated with 50 μm P2AP for 0–30 min, washed twice in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 138 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2mm EGTA), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in cytoskeletal stabilization buffer for 5 min at 25 °C, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin for 1 h at 25 °C. All images were observed by confocal microscopy on a Zeiss LSM500 with ×100 objective. Images of anti-p-ERK stained cells were also taken using a Nikon upright fluorescence microscope (×40 objective). Pseudopodia and Cell Migration Assays—Migration and pseudopod extension were monitored using 24-well Costar transwell polycarbonate membranes with 8.0-μ (migration) or 3.0-μ (pseudopod) pores, coated on both sides with fibronectin (10 μg/ml). After serum starvation for 6–18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or L-15 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 104 cells were seeded into the upper compartment and allowed to attach and spread for 2.5 h. P2AP (5 μm in MDA MB-468 or 50 μm in NIH3T3), insulin (100 ng/ml), or P1AP (50 μm) were added to the lower chamber to establish a gradient or to both upper and lower chambers to form a uniform concentration for either 16 h (migration assays) or 90 min (pseudopodia assays). Cells were stained with 1% crystal violet in 2% ethanol; either non-migratory cells or cell bodies on the upper surface were manually removed with a cotton swab, and migratory cells and pseudopodia were observed on an inverted Nikon TE300 with ×4, ×10, and ×20 objectives. Cells were counted in four fields of vision (×4 objective), and total number was determined. Pseudopodia density was determined by histogram analysis of pseudopodia using Adobe Photoshop and by eluting dye from the membrane and measuring absorbance at 600 nm on a Beckman spectrophotometer. To test the involvement of MAPKs, U0126 (10 μm) or PD98059 (5 μm) or SB203580 (25 μm) were added 20 min before agonists. Flow Cytometry—Migration experiments in cells transiently transfected with GFP, ERK-KR-GFP, and Arr319–418-GFP were performed as described except that 106 cells were seeded onto 6-well transwell filters, and after addition of agonist for 16 h, cells from both sides were scraped into medium + 1% bovine serum albumin, labeled with Cell Tracker Orange for 30 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry using Cellquest software. Regions were set based on background fluorescence of untransfected NIH3T3 cells, with and without addition of Celltracker Red (CT). Region 1 contained cells that were both CT and GFP positive, and Region 2 contained cells that were only CT positive. Non-viable cells that did not take up CT were eliminated from the analysis. Total cell numbers from top and bottom sides of each filter were counted, density plots of each region were generated, and total cells in each region were determined. Three methods for data analysis were used, normalizing for variations in cell number recovered and transfection efficiencies, and are as follows. 1) Migration indices (-fold increase over basal levels) were determined for transfected (GFP and CT positive) and untransfected (CT positive only) cells. This method does not account for differences in cell recovery from membranes. 2) GFP migration indices were determined as the percentage of transfected cells that migrated (GFP bottom/GFP top + bottom) divided by the total percentage of transfected cells (GFP bottom + GFP top/total cell number). 3) GFP/CT ratios were determined as percentages of migratory cells that were transfected divided by the number of untransfected cells that migrated. Values for GFP migration indices and GFP/CT rations were nearly identical; a value closer to one indicates little effect of transfection on cell migration. Pseudopodia Purification—Pseudopodia purification was performed as described (23Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 106 NIH3T3-PAR-2, transiently transfected with ARR-GFP, were seeded into the upper chamber of transwell filters (24-mm diameter, 3-μ pore size) as described above and treated with 50 μm AP for 0–90 min to induce pseudopodia extension. Cells were rinsed in excess cold phosphate-buffered saline and rapidly fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol. To isolate pseudopodial proteins, cell bodies on the upper membrane surface were manually removed with cotton swab, and pseudopodia on the undersurface were scraped into lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors, 1% SDS). Cell body proteins were purified in a similar manner. Equal amounts of proteins from whole-cell lysate, cell body, and pseudopod lysate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with antibodies to p-ERK, PAR-2 (SAM11), β-arrestin-1, Raf-1, and histone H1. Statistics—All statistics were performed using Kaleidograph software; analysis of variance and Student's t tests were used to determine standard errors and p values. PAR-2 Activation Results in ERK1/2-dependent Actin Reorganization—Our previous studies have suggested that PAR-2 activates ERK1/2, resulting in the incorporation of the kinases into a scaffolding complex that sequesters their activity in the cytosol, by a mechanism distinct from that utilized by receptor tyrosine kinases such as the IGF-1R (13DeFea K.A.

Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that PAR-2 induces actin reorganization by an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism, NIH3T3 cells, stably transfected with PAR-2 (NIH3T3-PAR-2 + ARR-GFP cells), were grown on extracellular matrix-coated coverslips and treated with P2AP or insulin for 0–60 min, with or without pretreatment with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor U0126, after which they were fixed, and F-actin was stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. Both P2AP and insulin caused an increase in actin stress fibers (arrows), but only P2AP treatment resulted in formation of broad pseudopodia (arrowheads). Formation of both pseudopodia and stress fibers was prevented by pretreatment with U0126 (Fig. 1). PAR-2 Activation Induces ERK1/2-dependent Chemotaxis—To address the possibility that PAR-2 stimulates chemotaxis whereas other receptors that activate ERK1/2 by alternative mechanisms do not, we compared the effects of PAR-2 activation on cell migration with that of IGF-1R (as a model of the classic receptor tyrosine kinase pathway) and PAR-1 (a receptor for thrombin that activates ERK1/2 by a β-arrestin-independent pathway). Two PAR-2 expressing cell lines were used in these studies: NIH-3T3 cells and a breast cancer cell line, MDA MB-468. Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor is highly expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and PAR-1 is expressed in both cell lines, as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Migration was determined using a transwell filter assay, and random migration was distinguished from chemotaxis by observing the migratory response of cells to a uniform concentration of agonist (added to top and bottom sides of filters) compared with a gradient of agonist (added only to the bottom chamber). This technique is commonly used to identify a chemotactic response, because cells that are able to sense a gradient of agonist will become confused by a uniform concentration and try to migrate in all directions, resulting in a reduced number of migratory cells. In contrast, cells that exhibit random migration will migrate equally well in response to a gradient and a uniform concentration of agonist (23Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Buettner H.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Zigmond S.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 123: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A gradient of P2AP induced a 5.2 ± 0.35-fold increase in NIH3T3 cell migration over basal levels (Fig. 2A) and 16 ± 3-fold increase in MDA MB-468 cell migration (Fig. 2B). In response to a uniform concentration of P2AP, migration was reduced by ∼60%. In contrast, P1AP (activates PAR-1), administered as a uniform concentration or a gradient did not induce migration in either cell line. Insulin (probably acting through IGF-1R) appeared to stimulate random migration, as both a uniform concentration and a gradient of insulin induced cell migration (Fig. 2, A and B). Virtually no cell migration in response to insulin was observed in MDA MB-468 cells, which we attribute to very low levels of either insulin receptor or IGF-1R expression (not shown). In summary, PAR-2 stimulates chemotaxis, IGF-1R stimulates random migration, and PAR-1 does not stimulate motility in the cell lines examined, despite the fact that all three are known to activate ERK1/2. To examine the role of MAPK activity in PAR-2-stimulated chemotaxis, we repeated migration assays in the presence of two MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, and a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580. Both U0126 and PD98059 inhibited PAR-2-induced chemotaxis by 70 and 89%, respectively, in NIH3T3 cells, whereas SB203580 had no significant effect (Fig. 2C). In MDA MB-468 cells, U0126 and PD98059 inhibited PAR-2-stimulated chemotaxis by 56 and 60%, respectively, whereas SB203580 actually stimulated PAR-2-induced migration (Fig. 2D), suggesting that ERK1/2 but not p38 MAPK activation is involved in PAR-2-stimulated chemotaxis (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 can antagonize each other, so the stimulatory effect of p38 MAPK may be because of enhanced ERK1/2 activity). In contrast, insulin-stimulated random migration was only mildly inhibited by U0126 (<40%) and was not affected by SB203580 or PD98059 (Fig. 2C), suggesting random and directed migration might have differential requirements for MAPK activity. To confirm that the sensitivity to U0126 and PD98059 reflected a requirement for ERK1/2 rather than nonspecific effects of these inhibitors, we repeated motility experiments in the presence of ERK-KR-GFP. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with ERK-KR-GFP or GFP alone and grown on 8-μ transwell filters. After 16 h of P2AP or insulin stimulation, cells from both sides of the filters were collected, labeled with Cell Tracker Red, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Migration indices (MI) and GFP MI were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative density plot of PAR-2-stimulated migration in ERK-KR-GFP-transfected cells is shown in Fig. 3A. P2AP-stimulated chemotaxis was inhibited by ∼80% (80 ± 3% MI inhibition and 89 ± 4% GFP MI inhibition) by ERK-KR-GFP expression (Fig. 3B). Insulin-i"

This decrease in cell volume occurs in synchrony with other classical features of apoptosis. The molecular basis for cell shrinkage during apoptosis involves fluxes of intracellular ions including K+, Na+, and Cl-. Here we show for the first time that these ion fluxes, but not cell shrinkage, are necessary for apoptosis. Using sodium-substituted medium during anti-Fas treatment of Jurkat cells, we observed cellular swelling, a property normally associated with necrosis, in contrast to the typical cell shrinkage. Surprisingly, these swollen cells displayed all of the other classical features of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase activity, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage, and internucleosomal DNA degradation. These swollen cells had a marked decrease in intracellular potassium, and subsequent inhibition of this potassium loss completely blocked apoptosis. Reintroduction of sodium ions in cell cultures reversed this cellular swelling, resulting in a dramatic loss of cell volume and the characteristic apoptotic morphology. Additionally, inhibition of sodium influx using a sodium channel blocker saxitoxin completely prevented the onset of anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. These findings suggest that sodium influx can control not only changes in cell size but also the activation of apoptosis, whereas potassium ion loss controls the progression of the cell death process.

Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Different. 2002; 9: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that a variety of apoptotic stimuli result in an early transient increase in intracellular sodium associated with a marked plasma membrane depolarization that occurs prior to the loss of cell volume and other characteristics of apoptosis (23Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although this increase in intracellular sodium appears to occur in part because of an early inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase during anti-Fas induced apoptosis, the precise role for this sodium influx is not completely known. In healthy cells, a balance of intracellular potassium and sodium ions is required not only to maintain a constant cell size but also for the overall viability of the cell. Variations in the cellular ionic composition are normally compensated via inherent volume regulatory mechanisms, suggesting the importance of maintaining this balance in ionic content (24Hoffman E.K. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1987; 30: 125-180Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Al-Habori M. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Lang F. Ritter M.

Changes in the concentration of intracellular potassium and chloride have been a primary focus of studies examining apoptotic cell shrinkage. The high intracellular concentration of potassium in most mammalian cells has made this ion an attractive target in dissecting the consequence of cell shrinkage during apoptosis. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the loss of intracellular potassium during apoptosis and subsequent cell shrinkage has not been identified, although it has been suggested that inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the eventual potassium efflux and loss of cell volume during apoptosis (23Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Nobel C.S. Aronson J.K. van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Slater A.F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies elucidating a role for intracellular sodium during apoptosis have lagged behind its aforementioned intracellular cation counterpart, despite the critical function sodium plays in controlling and maintaining a homeostatic cell volume. To date no evidence, either genetic or biochemical, has been reported separating cell shrinkage from other characteristics of apoptosis. Here we report that ion fluxes, but not cell shrinkage, are necessary for apoptosis. We show that sodium influx is necessary for cell shrinkage but not for the activation of the cell death effectors. In contrast, potassium efflux is critical for death by apoptosis, regardless of changes in cell size. Additionally, complete inhibition of sodium influx results in a delay in the activation of the apoptotic program, suggesting that sodium may have multiple roles during programmed cell death. Cell Culture—Jurkat cells, E6.1 (human lymphoma) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 31 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) was accomplished using 10 ng/ml anti-human Fas IgM (Kamiya Biomedical). The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere for various periods of time. For choline- or NMDG-substituted medium, RPMI 1640 medium was initially made substituting choline chloride or NMDG for NaCl. Additionally, choline bicarbonate and magnesium phosphate was used in place of sodium bicarbonate and sodium phosphate, respectively. In media where the potassium and sodium concentrations were switched, the KCl concentration was adjusted to 102.7 mm (the normal NaCl concentration of RPMI 1640), and the choline chloride or NMDG concentration was adjusted to 5.4 mm (the normal KCl concentration of RPMI 1640) and supplemented as described above. All of the media were examined for maintaining isotonicity using a 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT). Saxitoxin (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 30 μm. Intracellular Sodium and Potassium by Flow Cytometry—For intracellular sodium and potassium measurements, 2 μl of 2.5 mm SBFI-AM (Na+) or PBFI-AM (K+) (Molecular Probes) stock were individually added to 1-ml of cells at a final concentration of 5 μm 1 h prior to the time of examination. Incubation was continued at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Immediately prior to flow cytometric examination, propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Ten thousand cells were analyzed by sequential excitation of the cells containing SBFI-AM and PI at 340-350 and 488 nm, respectively, using a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (Benton Dickinson) and CellQuest software. Microscopy—A laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 410 NLO mounted on Axiovert 100M microscope; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to obtain differential interference contrast (DIC) images. The images were obtained simultaneously using the 488-nm line from the included argon ion laser as the light source and the Zeiss Plan-Apo 100× oil N.A. = 1.4 as the objective lens. The software used for acquisition was Zeiss LSM410 version 2.8 for Windows NT, and that used for analysis was LSM Image Examiner (licensed) version 2.8 for Windows NT. Hoechst stained cells were examined on a LSM 510 UV mounted on an Axiovert 200M microscope, (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a Plan-Apo 63× oil N.A. = 1.4 objective lens to obtain simultaneous DIC and UV images. Hoechst was excited at 361 nm from an Enterprise 653 laser (Coherent Laser, Auburn, CA), and emission was collected with a 385LP filter. The pinhole was adjusted so that the slice thickness in Z was ∼6 μm. Analysis of Cellular Membrane Lipid Symmetry by Flow Cytometry—Changes in the phosphatidylserine symmetry was determined using annexin V conjugated to FITC (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) and flow cytometry. Briefly, 5 × 105 control or treated cells, initially washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, were incubated with 1 μl of annexin-FITC and PI for 15 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. annexin-FITC/PI-stained samples were diluted in 400 μl of 1× annexin binding buffer and examined immediately using a BD FACSort flow cytometer with CellQuest software. Ten thousand cells were excited at 488 nm and examined at 530 and 585 nm for annexin-FITC and PI fluorescence, respectively. Analysis of Caspase Active by Flow Cytometry—Caspase activity was determined using the CaspaTag activity kits (Intergen, Purchase, NY) for the fluorescent detection of caspase-3, -8, and -9 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.5 × 105 control or treated cells were added to the various caspase substrates and incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 for 30 min. Immediately prior to flow cytometric examination, PI was added to each sample at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Ten thousand cells were analyzed using a BD FACSort flow cytometer with an excitation of 488 nm and emission at 530 and 585 nm for caspase activity and PI, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis for PARP cleavage was accomplished by running 50 μg/sample of protein extract on a 4-20% polyacrylamide gel (Novex/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferring the samples to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated with primary anti-PARP antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) overnight at a concentration of 500 ng/ml and then subsequently incubated with an anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Visualization was achieved on film with the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Analysis by Flow Cytometry—The DNA content for each sample was determined by flow cytometry by pelleting 3-5 ml of cells from both control and anti-Fas-treated samples. The cells were fixed by the slow addition of cold 70% ethanol to a volume of ∼1.5 ml, adjusted to 5 ml with cold 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C overnight. For flow analysis, the fixed cells were pelleted, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml of PI, 1 mg/ml RNase in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. 7500 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSort by gating on a PI area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. The percentage of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells with subdiploid DNA divided by the total number of cells examined under each experimental condition. DNA Analysis by Agarose Gel—DNA was isolated by pelleting 2.0-5.0 × 106 cells followed by resuspension in 500 μl of 5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The samples were stored at -20 °C overnight. The cell lysates were thawed and treated with 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 55 °C. The samples were then extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m, and the DNA was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol overnight at -80 °C. The DNA was pelleted, dried, and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA buffer to which 0.1 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease-free ribonuclease (RNase) was added. The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. DNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, and 15 μg of DNA were examined on a 1.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Sodium Replenishment Assay—Jurkat cells cultured in sodium-substituted choline medium were treated with and without 50 ng/ml of an anti-Fas antibody for 4 h at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. After this time, the cells were harvested and resuspended back into either fresh sodium-substituted choline medium or normal RPMI 1640 medium, the latter of which contained the standard levels of extracellular sodium. The cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Morphological examination of these cells was performed using DIC microscopy. Increased Intracellular Sodium Occurs prior to the Loss of Cell Volume—We initially examined Jurkat cells at the single-cell level for changes in intracellular sodium using the fluorescent SBFI-AM (Na+) dye and flow cytometry. Gating on only the normally sized or nonshrunken cells, anti-Fas treatment in the presence of SBFI-AM (Na+) resulted in two distinct populations of cells: one with a control level of intracellular sodium and one with increased intracellular sodium (Fig. 1). Previous kinetic studies revealed that the cell population with increased intracellular sodium correlated with those that had depolarized their plasma membrane, and it is these cells that proceed to adopt the characteristic features of apoptosis (23Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these cells remained depolarized, even after cell shrinkage, in part because of an inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase, thus preventing their cellular repolarization (23Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, this inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase alone does not account for the elevated level of sodium seen in the nonshrunken, anti-Fas-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that additional ion transport processes exist to account for the increase in intracellular sodium. These transport mechanisms may be intimately linked to the activation of the programmed cell death process. Prevention of Na + Influx Induced Cell Swelling—To examine the consequence of this early increase in intracellular sodium during apoptosis, we exposed Jurkat cells to sodium-substituted medium, thus removing the normal concentration gradient or driving force for sodium influx, while maintaining isotonic conditions. Standard RPMI 1640 medium that contains 125 mm [Na+] was substituted with sodium-free components. Because complete removal of sodium from this medium by dialyzing the fetal calf serum was incompatible with life, the cells were cultured in a small amount of sodium that was present in normal heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular sodium using SBFI-AM (Na+) in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody under normal conditions again showed a significant increase in the percentage of cells with increased intracellular sodium (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when either choline or NMDG was substituted for sodium in the culture medium, anti-Fas treatment did not result in increased intracellular sodium (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the observed increase in intracellular sodium is a consequence of sodium influx through the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas in the presence of sodium-substituted choline or sodium-substituted NMDG medium showed an unexpected change in cell size by flow cytometry. Under normal sodium conditions, an increase in the number of cells that had a diminished capacity to scatter light in the forward direction, indicative of cells with a smaller or shrunken cell size typical of apoptosis (29Willman C.L. Stewart C.C. Semin. Diagn. Pathol. 1989; 6: 3-12PubMed Google Scholar), was observed in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas (Fig. 2B). However, upon treatment of cells with anti-Fas in sodium-substituted medium, an increase in forward scatter light was observed, indicative of cellular swelling (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, control cells cultured in either sodium-substituted medium had a slightly decreased capacity to scatter light in the forward direction compared with the control cells cultured in normal medium, suggesting that the entire population of cells was adjusting their resting cell volume. Morphological examination of Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas for 6 h in normal RPMI 1640 medium on a confocal microscope with Nomarski optics showed shrunken cells with cellular blebbing, characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 2C). In marked contrast, Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas in either sodium-substituted choline or sodium-substituted NMDG medium exhibited a swollen morphology, classically associated with necrosis (Fig. 2C). However, these swollen cells had condensed chromatin and apoptotic nuclei, indicative of the apoptotic morphology as observed by Hoechst staining (Fig. 2D). Apoptosis Can Occur without Cell Shrinkage—Based on these findings, we sought to determine whether other apoptotic characteristics occurred in the swollen anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells cultured in sodium-substituted medium. Externalization of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface was examined using annexin V-FITC and flow cytometry. Treatment of Jurkat cells under normal conditions with anti-Fas resulted in flipping of phosphatidylserine prior to the loss of membrane integrity, characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Similarly, Jurkat cells cultured in either sodium-substituted choline or sodium-substituted NMDG medium also exhibited phosphatidylserine externalization to an equivalent extent as observed under normal medium conditions (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this feature of apoptosis can occur in the absence of extracellular sodium and cell shrinkage. Additionally, anti-Fas-treated cells cultured in the presence of normal or sodium-substituted medium were evaluated for activation of various caspases associated with apoptosis (30Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar, 31Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 32Kohler C. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using fluorescent substrates for caspase-3-, caspase-8-, and caspase-9-like enzymes and flow cytometry in living cells. Under normal medium conditions, treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas resulted in an increase in caspase-3-, caspase-8-, and caspase-9-like activity (Fig. 3B). When cells treated with anti-Fas were cultured in either sodium-substituted choline or sodium-substituted NMDG, comparable activation of all three caspases was observed (Fig. 3B), suggesting that sodium influx and cell shrinkage are not required for caspase activation and/or activity. To access the downstream functionality of caspase activity, we examined these cells for the cleavage of PARP, a constitutive nuclear protein involved in DNA repair and a well characterized substrate for caspase-3-like proteases. Western blot analysis of control protein extracts from normal or sodium-substituted medium showed no occurrence of PARP cleavage (Fig. 3C). However, in anti-Fas-treated extracts, degradation of the PARP protein was observed under all conditions (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that not only are caspases active in the swollen “apoptotic” cells, but they are both functional and targeted to their appropriate subcellular location. It has been well documented that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, characteristic of apoptosis, is completely restricted to the shrunken apoptotic cells (7Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 8Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 33Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined anti-Fas-treated cells cultured under normal or sodium-substituted conditions for changes in their DNA integrity by flow cytometry. Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas under normal extracellular sodium conditions exhibited the presence of a subdiploid peak of DNA, indicating the occurrence of degraded DNA (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed in cells cultured in either sodium-substituted choline or sodium-substituted NMDG medium (Fig. 3D). The nature of this DNA fragmentation was explored by agarose gel electrophoresis. The presence of internucleosomal DNA cleavage, a hallmark characteristic of apoptosis, was evident in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas in either normal or sodium-substituted medium (Fig. 3E). Our analysis of programmed cell death in the absence of the normal concentration of sodium indicates that although this ion is critical for cell shrinkage during apoptosis, sodium is not necessary for the generation of other apoptotic traits. Thus, we show for the first time that cell shrinkage can be uncoupled from the programmed cell death process. Loss of Intracellular Potassium Controls the Activation of the Apoptotic Machinery—The loss of intracellular potassium has been shown to play a key role in the activation of the apoptosis, and elimination of the normal electrochemical gradient of this ion has been shown to block apoptosis. To determine whether changes in intracellular potassium occurred in anti-Fas-treated cells cultured under sodium-substituted conditions, we used the fluorescent PBFI-AM (K+) dye and flow cytometry. Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas under normal sodium conditions resulted in a marked decrease in intracellular potassium (Fig. 4). Interestingly, when anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells were cultured in either sodium-substituted choline or NMDG medium, a similar decrease in intracellular potassium was also observed (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that the loss of intracellular potassium is not solely dependent upon an increase in intracellular sodium, indicating that independent ionic pathways can and do exist for the movement of sodium and potassium ions during programmed cell death. Based on the above data, we speculated that this loss of intracellular potassium, even in the swollen cells, might account for the engagement of the apoptotic machinery. To examine this hypothesis, we treated Jurkat cells with anti-Fas in sodium-substituted choline or NMDG medium where the normal concentration of choline or NMDG components and KCl were switched while maintaining isotonicity. These conditions establish a high potassium (102.7 mm), low sodium-substituted environment. Jurkat cells cultured in either sodium-substituted choline or NMDG high K+ medium were indistinguishable from cells cultured in the normal sodium-substituted medium in regards to their intracellular potassium (Fig. 5A). Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas under sodium-substituted high K+ conditions resulted in the inhibition of intracellular potassium loss (Fig. 5A), similar to observations made in normal sodium, high K+ medium (7Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 8Hughes Jr., F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J.

J. 2001; 357: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Markedly, the presence of high extracellular K+ attenuated the generation of other apoptotic characteristics, including externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine, caspase-3 activity, and DNA degradation even in the sodium depleted medium (Fig. 5, B-D). Thus, the loss of intracellular potassium plays a pivotal role in the engagement of apoptosis, regardless of the presence or absence of extracellular sodium. Replacement of Extracellular Sodium Induces Cell Shrinkage and Characteristic Apoptotic Morphology—To define the precise role sodium has in orchestrating cell shrinkage during apoptosis, sodium was replenished in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas in sodium-substituted medium after a period of time followed by analysis for changes in cell size. As shown earlier, an increase in cell size or a swollen morphology was observed in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas initially under sodium-substituted conditions, which remained upon further culture in sodium-substituted medium (Fig. 6, top panels). However, after reincubation of these cells in medium that contained the normal levels of extracellular sodium, the anti-Fas-treated cells exhibited a shrunken morphology characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 6, bottom panels). These data elucidate a crucial role for sodium influx in activating the apoptotic volume decrease response or cell shrinkage during apoptosis. Our data also show that changes in cell size are reversible upon reintroduction of sodium, whereas other features of the cell death process are regulated by the loss of intracellular potassium. Saxitoxin Blocks Anti-Fas-induced Apoptosis—Finally, we wanted to determine the effect of sodium channel inhibition on preventing the early increase in intracellular sodium during apoptosis using the sodium channel blocker saxitoxin. The addition of saxitoxin alone had no significant effect on Jurkat cells, because these cells were similar to control (Fig. 7, compare first column with second column). When Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Fas for 6 h, we observed an increase in intracellular sodium, the loss of intracellular potassium, along with a shrunken cell population by flow cytometry (Fig. 7, third column). Additionally, these cells had degraded their DNA, all characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 7, third column). Interestingly, the addition of the sodium channel blocker saxitoxin completely prevented the increase in intracellular sodium during anti-Fas treatment (Fig. 7, fourth column). As a result of this inhibition of sodium influx, anti-Fas-treated cells did not undergo apoptosis within 6 h, as evidenced by their failure to lose intracellular potassium, shrink, or degrade their DNA (Fig. 7, fourth column). This suggests that sodium influx may also play a role in the activation of the apoptotic program. Together, these data indicate that both early (apoptotic activation) and downstream apoptotic processes (cell shrinkage) can be prevented in the absence of sodium influx and further suggests that ionic fluxes can control or regulate programmed cell death. Our data reveal novel insight into the effects specific ions have on the apoptotic process. Specifically our results show for the first time that cell shrinkage can be separated from other characteristics of apoptosis, with sodium controlling cell size and potassium regulating the progression of the apoptotic process. The importance of the early increase in intracellular sodium was revealed by studies where sodium-substituted medium was used to remove the concentration gradient of this ion. Under this condition, the cells induced to undergo apoptosis swell, rather than shrink, suggesting that the influx of extracellular sodium plays a key role in controlling cell size. Unexpectedly, these swollen cells still exhibited classical apoptotic traits including externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase activation, PARP cleavage, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, and the loss of intracellular potassium. Inhibition of potassium loss using high external potassium medium completely prevented apoptosis, suggesting potassium as the key intracellular ion that holds the apoptotic death machinery in check. Thus, although cellular swelling has been a recognized hallmark of necrosis, we show that the characteristics associated with apoptosis remain intact in response to anti-Fas treatment in sodium-substituted conditions despite cellular swelling. Furthermore, replenishment of sodium into the sodium-substituted condition restores the ability of anti-Fas-treated cells to shrink, showing that sodium controls cell shrinkage during apoptosis. Interestingly, if the rise in intracellular sodium is prevented using the sodium channel blocker saxitoxin, a complete inhibition of apoptosis is observed. Thus, the rise in intracellular sodium not only appears to play a role in controlling changes in cell size but also appears to have an effect in the initial signaling of the apoptotic program. A specific change in cell size has traditionally been a defining characteristic to discriminate apoptosis from necrosis, with the direction of the change being the key; apoptotic cells shrink, and necrotic cells swell. In fact the term “shrinkage necrosis” was originally used to describe a distinctively different mode of cellular death with features of an active, controlled process (34Kerr J.F.R. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 419-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 35Kerr J.F.R. J. Pathol. 1971; 105: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This process termed apoptosis was shown to play a role in cell turnover in many adult tissues, as well as during normal embryonic development, and to occur spontaneously in untreated malignant neoplasms (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). Thus, for the deletion of unwanted cells with little or no tissue disruption, a shrunken cell is well suited for a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. There have always been debates in terms of the importance of specific events associated with apoptosis. For example, whether mitochondrial membrane depolarization or the release of cytochrome c is a necessary feature for inducing apoptosis, whether apoptosis is controlled by caspases or is caspase-independent, and earlier as to whether internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was a decisive event required for the activation of the cell death process. However, in all well characterized examples of apoptosis, the cells always shrink. Our ability now, for the first time, to uncouple this event from other characteristics of apoptosis demonstrates that it is not the morphological observation that is important but the underlying movement of ions that holds the key to understanding how this mode of cell death is triggered. The increase in intracellular sodium reported here that occurs prior to the loss of cell volume during apoptosis is transient, and as the cells shrink a loss of both sodium and potassium is observed. Several studies, along with ours, have suggested an early increase in intracellular sodium during apoptosis (4Jonas D. Walev I. Berger T. Liebetrau M. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Pathol. 1999; 188: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our ability here to prevent the onset of apoptosis using the sodium channel blocker saxitoxin shows that programmed cell death can be inhibited at the level of the plasma membrane. Additionally, this result suggests that an orchestrated movement of ions plays an important role in the overall programmed death process. Interestingly, in our studies using sodium congeners such as choline or NMDG show that cell shrinkage is not necessary for the progression of apoptosis. A primary difference between the saxitoxin and sodium-substituted studies is the presence of a small amount of sodium in the sodium-substituted medium from the fetal calf serum. In media where dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was used, we found this to be incompatible with life, because control cells incubated in the complete absence of extracellular sodium loss membrane integrity and demonstrated cellular swelling (data not shown). Thus, our data suggest that the small amount of sodium contributed by the fetal calf serum, although not present at a significant level to induce cell shrinkage upon apoptotic stimulation, is sufficient to allow downstream catabolic events. Additionally, our studies show that the route of sodium entry across the plasma membrane is not destroyed during the cell death process, because reintroduction of extracellular sodium permits the cells to shrink and display traditional apoptotic morphology. The mechanisms responsible for the cellular swelling in sodium-substituted medium and consequent potassium loss under sodium-substituted conditions are not completely understood, although under normal conditions both inhibition of potassium uptake and activation of potassium efflux appear to be involved (23Bortner C.D.

Introduction of a known inhibitor for the regulatory volume decrease response, i.e. cytochalasin B, did not prevent the loss of intracellular potassium during Fas-induced apoptosis in sodium-substituted medium (data not shown), suggesting the absence of an active ionic efflux mechanism. This result is not surprising, because it has been suggested that multiple pathways may exist for the loss of intracellular potassium during cell death depending on the cell type and/or apoptotic stimulus (39Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting to note that UV-treated Jurkat cells in sodium-substituted medium also have a swollen morphology with the loss of intracellular potassium, 2C. D. Bortner and J. A. Cidlowski, unpublished observation. suggesting that this response is not specific to Fas-induced apoptosis and more importantly that a common mechanism for the loss of this ion may be present under these conditions. In conclusion, this study uncouples for the first time the morphological occurrence of cell shrinkage from other apoptotic traits, revealing distinct roles for sodium and potassium ion fluxes during apoptosis. Additionally, our work shows that cell volume changes during apoptosis are reversible. Although sodium-free conditions do not exist in vivo, our use of congeners elucidates a central role for sodium in cell shrinkage during apoptosis. These studies point the way for new therapeutic approaches to modulate apoptosis in human disease through the use of ion channel inhibitors. We thank Drs.

Here we show that RIC-3 is a member of a conserved gene family with representatives in both vertebrates and invertebrates. All members of this family have two transmembrane domains followed by a coiled-coil domain. Expression of the human ric-3 homolog, hric3, like the C. elegans ric-3, enhances C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2, rat α7, and human α7 nAChR-dependent whole-cell current amplitudes in Xenopus leavis oocytes, thus demonstrating functional conservation. However, hric3 also reduces human α4β2 and α3β4 nAChR-dependent whole-cell current amplitudes. Thus, hric3 shows differential effects on human nAChRs unlike the observed uniform effect of ric-3 on C. elegans nAChRs. Moreover, hric3 totally abolished currents evoked by 5-HT3 serotonin receptors, whereas it barely modified α1 glycine receptor currents. With this caveat, RIC-3 belongs to a conserved family of genes likely to regulate nAChR-mediated transmission throughout evolution. Analysis of transcripts encoded by the hric3 locus shows that it encodes for multiple transcripts, likely to produce multiple hric3 isoforms, and that hric3 is expressed in neurons and muscles, thus enabling its interactions with nAChRs in vivo.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are widely expressed ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic excitation and have additional roles including modulation of synaptic release (1Clementi F. Fornasari D. Gotti C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The nAChRs 1The abbreviations used are: Ach, acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic Ach receptor; 5-HT3, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 3; 5-HT3R, 5-HT3 receptor; EST, expressed sequence tag; Bgt, bungarotoxin; GluR3, glutamate receptor 3; GlyR, glycine receptor; h, human. are homomers or heteromers composed of five subunits. Each subunit traverses the membrane four times and is posttranslationally modified by both disulfide bond formation and glycosylation. Maturation of nAChRs, leading to production of fully assembled and functional receptors on the plasma membrane, is a complex, time-consuming, and poorly characterized process (2Merlie J.P. Lindstrom J. Cell. 1983; 34: 747-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Green W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Keller S.H. Taylor P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a Caenorhabditis elegans gene, ric-3, likely to be an important player in the maturation of nAChRs. In C. elegans, RIC-3 is required for cholinergic transmission mediated by nAChRs in neurons and in muscles but not for synaptic transmission mediated by other ligand-gated ion channels, even when these are expressed within the same cells as the nAChRs. RIC-3 activity is required within the cells that express the nAChRs and is likely to affect the processes of receptor folding or assembly within the endoplasmic reticulum (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). RIC-3 is a protein with two transmembrane domains followed by coiled-coil domains. When first identified, this protein showed no similarity to any characterized protein. Only one homolog was identified, the Drosophila CG9349 gene that is similar in both sequence and overall predicted structure. However, the demonstrated ability of RIC-3 to enhance whole-cell current amplitudes resulting from expression of both the C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2 and the rat α7 receptors in Xenopus oocytes suggested functional conservation of ric-3 in evolution (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here we show that ric-3 belongs to a conserved gene family with both vertebrate and invertebrate representatives. We proceeded to characterize the human ric-3 homolog (hric3) and showed that, like ric-3, it is capable of enhancing nAChR-dependent whole-cell current amplitudes in oocytes. Moreover, this effect corresponds with enhanced surface expression of the α7 receptor. Therefore, the ric-3 family is a conserved family of genes regulating nAChR maturation. However, hric3 had diverse effects on co-expressed nAChRs and even on another ligand-gated channel from the same ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Specifically, although it enhances whole-cell current amplitudes produced by the C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2 nAChR and rat and human α7 nAChRs, it inhibits the whole-cell current amplitudes produced by two other human nAChRs, α4β2 and α3β4, as well as a mouse 5-HT3 serotonin receptor. Thus, hric3 shows a high diversity in its effects on co-expressed receptors. In addition, the hric3 locus encodes multiple transcripts coding for different protein isoforms. These transcripts are expressed widely in both excitable and non-excitable tissues. Such isoforms, if functional, may interact with hRIC3 to modulate its activity. Sequence Analysis—ric-3 homologs were identified using the protein sequence of ric-3 as a probe in a standard tblastn search at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST (6Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Sequences for ric-3 homologs were obtained from: Danio rerio sequence CA475611, Ostertagia ostertagi sequence BG734142, Drosophila melanogatser CG9349 encoded by FBg0034574, a reconstruction of two Xenopus leavis sequences, AW645559 and AW634327, the human clone AL520122 (clone FL1001, Invitrogen), which was sequenced in the Life Science Sequencing Facilities (Hebrew University) using internal primers (sequencing was done in both orientations (accession number AY326435)), and the mouse expressed sequence tags (EST) sequence BB642650 (the mouse sequence is a reconstruction of this EST sequence and the corresponding genomic sequence, a reconstruction made possible due to the strong conservation of hric3 and mouse ric3 nucleotide sequences). Sequence alignment was generated using Clustal_W analysis (McVector). Structure prediction analysis was done using programs on www.expasy.ch and psort.nib-b.ac.jp. Analysis of alternative hric3 transcripts and the resulting protein isoforms is based on sequences available in the databases, except clone BF680796 (IMAGE:4296897), which was sequenced in the Life Science Sequencing Facilities (Hebrew University) using internal primers (accession number AY326436). This cDNA is likely to be incomplete as it does not have a poly(A) sequence at the 3′-end. When a single base mismatch was found between different available versions of the same sequence, we chose the version that maintained continuity of the open reading frame. Heterologous Expression and Electrophysiology—A 1.2-kb XhoI-EcoRV fragment containing hric3 from AL520122 was cloned into pGEMH19, which contains Xenopus globin untranslated sequences.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed and capped cRNAs were injected at final concentrations of 0.1–0.05 ng for DEG-3 and DES-2, 0.2 ng for GluR3(L507Y), and 5 ng for the mammalian nAChR subunits, except α7, GlyR α1, and 5-HT3R, which were used at 10 ng. Subunits of heteromeric receptors (DEG-3/DES-2, α4β2 and α3β4) were injected in an equimolar ratio. Optimal effects of hric3 on DEG-3/DES-2 expression were found at 1:5 hric3 to DEG-3/DES-2 concentrations, but for mammalian nAChR experiments, equal concentrations (5 ng in all cases) were injected. The final concentrations of subunits cRNAs were kept constant between injections with or without hric3 for each experiment. Injections and recordings were done as described in Treinin et al. (13Treinin M. Gillo B. Liebman L. Chalfie M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15492-15495Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The effects of hric3 co-expression on receptor-mediated whole-cell current amplitudes were assayed between the first and third day following injections. Errors are standard error of means, and significance was examined using the paired t test or the Mann-Whitney test. Specific surface expression of [125I]α-Bgt binding sites was tested with 5 nm [125I]α-Bgt as described (14García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were incubated with 5 nm [125I]α-Bgt for 1 h at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, unbound [125I]α-Bgt was removed, oocytes were washed, and bound radioactivity was counted. Non-specific binding was determined using non-inoculated oocytes. Northern and in Situ Analysis—Expression of hric3 was examined on human multitissue Northern blot number 7760-1 (Clontech), using random primed labeled cDNA probes for the entire hric3 open reading frame or the first two exons. For in situ analysis, we used 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed cRNA from a SKII– clone containing a 0.6-kb mouse ric3 fragment. This EcoRV-BamHI fragment is derived from clone BU705427 (IMAGE:6408852). Both the sense (T7) and the antisense (T3) cRNAs were used as probes on wax sections of mouse brain (15Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. Champion J.E. McMahon A.P. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis showed that the antisense probe produced a stronger and less uniform signal. A Conserved Family of ric-3-like Proteins—Blast searches of the available databases of ESTs have identified ric-3 homologs in a number of species, including the invertebrates O. ostertagi (a parasitic nematode) and D. melanogaster, and the vertebrates X. leavis, D. rerio (Zebrafish), Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens (Fig. 1). All sequences show high homology in the two membrane-spanning domains and in the first coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1). In addition, all members of the family have a proline-rich region (>10% prolines) in between the two transmembrane domains. For all homologs, structure prediction analysis suggest that both the N terminus and the C terminus coiled-coil domain are cytosolic. Thus, they all conform to the suggested structure and topology of the C. elegans ric-3, which would allow the formation of a coiled-coil-mediated protein complex in the cytosol (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the basic structure is conserved within the RIC-3 family, some differences exist. Only the C. elegans ric-3 has a long N-terminal domain and a second coiled-coil domain; however, since the sequences of O. ostertagi, D. rerio, and X. leavis are incomplete, we cannot exclude the possibility that they also code for a second coiled-coil domain (or specifically for O. ostertagi, a long N-terminal domain). Differences are also found in the Drosophila ric-3, which has longer spacer sequences between the two transmembrane domains and between the second transmembrane domain and the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1B). A Human Homolog of ric-3—To further characterize this gene family, we focused on the H. sapiens ric-3 homolog (hric3). For this purpose, we obtained a full sequence of one of the available clones, AY326435, a clone obtained from a neuroblastoma cell line. This cDNA is 2.9-kb-long, coding for a 369-amino-acid-long open reading frame and a long 3′-untranslated region. The corresponding genomic sequence spans 60 kb on chromosome 11p15,4 and is encoded by 6 exons. A similar sequence (85% of amino acids are identical) with a similar genomic structure is found in M. musculus on chromosome 7. The full sequence of hric3 conforms to the general structure prediction for the ric-3 family having two transmembrane domains followed by a coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1B). Specifically, overall identity with the C. elegans ric-3 is 22%, and overall structure differs by having a shorter N-terminal domain and only one coiled-coil domain instead of the two found in ric-3 (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Functional Conservation of hric3—Human ric3 shows significant similarity to C. elegans ric-3 in both sequence and predicted structure. However, such sequence conservation does not imply functional conservation. To assay for functional conservation, we examined the effects of co-expression with hric3 on the whole-cell current amplitudes produced by ion channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Injection of non-saturating concentrations of the C. elegans DEG-3 and DES-2 cRNAs leads to reproducible choline-dependent whole-cell currents (131 ± 25 nA, n = 28 oocytes, N = 6 frogs). Co-expression with hric3 enhances these currents 5-fold (631 ± 86 nA, n = 28, N = 6). Co-expression of hric3 with GluR3 does not increase the amplitude of glutamate-activated whole-cell currents, nor does expression of hric3 alone lead to detectable choline, nicotine, or glutamate-activated currents (Fig. 2). Thus, hRIC3, like the C. elegans RIC-3, appears to specifically enhance nAChR-dependent whole-cell current amplitudes. We have previously shown that C. elegans RIC-3 enhances whole-cell current amplitudes elicited by the rat α7 neuronal nAChR. AY326435 was found in a neuroblastoma cell line, suggesting expression of hric3 in neurons (further evidence for co-localization of ric3 with α7 is provided below). Thus, hric3 is likely to be expressed in the same cells as α7, enabling interactions between the two proteins in vivo. Indeed co-expression of hric3 with rat (not shown) and human α7 leads to a 2-fold increase in acetylcholine (ACh)-induced whole-cell current amplitudes (Fig. 3C). Moreover, direct measurement of α7 nAChR expression on oocyte membranes as detected by [125I]α-Bgt binding indicated an increase of about 6-fold in binding sites in the presence of hric3 (Fig. 3B), supporting its role in α7-maturation in vivo. The hric3-dependent enhancement in current amplitude is not associated with changes in current kinetics (Fig. 3A). Mammals utilize additional types of nAChR that could also be targets for hRIC3 activity. Thus, it was interesting to examine the effects of hric3 expression on two abundantly expressed neuronal nAChRs. Co-expression of hric3 with both α4β2 and α3β4 produced marked inhibition of activity, down to 1.5 and 55%, respectively, as compared with controls without hric3 (Fig. 3C). Current kinetics observed with α3β4 nAChRs were not altered by the presence of hric3 (Fig. 3A), and ACh doseresponse curves were also similar (not shown), indicating that inhibition was not due to a decreased affinity for ACh. These results suggest inhibitory interaction of hRIC3 with these two heteromeric nAChRs. Such inhibition was not seen in C. elegans, where all four nAChRs examined required RIC-3 for their activity (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It thus appears that humans differ from C. elegans in having a more specialized role for hRIC3 in cholinergic transmission. In fact, these differences extend to the effect of hRIC3 on other ligand-gated receptors. Thus, co-expression of hRIC-3 with 5-HT3 receptors produced almost total inhibition of currents elicited by serotonin (Fig. 3, D and E). By contrast, another homomeric receptor, the α1 GlyR, showed no differences in glycine-dependent whole-cell currents (Fig. 3, D and E). Complex Expression Pattern of the hric3 Locus—To validate expression of hric3 in brain, we used a commercially available multitissue Northern blot (Fig. 4). AY326435, a full-length cDNA coding for the hric3 homolog, is 2.9 kb in length. A 394-bp probe from the first two exons of hric3 identifies such a transcript in excitable tissues, muscle, brain, and heart. However, this same probe also identifies additional transcripts that are expressed in non-excitable tissues. To understand the nature of these transcripts, we analyzed EST and mRNA sequences available in the databases. Indeed, the human genome project identified multiple mRNA sequences encoded by this locus. (a) Sequence BC022455 (hypothetical protein FLJ1608) is identical to the sequence of AY326435 except for the absence of3bpatthe5′-end of exon 4 (leading to the absence of a single serine at this site), a difference that may be attributed to editing and alternative splicing (Fig. 5A) (16Grauso M. Reenan R.A. Culetto E. Sattelle D.B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1519-1533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the transcript encoding for this alternative isoform is the same as AY326435. Thus, it is not clear which of these transcripts contributes to the 2.9-kb band seen in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. (b) Transcript AK021670 is 1.5 kb encoding for a soluble coiled-coil domain (Fig. 5B). The expression pattern of this isoform is presently unclear since probing with the entire hric3 open reading frame (1.2-kb probe, not shown) or the first two exons alone (Figs. 4 and 5B, the AK021670 transcript starts in the second intron) revealed the same transcripts. Thus, this transcript may be rare or may co-migrate with another transcript. (c) Transcript AL832601 is 5.2 kb encoding for the first membrane-spanning domain spliced directly to the C terminus (Fig. 5C). A transcript of the same size as AL832601 is strongly expressed in the pancreas. (d) The transcript corresponding to ESTs AY326436 (prostate) and BI832705 (pancreas and spleen) is a product of read-through into the second intron, thus encoding a truncated protein coding for the two trans-membrane domains only. Length of this transcript is not known since the available cDNA appears to be incomplete (Fig. 5D).Fig. 5Multiple isoforms encoded by the hric3 locus. A, isoforms encoded by clones BC022455 and AY326435, both 2.9 kb in length with one difference: the absence in BC022455, or the presence in AY326435, of a single serine that is boxed. B, an isoform encoded by clone AK021670, 1.5 kb in length, coding for the coiled-coil domain only. C, an isoform encoded by clone AL832601, 5.2 kb in length, coding for the first transmembrane domain spliced directly to the N terminus. D, an isoform encoded by clone AY326436, coding for a two-transmembrane domain-only protein. cDNAs encoding for this transcript are incomplete; thus, the length of the transcript encoding for this isoform is unknown. In all cases, lines represent transmembrane domains, dotted lines represent coiled-coil domains, arrowheads represent the site of intron/exon boundary, and double lines represent sequences that are not found in AY326435.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The complex expression pattern of the hric3 locus is not unusual as others have shown that mammalian loci encode for multiple transcripts and have suggested that many of these transcripts are non-functional (17Mallya M. Campbell R.D. Aguado B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting to speculate on the roles of these isoforms, if functional, since their differential expression could produce complex regulatory interactions. For example, the soluble coiled-coil domain may compete with the membrane-bound coiled-coil for interacting proteins, thereby inhibiting its activity. Localization of ric3 Transcripts in Mouse Brain—In humans, expression of hric3 transcripts is seen in many tissues, and hric3 has diverse effects on ligand-gated ion channel expression. Thus, detailed analysis of the distribution of ric3 is important to identify its in vivo targets. For this purpose, we used a mouse probe, encompassing the second membrane domain and the coiled-coil domain, for in situ analysis on mouse brain. Using this probe, we could detect a low signal from most regions of the brain and a stronger signal from few isolated regions: the CA1–CA3 region in the hippocampus (Fig. 6, A and B), the deep nuclei and the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum (Fig. 6, C and D), and the superior colliculus (not shown). These three regions overlap with regions of high α7 expression (18Dominguez del toro E. Juis J.M. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Criado M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 349: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), enabling interaction in vivo between the two proteins. However, it is interesting to note that not all α7-expressing regions express high levels of ric3, as seen for the dentate gyrus (Fig. 6, A and B). Although we first identified ric-3 as coding for a novel protein with no similarity to any other characterized proteins in the databases (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), here we show that ric-3 actually belongs to an evolutionarily conserved gene family. This conservation is also functional since the human homolog hric3, like the C. elegans ric-3, enhances whole-cell current amplitudes for some nAChR. In C. elegans ric-3 is required for cholinergic transmission mediated by the neuronal DEG-3/DES-2, the body muscle levamisole-sensitive, the body muscle nicotine-sensitive, and the pharyngeal-muscle EAT-2 nAChRs. These receptors differ in their subunit composition, function, and pharmacology. Moreover, RIC-3 is capable of enhancing peak current amplitudes elicited by the rat α7 nAChR in Xenopus oocytes. This apparent lack of discrimination between different nAChRs suggests that RIC-3-mediated effects depend on nAChR-specific domains, common to different receptor subtypes, and therefore likely to be conserved in evolution (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human counterpart of ric-3, hric3, enhances the peak whole-cell current amplitudes elicited by both the C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2 receptor and the human and rat α7 receptors. However, co-expression with the human α4β2 and α3β4 receptors leads to reduction in whole-cell current amplitudes, suggesting that the interaction between ric-3 homologs and members of the nAChR family was modified during evolution. Similar effects are also observed when the C. elegans ric-3 is used instead of hric3 (data not shown), which may indicate that potential structural variations within the mammalian nAChR family are responsible for the different behavior of the α3β4 and the α4β2 nAChR sub-types. Interestingly, the actions of hric3 appear to extend to other members of the same ligand-gated receptor gene super-family. In this case, dramatic differences are also observed since expression of the closely related 5-HT3 receptors is totally inhibited by hric3, whereas no modification in expression of the more distantly related α1 glycine receptor is observed. 2For more information, see www.pasteur.fr/recherche/banques/LGIC/catphylogen.html. These differential effects could be explained in several ways. One possibility is that formation of a complex with hric3 (mediated by a conserved domain within all the affected receptor subunits) leads to arrest of maturation if it is not followed by additional interactions of the receptor subunits with hric3. These additional interactions, produced with α7 nAChRs but not with α3β4 or α4β2 nAChRs, as well as with 5-HT3 receptors, are likely to be mediated by non-conserved domains within the former subunits. Another possibility suggests that formation of “productive complexes” depends, in addition to a conserved interaction of hric3 with receptor subunits, on yet unidentified proteins that interact differentially with mammalian members of this gene superfamily. Both possibilities suggest that interaction of “non-compatible” receptor subunits with hric3 leads to a “dead-end” complex incapable of further maturation and adds a potentially new mechanism for regulating ligand-gated receptor expression. Here it is important to note that glutamate receptors, which are members of a different ligand-gated receptor superfamily, and α1 GlyR, a distant relative of the nAChRs, are not affected by hric3. These last results suggest specificity of the effects of hric3 on nAChRs and closely related receptors, a specificity that is similar to what is seen in C. elegans. The RIC-3 family is a conserved gene family effecting nAChRs maturation. The exact role of these proteins in nAChR maturation is yet unclear. In C. elegans, we showed that RIC-3 is found inside the cells, probably on endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and not at synapses. We also showed that in its absence, transport of the DEG-3 protein to the processes is greatly reduced (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a result consistent with the effects that we now show on α7 surface expression. These results are consistent with a role for RIC-3 in folding or assembly, processes occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum, or in trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum. We now show that ric-3 belongs to a conserved gene family. All members of this family are relatively small proteins (350–400 amino acids), showing no homology to enzymes likely to modify nAChRs. Conservation within this family is limited to having two transmembrane domains, separated by a proline-rich spacer and followed by a coiled-coil domain. Structure predictions suggest that both the N terminus and the C terminus coiled-coil are cytosolic. Based on this analysis, we suggest a role for RIC-3 proteins as adaptor proteins, bringing together receptors and proteins needed for their maturation. We also suggest that multiple domains within the RIC-3 homologs mediate interactions with components of such a “maturation complex.” Coiled-coil domains have been implicated in protein-protein interactions (20Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The prolines within the spacer between the two transmembrane domains, some of which appear at conserved positions, may provide a structural scaffold on which to anchor interacting proteins. The membrane-spanning domains may also mediate protein-protein interactions. Here it is interesting to note that the second transmembrane domain in RIC-3 homologs shows conservation beyond what is needed for traversing the membrane. For example, within this domain are found a proline and a glycine that show 100% conservation. Also, the membrane-spanning domains of ligand-gated receptors are relatively well conserved and may form the conserved recognition domain for RIC-3 homologs. Thus, interactions within the membrane may bring together receptor subunits and the RIC-3 homologs, whereas other RIC-3 domains may be needed for additional interactions (the non-conserved interaction suggested above) and for interactions with yet unidentified proteins, thus forming a multiprotein maturation complex. Analysis of transcripts encoded by the hric3 locus shows multiple transcripts resulting from editing, alternative splicing, and alternative promoters. These transcripts are differentially expressed in many tissues, including non-excitable ones. At this stage, the relevance of this complexity is unclear. Three options are possible. First, these additional transcripts produce functional proteins that differentially affect the machinery that matures nAChRs. Second, these transcripts produce functional proteins whose function is unrelated to nAChR maturation. Third, these shorter isoforms are non-functional, as suggested by Mallya et al. (17Mallya M. Campbell R.D. Aguado B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is important to note that expression of these transcripts in non-excitable tissues and in heart muscle is not sufficient evidence for roles other than regulation of nAChRs, as expression and function of nAChRs was shown in many tissues including non-excitable tissues (21Sharma G. Vijayaraghavan S. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, ric-3 is a central player in cholinergic transmission mediated by nAChRs. In its absence, cholinergic transmission in both muscles and neurons is severely compromised. Here we show that in mammals, the role of hric3 is likely to be more general and heterogeneous. However, the complex expression of the hric3 locus, as well as the lack of knowledge on functional expression of hric3 and its isoforms, preclude conclusions as to the role of hric3 in nAChR-mediated transmission in humans. With these reservations in mind, a likely interpretation of our data is that hric3 regulates expression of α7 receptors, which are known to depend on host-specific factors for their expression (19Sweileh W. Wenberg K. Xue J. Forsayeth J. Hardy S. Loring R.H. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, mouse brain regions expressing high levels of ric3 transcripts are known to express α7, thus enabling an interaction between the two proteins (18Dominguez del toro E. Juis J.M. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Criado M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 349: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It is also possible to speculate that the differential interactions of hric3 with human ligand-gated ion channels are exploited in vivo to differentially regulate expression of these receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2055489321,"p38 MAPK has been implicated in the response to cancer therapy. To determine whether the activation of p38 MAPK could be specific to cancer therapy, we investigated the activation of p38 MAPK in response to several chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin and taxol in several human cell lines. Activation of p38 MAPK was measured after exposure to several chemotherapeutic agents, using specific phosphoantibodies. Only cisplatin was able to activate p38 MAPK in all the cell lines tested. Furthermore, other platinum compounds such as transplatin and platinum (IV) chloride can induce activation of p38 MAPK. The kinetics of this activation is a key event in the biological role of p38 MAPK in response to cisplatin, as we conclude from the differences observed after treatment with transplatin and cisplatin. The p38 MAPK activation is independent of the origin or genetic alterations of the cell lines and seems to be mediated through both upstream activators MKK6 and MKK3. Although the isoforms α/β are mainly activated, we also demonstrated that other members of the p38 MAPK family were susceptible to activation by cisplatin when they were overexpressed in 293 T. Finally, pretreatment with specific inhibitors (SB 203580 and SKF 86002) induces a resistant phenotype in response to cisplatin. Furthermore, low activation of this SAPK pathway correlates with a resistant phenotype as demonstrated in our experimental model of head and neck cancer. Therefore, we conclude that the p38 MAPK pathway is a specific target for cisplatin-based therapy with clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2167495642,"A second group of proteorhodopsin-encoding genes (blue-absorbing proteorhodopsin, BPR) differing by 20–30% in predicted primary structure from the first-discovered green-absorbing (GPR) group has been detected in picoplankton from Hawaiian deep sea water. Here we compare BPR and GPR absorption spectra, photochemical reactions, and proton transport activity. The photochemical reaction cycle of Hawaiian deep ocean BPR in cells is 10-fold slower than that of GPR with very low accumulation of a deprotonated Schiff base intermediate in cells and exhibits mechanistic differences, some of which are due to its glutamine residue rather than leucine at position 105. In contrast to GPR and other characterized microbial rhodopsins, spectral titrations of BPR indicate that a second titratable group, in addition to the retinylidene Schiff base counterion Asp-97, modulates the absorption spectrum near neutral pH. Mutant analysis confirms that Asp-97 and Glu-108 are proton acceptor and proton donor, respectively, in retinylidene Schiff base proton transfer reactions during the BPR photocycle as previously shown for GPR, but BPR contains an alternative acceptor evident in its D97N mutant, possibly the same as the second titratable group modulating the absorption spectrum. BPR, similar to GPR, carries out outward light-driven proton transport in Escherichia coli vesicles but with a reduced translocation rate attributable to its slower photocycle. In energized E. coli cells at physiological pH, the net effect of BPR photocycling is to generate proton currents dominated by a triggered proton influx, rather than efflux as observed with GPR-containing cells. Reversal of the proton current with the K+-ionophore valinomycin supports that the influx is because of voltagegated channels in the E. coli cell membrane. These observations demonstrate diversity in photochemistry and mechanism among proteorhodopsins. Calculations of photon fluence rates at different ocean depths show that the difference in photocycle rates between GPR and BPR as well as their different absorption maxima may be explained as an adaptation to the different light intensities available in their respective marine environments. Finally, the results raise the possibility of regulatory (i.e. sensory) rather than energy harvesting functions of some members of the proteorhodopsin family.

Nature. 2001; 411: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that GPR functions as a light-driven proton pump photoenergizing SAR86 cells in their natural environment. A variant group (clade II) of proteorhodopsin genes differing by ∼22% in predicted primary structure from the clade I group has been detected in the Antarctic and deep ocean plankton from Hawaiian waters (1Béjà O.

A second clade II gene (from Antarctica) matches exactly these absorption properties when expressed in E. coli. 2W.-W. Wang, O. A. Sineshchekov, E. N. Spudich, and J. L. Spudich, unpublished data. Here we characterize the Hawaiian deep water BPR transport, spectroscopic, and photochemical reactions. We observe striking differences between the Hawaiian 75-meter BPR and the Monterey Bay GPR, a comparison with which provides insight into proteorhodopsin diversity in mechanism and possibly physiological function. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For simplicity, the Monterey Bay protein eBAC31A08 is designated GPR and Hawaiian Ocean Time Station variant HOT75m4 is designated BPR in this report. Mutants BPR_D97N and BPR_E108Q were constructed using two-step PCR (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) following the procedure described for BPR_Q105L and GPR_L105Q (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of Proteorhodopsins in E. coli Cells—GPR, BPR, and their mutants were expressed in E. coli strain UT5600 using plasmid pBAD-Topo as described previously (4Béjà O. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Suzuki M.T. Hadd A. Nguyen L.P. Jovanovich S.B. Gates C.M. Feldman R.A. Spudich J.L. Spudich E.N. DeLong E.F. Science. 2000; 289: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of transformants were diluted 1:50 and grown to 0.4 absorbance units at 600 nm at 30 °C. Cells were induced with 0.2% (+)-l-arabinose for3hat30 °C. To obtain protein for flash photolysis and proton transport measurements, all-trans-retinal was added to a final concentration of 5 μm with the arabinose. For measurement of retinal-generated absorption spectra, the apoproteins were induced without the addition of retinal. Preparation of Cell Membranes for Retinal-generated Spectra Measurements—Cells were disrupted by sonication, unlysed cells and large debris were removed by low speed centrifugation, and cell membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 180,000 × g for 1 h. The membranes were resuspended with 100 mm sodium acetate, MES, potassium phosphate (KPi), and Tris-HCl buffers at different pH values between 4.5 and 9, and retinal-generated absorption spectra were measured by adding all-trans-retinal from an ethanolic solution as described previously (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L.

Proton Pumping Measurements—Right-side-out membrane vesicles were prepared as follows. 100 ml of induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3600 × g for 10 min, resuspended into 10 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20% sucrose. 100 μg (104 units) of lysozyme was added and stirred gently at room temperature. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 3600 × g for 15 min at room temperature and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (100 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgSO4, 20% sucrose, and 4 mg of DNase) and injected using a 1-ml syringe (18-gauge needle) into 500 ml of a rapidly stirring solution of 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, at 37 °C. After 15 min of gently stirring at 37 °C, Na-EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm and stirred for another 15 min, after which MgSO4 was added to a final concentration of 15 mm, followed by 15 min of stirring. Cell debris was removed at 3600 × g for 10 min, and vesicles were collected at 16,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm KPi, pH 7.0, and 10 mm MgSO4. For the measurement of proton pumping of cells, the E. coli cells with expressed proteorhodopsins were pelleted at 3600 × g for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with unbuffered solution (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 100 μm CaCl2) at room temperature. Samples were illuminated with 100 watts/m2 at 500 + 20 nm using a 200-watt Tungsten halogen lamp in combination with wide-band interference and heat-protecting (CuSO4 and glass) filters. The pH was monitored with a computerized Beckman F72 pH meter. Flash Photolysis—Flash-induced absorption changes were measured on a laboratory-constructed cross-beam flash photolysis system (similar to that used in Ref. 12Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The actinic flash was from a Nd-YAG pulse laser (Continuum, Surelight I, 532 nm, 6 ns, 40 mJ). Signals from the photomultiplier were digitized by a DIGIDATA 1320A at 20 μs/point and stored in a PC using the Clampex 8.0 program (both from Axon Instruments). 20–100 signals obtained with a 10-s flash interval were averaged. To minimize excitation artifacts, equal amounts of signals with the measuring beam blocked (scattered light) were averaged and subtracted from the measuring beam-monitored signals. The Clampfit 8.0 program (Axon Instruments) was used for data analysis. For flash photolysis, membranes were prepared as described above and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 9 and E. coli cells with expressed proteorhodopsins were pelleted at 3600 × g for 10 min at room temperature and washed and suspended with 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 9. Absorption Spectroscopy and pKa of the Acid and Alkaline Form Transition—Retinal-generated absorption spectra of proteorhodopsin apoproteins in E. coli membrane were measured by difference spectroscopy as described previously (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14138-14145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After adding the retinal solutions, the spectra were recorded with an SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer every 10 min for 1.5 h, after which no further absorption changes occurred. The spectra were used for calculating the pKa of the transition as follows. The λmax at different pH values were measured according to the reconstitution spectra of the membrane with proteorhodopsin apoproteins (“opsins”). The position of the absorption maxima of the mixtures of alkaline and acidic forms at different pH values does not depend linearly on the relative concentrations of the two forms because of different structures and half-bands of their spectra. For calculating the pKa of the transition, a calibration curve, which relates the relative concentration of alkaline and acidic forms with the position of the absorption maximum of their mixture, was calculated by mathematical summation of absorption spectra of pure acid and alkaline forms with corresponding coefficients. The corrected ratio of protonated and non-protonated forms at different pH values was determined using this calibration curve from the position of absorption maximum of their mixture and fitted with functions containing one or two pKa components (y = A/(1 + 10pH–p Ka). Two Titratable Groups Control BPR Absorption Spectra— One of the most notable distinguishing properties of retinal as a chromophore is the large variation of its absorption spectrum depending on interaction with the apoprotein (“spectral tuning”) (13Birge R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 293-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 14Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 112: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In rhodopsins, retinal is covalently attached to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue, forming a protonated retinylidene Schiff base. In methanol, a protonated retinylidene Schiff base exhibits a λmax of 440 nm. Typically, the protein microenvironment shifts the λmax (the “opsin shift” (15Yan B. Spudich J.L. Mazur P. Vunnam S. Derguini F. Nakanishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29668-29670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) to longer wavelengths, e.g. to 490 nm in BPR and 525 nm in GPR. Microbial rhodopsins in general exhibit two spectral forms in a proton-dependent equilibrium: a blue-shifted alkaline species and red-shifted acidic species. The two species differ in absorption maximum by ∼20–40 nm depending on the pigment and conditions of assay. In bacteriorhodopsin (16Subramaniam S. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25730-25733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sensory rhodopsins I (17Olson K.D. Zhang X.N. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3185-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and II (18Zhu J. Spudich E.N. Alam M. Spudich J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and GPR (6Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the spectral shift is attributable to the ionization state of the primary protonated retinylidene Schiff base counterion (Asp-85 in bacteriorhodopsin, Asp-97 in proteorhodopsins), because mutating this residue to the isosteric asparagine in each of these pigments eliminates the pH-induced shift and stabilizes the absorption spectrum in the wild-type acidic form. We titrated BPR in E. coli membranes to determine its alkaline and acidic spectra and the pKa of the spectral transition. Acid induces a shift of 46 nm (Fig. 1), a larger shift than the 20 nm seen in GPR (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and a loss of vibrational fine structure in the spectrum as observed for sensory rhodopsin II (19Takahashi T. Yan B. Mazur P. Derguini F. Nakanishi K. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8467-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The GPR spectral transition fits well to a single pKa of 7.2 (Fig 2A); however, a second component is evident in the BPR titration according to hyperbolic fits to the data that yields a diprotic fit with pKa values 6.2 and 7.8 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, unlike other microbial rhodopsins tested, the mutation of the expected Schiff base counterion Asp-97 to Asn does not completely eliminate an acid-induced shift but rather a 10-nm red-shift (Fig. 1) with a pKa of 7.1 (Fig. 2C) occurs in the BPR_D97N mutant pigment. This unique behavior among microbial rhodopsins indicates that an additional titratable group modulates the environment of the chromophore in BPR.Fig. 2Titration of the relative concentration of acid versus alkaline forms of GPR (A), BPR (B), and BPR_D97N (C). The percentages of red-shifted form were determined from the positions of absorption maxima using a calibration curve (see “Materials and Methods”), and pKa values were determined by fitting of the data with equations containing one or two components (y = A/(1 + 10pH–p Ka). The pH dependence in BPR cannot be fitted with single component dependence (shown as a dashed line in B). Corresponding pKa values are shown in the figures. The amplitudes of the two components in B are approximately equal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Note that the diprotic titration behavior of BPR differs from the two pKa spectral transitions reported for bacteriorhodopsin (20Balashov S.P. Govindjee R. Imasheva E.S. Misra S. Ebrey T.G. Feng Y. Crouch R.K. Menick D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8820-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and sensory rhodopsin I (21Chen X. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The diprotic behavior in those cases are attributable to the dependence of the pKa of the retinylidene Schiff base counterion aspartyl carboxylate (Asp-85 in BR and Asp-76 in SRI, which correspond to Asp-97 in BPR) on the titration of another residue in the protein. In those cases, substitution of the aspartyl counterion residue with asparagine eliminates the spectral shift entirely and the aspartyl counterion-independent shift evident in BPR_D97N (Fig. 2C) does not occur. BPR Photochemical Reactions Are an Order of Magnitude Slower than in GPR—Laser flash photolysis of the BPR pigment in E. coli cells reveals major differences in kinetics of the BPR photocycle from that of GPR (Fig. 3). In cells, laser flash-induced absorption difference spectra in the range of 350–600 nm show the depletion and return of the unphotolysed state BPR490 accompanied by the rise and decay of an O (red-shifted) intermediate at wavelengths of >500 nm and very little changes at <400 nm where a Schiff-base deprotonated M intermediate is expected to appear (Fig. 3A). The return of BPR490 absorption (Fig. 3B) governed by the decay of the O species (Fig. 3C) is >10-fold slower than that for GPR in cells under the same conditions. In contrast to GPR, the blue-shifted M intermediate accumulates in BPR in very low concentrations with maximum amplitude of ≤7% of the depletion of the unphotolysed state. This low extent of accumulation and high scattering renders the signal/noise ratio very poor below 400 nm in whole cell preparations. Furthermore, the appearance of M is masked above ∼380 nm by the depletion of the unphotolysed state. In membranes, we detected the rise and decay of BPR M at wave-lengths below 380 nm, although its kinetics is difficult to determine because of perturbation by a depletion of absorption in the near-UV region (data not shown). Clear formation of M was observed in purified BPR in dodecyl maltoside micelles and in membranes of the BPR_E108Q mutant (Fig. 4). Asp-97 and Glu-108 Function as a Proton Acceptor and Donor, Respectively, for Schiff Base Proton Transfer Reactions during the BPR Photocycle—The appearance of absorption changes near 370 nm is diagnostic of an unprotonated retinylidene Schiff base in this BPR intermediate. In GPR, Asp-97 is the proton acceptor from the Schiff base in the corresponding photocycle transition and M formation in GPR_D97N is essentially completely blocked (6Dioumaev A.K. Brown L.S. Shih J. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). BPR_D97N shows a 7-fold reduced accumulation of M, confirming a similar role of Asp-97 as a proton acceptor in BPR (Fig. 4A). However, some M formation is still evident in BPR_D97N, indicating that an alternative proton acceptor residue is present in this mutant. Possibly, the titratable group that influences the absorption maximum of BPR_D97N is the alternative proton acceptor. In GPR, Glu-108 is the proton donor to the Schiff base for the proton transfer occurring during the transition of the M intermediate to later red-shifted states as evidenced by a greatly retarded M decay in GPR_E108Q. The corresponding photocycle transition in BPR is also greatly slowed in GPR_E108Q, indicating a similar role as a Schiff base proton donor for this residue (Fig. 4B). As noted above, in the wild type BPR photocycle. most accumulation is in the red-shifted O state without marked accumulation of M (Figs. 3A and 4B). In BPR_E108Q, the reversed situation was observed, i.e. the dominant intermediate is M with negligible accumulation of the O state (Fig. 4B). This accumulation allows determination of the absorption maximum of the M state of BPR_E108Q, which is ∼390 nm (data not shown), slightly shorter than that of the M intermediate in GPR. The Spectral Tuning Switch Residue at Position 105 Modulates the Photocycle—By site-specific mutagenesis of residues in the predicted retinal-binding pockets of both pigments, we have found that a single residue substitution (L105Q in GPR versus Q105L in BPR) nearly completely interconverts the absorption spectra of the two pigments. GPR_L105Q is blue-shifted and gains vibrational fine structure, whereas BPR_Q105L is shifted to green absorption and loses fine structure in its spectrum (5Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition to functioning as a spectral tuning switch, the interconversion of residue 105 between GPR and BPR has pronounced effects on the photocycles of the pigments. As noted above, the photocycle of GPR is ∼10 times faster than that of BPR with evident M accumulation unlike BPR when monitored at 400 nm (Fig. 5). The mutation L105Q in GPR slows the photocycle to a value typical of BPR with no M signal at 400 nm. The reciprocal mutation Q105L in BPR does not accelerate the photocycle but does cause clear accumulation of M in the 400-nm trace. Therefore, the residue at position 105 acts as a switch for both spectral and photochemical properties of GPR and BPR, but differences in addition to that at position 105 must contribute to the relatively rapid photocycle of GPR. BPR-mediated Proton Fluxes in E. coli Vesicles and Cells— Previous work has shown that GPR exhibits light-induced electrogenic ejection of protons from E. coli cells (4Béjà O. Aravind L.

Nature. 2001; 411: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Here we examine the transport activity of GPR and BPR both in E. coli right-side-out vesicles and cells. In E. coli vesicles, both GRP and BPR exhibit outward light-induced proton transport (Fig. 6A). At similar pigment concentrations of GPR and BPR, protons are ejected at a slower rate in BPR, as expected from its slower photocycle rate. In agreement with a study of GPR proton transport (7Dioumaev A.K. Wang J.M. Balint Z. Varo G. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6582-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we do not observe the inverse direction of pumping by either rhodopsin under acidic pH in vesicles or in intact cells, contrary to what has been reported for GPR in a model system (8Friedrich T. Geibel S. Kalmbach R. Chizhov I. Ataka K. Heberle J. Engelhard M. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 821-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). At pH 6, cells with GPR and BPR both carry out light-driven proton ejection (data not shown); however, at pH 7, there is a net proton influx for the cells with BPR upon illumination (Fig. 6B). GPR photoexcitation induces proton efflux, but an initial transient net proton influx is observed following illumination. E. coli cells without proteorhodopsin do not exhibit light-induced proton fluxes under our conditions. Our interpretation is that the pumping by BPR triggers the opening of voltage-gated proton channels in the E. coli membrane, which results in proton influx driven by the generated and preexisting electrochemical potential of protons across the membranes of the energized E. coli cells. A similar interpretation was advanced for light-induced bacteriorhodopsin-mediated inward proton fluxes in Halobacterium membranes attributed to voltage gating of an H+-ATPase and Na+/H+ antiporter (22Helgerson S.L. Stoeckenius W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We examined proton fluxes in E. coli cells treated with valinomycin and K+, which eliminates the electrical component of the H+ electrochemical gradient generated by the outwardly directed H+ transport by BPR. Confirming our interpretation, the direction of proton fluxes induced by BPR at pH 7 is reversed (i.e. converted to proton efflux) by K+/valinomycin (Fig. 6C). Elimination of all of the BPR-mediated proton fluxes by the proton-ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone (10 μm) confirms that the proton fluxes are not passive currents responding to electrogenic transport of another ion by BPR (data not shown). We explain the different proton fluxes from BPR and GPR photocycling as the result of the slower rate of proton ejection of BPR. In BPR-containing cells, the proton currents are dominated by the triggered proton influx through voltage-gated channels, whereas in GPR-containing cells, the triggered influx is overcome by the greater proton ejection rate of the pigment. Confirming this interpretation, low light intensity illumination of GPR, which reduces the rate of proton ejection to that of BPR at high intensity, results in a proton influx response similar to that of BPR in Fig. 6B. Biological Significance of GPR and BPR Variation—The difference in photocycle rates between GPR and BPR and their different absorption maxima may be explained as an adaptation to the different light intensities in their respective marine environments based on measured spectral distributions of intensities of solar illumination at the ocean surface and at various depths (23Jerlov N.G. Monin A.S. Marine Optics. Elsevier, Amsterdam1976: 231Google Scholar). At solar radiation intensity of 1.5 watts·m–2·nm–1 at 525 nm (the absorption maximum of GPR) on the ocean surface under brightest conditions using a 95-nm half-bandwidth of GPR and 2 A2 cross-sectional area, we calculate that 1 photon/proteorhodopsin molecule would be available for absorption for each ∼150 ms. During this time, a population of GPR molecules reaches 98% recovery (Fig. 3B) and thus the GPR photocycle rate is well matched to the incident fluence rate. At 75 m, the depth at which the BPR gene was identified, the solar intensity at this wavelength is ∼50 times less and the quanta available for absorption through the entire absorption spectrum are even smaller due to the very sharp attenuation in light at wavelengths above 500 nm. Because of the shift of solar radiation to the blue-width depth, the spectral shift to 488 nm in BPR compensates this decrease in available light energy >5-fold, but at most 1 quantum/1.5 s/BPR molecule would be available for absorption. Matching this photon fluence rate would require a 10-fold slower photocycle in BPR than in GPR as we observe (Fig. 3). Hence, there is no selective pressure for a photocycle faster than that of BPR at that depth. BPR may function to energize cells by light-driven electrogenic proton pumping as does GPR. However, we do not expect a significant contribution of solar energy capture from BPR, which is limited by the low light intensities in deep waters. In E. coli, at neutral pH evidently the initial inward movement of protons, observed in both GPR and BPR, could not be overcome by BPR-driven proton extrusion from the cell even at saturating light intensities because of its slow cycling. This observation may indicate a regulatory rather than energy-harvesting function of BPR, which may be based on light-induced opening of proton channels in response to the initial increase in membrane electrical potential and dissipation of preexisting gradients. A possible function might be modulation of cell physiology depending on light intensity variations due to daily or seasonal changes or depth. Because little is known regarding the cells producing BPR, we cannot exclude that BPR may be coupled by protein-protein interaction as are haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsins with a transducer component not present in the E. coli membrane. In this case, BPR may not exhibit even its relatively slow light-driven proton transport in nature if its transport activity is inhibited by transducer interaction as is the case with the haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsins (24Bogomolni R.A.

https://openalex.org/W1997903864,"Mammalian LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) is involved in reorganization of actin cytoskeleton through inactivating phosphorylation of the ADF family protein cofilin, which depolymerizes actin filaments. Maintenance of the actin dynamics in an ordered fashion is essential for stabilization of cell shape or promotion of cell motility depending on the cell type. These are the two key phenomena that may become altered during acquisition of the metastatic phenotype by cancer cells. Here we show that LIMK1 is overexpressed in prostate tumors and in prostate cancer cell lines, that the concentration of phosphorylated cofilin is higher in metastatic prostate cancer cells, and that a partial reduction of LIMK1 altered cell proliferation by arresting cells at G2/M, changed cell shape, and abolished the invasiveness of metastatic prostate cancer cells. We also show that the ectopic expression of LIMK1 promotes acquisition of invasive phenotype by the benign prostate epithelial cells. Our data provide evidence of a novel role of LIMK1 in regulating cell division and invasive property of prostate cancer cells and indicate that the effect is not mediated by phosphorylation of cofilin. Our study correlates with the recent observations showing a metastasis-associated chromosomal gain on 7q11.2 in prostate cancer, suggesting a possible gain in LIMK1 DNA (7q11.23).

LIMK1 gene is expressed predominantly in brain and in developing neural tissues (2Bernard D. Geniatsus S. Kannourakis G. Dringen R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1159-1171PubMed Google Scholar), and its deletion (microdeletion of chromosome 7q11.23) is typical for Williams syndrome (3Wouters C.H. Meijers-Heijboer H.J. Eussen B.J. van der Heide A.A. van Luijk R.B. van Drunen E. Beverloo B.B. Visscher F. Van Hemel J.O. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 102: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cofilin, one of the actin-binding proteins, considered to be a potent regulator of the actin dynamics (4Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) by means of its activity in F-actin depolymerization, is the only known substrate of LIMK1. The function of cofilin is inhibited by phosphorylation at the Ser-3 residue (5Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) by LIMK1, which leads to accumulation of F-actin. The catalytic activity of LIMK1 is regulated by distinct members of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), which controls actin filament dynamics and focal adhesions assembly in response to extra- and intracellular stimuli. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 induce formation of stress fibers, assembly of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, and regulation of filopodial protrusions, respectively (6Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). LIMK1 has been shown to mediate specifically Rac-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and focal adhesion complexes (5Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 7Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K.

Rac-induced activation of LIMK1 is mediated by PAK1, which phosphorylates LIMK1 on its Thr508 residue (9Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Other studies also proposed that Rhoand Cdc42-induced cytoskeletal changes are mediated through phosphorylation of LIMK1 by Rho-dependent protein kinase ROCK (10Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and Cdc42-regulated protein kinase PAK4 (11Dan C. Kelly A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23092-23096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The non-catalytic domain of LIMK1 contains two tandem repeats of a LIM motif, a putative zinc binding motif, and a PDZ domain, which contains two tandem nuclear exit signal sequences (7Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). LIMK1 also contains a nuclear localization signal-like basic cluster sequence. The non-catalytic domain of LIMK1 has been shown to have effects on cytoskeleton reorganization independent of its kinase activity. Specific regions of the non-catalytic domain (LIM or PDZ) inhibit neurite outgrowth in differentiating PC12 cells in response to Ras, neuronal growth factor (NGF) or a ROCK inhibitor without altering endogenous LIMK1 activity (13Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Higuchi O. Amano T. Yang N. Mizuno K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the non-catalytic domain of LIMK1 is involved in regulating cellular processes though protein-protein interaction. LIMK1 also physically interacts through its LIM domain with the cytoplasmic tail of neuregulins, a family of transmembrane proteins that functions as receptor tyrosine kinase ligands. These proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of synapse formation and maintenance, cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and neuronal migration (15Wang J.Y. Frenzel K.E. Wen D. Falls D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20525-20534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Deletion experiments have shown that the lack of LIM and PDZ domains enhances the effect of LIMK1 on actin cytoskeleton (16Edwards D. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of a kinase-inactive form of the protein blocked the effect of the native LIMK1 (5Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). These findings suggest an inhibitory role of the non-catalytic domain in the regulation of the kinase activity of LIMK1. Reorganization of cytoskeleton is an essential feature of motility, detachment, and invasion of cancer cells. Individual members of the Rho family, such as Rac and Cdc42, induce distinct actin remodeling events, work together at the leading edge of the cell, and coordinate lamellipodial and filopodial extensions, whereas Rho activates accumulation of stress fibers through activation of ROCK (17Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). Formation and stabilization of actin filaments are the key events downstream of Rac and Cdc42, which provide the protrusive force for cellular extensions at the leading edge of the migratory cells (18Small J.V. Rottner K. Kaverina I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Seemingly, these events are critical for the invasive behavior of the cancer cells, as the inhibition of Rho kinase activity has been shown to reduce invasive progress of prostate cancer cells in vivo (19Somlyo A.V. Bradshaw D. Ramos S. Murphy C. Myers C.E. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Rho proteins are activated by growth factor receptors and their ligands, for example, EGF and NGF and their respective receptors erbB2 and Trk. Cellular-erbB2 and Trk are often overexpressed and activated in various types of cancers including prostate cancer (20Yu D. Wang S. Dulski K.M. Tsai C.M. Nicolson G.L. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3260-3266PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morote J. Torres I Caceres C. Vallejo C. Schwartz S. Reventos J. Int. J.

Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1887-1898PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-erbB2 was shown to enhance the invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells (20Yu D. Wang S. Dulski K.M. Tsai C.M. Nicolson G.L. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3260-3266PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, NGF and Trk expressions in prostate cancer cells coincide with transformation to a malignant phenotype capable of invading along the perineural space and extracapsular metastasis to a distant site (23Walch E.T. Marchetti D. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As evident from membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation, EGF- and NGF-induced increased invasion of prostate tumor cells is mediated through Rac (24Malliri A Symons M Hennigan R.F. Hurlstone A.F. Lamb R.F Wheeler T. Ozanne B.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Rac-mediated activation of actin reorganization is mediated through LIMK1. cDNA microarry and differential display reverse-transcription PCR analyses revealed an up-regulation of LIMK1 mRNA (25Dhanasekaran S.M. Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R. Varambally S. Kurachi K. Pienta K.J. Rubin M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M.

This study reports that LIMK1 is overexpressed in prostate adnocarcinomatous tissues and in malignant prostate cell lines and is essential for the invasive property and growth of prostate cancer cells, and the effect is not mediated through inactivating phosphorylation of cofilin.

PC3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with the open reading frame of the LacZ gene or the antisense cDNA of the coding sequence of LIMK1 (1.94 kilobases), both cloned into an ecdysoneinducible mammalian expression vector (pIND, Invitrogen).

Cells were cotransfected with the vector pVRxR that encodes the subunit of a heterodimer of the ecdysone and the retinoid X receptor to establish stable cell lines (PC3ASL and PC3LacZ) capable of expressing antisense LIMK1 RNA or LacZ when induced with an ecdysone analogue, ponasterone A. Double stable clones were selected using 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). When mentioned, stably transfected cells were continuously induced during the times indicated by adding 5 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen) every 22 h. Immunoblotting, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescence— Total cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE (10-14%) and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-LIMK1 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-cofilin (Cytoskeleton), or anti-phospho-cofilin antibodies (Cell Signaling). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Bio-genesis) was simultaneously used as an internal control. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of normal and malignant human prostate were subjected to a pepsin-based antigen retrieval protocol (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) followed by incubation with anti-LIMK1 antibody. A biotinylated multi-link goat anti-immunoglobulin for mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, and rat was used as the secondary antibody. Positive signals were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the chromogen (BioGenex Multi-Link kit). For indirect immunofluorescence, PC3ASL and PC3LacZ cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass cover slips and continuously induced for 72 h. Cells were permeabilized and dually stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and anti-LIMK1, anti-paxillin (Transduction Laboratories), or anti-MT1-MMP (Cytoskeleton) antibodies. Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody. Fluorescent images were captured in a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. In Vivo Phosphorylation, Expression of Recombinant Protein, and Immunecomplex Kinase Assay—BPH-1 and PC3 cells were cultured in the presence of 1.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 10 h. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-cofilin antibody and protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) using the procedure as described (28Ellis J.G. Davila M. Chakrabarti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1936-1945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the products were resolved in SDS-PAGE (14%). Labeled cofilin was detected by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant cofilin was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged fusion protein by cloning the open reading frame of human cofilin into the T7 polymerase driven pET30Ek/LIC (Novagen) expression vector using specific primers (F, 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGCCTCCGGTGTGGCTG-3′, and R, 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCC GGTTCACAAAGGCTTGCCC-3′). The expression construct was used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Transformed cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C, and the expressed cofilin was purified through a Nickel affinity column (HiTrap Chelating HP columns, Amersham Biosciences). For immune complex kinase assay, LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated from PC3 cells cultured under regular conditions using anti-LIMK1 antibody and protein G-agarose (Sigma) beads. Protein G-agarose beads bound to the immune complex were resuspended in kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 3 nm [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with 10 μg of recombinant cofilin as the substrate (29Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reaction mix was resolved in SDS-PAGE (14%), and phosphorylated cofilin was detected by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. Invasion Assay—Cells were plated in serum-free media (containing ponasterone A for transfected cells) on control and Matrigel-coated membrane containing invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 22 h in a CO2 incubator using 5% fetal bovine serum in the lower chamber as the chemoattractant. Invading cells were stained with Diff-QuickTM stain (DADE) and counted. The percentage of cells that invaded through the Matrigel-coated membranes was calculated by comparison with the cells passed through the membranes in the control chambers. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation, Cell Synchronization, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Asynchronous PC3LacZ and PCASL cells were incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine in the presence or absence of ponasterone A. At different time points after induction, cells were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and lysed using 0.5 n NaOH. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine to DNA was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 5000 TD). For cell cycle analysis, PC3LacZ and PC3ASL cells induced every 22 h were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a double thymidine block by treating them with thymidine (2 mm) for 24 h followed by an 8-h release in fresh growth medium and successive retreatment with thymidine (2 mm) for 16 h. Cells were then released to enter the cell cycle in fresh growth medium and harvested at specified times. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (1%) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed in PBS, permeabilized with saponin (0.25%) in PBS, and treated with RNase (1 mg/ml) at room temperature. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide (400 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (FACScalibur BD Biosciences), and raw data were analyzed using Modfit (BD Biosciences) software. LIMK1 Is Overexpressed in Cancerous Prostate Cells and Tissues and Is Catalytically Active—To confirm the differential expression of LIMK1 in prostate cancer, we monitored the expression profile of LIMK1 in various prostate cell lines and prostate tissues. Our results revealed an increased expression of LIMK1 in highly aggressive metastatic prostate epithelial cells and in some prostatic adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1). The concentration of LIMK1 in some cancerous prostate cells (M21 and M12) increased proportionately with increasing tumorigenic and aggressive properties compared with normal prostate epithelial cells (P69) and BPH-1 cells (Fig. 1a). A ∼2-3-fold higher expression of LIMK1 was noted in tumorigenic (LNCaP and M21) and metastatic (PC3, DU145, and M12) prostate cancer cells compared with BPH-1 and P69 (non-tumorigenic) cells (Fig. 1a). Compared with prostate epithelial cells, the expression of LIMK1 was 5-10-fold higher in the metastatic prostate cancer cells (PC3 and M21) (Fig. 1a). Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical analysis indicated a highly abundant expression of LIMK1 in some cancerous glands in prostatic epithelium (Fig 1b). The expression of LIMK1 in prostate tissues was localized to the basal cells in benign glands (arrows in Fig. 1b, top: middle and right) compared with a widespread staining in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the epithelial cells in cancerous glands (arrows in Fig. 1b, bottom: middle, and right). These results suggest a possible correlation between overexpression of LIMK1 and phenotypic differences in prostate tissues. The abundantly expressed LIMK1 in prostate cancer cells was catalytically competent as immunoprecipitated LIMK1 (Fig. 2, a and b) from PC3 cells was capable of phosphorylating recombinant cofilin (Fig. 2c), the only known substrate of LIMK1 (5Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). To assess whether the increased expression of LIMK1 was associated with an increased phosphorylation of endogenous cofilin, the phosphorylation status of the native cofilin in BPH-1 and PC3 cells was studied using in vivo phosphorylation and immunoblotting techniques. Although no significant difference in the expression of cofilin was noted in these two cell lines an appreciable increase in the phosphorylated cofilin was noted in PC3 cells (Fig. 2, d and e), which demonstrates a parallel increase in phosphorylated cofilin in these cells. A Partial Inhibition of LIMK1 Expression Did Not Result in Reduced Phosphorylation of Cofilin—To understand the possible role of overexpressed LIMK1 in acquisition of tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes, we used antisense-RNA mediated functional inactivation of LIMK1; subsequently, we generated a stable cell line (PC3ASL) capable of expressing antisense LIMK1 RNA after induction with an ecdysone analogue, ponasterone A. A time course study using PC3ASL and a control transformed cell line, PC3LacZ, after continuous induction every 20-22 h for 72 h indicated the maximum expression of LIMK1 antisense transcript at 72 h, which was associated with a concurrent decrease in the concentration of the sense LIMK1 transcript only in the induced PC3ASL cells (Fig. 3a). No decrease in the LIMK1 transcript was apparent in any of the PC3LacZ cells induced or not or in uninduced PC3ASL cells (Fig. 3, a and b). A parallel reduction in the LIMK1 protein concentration confirmed the decreased synthesis of LIMK1 in PC3ASL cells (Fig. 3c). Immunoblot analysis using anti-cofilin or anti-phospho-cofilin antibodies revealed no simultaneous decrease in the concentration of phosphorylated cofilin in PC3ASL cells (Fig. 3d). This observation suggests two possibilities, either the residual LIMK1 can be catalytically more efficient and maintain an increased concentration of phosphorylated cofilin or the enhanced phosphorylation of cofilin was not mediated by LIMK1. Although cofilin is the only known substrate of LIMK1, it can be phosphorylated by other serine/threonine kinases, such as LIMK2 (8Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and TESK1/TESK2 (30Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31449-31458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Reduced Expression of LIMK1 Retarded Cell Proliferation by Arresting Cells at G 2/M Phase—The effect of reduced expression of LIMK1 on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression was studied next. Because LIMK1 is expressed in a growth phase-dependent manner, which suggests its possible involvement in regulation of cell growth (31Higuchi O. Baeg G. Akiyama T. Mizuno K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we monitored the growth pattern of induced and non-induced PC3ASL and PC3LacZ cells by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Our results indicated that the inhibition of expression of LIMK1 led to a block in [3H]thymidine incorporation only in PC3ASL cells after 48 h of continuous induction (Fig. 4a), signifying a growth arrest in PC3ASL cells. A possible role of active LIMK1 in regulating mitosis has been suggested also, based on the studies that have shown that the LIMK1 activity fluctuates with cell cycle progression and attains a maximum level during mitosis when LIMK becomes hyperphosphorylated, presumably by mitotic Cdks (29Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We used induced PC3ASL and PC3LacZ cells synchronized at G1/S boundary by double thymidine block and monitored cell cycle progression by harvesting cells at different time points after the release of the block. At 0 h, ∼75-78% of PC3ASL and PC3LacZ cells were at G1/S phase. The remaining 23-25% of cells were at G2/M phase, which could be accounted for by the higher DNA content in a subpopulation of PC3 cells with inherent chromosomal gain (33Strefford J.C. Lillington D.M. Young B.D. Oliver R.T. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2001; 124: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After the release of thymidine block, both cell types exhibited progression through S phase (∼60% cells) and G2/M (∼30% cells) during the next 6 h. PC3LacZ cells started to cycle through G1 as a gradual increase in the percent of cells in G1 was noted with a concurrent decrease in the total percent of cells in S and G2/M phases between 6-14 h (Fig. 4, b and c). In contrast, PC3ASL cells started to accumulate in G2/M phase during this time (∼50% cells at 14 h), indicating a G2/M arrest in these cells (Fig. 4, b and d). No block in the cell cycle progression in PC3LacZ cells (Fig. 4, b and c) confirms that a threshold concentration of LIMK1 is necessary for the passage of cells through G2/M phase. This result is also consistent with the [3H]thymidine incorporation data, indicating a growth arrest in PC3ASL cells. Reduced Expression of LIMK1 Abolished the Invasive Behavior of Prostate Cancer Cells—The effect of inhibition of LIMK1 expression on the invasive property of PC3 cells was studied next using an in vitro invasion assay. Consistent with their highly metastatic ability, a 3-fold higher percentage of untransfected PC3 cells were invasive and migrated through the Matrigel compared with the non-invasive BPH-1 cells (Fig. 5, a and b). A partial inhibition of LIMK1 expression in PC3ASL cells resulted in a 4-5-fold decrease in the percent of invaded cells compared with that in the wild type PC3 and PC3LacZ cells (transfection control), which was comparable with the percent of BPH-1 cells invaded through the membranes. These data confirm that the functional LIMK1 is essential for the invasive function of PC3 cells. To further confirm the role of LIMK1 in promoting invasiveness of prostate epithelial cells, the effect of ectopic expression of LIMK1 or LacZ (as the control) in non-invasive BPH-1 cells was studied. Expression of LIMK1 in transfected BPH-1 cells after induction by ponasterone A showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization of LIMK1 (Fig. 5d) and altered the growth pattern from a clustered and patchy appearance (BPHLacZ)) to a more uniform distribution of single cells (BPHL) (Fig. 6, i and j). More importantly, expression of LIMK1 in ponasterone A-treated BPHL cells significantly increased the percentage of invasive cells (13-fold) compared with BPH-1 cells expressing LacZ (Fig. 5, a and c), suggesting acquisition of a new invasive phenotype by the non-invasive prostate cells. This study provides compelling evidence that LIMK1 is one of the key proteins that promotes invasiveness and suggests that the increased expression of LIMK1 in PC3 cells may render them metastatic. Altered Expression of LIMK1 Changes Cell Morphology and Organization of Actin Cytoskeleton—The dynamic regulation of actin cytoskeleton and the adhesion apparatus and the extra-cellular matrix degradation are both required for the invasion process of tumor cells. Therefore, we monitored possible alterations in these processes following reduced expression of LIMK1 in PC3 cells. The induced PC3LacZ cells exhibited cell morphology that is typically observed in PC3 cells, with smooth edges and the occasional presence of the filopodial spike-like structures extended from one or both ends of the cell and, in some cases, a phase dense border, characteristic of ruffling lamellipodia around an extensive area of the cell periphery (Fig. 6a, arrows). A majority of induced PC3ASL cells, however, showed a more flattened and irregular shape, with several dark patches at the periphery of the cell (arrows in Fig. 6b) that appear to be possible adhesion points. Fluorescent staining of actin cytoskeleton showed a prominent actin meshwork, characteristic of lamellipodia formation at the leading edge of the induced PC3LacZ cells (Fig. 6c, middle and right); this meshwork was also typical of parental PC3 cells (data not shown) and of motile cells. Immunolocalization of LIMK1 (Fig. 6c) showed a perinuclear distribution, with distinct targeting to the ruffles at the leading edge of these cells (arrows in Fig. 6c, left). In contrast, a high percentage of induced PC3ASL cells showed a predominant formation of discrete stress fibers and focal adhesions typically observed in non-motile adherent cells (34Defilippi P. Olivo C. Venturino M. Dolce L. Silengo L. Tarone G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6d, middle and right). Distribution of LIMK1 in these cells was a"
https://openalex.org/W2089020501,"Agonist-induced phosphorylation of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) results in their desensitization followed by internalization. Whether protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of βARs, particularly the β1AR subtype, can also trigger internalization is currently not known. To test this, we cloned the mouse wild type β1AR (WTβ1AR) and created 3 mutants lacking, respectively: the putative PKA phosphorylation sites (PKA–β1AR), the putative GRK phosphorylation sites (GRK–β1AR), and both sets of phosphorylation sites (PKA–/GRK–β1AR). Following agonist stimulation, both PKA–β1AR and GRK–β1AR mutants showed comparable increases in phosphorylation and desensitization. Saturating concentrations of agonist induced only 50% internalization of either mutant compared with wild type, suggesting that both PKA and GRK phosphorylation of the receptor contributed to receptor sequestration in an additive manner. Moreover, in contrast to the WTβ1AR and PKA–β1AR, sequestration of the GRK–β1AR and PKA–/GRK–β1AR was independent of β-arrestin recruitment. Importantly, clathrin inhibitors abolished agonist-dependent internalization for both the WTβ1AR and PKA–β1AR, whereas caveolae inhibitors prevented internalization only of the GRK–β1AR mutant. Taken together, these data demonstrate that: 1) PKA-mediated phosphorylation can trigger agonist-induced internalization of the β1AR and 2) the pathway selected for β1AR internalization is primarily determined by the kinase that phosphorylates the receptor, i.e. PKA-mediated phosphorylation directs internalization via a caveolae pathway, whereas GRK-mediated phosphorylation directs it through clathrin-coated pits.

Nurnberg B. Schultz G. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Three types of βARs, designated β1, β2, and β3ARs, have been cloned from mammalian tissues (1Gudermann T. Nurnberg B. Schultz G. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Both β1 and β2ARs contain phosphorylation sites located in the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail of the receptor, which serve as targets for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (2Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Furthermore, site-specific mutagenesis studies of the human β2AR suggest that low concentrations of agonist preferentially induce phosphorylation at PKA sites, whereas higher concentrations of agonist induce phosphorylation at both PKA and GRK sites (4Hausdorff W.P.

Continuous exposure of cells to a stimulus causes βARs to undergo rapid phosphorylation in a process that dampens receptor signaling known as desensitization (4Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). βARs demonstrate two different mechanisms of desensitization. Agonist-specific or homologous desensitization of βARs consists of a two-step process in which phosphorylation at the C terminus of the βAR is mediated by GRKs followed by binding to an arrestin protein, which sterically interrupts signaling to the G protein (5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 8Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Heterologous or non-agonist-specific desensitization is mediated by the second messenger-stimulated protein kinases A and C, which phosphorylate the receptor and effect a change in receptor conformation such that interaction with the G protein is impaired (5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). An important consequence of agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation and desensitization by GRKs is the subsequent internalization of phosphorylated receptors into the cell (9Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by β-arrestin, which binds to components of the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery and targets the ligand-bound receptor to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis (10Lin F.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), little is known of the role that PKA-mediated phosphorylation plays in the internalization of βARs, particularly the β1AR. GPCRs can internalize via at least two distinct pathways, namely clathrin-coated pits and caveolae. Although very different structurally, clathrin-coated pits and caveolae both serve as microdomains, which, in addition to functioning as transport machinery, also serve as platforms for integrating the cell's signal-transduction pathways (13Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 14Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These membrane domains serve to facilitate cross-talk between different proteins from a particular signaling pathway contained within these distinct regions (15Marx J.

Proteins to be transported are now thought to have “molecular addresses” located in the amino acid sequences of their cytoplasmic tail regions or to contain a binding site for a particular adaptor protein that directs the molecule to a particular cellular domain (16Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 17Hall R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this regard, although a number of studies have demonstrated a critical role for GRK phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding in the process of clathrin-mediated internalization of the β2AR (5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the internalization of the β1AR are less known. The aim of the present study was to determine the specific role of PKA- and GRK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the β1AR in determining the cellular pathway for agonist-promoted receptor internalization. Materials—All cell culture reagents were procured from Invitrogen. Human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.

The β2AR antagonist ICI-118,551·HCl was procured from Research Biochemicals International. [32P]Orthophosphate, and [125I]iodocyanopindolol came from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen. A cyclic AMP (3H) assay kit and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. An alkaline phosphatase substrate kit and protein assay kit were procured from Bio-Rad. Geneticin was obtained from Invitrogen. Plasmid Constructs—We generated mouse wild type β1AR (WTβ1AR) as previously described (18Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Three different mutants lacking, respectively: the putative PKA phosphorylation consensus sites (PKA–β1AR), the putative GRK phosphorylation sites (GRK–β1AR), and both sets of sites (PKA–/GRK–β1AR) (Fig. 1A) were generated using a combination of primers (for details see Supplemental Material). All recombinant DNA-containing plasmids were verified for sequence authenticity and subcloned into mammalian expression vectors. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were maintained as previously described (18Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The evening before transfection, 4 × 106 cells were plated per 75-cm2 flasks. These cells were transfected on day 1 by FuGENE6™ method (Roche Applied Science). For all experiments, each plate received 5 μg of total DNA, comprising 0.25 μg of the mutant β1AR or 0.5 μg of the WTβ1AR, with the balance comprising just pRK5 DNA. For the β-arrestin2 recruitment studies, each plate received 0.5 μg of β1AR along with a 10-fold molar excess GFP-β-arrestin2 plasmid. Cells were split on day 2 into assay dishes as follows: for phosphorylation assays, and cAMP assays, 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, for β-arrestin2 recruitment, and confocal studies 1 × 106 cells/9.6-cm2 well. Assays were performed on day 3. HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNA containing WTβ1AR, PKA–β1AR, GRK–βAR, and PKA–/GRK–1AR to create stable cell lines. 48 h after transfection cells were selected by the addition of Geneticin at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Expression of receptor was determined by radioligand binding assays. WTβ1AR 551 ± 63, PKA–β1AR 896 ± 56, GRK–β1AR 835 ± 11, PKA–/GRK–β1AR 479 ± 15 fmol/mg of protein. These stable cells were used in ELISA assays, confocal experiments, and immunoblotting studies. Intact Cell Phosphorylation—Intact cell phosphorylation was performed as previously described (19Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were performed at 37 °C, in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Labeling was conducted for 1 h in medium containing 100 μCi of 32Pi/ml (inorganic phosphate, Pi). In PKA inhibition experiments, the labeling medium contained 0.04% Me2SO followed by incubation with ISO (10 μm) for 10 min in the appropriate dishes. The β1AR density (pmol/mg of whole cell protein) of each transfected cell line was determined on a non-radioactive aliquot of each transfected cell population by 125I-cyanopindolol. Equivalent amounts of β1AR were immunoprecipitated from each sample and were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography and analyzed quantitatively with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Radioligand Binding Assays—β1AR expression was evaluated by 125I-cyanopindolol binding studies done at 13 °C for 3 h as previously described (18Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Bound ligand was separated on glass fiber filters (Whatman, GF/C) by vacuum filtration. The filters were washed three times with cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)) and counted in a scintillation counter. Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Receptor sequestration after a 30-min exposure to agonist (10 μm ISO) was defined as the loss of 125I-cyanopindolol binding displaced by CGP-12177. Receptor Binding by ELISA—To determine agonist concentration dependence for internalization of the wild type and three mutants, the receptor number was measured by the ELISA method, as described previously (20Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Kim J. Ahn S. Guo R. Daaka Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, stable cell lines expressing the WTβ1AR or the PKA– or GRK– mutants were plated onto 24-well tissue culture dishes. To improve adhesion of cells to plastic, the wells were treated with 20 μg/ml poly-d-lysine in PBS before plating. 24 h after seeding, cells were incubated with serum-free minimum essential media (MEM) for 10 min at 37 °C. Different concentrations of isoproterenol (0.01–10 μm) were added for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by removing the culture medium followed by fixing cells in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 45 min. Mouse monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG IgG was added at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h, followed by three subsequent washes with PBS. The samples were then briefly re-blocked, incubated with goat anti-mouse-conjugated alkaline phosphatase at a concentration of 1:1000 in PBS/BSA for 1 h, and washed three times with PBS before the addition of a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate. When adequate color change was reached, 100-μl samples were taken for colorimetric readings at 405 nm using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer. Non-transfected cells were studied concurrently to determine background signal and all experiments were done in triplicate. GFP-β-arrestin2 Translocation in Live Cells—GFP-β-arrestin2 translocation was visualized in real-time on a 37 °C heated stage Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM-510) as previously described (22Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Cells expressing either the WTβ1AR or one of the mutants and GFP-β-arrestin2 were stimulated with 10 μm ISO in serum-free medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES. Images were collected sequentially every minute for a period of 10 min using a single line excitation filter 488 nm and emission filters at 505–550 nm. For each single experiment, quantitation was performed in the image in which maximal agonist-dependent β-arrestin2 translocation occurred. β-Arrestin2 translocation was calculated and expressed as agonist-promoted percent loss of the green fluorescent color from the cytosol due to GFP-β-arrestin2 expression. Intact Cell β-AR Desensitization: cAMP Assay—HEK 293 cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free MEM (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) prior to the assay. Two identical sets of 100-mm plates were set up; one set was used as controls and the other for desensitization assays. Cells used for desensitization were exposed to 10 μm dobutamine for 5 min at 37 °C and were then washed with serum-free MEM (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Control cells were washed in an identical manner. Both sets of cells were then replaced with assay buffer (serum-free MEM, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm IBMX, 100 nm ICI 118,551) and exposed to β1-agonist, dobutamine (0.1–10 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by aspiration of the assay buffer and addition of 200 μl of Tris-EDTA solution (0.05 m Tris, 4 mm EDTA, supplied with cyclic AMP (3H) assay kit) to each plate. Plates were frozen at –80 °C for subsequent processing of cells. Cells were scraped and collected, boiled for 10 min and placed on ice. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatant was transferred to a tube for cAMP measurement. cAMP was measured using the procedure outlined in the assay kit. The amount of protein per fraction was determined using a dye-binding protein assay kit. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was carried out as previously described (18Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with the plasmids containing cDNAs encoding either the FLAG-WTβ1AR, FLAG-β2AR, or one of the mutant FLAG-β1ARs as well as pRK5. Live cells were incubated in the absence or presence of filipin, β-CD, cholesterol, MDC along with sucrose, H-89, and GFX for the indicated times and stimulated with ISO (10 μm) for 30 min. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. Staining of FLAG-tagged receptor was carried out as previously described (23Naga Prasad S.V. Laporte S.A. Chamberlain D. Caron M.G. Barak L. Rockman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transferrin uptake was carried out as described previously (24van Dam E.M. Stoorvogel W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). All samples were visualized under the Olympus 1X70 laser scanning confocal microscope, using single sequential line excitation filters of 568 nm and emission filters of 585 nm for Texas Red detection. Images were viewed using Fluoview software and processed using Adobe Illustrator 9.0.1 and Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1. Immunoblotting—Pretreatment of cells with inhibitors and stimulation with agonist were carried out at 37 °C in serum starvation medium as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, cells were lysed directly with 100 μl/well Laemmli sample buffer and proteins (30 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was detected by protein immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase IgG (New England BioLabs) with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. Vasodilator- and A kinase-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was detected by using 1:1000 anti-FLAG M2 antibody with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody. Blots were developed in ECL reagents for 1 min. Agonist-induced Phosphorylation of the β 1AR in Intact 293 Cells—To study the role of PKA- and GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β1AR in an agonist-dependent manner, we used HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids containing the WTβ1AR, PKA–β1AR, GRK–β1AR, or PKA–/GRK–β1AR cDNAs. In unstimulated cells, the WTβ1AR exists as a phosphoprotein migrating with a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 1B). Upon stimulation, phosphorylation of the WTβ1AR as well as PKA–β1AR and GRK–β1AR mutants increased ∼2-fold above basal levels (Fig. 1B). However, when both the PKA and GRK sites were mutated (PKA–/GRK–β1AR), no agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor was observed. Agonist-induced Desensitization of the β 1AR in Intact 293 Cells—To determine the role of PKA and GRK phosphorylation in the desensitization of the β1AR we measured cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the various β1AR mutants. The PKA and GRK phosphorylation mutants caused a 6- to 7-fold increase in cAMP, similar to the wild type receptor, indicating that they were fully coupled to Gs (Fig. 2). In contrast, stimulation of the PKA–/GRK–β1AR mutant produced only a 3-fold increase in cAMP, suggesting that removal of all of the sites resulted in a general impairment of receptor function (Fig. 2). Furthermore, cells overexpressing the WTβ1AR, PKA–β1AR, or GRK–β1AR showed ∼70% desensitization measured as a reduction in catecholamine-induced cAMP generation on repeated exposure to the β1-selective agonist dobutamine. In contrast to the wild type receptor, which fully desensitized even at agonist concentrations that produced a less than maximal increase in intracellular cAMP, cells transfected with the PKA–/GRK–β1AR were not significantly desensitized by pretreatment with agonist. Consistent with the β2AR model of PKA-mediated heterologous desensitization and GRK-mediated homologous desensitization, these data suggest that β1ARs could become fully desensitized by either phosphorylation of PKA and/or GRK sites and only when all the phosphorylation sites were removed did a dramatic reduction in agonist promoted desensitization occur. Both PKA and GRKs Mediate Agonist-induced β 1AR Internalization—As opposed to desensitization, agonist-induced internalization of β2ARs is thought to be mediated predominantly through GRK phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding. To determine the contribution of PKA and GRK phosphorylation to agonist promoted β1AR internalization, we measured the loss of β1ARs from the cell surface in response to isoproterenol by radioligand binding. As shown in Fig. 3A, agonist stimulation resulted in a marked loss of WTβ1ARs from the cell surface. In contrast, at saturating agonist concentrations the extent of agonist-induced sequestration of both the PKA–β1AR and GRK–β1AR was about half that of the WTβ1AR. The double mutant exhibited minimal agonist-induced internalization. These results contrast with the desensitization data (Fig. 2), which indicate that either PKA or GRK sites alone were sufficient for full receptor desensitization, and suggest that both PKA and GRK phosphorylation are required for full internalization of the β1AR. To further examine the role of PKA and GRK phosphorylation in β1AR receptor endocytosis, we determined the dose dependence of isoproterenol-stimulated sequestration of the wild type and mutant receptors (Fig. 3B). Whereas WTβ1AR and PKA–β1AR exhibited half-maximal internalization at similar agonist concentrations, the EC50 for GRK–β1AR internalization was ∼10-fold higher (EC50 values for WTβ1AR = 56 nm, PKA–β1AR = 46 nm, GRK–β1AR = 632 nm, and PKA–/GRK–β1AR = 534 nm). Thus, two distinct mechanisms appear to contribute additively to β1AR sequestration, one a GRK site-dependent mechanism that predominates at lower agonist concentrations, and the other a PKA site-dependent mechanism that accounts for approximately half of the agonist-dependent β1AR sequestration at higher agonist concentrations. Importantly, the reduced efficiency of sequestration for the β1AR mutants was observed over a broad range of agonist concentrations (Fig. 3B). PKA-mediated β 1AR Internalization Does Not Involve β-Arrestin Recruitment to the Membrane—Previous studies have shown that GRK-mediated desensitization involves recruitment of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated β2AR (5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the ability of the wild type and mutant receptors to recruit GFP-β-arrestin2 to the membrane. As shown in Fig. 4A, agonist stimulation of the WTβ1AR resulted in marked translocation of β-arrestin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. In the absence of PKA sites (PKA–β1AR), β-arrestin recruitment was significantly increased. In contrast, cells expressing the GRK–β1AR mutant showed marked impairment of β-arrestin recruitment to the membrane (Fig. 4, A and B). Removal of all phosphorylation sites in the double mutant resulted in very low β-arrestin recruitment comparable to that of the GRK–β1AR (Fig. 4, A and B). Importantly, the ability of the GRK–β1AR (PKA sites intact) to internalize (Fig. 3), despite the marked reduction of β-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 4), suggests that internalization of the β1AR can proceed via multiple mechanisms. Phosphorylation of the β 1AR Directs Internalization via Two Separate Pathways—β-Arrestin recruitment has been shown to be important for targeting the β2AR to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (25Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because the GRK–β1AR mutant showed marked impairment of β-arrestin recruitment compared with the PKA–β1AR mutant, we sought to determine the pathway(s) of internalization following PKA- and GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β1AR. In these experiments cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged WTβ1AR, PKA–β1AR, GRK–β1AR, or β2AR (used as a control) were used for the internalization studies assessed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Because caveolae have been reported to play a significant role in both the signaling and internalization of several GPCRs, cells were pretreated with two different caveolae pathway inhi"

Although IFT proteins are present in cells with sensory cilia, the organization of IFT protein complexes in those cells has not been analyzed. To determine whether the IFT complex is conserved in the sensory cilia of photo-receptors, we investigated protein interactions among four mammalian IFT proteins: IFT88/Polaris, IFT57/Hippi, IFT52/NGD5, and IFT20. We demonstrate that IFT proteins extracted from bovine photoreceptor outer segments, a modified sensory cilium, co-fractionate at ∼17 S, similar to IFT proteins extracted from mouse testis. Using antibodies to IFT88 and IFT57, we demonstrate that all four IFT proteins co-immunoprecipitate from lysates of mouse testis, kidney, and retina. We also extended our analysis to interactions outside of the IFT complex and demonstrate an ATP-regulated co-immunoprecipitation of heterotrimeric kinesin II with the IFT complex. The internal architecture of the IFT complex was investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. IFT20 exhibited a strong interaction with IFT57/Hippi and the kinesin II subunit, KIF3B. Our data indicate that all four mammalian IFT proteins are part of a highly conserved complex in multiple ciliated cell types. Furthermore, IFT20 appears to bridge kinesin II with the IFT complex.

As originally described in the green alga, Chlamydomonas, the 17 S IFT complex is composed of at least 15 different polypeptides and is thought to assemble near the basal body (1Piperno G. Mead K.

In addition, we have previously reported that IFT88, -57, -52, and -20 from mouse testis co-fractionate at ∼17 S (12Pazour G.J. Baker S.A. Deane J.A. Cole D.G. Dickert B.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Besharse J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), formally extending the concept of an IFT complex from Chlamydomonas to mammalian motile flagella. However, the characterization of IFT particles as ∼17 S protein complexes is based exclusively on studies of the motile flagella of Chlamydomonas and mouse testis, while the IFT complexes of sensory and primary cilia have not yet been characterized. An IFT particle utilized in the sensory outer segment of photoreceptors could be grossly different from the IFT particle in motile cilia in its size or architecture as a reflection of a very different cargo pool. For example, components of the phototransduction cascade, such as rhodopsin, transducin, and arrestin (24Marszalek J.R. Liu X. Roberts E.A. Chui D. Marth J.D. Williams D.S. Goldstein L.S.

An IFT particle in such cells may require additional adaptor proteins that could increase the sedimentation value of the complex. Conversely, the IFT particle in sensory cilia could be smaller and more simplified as a reflection of the simplified organization of an axoneme lacking large protein complexes involved in regulated motility such as radial spokes and dynein arms. The principal goal of this study was to determine whether IFT88, -57, -52, and -20 are conserved in the IFT complex in tissues with multiple types of cilia. Using a combination of velocity sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we report a large, ∼17 S complex containing these four proteins is present in tissues containing sensory cilia, motile flagella, and primary cilia. Additionally, we report that the anterograde motor, kinesin II, is co-immunoprecipitated with the IFT complex in multiple tissues in an ATP-regulated manner. IFT20 appears to function in bridging these two complexes by directly interacting with both IFT57 in the IFT complex and KIF3B, a motor subunit of kinesin II. Our analysis indicates that an IFT complex is present in multiple ciliary types and provides insight into the interaction between the complex and the anterograde motor, kinesin II. Antibodies and Western Blotting—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against IFT88, -57, -52, and -20 were generated as previously described (12Pazour G.J. Baker S.A. Deane J.A. Cole D.G. Dickert B.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Besharse J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Additional peptide antibodies were generated at Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) by immunizing goats with synthetic peptides corresponding to a region near the N terminus of IFT57 (EELLRKSNLDPPSRg), to a region near the N terminus of IFT88 (EDDLYSGFNDYNPAY), to a region near the C terminus of IFT88 (DDFADEELGDDLLSE) and affinity purified. KIF3A was detected with the mouse monoclonal antibody, K2.4 (Covance, Berkeley, CA). KIF3B and KAP3 were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). Conventional kinesin heavy chain was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Antibodies against cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 2 and light intermediate chain 3 were a generous gift from Richard Vallee (Columbia University, New York) (26Mikami A. Tynan S.H. Hama T. Luby-Phelps K. Saito T. Crandall J.E. Besharse J.C. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4801-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detected with either ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) or the SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Preparation of ROS Extract and Velocity Sedimentation—Bovine eyes were obtained fresh from Emmpak Foods (Milwaukee, WI). Retinas were either dark-adapted for one hour or immediately harvested and stored at –80 °C. Minimums of four retinas were thawed in 50% sucrose in HMEK buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 m EDTA, 25 mm KCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/μl pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The thawed retinas were vortexed at medium speed for 1 min to break off the rod outer segments (ROS) and then filtered through cheesecloth. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for one hour at 4 °C, the crude ROS were collected and extracted in an equal volume of 2× Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (0.5% Surfact-Amp Nonidet P-40 (Pierce) in HMEK buffer), with and without 300 mm NaCl. After incubation on ice for at least 10 min, the ROS extract was clarified with a 10-min spin at 20 psi in a Beckman tabletop airfuge. The clarified extract was then diluted 2:1 with HMEK buffer to reduce the sucrose concentration, and 1 ml was loaded on a 10.6-ml 5–20% sucrose gradient prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. In preparations treated with salt, 300 mm NaCl was added to the sucrose gradients. Centrifugation was carried out in an Sw41Ti rotor at 35,000 RPM for 14 h at 4 °C (Beckman Optima LE 80 K ultracentrifuge). Following centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Sedimentation standards were run in parallel gradients and included thyroglobulin (19 S), catalase (11.5 S), and bovine serum albumin (4.2 S). Western blotting for cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain, which sediments at ∼20 S (27Holzbaur E.L. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), was often used as an internal size standard. Six frozen mouse testes were homogenized in 1× Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer, with or without 300 mm NaCl, clarified, and analyzed on sucrose gradients as above. Immunoprecipitation—Tissues were harvested fresh from C57Bl6 adult mice and homogenized, followed by sonication in IP lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (see above) or mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and incubated with an antibody against the IFT57-N peptide, the IFT88-N peptide, or preimmune serum and incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for a minimum of 2 h. Sixty microliters of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each lysate/antibody mixture, and the incubation was continued for a minimum of 2 h. The beads were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by four washes in IP lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. In salt experiments, 5 m NaCl was added to the tissue lysate prior to incubation with the antibody to the desired final concentration; all washes were performed with IP lysis buffer at the same NaCl concentration as the lysate. To test the effect of nucleotides, ATP, AMP-PNP, and ATPγS (Sigma) were incubated with the tissue lysates for one hour at 4 °C prior to proceeding with the IP protocol outlined above. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Vectors, yeast, and major reagents were supplied as part of the Matchmaker Gal4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The entire open reading frame or deletion constructs of IFT88, -57, -52, and -20 were cloned into both the pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors using standard cloning procedures (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 3 Ed. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Constructs encoding the C terminus of KIF3A (amino acids 338–701) and KIF3B (amino acids 470–747) were obtained by RT-PCR from C57/Bl mouse testis RNA and subcloned into pGADT7 and pGBKT7. KAP3 constructs were a generous gift from Tetsu Akiyama (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (29Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into yeast strain AH109 using the LiAc-mediated yeast transformation as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (PT3024–1; Clontech). Transformed yeast cells were isolated by growth on S.D.-leucine-tryptophan plates at 30 °C for 3 days. For high stringency selection, cells were then transferred to S.D.-adenine-histidine-leucine-tryptophan plates, supplemented with 20 μg/ml X-α-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside), and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3–5 days. α-Galactosidase Quantitative Assay—S.D.-leucine-tryptophan cultures were inoculated with a single, fresh yeast colony and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The A600 was measured, and the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. Sixteen microliters of the supernatant was combined with 48 μl of fresh assay buffer (2:1 ratio of 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, to 100 mm p-nitrophenyl α-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 136 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. Optical density was measured at 405 nm in a micro titer plate, and α-galactosidase units were calculated from the following formula: (milliunits/(ml × cell)) = (A405)(final assay volume)(1000)/((10.5 ml/umol)(60 min)(16 μl of culture volume)(A600)). Each yeast colony was assayed in triplicate. An IFT Particle in the Sensory Cilia of Photoreceptors—We have extended the velocity sedimentation analysis of IFT complexes to photoreceptors in order to determine whether an ∼17 S particle is present in cells with sensory cilia. The abundance of IFT proteins is lower in the retina compared with the testis, which previously made it difficult to demonstrate a complex associated with photoreceptors (12Pazour G.J. Baker S.A. Deane J.A. Cole D.G. Dickert B.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Besharse J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To counter this problem, we prepared crude bovine ROS by mechanical disruption and flotation on 50% sucrose (30Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This preparation contains sealed and broken outer segments as well as the basal body, the axoneme, and variable amounts of the inner segment but lacks other retinal neurons and glia. The crude ROS were then extracted in 0.25% Nonidet P-40, generating a supernatant enriched in IFT proteins. After centrifugation on a 5–20% sucrose gradient, Western blots revealed that IFT57 and -88 co-fractionate at ∼17 S (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the fractionation pattern of extracts from bovine photoreceptor to mouse testis (Fig. 1, A and C) demonstrated that the hydrodynamic properties of IFT proteins from both tissues were similar. The principal difference between bovine photoreceptors and testis was that IFT proteins were much more abundant in testis extracts, which permitted analysis of IFT52 and -20 (Fig. 1C); these two components were difficult to detect reliably in the gradients derived from photoreceptors. In testis both IFT20 and -52 co-fractionate with IFT57 and -88 at ∼17 S. However, we also observed that only a portion of IFT20 co-fractionates with the remaining three IFT proteins; a substantial pool of unassembled IFT20 remained near the top of the gradient. In Chlamydomonas the homologues of all four mammalian IFT proteins are part of complex B, which dissociates from complex A at moderate ionic strength. We found that when both bovine ROS (Fig. 1B) and testis extracts (Fig. 1D) were prepared in moderate ionic strength buffer (300 mm NaCl), the IFT particle was partially dissociated, causing a similar shift in the peak of IFT protein from ∼17 S to ∼12 S in both tissues. In addition, the extraction of total IFT protein was enhanced in the presence of 300 mm NaCl. This was most clearly seen in the photoreceptor samples (compare Fig. 1, A and B) but was also routinely observed in the testis samples. Similar to the low salt condition (Fig. 1C), only a portion of IFT20 co-fractionated with the remaining IFT components (Fig. 1D), while the remainder sedimented near the top of the gradient. However, a larger proportion of IFT20 was found co-fractionating with IFT88, -57, and -52 in the presence of 300 mm NaCl (compare Fig. 1, C and D). This suggests that moderate ionic strength favors association of IFT20 with a smaller, partially dissociated IFT complex. The continued co-fractionation of these mammalian homologues at increasing ionic strength suggests that an arrangement of subcomplexes similar to that proposed for Chlamydomonas is conserved in mammalian ciliated tissues. Immunoprecipitation of IFT Components from Multiple Ciliated Cell Types—Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the four IFT proteins that co-fractionate on velocity sedimentation gradients are components of the same complex in both photoreceptors and testis. We found that affinity-purified goat antibodies against two different IFT proteins, IFT88 and -57, precipitated all four IFT components in extracts of mouse retina, kidney, and testis (Fig. 2). The kidney lysates were included in these experiments to demonstrate that the IFT complex is also present in a tissue containing primary cilia, an organelle structurally and functionally different from photoreceptor cilia and motile flagella. Although IFT52 and -20 were difficult to detect in the velocity sedimentation analysis of photoreceptors (Fig. 1A), enrichment of IFT proteins by immunoprecipitation confirmed their presence in the photoreceptor IFT complex. Note that the upper band in the precipitation of IFT52 with anti-IFT57 shows cross-reactivity with the goat IgG heavy chain. The immunoprecipitation of IFT proteins in different tissues is qualitatively similar, but the lower abundance of IFT proteins in the retina compared with the testis (Fig. 2, A and B) is apparent, particularly when IFT52 and -20 are analyzed. In addition, the anti-IFT57 immunoprecipitates pull down more IFT57 than is pulled down with anti-IFT88. Similarly, the anti-IFT88 immunoprecipitates pull down more IFT88 than is pulled down with anti-IFT57. This difference suggests that unassembled pools of both proteins are present. In summary, the immunoprecipitation results support the velocity sedimentation data by demonstrating that the IFT proteins are part of a complex and that this complex is conserved in multiple types of ciliated cells. IFT57 Interacts Directly with IFT20 —We utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to look for direct interactions among the four mammalian IFT proteins. IFT88, -57, -52, and -20 were expressed in yeast as fusion proteins with either the Gal4 activation domain or DNA-binding domain. Each pair was tested for interaction by growth on high stringency (S.D.-adenine-histidine-leucine-tryptophan + X-α-Gal) medium (data not shown) and in quantitative α-galactosidase activity assays. Each mammalian IFT protein was tested pair-wise against the remaining three IFT proteins as well as against itself to test for homodimerization. A strong interaction between IFT57 and IFT20 was discovered (Fig. 3). There was no evidence for a direct interaction between any other pairs nor was there evidence of homodimerization for any IFT protein (homodimerization assays for IFT88, -52, and -20 are not shown). To further characterize the interaction between IFT57 and IFT20, several deletion constructs of each gene were generated and retested in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4A). Secondary structure analysis of IFT57 predicts two immediately adjacent coiled-coil domains near the C terminus (31Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), previously identified as a myosin-like domain and a pseudo-death effector domain (32Gervais F.G. Singaraja R. Xanthoudakis S. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Metzler M. Hackam A.S. Tam J. Vaillancourt J.P. Houtzager V. Rasper D.M. Roy S. Hayden M.R. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The strong interaction with IFT20 was abolished by a truncation of IFT57 lacking the C-terminal coiled-coil domains. Truncations encoding either of the two coiled-coil domains were sufficient to maintain a weaker but significant interaction with IFT20 (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the entire extended coiled-coil region, including the pseudo-death effector domain, in IFT57 is required for optimal interaction with IFT20. Secondary structure analysis of the IFT20 sequence also predicted a coiled-coil domain near the C terminus of the protein as the only candidate protein-protein interaction motif (31Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Deletion of this region caused a greatly reduced interaction but did not abolish it completely. In contrast, the coiled-coil domain by itself was sufficient for a reduced, but significant, interaction with IFT57 (Fig. 4C). Thus, the primary interaction domain between IFT57 and IFT20 are the coiled-coil domains in each protein, although secondary contacts outside of these domains may further stabilize the interaction. Regulated Interaction Between Heterotrimeric Kinesin II and the IFT Complex—The salient feature of the IFT complex is its association with motility within cilia and flagella. Genetic studies in Chlamydomonas have demonstrated that the motility of IFT particles or individual IFT components requires the activity of kinesin II for anterograde movement and cytoplasmic dynein 1b for retrograde movement (2Cole D.G.

Cell. 1999; 10: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that kinesin II co-immunoprecipitates with an IFT complex in Chlamydomonas (2Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To determine whether either of the motors was associated with the mammalian IFT complex in our preparations, we probed IFT immunoprecipitates with antibodies against the subunits of kinesin II or cytoplasmic dynein. Neither cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 2 nor light intermediate chain 3 was detected (data not shown). We did observe that all three subunits of kinesin II, KIF3A, KIF3B, and KAP3, co-immunoprecipitated with the IFT components from testis and retina (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar results were obtained from kidney (data not shown). The intraflagellar transport model predicts that interactions between the IFT complex and motors would be transient. To determine whether the interaction between the IFT complex and kinesin II was affected by ionic strength, testis lysate was supplemented with increasing amounts of NaCl prior to immunoprecipitation. The co-immunoprecipitation of IFT proteins remained stable at the highest salt concentration tested (Fig. 5C). However, raising the salt concentration above physiological conditions disrupted the interaction between kinesin II and the stable, IFT subcomplex containing IFT88, -57, -52, and -20. We also tested the effect of nucleotides on the association between IFT components and kinesin II. The addition of 1 mm ATP to the testis lysate prevented the co-immunoprecipitation of kinesin II with the IFT complex, whereas the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, had no effect (Fig. 6). However, ATPγS, a stable ATP analog that can be used to generate thiophosphorylated proteins, mimicked the action of ATP, releasing kinesin II from the IFT complex. None of these treatments disrupted interactions among the four IFT proteins. Also note that we did not detect conventional kinesin heavy chain (KHC) or tubulin in these immunoprecipitation experiments (Fi"

Promoter hypermethylation is an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation known to silence gene expression in carcinogenesis. Treatment of spontaneously immortal Li-Fraumeni fibroblasts with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), induces a senescence-like state. We used microarrays containing 12 558 genes to determine the gene expression profile associated with cellular immortalization and also regulated by 5AZA-dC. Remarkably, among 85 genes with methylation-dependent downregulation (silencing) after immortalization, 39 (46%) are known to be regulated during interferon signaling, a known growth-suppressive pathway. This work indicates that gene silencing may be associated with an early event in carcinogenesis, cellular immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W1976538401,"Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) has been proposed to play a key role in cell death. Downstream MPT events include the release of apoptogenic factors that sets in motion the mitochondrial apoptosome leading to caspase activation. The current work examined the regulation of MPT by membrane fluidity modulated upon cholesterol enrichment. Mitochondria enriched in cholesterol displayed increased microviscosity resulting in impaired MPT induced by atractyloside, a c-conformation stabilizing ligand of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). This effect was dependent on the dose of cholesterol loaded and reversed upon the fluidization of mitochondria by the fatty acid derivative A2C. Mitoplasts derived from cholesterol-enriched mitochondria responded to atractyloside in a similar fashion as intact mitochondria, indicating that a significant amount of cholesterol is still found in the inner membrane. The effects of cholesterol on MPT induced by atractyloside were mirrored by the release of intermembrane proteins, cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis inducing factor. However, cholesterol loading did not affect the uptake rate of adenine nucleotide hence dissociating the function of ANT as a MPT-mediated protein from its adenine nucleotide exchange function. Thus, these findings indicate that the ability of atractyloside to induce MPT via ANT requires an appropriate membrane fluidity range."
https://openalex.org/W2073125132,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity are regulated by diverse protein kinases in response to extracellular stimuli by cytokines, growth factors and stress. Using two melanoma-derived cell lines that exhibit marked differences in basal activities of MAPKs and PI3K-AKT, we studied changes both in STAT activities and in their sensitization to apoptosis. Activating mutations of B-RAF (T1796A) and impaired expression of PTEN are detected in LU1205, but not in FEMX melanoma cells, and are reflected in high basal levels of expression and activities of MAPKs and PI3K-AKT. Treatment with either PD98059 (PD) or LY294002 (LY), the pharmacological inhibitors of MEK-ERK and PI3K, respectively, markedly increased GAS-Luc activity in LU1205, but not in FEMX cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3/5 and of JAK2 also increased upon treatment of LU1205 cells with either PD or LY, suggesting that constitutive active MAPK and PI3K signals inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK/STATs. Treatment of FEMX and LU1205 with PD sensitized the cells to apoptosis, albeit by TNFalpha and TRAIL death cascades, respectively, indicating that additional yet distinct targets are affected by each signaling pathway. Indeed, the combination of LY and PD treatment synergistically increased the apoptosis of LU1205 and FEMX cells. Overall, whereas PI3K and MAPK downregulate JAK-STAT signaling, additional targets are affected by these kinases and sensitizes melanoma to apoptosis via distinct death cascades."

We now demonstrate that in cells coexpressing PS1, APH-1, and NCT, full-length PS1 accumulates to high levels and is fairly stable. Upon expression of PEN-2, the levels of PS1 holoprotein are significantly reduced, commensurate with an elevation in levels of PS1 fragments. These findings suggest that APH-1 and NCT are necessary for stabilization of full-length PS1 and that PEN-2 is critical for the proteolysis of stabilized PS1. In N2a and 293 cell lines that stably overexpress PS1, APH-1, NCT, and PEN-2, PS1 fragment levels are elevated by up to 10-fold over endogenous levels. In these cells, we find a marked accumulation of the APP-CTFγ (AICD) fragment and a concomitant reduction in levels of both APP-CTFβ and CTFα. Moreover, the production of the γ-secretase-generated Notch S3/NICD derivative is modestly elevated. However, we failed to observe a corresponding increase in levels of secreted Aβ peptides in the medium of these cells. These results lead us to conclude that, although the PS1, APH-1, NCT, and PEN-2 are essential for γ-secretase activity, the proteolysis of APP-CTF and Notch S2/NEXT are differentially regulated and require the activity of additional cofactors that promote production of AICD, NICD, and Aβ.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Intramembranous proteolysis of a set of membrane-tethered APP derivatives (APP-CTFs) leads to the production and subsequent secretion of amyloid β-peptides (Aβs), whereas proteolysis of a membrane-tethered Notch 1 derivative, termed S2/NEXT, results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (S3/NICD). It has previously been observed that Aβ and S3/NICD production are eliminated in cells derived from mouse blastocysts with compound deletions of PS1 and PS2 (4Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W.

Cell lysates or conditioned medium were subject to Tris/glycine or 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE, and fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) prior to incubation with selected antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Parallel dishes of stable N2a or HEK293 cells were labeled with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 1% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) for 10 min or 4 h. Conditioned medium was collected and adjusted to 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and labeled cells were harvested as described above. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with respective antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected with Protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce) and eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli SDS sample buffer. After separation on 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE, radioactive bands were visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). For pulse-chase analysis of NΔE processing, transiently transfected N2a or HEK293 cells were starved in methionine-free DMEM and then labeled with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 20 min. At the end of the labeling period, one dish of each cell line was immediately harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer, as described above, whereas the other dish was washed once and incubated for 2 h in DMEM containing 1% dialyzed FBS and 0.5 mm l-methionine (Invitrogen). When indicated, lactacystin (10 μm) was added to both pulse-labeling and pulse-chase media. Detergent lysates were prepared and subject to immunoprecipitation analysis with myc15 antibody, as described above. Cytoplasmic RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated as described previously (56Sisodia S.S. Sollner-Webb B. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm Tris, pH 8.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm vanadylribonucleoside complexes (New England BioLabs)). Cell extracts were centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The supernatant was collected and diluted with an equal volume of 2× proteinase K buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 2% SDS), and proteinase K was added to 200 μg/ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the lysates were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. First strand cDNA was generated using the Thermoscript cDNA kit (Invitrogen), and PCR was performed using human APH-1αs specific primers. Steady-state Levels of PS1, APH-1α, NCT, and PEN-2 Are Coordinately Regulated—Our initial efforts focused on the effects of APH-1, NCT, and PEN-2 on PS1 accumulation in transiently transfected mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. APH-1α, NCT, and PEN-2 were epitope-tagged with a sequence, RFLEERP, which is recognized by CT11 antibody (57Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C.

We have verified that the CT11-tagged NCT molecule can be coimmunoprecipitated with PS1 fragments in a manner indistinguishable from untagged NCT (data not shown). Moreover, we have successfully coimmunoprecipitated PS1 with CT11-tagged APH-1α or CT11-tagged PEN-2 (data not shown), data consistent with previous findings (40Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W.

In transiently transfected N2a cells, we show that, in contrast to cells expressing NCT without APH-1α, the steady-state levels and, particularly, the levels of mature, fully glycosylated NCT are significantly increased in the cells coexpressing NCT and APH-1α (Fig. 1A, panel I, compare lanes 4 and 6; 8 and 9). Similar results were obtained for PEN-2; the steady-state levels of PEN-2 are higher when coexpressed with APH-1α compared with settings in which only PEN-2 is expressed (Fig. 1A, panel II, compare lanes 5 and 7; 8 and 9). Moreover, the accumulated levels of APH-1α are higher when coexpressed with NCT compared with settings in which APH-1α is expressed without NCT (Fig. 1A, panel III, compare lanes 3 and 6; 7 and 9). To assess whether APH-1, NCT, and/or PEN-2 are the limiting factor(s) for stabilization of PS1 and could affect the levels of accumulated PS1 fragments, we performed Western blot analysis using PS1NT antibody ("
https://openalex.org/W1973255990,"In eukaryotes, at least 10 proteins associate in a 3′-5′ exonuclease complex, the exosome, which is involved in the processing of many RNA species. A recent model for the exosome placed six RNase PH-related components in a hexameric ring core structure, with three S1 domain proteins associated with the ring surface. So far, however, this model lacks experimental support. Using a combination of RNA interference, complex affinity purification, and yeast two-hybrid approaches, we show here that the RNase PH homologues are important for maintenance of complex integrity. In contrast, the S1 domain proteins are not required for complex stability, although they are required for exosome function. Our results are partially consistent with the proposed model of the exosome, but indicate a different arrangement of the RNase PH proteins."

However, it is unclear exactly what environmental factors may trigger this pathogenetic tau hyperphosphorylation. From several perspectives, the coagulation serine protease, thrombin, has been implicated in AD and activates several different protein kinase pathways but has not previously been shown how it may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Here we report that nanomolar thrombin induced rapid tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in murine hippocampal neurons via protease-activated receptors, which was followed by delayed synaptophysin reduction and apoptotic neuronal death. Mechanistic study revealed that a persistent thrombin signaling via protease-activated receptor 4 and prolonged downstream p44/42 mitogenactivated protein kinase activation are at least in part responsible. These results pathogenetically linked thrombin to subpopulations of AD and other tauopathies associated with cerebrovascular damage.

Phosphorylation of tau at its microtubule-binding domain disassociates tau from microtubules and leads to microtubule disassembly. Moreover, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau tends to self-aggregate and is likely transported to neuronal soma for either degradation or aggregation into inclusion bodies (IBs) 1The abbreviations used are: IB, inclusion body; pAb, polyclonal antibody; AD, Alzheimer's disease; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; HMW, high molecular weight; ICC, immunocytochemistry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NFT, neurofibrillary tangle; PAR, protease-activated receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RT, reverse transcriptase; TPK, tau protein kinases; apoE, apolipoprotein E; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β.1The abbreviations used are: IB, inclusion body; pAb, polyclonal antibody; AD, Alzheimer's disease; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; HMW, high molecular weight; ICC, immunocytochemistry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NFT, neurofibrillary tangle; PAR, protease-activated receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RT, reverse transcriptase; TPK, tau protein kinases; apoE, apolipoprotein E; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β. if incapable of degradation (see Ref. 1Buee L.

The IBs composed of primarily undegraded hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are pathologically revealed as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies (2Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Although discrepancies exist regarding the causality between NFTs and neurodegeneration (3Armstrong R.A. Cairns N.J. Lantos P.L. Neuropathology. 2002; 22: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), certain types of neurodegeneration, particularly those in AD and other tauopathies, are characterized by accompanying NFT formation, referred as neurofibrillary degeneration. Most tauopathies like AD are multifactorial disorders. Although significant efforts have been devoted to elucidate disease-specific risk factors or possible pathogenetic causes, the specific factors/causes responsible for induction of NFTs and neurofibrillary degeneration in different tauopathies remain to be established. Genetic mutations in the tau gene may render tau protein more prone to aggregate and form NFTs in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (4Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 5Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S.

Although evidence indicates that multiple tau mutations are clearly pathogenic in FTDP-17 and some polymorphisms may increase risk in other tauopathies, neither AD nor the majority of sporadic tauopathy patients have tau mutations, whereas they still express typical neurofibrillary degeneration in various populations of neurons. This points out that certain environmental pathogenetic risk factors may be sufficient to induce NFTs and/or neurofibrillary degeneration in these conditions. With AD as an example, cerebrovascular degeneration is consistently observed and the laminar and regional distribution of the vascular alterations are closely correlated with the presence of NFTs (7Bell M.A. Ball M.J.

The pathological observations indicated that the NFTs in these patients were consistently situated around blood vessels in the heavily affected regions (16Geddes J.F. Vowles G.H. Nicoll J.A. Revesz T. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1999; 98: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In dementia pugilistica, the recurrent and severe form of traumatic brain injury seen in career boxers, the molecular characteristics of tau in terms of its six isoforms and precise phosphorylation profiles have been recently shown to recapitulate those of AD (13Schmidt M.L.

These facts raise the question as to whether certain blood-derived factors that might leak from damaged cerebral vessels are capable of inducing neurofibrillary degeneration. Among various blood-derived factors, the serine protease thrombin is not only critical in peripheral coagulation cascades (20Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) but may also affect a broad spectrum of central nervous system glial and neuronal cell functions (21Snider R.M. Richelson E.

Taken together, these facts have therefore led us to propose and test whether thrombin is capable of inducing neurofibrillary degeneration in hippocampal neurons, and if so, what extra- and intracellular mechanisms might be involved.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and differentiated in modified serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1× N2 supplement, 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor-β, 100 μm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, 100 μm dibutyryl cAMP) for 24–48 h before treatment. All treatments were performed in differentiation medium with reduced nerve growth factor-β content to 5 ng/ml. Immunocytochemistry—HT22 cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine and laminin pre-treated 8-chamber slides at a density of 1 × 105/well or 18-mm round glass coverslips at 30–50% confluence. After differentiation and treatments, cultures were washed with PBS, fixed with pre-chilled (4 °C) 5% acetic acid in methanol for 45 min at 4 °C, and followed by washing with PBS. Fixed cells were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C and then incubated with specific primary Ab (A24, 1:200; tau-1, 1:200; AB1518, 1:400; AT8, 1:100; PG-5, 1:200) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1–3 h at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After sufficient washing, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary Ab conjugated with proper fluorescent dyes (1:300) for 1 h at 25 °C. After staining, slide chambers were removed, and slides or glass coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount and observed under a Nikon Bio-Radiance confocal microscope. Preparation of Soluble and Insoluble Cellular Fractions—Treated cells were harvested in pre-chilled (4 °C) H buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.8 m NaCl, 10% sucrose, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures, pH 7.4), and homogenized with a Teflon/glass homogenizer by 10 strokes at 200 rpm for each sample. After centrifugation at 27,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were saved, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of H buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged again at the same conditions. The resulting pellet (P1) was saved, the supernatants were combined with the earlier supernatants, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The final pellet (P2), along with P1, was resupended in 2× reducing sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), sonicated with high power for 30 s and boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE analysis. An equal volume of the final supernatants (S) from each sample was directly mixed with 2× reducing sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE analysis. Western Blot—Cultured cells were lysed with appropriate amounts of boiling denaturing lysate buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) or pre-chilled native lysate buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented both with phosphatase (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Diagnostics).

RT-PCR—Cultured cells were washed and then lysed in Trizol and total RNAs were extracted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA concentrations were based on absorbance at 230, 260, and 280 nm. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 0.5–1.0 μg of total RNA, downstream primer sequence 5′-GCCATCACCCAAATGACCAC, and upstream primer 5′-GTGCGGTCCCTTGCTGTCTT in a 50-μl volume with 5 units of rTth polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.3 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm MnOAc, 0.45 μm primer incubated at 57 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min and 57 °C for 1 min. PCR of 2 μl the products was performed with the upstream primer 5′-CAGCCAGAATCAGAGAGG in 100-μl reactions with 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Bioline, London, UK), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm each primer. cDNA products were visualized, after agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide, under UV light and images were captured and analyzed with the aid of a CCD camera and NIH Image software. Cytotoxicity Assay—Differentiated HT22 cells were treated control, thrombin (100 nm), PAR1AP (100 μm), and PAR4AP (100 μm) either in the absence or presence of PD98059 (10 μm) for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cytotoxicity of HT22 cells was evaluated by release of LDH into the culture media as previously described (44Suo Z. Fang C. Crawford F. Mullan M. Brain Res. 1997; 762: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Suo Z. Crawford F. Fang C. Paris D. Parker T. Placzek A. Humphrey J. Mullan M. Alzheimer's Rept. 1998; 1: 381-387Google Scholar). Thioflavin-S Staining—Fixed cells on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and followed by incubation in 0.01% thioflavin-S for 5 min. After washing 3 times with 70% ethanol, glass coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount and observed under a Nikon Bio-Radiance confocal microscope. Statistical Analysis—All qualitative analysis (Western blot and ICC) was repeated at least three times. Quantitative data (LDH assay) are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by ANOVA using StatView 6.0 (Abacus Systems, Mountain View, CA). Post-hoc comparisons of means were made using Scheffe's or Tukey's method where appropriate. Thrombin Induced Tau Hyperphosphorylation and Aggregation in HT22 Hippocampal Neurons—Potential impact of thrombin on the cellular status of tau protein was first examined using ICC and Western blot in differentiated HT22 cells, an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (43Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, a phosphorylation-independent, total tau pAb, A24, revealed a homogenous staining pattern of tau in cytosol and processes of control HT22 cells, whereas it decorated intensified perinuclear and cytoplasmic IB-like tau profiles after 24 h treatment with 100 nm α-thrombin. These data indicated that thrombin induced significant tau translocation and possibly tau aggregation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau has been widely believed to promote tau aggregation both in cultured cells and in vivo (see Ref. 1Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar for review). To determine whether thrombin treatment increases tau phosphorylation levels, we used a panel of phosphorylation-specific tau Abs and further examined the influence of thrombin on the cellular state of tau in HT22 cells. In contrast to the distinct IB-like tau staining revealed by the A24 total tau Ab, tau-1, a mAb recognizing only dephosphorylated tau, homogenously decorated neuritic and cytosolic tau in both thrombin-treated and control HT22 cells (data not shown). This failure to reveal the IB-like tau staining patterns in thrombin-treated cells implied that the thrombin-induced IB-like tau staining profiles might be primarily comprised of phosphorylated tau proteins. In support of this assumption, we next used AT8, a mAb specifically recognizing hyperphosphorylated tau at pSpT202/205, a phospho-epitope that may appear in both control and AD brains (1Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). AT8 positively decorated both cytoplasmic and neuritic IB-like tau structures in thrombin-treated, but not control, HT22 cells. Moreover, a phosphoepitope-specific tau pAb for pS422, a phosphorylation site only found in AD but not control brains (1Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), also revealed IB-like tau profiles in HT22 cells treated with thrombin, but not the control cells (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a pAb (AB1518, Chemicon) raised against purified NFT extracts, and which is capable of recognizing multiple AD-related hyperphosphorylated tau isoforms, highlighted specific cytoplasmic and neuritic IB-like structures in thrombin-treated, but not control HT22 cells (Fig. 2, A–F). Nevertheless, at least two other phospho-epitope specific Abs, a pAb for pS396 and a mAb for pS409 tau (PG-5), failed to stain either cytoplasmic or neuritic structures in control or thrombin-treated cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that thrombin treatment of HT22 cells increased phosphorylation levels of tau proteins at certain specific sites that are believed relevant to NFT formation (Table I). Going further, these hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in mouse hippocampal cells were translocated to perinuclear and cytoplasmic and accumulated in IB-like structures.Table IThrombin-induced tau hyperphosphorylation/aggregation in HT22 cellsName of tau AbsEpitope specificityEffects of thrombinA24Total tau, not dependent on phosphorylation status++Tau-1Dephosphorylation-dependent tau-AB1518Extracts of AD NFTs, multiple phosphorylated tau++++AT8Phosphoryation-specific tau pSpT202/205++pSpS199/202Phosphoryation-specific tau pSpS199/202+++pS396Phosphoryation-specific tau pS396-PG-5Phosphoryation-specific tau pS409-pS422Phosphoryation-specific tau pS422+++ Open table in a new tab To further characterize the property of the thrombin-induced IB-like tau profiles in HT22 cells, we also performed a routine thioflavin-S staining. This revealed the similar IB-like profiles that were co-localized with those stained by the AB1518 NFT pAb (Fig. 2, A and B). Because thioflavin-S staining preferentially labels protein aggregates containing β-sheet structure, these results suggest that the thrombin-induced hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the IB-like structures formed β-sheet-containing protein aggregates, and these IB-like structures might represent “pre-tangle” tau aggregates (46Terry R.D. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1998; 53: 141-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ugolini G. Cattaneo A. Novak M. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3709-3712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lewis J. McGowan E.

Genet. 2000; 25: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Therefore, in summary, these morphological studies suggest that thrombin is capable of inducing tau translocation and aggregation in HT22 hippocampal neurons and that hyperphosphorylation of tau may participate in mediating the tau aggregation. In addition to the morphological characterization of the thrombin-induced IB-like tau aggregates, we also performed Western blot analyses with these tau Abs. As seen in Fig. 3A, 100 nm α-thrombin induced time-dependent (as early as 2 h) tau oligomerization in HT22 hippocampal neurons, as evidenced by the appearance of high molecular weight (HMW) bands immunopositive for tau using the total tau Ab, A24, in reduced and denatured electrophoresis conditions. In contrast, although the tau-1 Ab revealed monomeric tau isoforms it failed to show the HMW tau bands as revealed by A24 (Fig. 3B), supporting the notion that the HMW tau bands were comprised mainly of phosphorylated tau. In addition, under native conditions, Western blot with the NFT-specific Ab, AB1518, failed to detect immunopositive bands in control but numerous bands were stained intensively in HT22 cells treated with thrombin (Fig. 3C). As early as 2 h after treatment, thrombin induced HMW tau bands, and this was true for Western blots employing both A24 and AB1518 Abs. This is even more clearly shown by Western blot using AB1518, where thrombin initially induced several AB1518-positive bands with molecular weights between 50,000 and 285,000, which may include both monomeric and oligomeric phosphorylated tau proteins. With increasing time, these bands were more intensified and eventually became a smear with molecular weight greater than 200,000, whereas the smaller bands essentially disappeared after 24 or 48 h treatment. These results suggest that thrombin induced a rapid and time-dependent increase of tau phosphorylation and oligomerization, and that the time course for developing this change could be as short as 2 h and reached its peak at the latest by 24 h. Aside from the results using tau-1 and AB1518 NFT Abs, Western blots with several other phospho-specific tau Abs under native conditions were also performed. As shown in Fig. 6B, phospho-specific Ab against pSpS199/202 tau revealed that control HT22 cells showed significantly stained bands, particularly at sizes corresponding to the monomers, while thrombin treatment resulted in a strong increase of the immunoreactivity especially those corresponding to HMW tau oligomers. These data suggest that the pSpS199/202 tau may be physiologically presented in these cells, but that thrombin strongly increased the tau phosphorylation levels at this particular site. In addition, the AD-specific phospho-epitope of tau, pS422, was not found in control HT22 cells but presented in thrombin-treated cells at high levels primarily as HMW bands (Fig. 6C). Probing with PG-5 (pS409-specific) and anti-pS396-specific tau failed to reveal significant differences between control and thrombin-treated cells. Taken together, except for PG-5 and pS396-tau, all other phospho-specific tau Abs tested revealed a common feature that thrombin treatment in HT22 cells not only increased phosphorylation levels of tau but the increased hyperphosphorylated tau proteins primarily integrated into HMW tau oligomers under native non-reducing conditions. Therefore, these Western blot data confirmed the morphological results, and support the conclusion that thrombin induced hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization of tau in HT22 hippocampal neurons.Fig. 6Effects of PD98059 on tau phosphorylation and aggregation induced by thrombin, PAR1AP, and PAR4AP. Differentiated HT22 hippocampal neurons were treated with control, α-thrombin (100 nm), PAR1AP (100 μm), or PAR4AP (100 μm) in the absence or presence of PD98059 (10 μm) as indicated for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared in native lysate buffer (“Experimental Procedures”), which was followed by non-reducing native PAGE (12% gel). Panel A, Western blot with AB1518.

The resultant outcomes are cytoprotective but also proapoptotic. ER chaperones and misfolded proteins exit to the secretory pathway and are retrieved to the ER, during which process the KDEL receptor plays a significant role. Using an expression of a mutant KDEL receptor that lacks the ability for ligand recognition, we show that the impairment of retrieval by the KDEL receptor led to a mis-sorting of the immunoglobulin-binding protein BiP, an ER chaperone that has a retrieval signal from the early secretory pathway, which induced intense ER stress response and an increase in susceptibility to ER stress in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we show that the ER stress response accompanied the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) and that the expression of the mutant KDEL receptor suppressed the activation of p38 and JNK1 but not JNK2. The effect of the expression of the mutant KDEL receptor was consistent with the effect of a specific inhibitor for p38 MAP kinases, because the inhibitor sensitized HeLa cells to ER stress. We also found that activation of the KDEL receptor by the ligand induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinases. These results indicate that the KDEL receptor participates in the ER stress response not only by its retrieval ability but also by modulating MAP kinase signaling, which may affect the outcomes of the mammalian ER stress response.

ER molecular chaperones such as the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) and calnexin facilitate the correct folding or degradation of these newly synthesized proteins as well as that of misfolded proteins (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). An increase in misfolded proteins in the ER caused by deleterious effects upon the folding environments in the ER or by genetic mutations evokes the ER stress response, which includes an induction of the synthesis of ER chaperones called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), suppression of general protein synthesis (3Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D.

Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Despite these responses, the persistent accumulation of misfolded proteins leads to protein aggregation in the cell as well as in the extracellular tissue, frequently accompanied by cellular dysfunction and cell death. Now a growing amount of evidence indicates that the ER stress response is involved in the pathogenesis of several diverse disorders called conformational diseases (8Kopito R.R. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E207-E209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mammalian ER stress response is a complicated process that is coordinately induced by ER transmembrane kinases such as ATF6, IRE1, and PERK (9Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 10Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Further complexity comes from the fact that the activation of these kinases not only enhances the expression of ER chaperones for cytoprotection but also causes apoptosis (12Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13Gotoh T. Oyadomari S. Mori K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12343-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanism of the transition between these two opposite outcomes during the ER stress response is uncertain. Yeast genetic analyses have revealed that the UPR affects a wide variety of gene transcriptions regulating not only ER chaperones and protein degradation but also the early secretory pathway (14Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 15Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), suggesting that the UPR may involve the whole secretory pathway rather than just that portion within the ER. In fact, some misfolded proteins in mammalian cells (16Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T.

Caldwell S. Cooper A.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have been shown to be transported from the ER but were then retrieved to the ER. The yeast UPR is initiated by the activation of IRE1, which induces the synthesis of ER chaperones, although it does not seem to be accompanied by apoptosis (2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). ER luminal chaperones like BiP/Kar2 are localized in the ER partly because of the interaction with the ER matrix and partly because of the retrieval from the secretory pathway to the ER (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). These luminal chaperones have a carboxyl-terminal His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) amino acid sequence that is recognized by the transmembrane receptor, ERD2, in post-ER compartments when the chaperones are secreted from the ER (23Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast cells without the IRE1 gene are viable, and yeast cells bearing mutant alleles of the ERD2 gene in which ERD2-mediated retrieval is impaired are also viable; however, both mutations synthetically cause growth arrest. Thus, the secretion of ER chaperones and misfolded proteins from the early secretory pathway per se does not seem to be critical in yeast if the synthesis of chaperones is compensated for by the function of IRE1 (24Beh C.T. Rose M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9820-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mammalian ER luminal chaperones like BiP have a carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) amino acid sequence instead of HDEL (25Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), which is recognized by the KDEL receptor, the mammalian homologue of ERD2, in post-ER compartments including the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex when the chaperones are secreted from the ER (26Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). ER chaperones and the KDEL receptor are sorted into the transport vesicle coated with COPI complex and retrieved to the ER (27Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the KDEL receptor enhances mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling during the ER stress response, which affects the outcomes of the response. This finding reveals a novel function of the KDEL receptor; it modulates the ER stress response with its signaling function in addition to its retrieval function. Furthermore, it suggests diverse biological scenery where the ER stress response may be concerned in mammals, considering the pivotal roles of MAP kinase signaling such as development, cell differentiation, cell survival, and cell death (28Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar).

The following reagents were used: tunicamycin (Nacalai Tesque); dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma); p38 inhibitor (SB202190; Upstate Biotechnology); ERK inhibitor (PD 98059; Alexis); and JNK inhibitor II (SP600125, Calbiochem). Plasmids and Transfection—The following cDNAs were used. The carboxyl-terminal KDEL-lysozyme has been described previously (30Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), were gifts from H. R. B. Pelham (Cambridge, UK). Transfection with the calcium phosphate method was performed as described previously (30Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 625-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To generate a stable cell line, the Myc-tagged wild-type human KDEL receptor or a mutant R169N cDNA was co-transfected with a construct containing a hygromycin resistance gene into cells by using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were selected from a complete medium containing 0.5 mg ml–1 of hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were screened by immunofluorescence microscopy. Confocal and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells on coverslips were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then processed as described previously (30Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 625-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The labeled cells were examined using either a confocal laser scan microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss) fitted with krypton and argon lasers or a fluorescent microscope (DMRA2, Leica). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The cells were removed from the dishes, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 ml Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 ml NaCl, 10 μg ml–1 aprotinin, 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 1 ml sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mg ml–1 iodoacetamide. The cell lysates were incubated with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates and the culture media were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with antibody-coupled protein ASepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed and then boiled in a sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Western blotting was done as described previously (17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The signals were analyzed by LAS 1000 and Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Metabolic Labeling Experiment—The cells were preincubated in a labeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 2 ml glutamine, 50 μg ml–1 streptomycin, and 50 unit ml–1 penicillin G) for 20 min at 37 °C and labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) at 250 μCi ml–1 for 12 h. The cells were collected and lysed as above. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-KDEL receptor mAb or an anti-Myc mAb. The immunoprecipitates in a sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gels were then analyzed by BAS 2500 and Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Sucrose Gradient Experiment—A postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared and loaded on a continuous sucrose gradient (20–50%) as described previously (17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Twelve fractions were obtained from each sample. An aliquot of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the distribution of each protein was determined by Western blotting. Detection of Cell Death—The cells treated with tunicamycin (5 μg ml–1) or DTT (5 ml) for 0–60 h were collected, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. For the TUNEL assay, cells on coverslips were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained using a kit (in situ cell death detection kit, Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. For nuclear staining, the cells on the coverslips were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline and stained with 16 μl Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes). Northern Blot Analysis—The total RNA from the cells was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty micrograms of each RNA were separated on 1% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gels, transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary action, and cross-linked with UV light using a cross-linker (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed for 24 h at 65 °C in a hybridization buffer containing 20× SSC Denhardt's solution and herring sperm DNA with a 32P randomly labeled cDNA fragment. A rat cDNA encoding BiP was used for a probe. The hybridized membrane was washed at 65 °C with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The radioactive signals were analyzed by BAS 2500 and Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The blots were stripped and re-probed with a cDNA encoding murine β-actin to ensure the equivalent loading of RNA samples, and the expression level of BiP mRNA was normalized by the signal intensity of β-actin mRNA. Ligand Recognition by the KDEL Receptor Is Saturable— Transient transfection of the KDEL receptor results in various expression levels in HeLa cells. Overexpression of the KDEL receptor has been shown to enhance transport from the Golgi complex to the ER, which results in the redistribution of the whole Golgi complex to the ER (30Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 625-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); however, moderate expression of the KDEL receptor does not disturb the Golgi structure, and only those cells with moderate expression become stable transfectants (33Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the KDEL receptor in the ER stress response, we made HeLa cells that stably expressed either the wild-type or a mutant human KDEL receptor. This binding defective mutant, which had a single amino acid replacement (R169N), was localized to the Golgi complex as was the wild-type, but did not respond to the KDEL sequence effectively as described previously (32Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The transient expression of the lysozyme-KDEL in these stable cells induced the transport of the wild-type KDEL receptor, but not that of the mutant, to the ER (Fig. 1A). The lysozyme-KDEL was localized in the ER even in the mutant KDEL receptor cells, which indicates that minimal retrieval was maintained in these cells by the endogenous KDEL receptor. In fact, metabolic labeling experiments revealed that stably transfected KDEL receptors expressed at levels less than endogenous KDEL receptors in these cells (Fig. 1B). The expression of ER chaperones is induced extensively upon ER stress, which may saturate KDEL receptor-mediated retrieval because the expression of the KDEL receptor is not inducible in mammals (34Llewellyn D.H. Roderick H.L. Rose S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of ER stress on the distribution of BiP, an endogenous ligand of the KDEL receptor, in the secretory pathway by using sucrose gradient analysis in cells stably expressing the wild-type (Fig. 2A) or the mutant KDEL receptor (Fig. 2B). Although most endogenous BiP was found in the ER in the resting state, a significant amount was detected in the post-ER fractions of these cells when the cells were treated with tunicamycin, which prevented protein glycosylation in the ER and induced the UPR. Under these circumstances, we detected more BiP being secreted to the medium in the mutant KDEL receptor cells than in the HeLa cells and the wild-type KDEL receptor cells despite an equivalent expression level of BiP within these cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that ER chaperones associating with misfolded proteins might be secreted from the ER and retrieved by the KDEL receptor. When retrieval is limited, they may escape from the early secretory pathway, especially under stressed conditions. The Loss of BiP from the Early Secretory Pathway Causes Persistent UPR—The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER leads to the recruitment of BiP from ER transmembrane kinases such as ATF6 and IRE1, which results in the activation of these kinases and the synthesis of ER chaperones, including BiP (35Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). The loss of BiP in the early secretory pathway may enhance this process. We examined the induction of BiP gene transcription with Northern blot analysis. Although the BiP mRNA in all cells increased upon tunicamycin treatment, it was prominent and persistent in the mutant KDEL receptor cells (Fig. 3A). ATF6 is localized in the ER in the resting state, and its translocation to the Golgi upon ER stress has been shown to activate ATF6, resulting in the initiation of the UPR (36Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). We examined the localization of ATF6 in these cells by immunofluorescence upon acute ER stress with DTT, which disturbs proper protein folding in the ER. The ATF6 was translocated to the Golgi in HeLa cells. Moreover, in the mutant KDEL receptor cells the translocation was immediate and intense, whereas it was slower in the wild-type KDEL receptor cells (Fig. 3B). We also observed an increased phosphorylation of IRE1 upon tunicamycin treatment, even at the basal level, in the mutant KDEL receptor cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that retrieval by the KDEL receptor keeps BiP in the early secretory pathway efficiently and that impairment of the retrieval causes a loss of BiP there that induces intense UPR. Sensitization to ER Stress—We assessed whether retrieval by the KDEL receptor might contribute to cell survival in the UPR, because intense UPR due to an overexpression of ATF6 or IRE1 causes cell death (12Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13Gotoh T. Oyadomari S. Mori K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12343-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and the wild-type or the mutant KDEL receptor cells were treated with tunicamycin and DTT. Significantly, the mutant KDEL receptor cells were sensitive to ER stress, whereas cells expressing the wild-type tolerated the stress (Fig. 4A). By TUNEL assay, we detected more apoptotic features in the mutant KDEL receptor cells undergoing tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 4B). Hoechst 33258 staining revealed prominent, condensed chromatins and the fragmentation of nuclei in the mutant tunicamycin-treated KDEL receptor cells (Fig. 4C). These features were consistent with programmed cell death by ER stress (37Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). Although BiP expressed itself at an equivalent level in these different cells (Fig. 2C), the impairment of the retrieval led to intense UPR that sensitized the mutant KDEL receptor cells to ER stress, suggesting that the retrieval of BiP and misfolded proteins from post-ER compartments by the KDEL receptor plays a significant role in the ER stress response. The KDEL Receptor Enhances MAP Kinase Signaling—UPR signaling has been shown to be transduced through IRE1 to cytosolic factors such as TRAF2, caspase-12, and JNKs (38Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar, 39Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The transcriptional factor CHOP is also induced through IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 activation (9Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 12Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12343-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These signaling cascades have been shown to contribute to cell death during the ER stress response (37Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar, 39Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). We examined these death-related pathways in the HeLa cells after treating them with tunicamycin. We observed an enhanced expression of CHOP in the mutant KDEL receptor stable cells in comparison to the wild-type stable cells (Fig. 5, top panel). As for JNK activation, we found an increased phosphorylation of JNKs in the wild-type stable cells; however, in the mutant KDEL receptor cells, although JNK2 phosphorylation was enhanced in the resting state that accompanied the phosphorylation of c-Jun, the phosphorylation of JNK1 was suppressed (Fig. 5, bottom panel). This observation prompted us to examine other signaling molecules of MAPK cascades. Interestingly, we found that p38 MAP kinases were phosphorylated in the wild-type stable cells upon tunicamycin treatment; this accompanied the phosphorylation of ATF2, CREB (downstream effectors of p38), and MKK3/6 (kinases for p38), especially at 3–6 h after stimulation, but these phosphorylations were suppressed in the mutant stable cells despite an equivalent expression of BiP in the wild-type stable cells. Then, we assessed whether these differences in MAPK cascades activity might affect cell survival and death during the ER stress response. We examined the effects of p38 activation upon tunicamycin-induced cell death in HeLa cells by using a specific inhibitor for p38 (SB202190). Although SB202190 treatment alone did not affect cell viability, it significantly promoted tunicamycin-induced cell death in the HeLa cells (Fig. 6, A and B). As a control, treatment with a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and an ERK inhibitor (PD98059) had no significant effects (Fig. 6A). Next, we evaluated whether the activation of the KDEL receptor might induce the activation of p38 MAP kinases. We have shown previously that an artificial KDEL-tagged protein as well as endogenous KDEL proteins secreted from the ER were recognized by the KDEL receptor in post-ER compartments and retrieved to the ER. This process accompanied the activation of the KDEL receptor and its downstream signaling events such as the activation of a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) (17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably expressing the wild-type KDEL receptor and inducibly expressing the KDEL-tagged lysozyme by glucocorticoid responsive promoter (17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were treated with dexamethasone or tunicamycin. We found that the expression of the lysozyme-KDEL induced the accumulation of phosphorylated p38, although it did not induce the expression of BiP (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that activation of the KDEL receptor by endogenous ligands (such as BiP), possibly complexed to misfolded proteins (Fig. 5) and an artificial ligand (Fig. 6C), enhances the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinases and that p38 activation contributes to the resistance of HeLa cells to ER stress. MAPKs have diverse functions in mammals, and those functions are spatially and temporarily regulated (28Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). In fact, the activation of p38 MAP kinases has been shown to induce both cell survival (42Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and cell death (43Su H.L. Liao C.L. Lin Y.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4162-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of the KDEL receptor on MAPK signaling may cause different outcomes in other cell types. Taken together, these results indicate that the KDEL receptor modulates MAPK signaling during the ER stress response, which affects the outcomes of the response. In this study, we have shown that an overload of misfolded proteins and ER chaperones in the lumen of the ER upon ER stress induced their secretion out of the ER in mammalian cells. These proteins did not escape from the early secretory pathway entirely, because the KDEL receptor retrieved them from post-ER compartments and returned them to the ER. When the retrieval was limited during the ER stress response, which is demonstrated by the expression of a mutant KDEL receptor, the ER chaperones escaped further down the secretory pathway, and intense ER stress response was induced to compensate for the loss of BiP. The resultant outcomes are possibly cell survival and cell death. We found that activation of the KDEL receptor modulated the MAPK signaling, which affected the fate of the cells upon ER stress. Although yeast ERD2 is an essential protein for cell viability and preserving the Golgi morphology and function (23Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), its retrieval function has been revealed to be dispensable (44Hardwick K.G. Boothroyd J.C. Rudner A.D. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that the main function of ERD2 is not retrieval but rather maintaining Golgi membrane trafficking. Consistent with the yeast studies, we have found in mammals that the KDEL receptor mediates Golgi membrane trafficking through the regulation of ARF GAP1 (33Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the KDEL receptor mediating Golgi membrane trafficking is linked to the retrieval function, because stimulation by KDEL proteins, including artificial KDEL-tagged proteins (31Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 45Majoul I. Straub M. Hell S.W. Duden R. Soling H.D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as well as endogenous ER chaperones associating with misfolded proteins (17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), can activate the KDEL receptor and ARF GAP1 in post-ER compartments when they exit from the ER. As a result, ARF GAP1 is recruited from the cytosol to the membranes to promote the hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1 to GDP (46Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 47Aoe T. Huber I. Vasudevan C. Watkins S.C. Romero G. Cassel D. Hsu V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20545-20549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is required for the proper sorting of cargo proteins into COPI vesicles (48Lanoix J.

Premont R.T. Hsu V.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In fact, some misfolded proteins in mammalian cells (16Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 17Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T.

A. 2001; 98: 10710-10715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as well as in yeast (20Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Taxis C. Vogel F. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1806-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Haynes C.M. Caldwell S. Cooper A.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have been shown to leak out from the ER but then be retrieved to the ER. Thus, ER chaperones, accumulated in post-ER compartments and complexed to misfolded proteins, could be input signals that the KDEL receptor senses, and enhancing the COPI transport could be one of the outputs. The KDEL receptor is a multi-membranous intracellular receptor for ER chaperones with the KDEL sequence. The expectation that activation of the KDEL receptor by ligands may lead to multiple signal transduction events other than its interaction with ARF GAP1 is quite natural, considering the well characterized signal transduction pathways of cell surface receptors (50Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Although precise mechanisms remain uncertain, our study indicates that those signaling events have connections to MAPK signaling cascades. The cross talk between the ER stress response and MAPK cascades is well established in that IRE1 transduces the ER stress signals to ASK1 and JNK, which participates in cell death in neurogenic cells (38Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar, 41Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The KDEL receptor may modify such signaling or, alternatively, it may have other independent connections to MAPK cascades. What we found was that the mutant KDEL receptor suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinases and JNK1 but not JNK2. The selective suppression of p38 MAP kinases and JNK1, but not JNK2, has been reported in activated macrophages treated with anthrax lethal factor; this treatment results in the apoptosis of those macrophages (42Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The activation of the KDEL receptor may stimulate the MKKs for p38 as shown in Fig. 5, or it may also suppress the phosphatase function for p38 (51Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), because we observed an accumulation of phospho-p38 upon activation of the KDEL receptor by the ligand in Fig. 6C. These possibilities will be examined further. ER stress causes misfolded proteins and induces an expansion of ER chaperones. Among the chaperones, BiP has been acknowledged to be a sensor molecule in the UPR that initiates both survival and apoptotic responses. The mammalian UPR has been suggested to be a self-regulatory process. At rest, BiP associates with IRE1 and PERK kinases and suppresses their activity by preventing their self-oligomerization in the ER (35Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins caused by ER stress recruit BiP from these kinases, which activates the kinases and initiates the UPR, including the beneficial production of BiP and other ER chaperones for cell survival. In addition to that, BiP may function as a sensor in post-ER compartments, where it activates the KDEL receptor. What determines the survival or death of the cells is still one of the central questions in the ER stress response research (2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). At the successful termination of the ER stress response, the misfolded proteins are degraded or obtain correct folding, which releases BiP to bind with those kinases and repress their activity again (35Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if the stress continues or is beyond the capacity of the ER quality control, the overload of misfolded proteins seems to initiate an apoptotic process through the activation of the same kinases. The activation of IRE1 induces the expression of BiP as well as that of CHOP/GADD153, a transcription factor that causes Bcl-2 down-regulation and cell death (12Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 52McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). IRE1 also transduces signals to a cytosolic factor, TRAF2, that activates the JNK pathway (38Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar) as well as the caspase-12 dependent apoptotic pathway (39Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The loss of BiP from the early secretory pathway may enhance these processes, and, thus, the retrieval function of the KDEL receptor is important. Furthermore, our present study indicates that the signaling function of the KDEL receptor mediating MAPK cascades is also one of the critical factors that determine the fates of the cells during the ER stress response. MAPKs have been acknowledged to determine the fates of cells in diverse biological situations, including cell differentiation and development in addition to cell survival and cell death (28Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). One interesting assumption is that the way the KDEL receptor modulates MAPK activity shown in this study may also be involved in other diverse situations, which implies that the ER stress response may participate in many biological processes, physiological as well as pathological.

Shifting cell culture temperatures from 37 to 28 °C, implemented 24 h after transfections, was essential for detectable functional expression of NPR-1. AF9 treatments linked both cloned receptor variants to activation of Gi/Go proteins and cAMP inhibition, thus allowing for classification of NPR-1 as an inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor. The Val-215 receptor isoform displayed higher binding and functional activity than its Phe-215 counterpart. This finding parallels the in vivo observation of a more potent repression of social feeding by the npr-1 gene encoding the Val-215 form of the receptor, resulting in dispersing (solitary) animals. Since neuropeptide Y shows no sequence homology to AF9 and was functionally inactive at the cloned NPR-1, we propose to rename NPR-1 and refer to it as an AF9 receptor, AF9-R1.

The receptor in question is the putative C. elegans neuropeptide GPCR 1The abbreviations used were: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AF9, GLGPRPLRF-NH2; AF9-R1, AF9 receptor type 1; FaRP, FMRFamide-related peptide; flp, FMRFamide-like precursor protein gene; FLIPR, fluorescence imaging plate reader; NPR-1, neuropeptide Y-like receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; NPY, neuropeptide Y; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RAMP, receptor activity-modifying protein; CRLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; h, human.1The abbreviations used were: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AF9, GLGPRPLRF-NH2; AF9-R1, AF9 receptor type 1; FaRP, FMRFamide-related peptide; flp, FMRFamide-like precursor protein gene; FLIPR, fluorescence imaging plate reader; NPR-1, neuropeptide Y-like receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; NPY, neuropeptide Y; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RAMP, receptor activity-modifying protein; CRLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; h, human. (Wormpep designation C39E.6.6) with homology to the vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor family and therefore named NPR-1 (1de Bono M. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Natural variations of wild isolates have either Phe-215 or Val-215 in NPR-1, resulting in either “social” or “solitary” feeders, respectively (1de Bono M. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Possible roles of NPR-1 are highlighted by the finding that npr-1 knockout worms are strongly clumping, indicating that npr-1 functions to repress social feeding and aggregation. In transgenes that express NPR-1 in the npr-1 null background, both variants can repress social feeding, but Val-215-npr-1 does it more effectively (1de Bono M. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Two recent papers from the de Bono group (2Coates J.C de Bono M. Nature. 2002; 419: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3de Bono M. Tobin D.M. Davis M.W. Avery L. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2002; 419: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) provided further insight into the complex nature of genetic, molecular, and neural mechanisms involved in nematode social feeding. Evaluation of various mutant strains of C. elegans for mutations affecting social feeding led to the identification of other genes that co-localized or interacted with npr-1 in distinct sets of neurons. These findings point to a network of multiple interactions that control signals from the external environment as well as neuronal activity inside the body cavity of the worm that lead to worm aggregation into feeding groups (2Coates J.C de Bono M. Nature. 2002; 419: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3de Bono M. Tobin D.M. Davis M.W. Avery L. Bargmann C.I. Nature. 2002; 419: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, so far none of these studies proposed any link that would connect the two systems or suggest a possible role for the activation of NPR-1 by its cognate ligand in this process. Since the two strains behave similarly in the absence of food, it has been postulated that food might regulate secretion of a neuropeptide that acts through the NPR-1 receptor to result in different feeding patterns (1de Bono M. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Despite the publication of the C. elegans genome more than four years ago now (4The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar) and prediction of ∼50 putative peptide GPCRs in this nematode (5Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), there has been no report to date on any C. elegans neuropeptide GPCR (including NPR-1) successfully matched with its cognate ligand. This is in contrast to numerous orphan vertebrate GPCRs, which have been paired to their natural ligands by reverse pharmacology after heterologous receptor expression, in most cases, using mammalian cells (6Civelli O. Nothacker H.-P. Saito Y. Wang Z. Lin S.H.S. Reinscheid R.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 230-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We describe here the identification of AF9 (GLGPRPLRF-NH2), a nematode FMRFamide-related peptide (FaRP) with no homology to NPY (Fig. 1) as a ligand activating NPR-1. To our knowledge, this is the first successful functional heterologous expression of a C. elegans neuropeptide GPCR and the first account of pairing of any C. elegans FaRP receptor with its cognate ligand. Materials—Human NPY was from Sigma. Other synthetic peptides were custom made at Auspep Pty. Ltd. (Parkville, Australia). Mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO-10001A (7Gottesman M.M. LeCam A.

Ther. 1993; 267: 1573-1581PubMed Google Scholar) (referred to as CHO cells in the text) were a kind gift from Dr. Rita Huff. Cell culture media, transfection, and assay reagents were as described previously (9Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E Kubiak T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cloning and Plasmid Preparation—Molecular biological techniques followed either manufacturer's recommendations or general protocols (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidam J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1991Google Scholar). The open reading frame for npr-1 (C39E6.6) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned directly into the eucaryotic expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The only significant modification was the addition of an optimized translational initiation sequence immediately preceding the authentic initiation codon (GCC GCC ATG) (12Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). A clone was obtained that had the identical sequence to the Phe-215 npr-1 variant (1de Bono M. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to derive the corresponding Val-215 npr-1 variant. The DNA sequence of all constructs was confirmed before use in transfection studies. Details of molecular biological manipulations are available upon request. Cell Cultures, Cell Transfection, and Membrane Preparation—CHO-10001A cells were cultured and transfected as described (9Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E Kubiak T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kubiak T.M. Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Bannow C.A. Martin R.A. Zantello M.R. Lowery D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Phe-215-NPR-1/pCR3.1 or Val-215-NPR-1/pCR3.1 plasmids (5 μg of DNA/10-cm plate) were used for transfections. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and membranes were prepared as described (9Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E Kubiak T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In cases where the 37–28 °C shift was implemented, the transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h after transfection and then moved to a humidified 28 °C, 3% CO2 incubator for an additional 24 h before harvesting for membrane preparation. Radioligand Preparation and Receptor Binding via Scintillation Proximity Assay—[125I-Tyr°]AF9 was prepared by radioiodiation of YGLGPRPLRF-NH2 ([Y°]AF9) using the chloramine T procedure. The crude products were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18, 0.45 × 15 cm column using a 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.5/acetonitrile system. The radioactive fractions with retention time corresponding to that of the cold [3-monoiodoY°]AF9 standard were collected into vials containing capture buffer (0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Tween 20). The transfected cell membranes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking with wheat germ agglutinin-coated scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham Biosciences) in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) (200 μg of membrane protein/20 mg of beads/ml). After centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min, the beads were resuspended in the assay buffer. In saturation binding experiments, to each well in 96-well scintillation proximity assay plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland), we added 60 μl of the assay buffer, various concentrations of [125I-Tyr°]AF9 diluted into the assay buffer (20 μl), and 20 μl of the reconstituted membrane-coated scintillation proximity assay bead suspension (1.5 μg of membranes/150 mg of beads) to result in a total volume of 100 μl/well. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm AF9 at each radioligand concentration. Plates were counted on a Wallac 1450 Microbeta counter continuously, and the 2-h counts, corrected for nonspecific binding, were used for Kd and B max determinations. Competitive displacement methods were similar to those used for determination of the saturation curve except that a fixed [125I-Tyr0]AF9 dose was used (216 and 54 pm with Phe-215- and Val-215-NPR-1 membranes, respectively), added in 10 μl of assay buffer, and followed by the addition of increasing peptide concentrations, also in 10 μl of assay buffer. Total binding was determined in the absence of any peptides and was ∼10% of the label added with 80% specific binding at the highest peptide concentrations used (10 μm). [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—The GTPγS assay was carried out as described (9Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E Kubiak T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kubiak T.M. Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Bannow C.A. Martin R.A. Zantello M.R. Lowery D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In experiments evaluating hNPY as a potential antagonist, the Phe-215-NPR-1 membranes were incubated with varying concentrations of hNPY in the presence of 200 nm AF9. cAMP Assay—CHO cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected the next day with either the Phe-215-NPR-1/pCR3.1 or the Val-215-NPR-1/pCR3.1 (100 ng/well) plasmids using standard LipofectAMINE PLUS™ protocols. cAMP determinations were via the cAMP-Screen™ (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) (13Chiulli A.C. Trompeter K. Palmer M. J. Biomol. Screen. 2000; 5: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the 28 °C shift experiments, the transfected cells were moved to 28 °C at 24 h after transfection and incubated at 28 °C for an additional 24 h. The cells were then re-equilibrated to 37 °C for 1 h prior to the cAMP assay. Forskolin (5 μm) was used to stimulate cellular cAMP in the cAMP inhibition assays. Calcium Mobilization Assay—Assays were run using a 96-well fluorescence imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) essentially as described (9Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E Kubiak T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kubiak T.M. Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Bannow C.A. Martin R.A. Zantello M.R. Lowery D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) except that the transfected cells plated in 96-well plates were additionally incubated at 28 °C for 24 h prior to testing (72 h after transfection). Data Analysis—Dose-response curves were analyzed using non-linear regression analysis via Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). Each treatment was run in triplicate, values were expressed as means ± S.E. The calculated EC50, Kd, Ki , or B max values were considered statistically different (p = 0.05) when their 95% confidence limits did not overlap. Temperature-sensitive Functional Expression of NPR-1 and Receptor-Ligand Matching—The receptor-ligand matching was achieved by functionally expressing NPR-1 in mammalian cells using special cell culturing conditions. The cloned npr-1 genes, encoding the Phe-215 and Val-215 forms of the receptor, were transiently transfected into CHO cells, and a GTPγS assay was utilized as a readout for detection of receptor function based on agonist-driven stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes prepared from the transfected cells. A collection of about 200 synthetic peptides representing a variety of C. elegans and other invertebrate FaRPs (based on both the isolated and the predicted peptide sequences) was used as a source of potential matching ligands. Individual peptides were arranged into peptide pools of 5–7 peptides/group (each peptide at 5–6 μm) tested with plasma membranes prepared from the cells transiently transfected with NPR-1. In initial experiments, no stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding could be detected in response to peptide treatments when standard transfection and cell culture conditions at 37 °C were applied (Fig. 2A). However, when membranes were prepared from the Phe-215-NPR-1/CHO cells, which were moved to 28 °C at 24 h after transfection, and incubated at this lower temperature for an additional 24 h prior to cell harvesting, a 2.8-fold increase in the [35S]GTPγS binding was recorded for a single peptide pool (Fig. 2B, pool 7). AF9 was then found as the only active component in this pool, as identified in a subsequent deconvolution experiment run with individual peptides present in pool 7, each tested at 5 μm (Fig. 2C). It is important to stress that the observed AF9 activity was receptor-specific since it was detected only in the NPR-1/CHO membranes, whereas there was no response to AF9 when membranes from the untransfected CHO cells or CHO cells transfected with unrelated Drosophila neuropeptide GPCRs (9Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E Kubiak T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kubiak T.M. Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Bannow C.A. Martin R.A. Zantello M.R. Lowery D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were used as controls (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, the 37 to 28 °C shift consistently resulted in the elevated [35S]GTPγS binding. Without this cooling step, no stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by AF9 (5 μm) could be seen in most of the experiments, as reflected in the same basal and AF9-evoked activity in the 37 °C membranes, analogous to that depicted in Fig. 2A. Only occasionally, a weak signal was recorded (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the Val-215-NPR-1 membranes (data not shown). These findings indicate that at 37 °C, the receptor function was compromised, and the observed sporadic activity could be due to different receptor expression levels and efficiency of functional folding in transient transfection experiments. Evaluation of NPY for Activation of NPR-1—Human NPY did not trigger either Phe-215- or Val-215-NPR-1 stimulation when tested at concentrations up to 10 μm in the GTPγS assays carried out with membranes prepared from the transfected cells harvested after the implemented 37 to 28 °C temperature shift (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, hNPY did not show any antagonistic activity when tested with the Phe-215-NPR-1 (Fig. 3A) or Val-215-NPR-1 membranes stimulated with 200 nm AF9 (data not shown). In control experiments with the same plasma membranes as tested with hNPY, the AF9-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to the Phe-215- and Val-215-NPR-1 membranes was dose-dependent with calculated EC50 values of 59.4 and 2.5 nm, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). These results show that the assay conditions were suitable for detecting NPR-1 activation and confirm that hNPY was not able to functionally activate either variant of the NPR-1 receptor. Comparison of Functional Activity for the Phe-215- and Val-215-NPR-1 Variants—Direct quantitative comparisons of the Phe-215 and Val-215 receptor variants were complicated by the fact that the potency of AF9 varied due to the transient nature of transfections and the time of cell incubation at 28 °C. For example, in the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, the AF9 potency range (EC50 values) was from 59.4 to 391 nm in the Phe-215-NPR-1 and from 2.5 to 77 nm in the Val-215-NPR-1 membranes in various independent transfection experiments. Attempts to overcome this problem by creating clonal cell lines stably expressing each receptor were unsuccessful because only a small fraction of the transfected cells survived but then quickly lost the receptor function only after one or two passages. This was even worse when HEK-293 cells were used as a host since the inserted Phe-215- or Val-215-npr-1 genes caused cell death about 16–20 h after transfection. To minimize the variables of transient transfection, in direct receptor variant comparisons, the same CHO cell pool was used for transfections with the Phe-215- and Val-215-NPR-1 plasmids run in parallel, and identical conditions were utilized for the transfections and the subsequent cooling step before cell harvesting for membrane preparation. Membranes from transfected cells were normalized by their protein content, and the same amounts of membrane proteins were used for each receptor form. As depicted in Fig. 4A, in one of such GTPγS assays, AF9 was ∼42-fold more potent at the Val-215 receptor than the Phe-215 counterpart (EC50 values of 2.5 and 102.2 nm, respectively, p = 0.05). Similar results were obtained in three other independent experiments, performed in an analogous fashion, where the determined differences in the potency of AF9 to activate the Val-215- versus Phe-215-NPR-1 were in the 5–10-fold range (data not shown). Receptor Binding—Before [125I]YGLGPRPLRF-NH2 ([125 I-Tyr°]AF9) was used as a probe for binding, its cold iodo counterpart was functionally characterized in the [35S]GTPγS assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, [I-Y°]AF9 acted as a high potency functional agonist to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in the Phe-215-NPR-1 membranes and was indistinguishable from AF9 (EC50 values of 42.8 and 59.3 nm, p < 0.05, for [I-Y°]AF9 and AF9, respectively). This finding was confirmed in another independent transfection experiment with the determined EC50 values of 70 and 102.2 nm, p < 0.05, for [I-Y°]AF9 and AF9, respectively (Table I). [I-Y°]AF9 was also a full agonist at the Val-215 receptor, however, with the potency about 4-fold lower as compared with that of AF9 (EC50 values of 10.4 and 2.5 nm, respectively, p = 0.05) (Fig. 3B and Table I).Table ISummary of the [35S]GTPγS and receptor binding dataPeptide[35S]GTPγS binding EC50 (nm)Receptor bindingaSaturation binding with the radiolabel, [125I-Tyro]AF9.

Open table in a new tab In a saturation binding experiment, [125I-Tyr°]AF9 bound with about 4-fold higher affinity to the Val-215-NPR-1 membranes than to the Phe-215 preparations (Kd values of 59.5 and 227.2 pm, respectively, p = 0.05). The receptor density in the Val-215-NPR-1 membranes was about 1.7-fold higher than in the Phe-215-NPR-1 preparations (B max values of 1.5 and 0.9 pmol/mg of membrane protein, respectively, p = 0.05) (Fig. 4B and Table I). In the competition binding experiments shown in Fig. 4, C and D, AF9 was about 8-fold more potent at the Val-215- than at the Phe-215-NPR-1 (Ki values of 2.3 and 17.8 nm, respectively, p = 0.05) (Table I). All together, the receptor binding/competition and functional (GTPγS) results indicate that AF9 was significantly more potent at the Val-215-NPR-1 receptor. In the competition binding assay, carried out with both the Val-215- and the Phe-215-NPR-1 membranes, hNPY weakly competed with the radioactive probe, [125I-Tyr°]AF9. The calculated Ki values for hNPY at the Val-215 and Phe-215 receptors were 1.6 and 1.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D, and Table I). This makes hNPY 694- and 66-fold less potent than AF9 at the Val-215 and Phe-215 receptor, respectively, which might be not biologically relevant. Despite this weak binding to NPR-1, hNPY was unable to functionally activate this C. elegans GPCR, as determined in the GTPγS assay (Fig. 3, A and B). Evaluation of NPR-1 Signaling Pathways—AF9 did not increase intracellular cAMP in cells transfected with either Phe-215- or Val-215-NPR-1, indicating that Gs proteins were not involved in NPR-1 activation (data not shown). However, the AF9-evoked stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to the Phe-215-NPR-1 and Val-215-NPR-1 membranes was completely abolished by pertussis toxin treatments (Fig. 4A). This implicated Gi/Go proteins in both the activation of the receptors and cAMP inhibition as a major signaling pathway. An AF9 dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP release was detected in the CHO cells transiently transfected with either the Phe-215 or the Val-215 receptor variants, both at 37 and 28 °C (Fig. 5, A and B). Qualitatively, the inhibitory effects of AF9 at 37 °C (Fig. 5A) were more potent in the Val-215 than in the Phe-215 cells, and similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. However, quantitatively, the determined IC50 values for Phe-215- and Val-215-NPR-1 (4.1 and 0.42 nm, respectively) were not statistically different (overlapping 95% limits) due to a high noise level in the assay. Similarly, in the 28 °C membranes, both receptor variants showed no potency difference to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (IC50 values 0.58–0.71 nm, overlapping 95% confidence limits) (Fig. 5B). The assay noise originated from the fact that the cAMP inhibition was measured in a population of transfected and untransfected cells with the latter contributing to a high background and variability of the forskolin-induced cAMP, which could not be inhibited by AF9. Additionally, it is also possible that the cooling step could have helped with proper folding of the expressed nematode receptors, but at the same time, could have been detrimental to the activity of the mammalian adenyl cyclase in the CHO cells incubated at 28 °C. For this reason, the cAMP inhibition, as a further downstream effect, might not have paralleled the differences observed at the receptor and G protein levels. Attempts to overcome problems related to transient transfections by creating stable CHO cell lines expressing each receptor were unsuccessful, as mentioned earlier. It has been suggested (1de Bono M. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) that the two npr-1 alleles could activate different G proteins and different downstream signaling pathways since position 215 in NPR-1/AF9-R1 is predicted to be in the third intracellular loop, the region, which was shown to be important for coupling to G proteins in other GPCRs. This hypothesis was based on the report that an aromatic amino acid residue in an equivalent position in a muscarinic receptor resulted in the activation of a Gq/phospholipase-C/Ca+2 signaling pathway, whereas its counterpart having Val at this position did not couple to Gq (14Bluml K. Mutschler E. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 402-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2882-2885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since it is not uncommon that the same GPCR can couple to more than one signaling pathway, we also evaluated the Val-215 and Phe-215 receptors for possible AF9-induced intracellular Ca+2 mobilization using a fluorescence imaging plate reader. No increases in Ca+2 signal were seen in response to AF9 in the cells transiently transfected with either receptor variant (Phe-215 or Val-215) cultured either at 37 or 28 °C (data not shown).

The molecular mechanisms transforming the glomerular mesangial cell phenotype to cause nephropathy including diacylglycerol-sensitive protein kinase C (PKC) are still being defined. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been postulated as a unifying mechanism for HG-induced complications. We hypothesized that in HG an interaction between ROS generation, from NADPH oxidase, and PKC suppresses mesangial Ca2+ signaling in response to endothelin-1 (ET-1). In primary rat mesangial cells, growth-arrested (48 h) in 5.6 mm (NG) or 30 mm (HG) glucose, the total cell peak [Ca2+] i response to ET-1 (50 nm) was 630 ± 102 nm in NG and was reduced to 159 ± 15 nm in HG, measured by confocal imaging. Inhibition of PKC with phorbol ester down-regulation in HG normalized the ET-1-stimulated [Ca2+] i response to 541 ± 74 nm. Conversely, an inhibitory peptide specific for PKC-ζ did not alter Ca2+ signaling in HG. Furthermore, overexpression of conventional PKC-β or novel PKC-δ in NG diminished the [Ca2+] i response to ET-1, reflecting the condition observed in HG. Likewise, catalase or p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide normalized the [Ca2+] i response to ET-1 in HG to 521 ± 58 nm and 514 ± 48 nm, respectively. Pretreatment with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or rotenone did not restore Ca2+ signaling in HG. Detection of increased intracellular ROS in HG by dichlorofluorescein was inhibited by catalase, diphenyleneiodonium, or p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide. HG increased p47 phox mRNA by 1.7 ± 0.1-fold as measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR. In NG, H2O2 increased membrane-enriched PKC-β and -δ, suggesting activation of these isozymes. HG-enhanced immunoreactivity of PKC-δ visualized by confocal imaging was attenuated by diphenyleneiodium chloride. Thus, mesangial cell [Ca2+] i signaling in response to ET-1 in HG is attenuated through an interaction mechanism between NADPH oxidase ROS production and diacylglycerol-sensitive PKC.

Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). One of the phenotypic changes observed in mesangial cells exposed to HG is altered Ca2+ signaling. Several groups have shown that the Ca2+ signal induced by vasoactive compounds, including endothelin-1 (ET-1), is markedly reduced in the presence of HG. The mechanism(s) by which HG may depress Ca2+ signaling is unknown. One possible candidate is the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in HG. Mené et al. (2Mené P. Pugliese G. Pricci F. Di Mario U. Cinotti G.A. Pugliese F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that HG inhibits Ca2+ influx through store-operated channels via a PKC-dependent mechanism. An alternative postulate is the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been demonstrated to modify intracellular Ca2+ signaling responsiveness depending on the cell type, the species of ROS, and the magnitude and duration of ROS generation. HG induces dysfunction in mesangial cells and other target cells through enhanced synthesis of autocrine growth factors such as transforming growth factor-β1, ET-1, and altered signaling via pathways such as PKC (3Way K.J.

In the last few years, enhanced production of ROS in response to HG, identified in many target cells including mesangial cells (5Catherwood M.A. Powell L.A. Anderson P. McMaster D. Sharpe P.C.

Although ROS have been implicated in causing cell damage and apoptosis, they also play a physiological role in intracellular signaling pathways (10Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell Physiol.

In particular, several growth factors including ET-1, angiotensin II, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor stimulate production of ROS as second messengers (12Fei J. Viedt C.

Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In several cell types, signaled ROS production is due to activation of NADPH oxidase, a multicomponent enzyme (14Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Regul. Pept. 2000; 91: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In phagocytic cells, the multiple subunits of NADPH oxidase are localized in subcellular compartments. gp91 phox , the catalytic moiety of the phagocyte oxidase, and p22 phox associate to form a flavocytochrome in the plasma membrane. The cytosol components p47 phox , p67 phox , p40 phox , and the small GTPase, Rac1 (or Rac2), are recruited to the membrane for assembly of a fully active oxidase (15Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar, 17Forman H.J. Torres M. Fukuto J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In nonphagocytic cells, most of the subunits of NADPH oxidase have been identified, although the precise mechanisms of regulation are not completely understood. A functional glomerular mesangial NADPH oxidase has been inferred through the use of diphenyleneiodium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of flavoproteins, in response to cytokine (18Dorsam G. Taher M.M.

Jones O.T. Nakamura M. Kaever V. Resch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21025-21029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no report has described the role of NADPH oxidase in HG-induced altered mesangial cell phenotype. We reasoned that if HG causes enhanced and sustained ROS generation in mesangial cells, Ca2+ signaling responsiveness to ET-1 may be modified through a ROS-dependent mechanism.

Materials—The following materials were used: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen); fetal bovine serum (Winsent Inc.); fluo-3,5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR); endothelin-1, ionomycin, anti-PKC antibodies, DPI, catalase, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and rotenone (Sigma); anti-p47 phox (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch); RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD); RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); and p47 phox primers, p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide, and a cell-permeant myristoylated peptide that specifically inhibits PKC-ζ activity (31Dlugosz J.A. Munk S. Ispanovic E. Goldberg H.J. Whiteside C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F151-F163Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (The Centre for Applied Genomics, DNA Synthesis Facility, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Cell Culture—Primary rat mesangial cells were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat kidney glomeruli and characterized as previously described (32Hurst R.D. Stevanovic Z.S. Munk S. Derylo B. Zhou X. Meer J. Silverberg M. Whiteside C.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 759-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Passages 12–17 were used for all studies. Mesangial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum to confluence and then growth-arrested in 0.5% fetal bovine serum containing either 5.6 mm glucose (NG) or 30 mm glucose (HG) for 48 h. Confocal Imaging of Intracellular Ca2 + —Mesangial cells were cultured on glass coverslips to subconfluence under the above conditions and then loaded with 2.5 μm fluo-3 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing CaCl2) with 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 60 min at 37 °C. The coverslip was mounted in a chamber on the stage of a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 410; Düsseldorf, Germany), and the cells were imaged prior to and during the response to ET-1. Digitized images were captured every 15 s for 120 s. The digitized confocal images from basal condition and peak response of total cell [Ca2+] i were analyzed using Scion Image Analysis (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). For each condition, 30–35 cells from different coverslips of separate experiments were analyzed. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) was calculated as follows, [Ca2+]i=Kd(R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)×Sf2/Sb2(Eq. 1) where, Kd for fluo-3 was 320 nm (33Whiteside C. Munk S. Zhou X. Miralem T. Templeton D.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 14-25PubMed Google Scholar). The R min and R max represent the fluorescence ratios measured with excitation at 340/380 nm under minimum free Ca2+ (bound with EGTA) and maximum Ca2+ (ionomycin plus 10 mm CaCl2). S b2 represents the fluorescence at saturating Ca2+ levels. S f2 is the fluorescence at 380-nm excitation in the absence of Ca2+. Autofluorescence, measured by quenching fluo-3 with MnCl2, was subtracted from the R max and R min values (32Hurst R.D. Stevanovic Z.S. Munk S. Derylo B. Zhou X. Meer J. Silverberg M. Whiteside C.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 759-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dlugosz J.A. Munk S. Zhou X. Whiteside C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F423-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of GFP-PKC and PKC-ζ Inhibition— Mesangial cells were transiently transfected with either GFP-PKC-β or GFP-PKC-δ using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) as instructed by the manufacturer. To inhibit PKC-ζ activity, mesangial cells were pretreated with the PKC-ζ peptide inhibitor (Zi; 10 μm, 24 h) (31Dlugosz J.A. Munk S. Ispanovic E. Goldberg H.J. Whiteside C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F151-F163Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in HG. Cells were loaded with fluo-3 and imaged for Ca2+ response to ionomycin or ET-1. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Expression of p47phox and β-Actin—Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using RevertAid First strand synthesis kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After first-strand synthesis of DNA, 3 μl of cDNA was amplified by using specific primers selected on the basis of published sequences (35Huang C.K. Zhan L. Hannigan M.O. Ai Y. Leto T.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) including 5′-AATGTAGCTGACATCATGGGT-3′ and 5′-TCTAGGAGCTTATGAATGACC-3′ (320-bp product). The sequence for the β-actin primers is as follows: 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGACGATATGG-3′ and 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and bands corresponding to reverse transcriptase-PCR products were visualized by UV light. Confocal immunofluorescence of p47phox and PKC—Mesangial cells were cultured on coverslips to subconfluence and growth-arrested in 0.5% fetal bovine serum NG or HG. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol. To prevent nonspecific binding of antibody, cells were blocked with goat serum containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with anti-p47 phox monoclonal antibody or PKC-δ antibody. The primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody using confocal image analysis. Transient Expression of p47phox Antisense Oligonucleotide—Mesangial cells were grown to 80% confluence on coverslips and transiently transfected with either antisense or scrambled phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotide for p47 phox using Effectene or Fugene6 transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence to the p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide was derived from a published report by Bey and Cathcart (36Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence is as follows: TTCACCTGGCTGTCATTGG. Cells were transfected with a 5 μm concentration of the oligonucleotide for 48 h, and decreased expression of p47 phox protein was ascertained by immunoreactivity of p47 phox using confocal imaging. Measurement of ROS—Generation of intracellular ROS was measured with the fluoroprobe carboxymethyl-H2-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes). CM-H2DCF-DA is a nonpolar compound that is converted into a nonfluorescent polar derivative (CM-H2DCF-DA) by cellular esterases after incorporation into cells. CM-H2DCF-DA is rapidly oxidized to the fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein in the presence of intracellular ROS. Briefly, mesangial cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μmol/liter CM-H2DCF-DA in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in NG or HG (1, 3, 24, or 48 h). Fluorescence intensity was measured by confocal microscopy (Zeiss; excitation 488 nm, emission 513 nm). Average intensity for each experimental group of cells was determined using Scion Image Analysis software, and values were expressed as above control. As a positive control, cells were stimulated with 100 μm H2O2. Membrane-enriched Cellular Fraction—To obtain membrane fractions, mesangial cells grown on 10-cm plates were lysed in ice-cold buffer A containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter benzamidine, 1 mmol/liter NaF, vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were disrupted by passage through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (TL-100; Beckman Instruments Canada, Mississauga, Canada). The pellet was resuspended in buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as the plasma membrane enriched fraction. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using InStat 2.01 statistics software (Graph Pad, Sacramento, CA). The means of three or more groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance. If significance of p < 0.05 was obtained in the analysis of variance, the Tukey multiple comparison post-test was applied. Differences described as significant are p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated. Ca2 + Signaling in NG and HG in Response to Ionomycin—To study Ca2+ signaling, mesangial cells were grown on glass coverslips and growth-arrested in 5.6 mm (NG) glucose or 30 mm (HG) glucose for 48 h and stimulated with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Ca2+ release was determined by converting the mean pixel intensity of the entire cell into values [Ca2+] i expressed in nm using the calibration formula (32Hurst R.D. Stevanovic Z.S. Munk S. Derylo B. Zhou X. Meer J. Silverberg M. Whiteside C.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 759-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no difference between the Ca2+ response in NG and HG to ionomycin at 100 nm (data not shown). However, at a low concentration of ionomycin (12.5 nm), the peak total cell [Ca2+] i response in NG was 657 ± 86 nm, and in HG, the response was reduced to 346 ± 22 nm (Fig. 1). DAG-sensitive PKC Inhibition Reverses HG-suppressed Ca2 + Release in Response to ET-1—To study the Ca2+ response of mesangial cells to the vasoactive peptide ET-1, cells were grown on glass coverslips and growth-arrested in NG or HG glucose for 48 h and stimulated with ET-1 (50 nm). In all experiments, values from total cell [Ca2+] i release from basal and peak response are reported. In NG, the total cell peak [Ca2+] i response to ET-1 (50 nm) was 630 ± 102 nm, which was attenuated to 159 ± 15 nm in HG (p < 0.001 versus NG peak) (Fig. 2). To determine whether PKC was involved in decreased Ca2+ signaling in HG, we down-regulated DAG-sensitive PKC isozymes by chronic treatment of PMA (100 nm) in HG for 48 h. Inhibition of PKC reversed the effect seen in HG. The peak total cell [Ca2+] i response was elevated to 541 ± 74 nm (p < 0.01 versus HG peak) (Fig. 2). Since chronic PMA down-regulates only DAG-sensitive PKC isozymes, the role of PKC-ζ in Ca2+ signaling was ascertained using a cell-permeant myristoylated peptide inhibitor, previously demonstrated to be specific for this PKC isozyme (31Dlugosz J.A. Munk S. Ispanovic E. Goldberg H.J. Whiteside C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F151-F163Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were growth-arrested in HG with or without the PKC-ζ inhibitor (Zi; 10 μm, 24 h). Pretreatment with the PKC-ζ inhibitor in HG did not alter Ca2+ signaling in response to ET-1 (268 ± 31 nm, p < 0.01 versus NG peak) (Fig. 2). To further support a role of DAG-sensitive PKC isozymes in Ca2+ release in response to ET-1, mesangial cells were transiently transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-PKC-β or GFP-PKC-δ to represent both the conventional and novel class of PKC isozymes. Mesangial cells expressed functional GFP-PKC-δ and -δ in these experiments as they responded to PMA (1 μm, 10 min) stimulation by translocating to the membrane, the hallmark of PKC activation (Fig. 3). In fluo-3-loaded cells, expression of the GFP-PKC constructs was clearly distinguishable from the surrounding cells (Fig. 4). When stimulated with ET-1, cells transfected with either GFP-PKC-β or GFP-PKC-δ displayed a blunted Ca2+ response (Fig. 4A). This was particularly evident in the nucleus. Conversely, when cells were stimulated with ionomycin (25 μm), all cells responded, including the transfected ones, with a robust intranuclear release of Ca2+ (Fig. 4B). Thus, the transfection procedure did not affect the loading of fluo-3.Fig. 4Overexpression of GFP-PKC-β or GFP-PKC-δ attenuated the Ca2+ response in NG. Mesangial cells were transfected with GFP-PKC-β or GFP-PKC-δ in NG, loaded with fluo-3, and stimulated with ET-1 or ionomycin. A, GFP-β transfected cells during ET-1 stimulation are indicated by an arrow. B, GFP-δ transfected cells during ET-1 stimulation are indicated by an arrow.

HG caused increased ROS generation as measured by DCF intensity as early as 1 h (Fig. 5). The effect was sustained in long term incubation with HG up to 48 h (Fig. 5). When cells were pretreated with catalase (100 units, 1 h) or DPI (1 μm, 1 h), HG-induced ROS generation was significantly reduced (control: 41 ± 1 S.E. mean pixel intensity/cell, n = 73 cells; HG: 150 ± 5, n = 90 cells, p < 0.001 versus NG; HG + catalase: 16 ± 2, n = 122 cells, p < 0.001 versus HG; and HG + DPI: 37 ± 3, n = 83 cells, p < 0.001 versus HG) (Fig. 6).Fig. 6HG-induced increase of ROS is inhibited by catalase and DPI.

Confocal immunofluorescence imaging showed that mesangial cells indeed express p47 phox , which is localized in a perinuclear pattern (Fig. 7). HG caused increased intensity of the staining. Semiquantitative analysis indicates that the mean pixel intensity per cell in NG was 73 ± 2 S.E., whereas in HG, the value was 110 ± 2 S.E. (100 cells analyzed, p < 0.01) (Fig. 7). To address the precise function of p47 phox , mesangial cells were transiently transfected with p47 phox antisense oligonucleotides. Fig. 7 shows that this method was sufficient to reduce expression of p47 phox protein, normally found in a perinuclear distribution. Since both catalase and DPI prevented HG-induced ROS production, the function of NADPH oxidase was further investigated. Fig. 8 shows that the HG-enhanced DCF fluorescence (144 ± 5, pixel intensity/cell, n = 119 cells) was inhibited when mesangial cells were transfected with p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide (45 ± 2, p < 0.001 versus HG, n = 126 cells). Transfection of the scrambled version of p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide did not reduce DCF fluorescence (166 ± 6, p < 0.001 versus NG, n = 34 cells). Inhibition of ROS Formation Reverses the Effect of HG on Ca2 + Signaling in Response to ET-1—To determine the role of ROS on the observed reduced Ca2+ signaling, mesangial cells were growth-arrested in HG and then treated with the addition of catalase (100 units, 1 h). In these experiments, the peak total cell [Ca2+] i response in NG to ET-1 (50 nm) was 446 ± 79 nm. In HG, the effect was reduced to 146 ± 13 nm. Catalase significantly rescued the ET-1-induced Ca2+ response in HG to 521 ± 58 nm (p < 0.001 versus HG peak without catalase) (Fig. 9). To further elucidate the role of ROS in Ca2+ signaling, particularly to determine whether the p47 phox subunit of NADPH oxidase is necessary for the effect of HG on Ca2+ release, mesangial cells were transiently transfected with p47 phox antisense oligonucleotides in HG and stimulated with ET-1. In NG, the peak total cell [Ca2+] i response was 426 ± 34 nm. In HG, the peak was reduced to 177 ± 17 nm. Inhibition of p47 phox by down-regulation with antisense oligonucleotides reversed the effect of HG to a level that was not significantly different than the response seen in NG (514 ± 48 nm, p < 0.001 versus HG peak) (Fig. 10). Transfection of the scrambled (SCR) version of p47 phox antisense oligonucleotide did not reverse the decreased [Ca2+] i observed in HG (144 ± 16 nm, p < 0.001 versus peak NG + ET-1) (Fig. 10). Thus, ROS derived from NADPH oxidase plays a pivotal role in the reduced Ca2+ response in HG. Since several reports demonstrated the importance of ROS derived from a mitochondrial source in the diabetic milieu, we tested the effects of CCCP, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, and rotenone on Ca2+ signaling in response to ET-1. These experiments were performed using measangial cells in passages 19–21. In these experiments, the peak total cell [Ca2+] i response was 173 ± 10 nm, which was significantly attenuated to 88 ± 10 nm (p < 0.05 versus peak NG + ET-1) in HG (Fig. 11). CCCP (100 nm, 1 h) did not significantly alter the peak total cell [Ca2+] i in NG (187 ± 14 nm, p > 0.05 versus peak NG + ET-1) or in HG (103 ± 17 nm, p > 0.05 versus peak HG + ET-1) (Fig. 11). Pretreatment with rotenone (1 μg/ml, 1 h) decreased the basal and peak total cell [Ca2+] i in NG and was therefore not used in HG. Effect of PKC Down-regulation on p47phox mRNA Expression and ROS on PKC Activation—To determine the effect of HG on p47 phox expression, mesangial cells were growth-arrested in NG or HG, and p47 phox mRNA was measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR. HG increased p47 phox mRNA by 1.7 ± 0.1-fold over control (Fig. 12). To determine whether PKC plays a role in HG-increased p47 phox mRNA expression, mesangial cells were pretreated with chronic PMA exposure (100 nm, 48 h). Fig. 12 shows that down-regulation of mesangial cell PKC did not alter the effect of HG regulation on p47 phox mRNA (1.9 ± 0.4"

Since growth hormone (GH) regulates multiple transcription factors including C/EBPβ, the effect of GH on the subcellular localization of C/EBPβ was examined in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence shows that C/EBPβ is diffusely distributed in nuclei of quiescent cells. Within 5 min of GH treatment, the diffuse pattern dramatically becomes punctate. The relocalization of C/EBPβ coincides with DAPI staining of heterochromatin. Further, C/EBPβ and heterochromatin protein (HP)-1α colocalize in the nucleus, consistent with localization of C/EBPβ to pericentromeric heterochromatin. In contrast, C/EBPδ exhibits a diffuse distribution in the nucleus that is not modified by GH treatment. C/EBPβ is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on a conserved MAPK consensus site in response to GH (Piwien-Pilipuk, G., MacDougald, O. A., and Schwartz, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 44557–44565). Indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for C/EBPβ phosphorylated on the conserved MAPK site shows that GH also rapidly induces a punctate pattern of staining for the phosphorylated C/EBPβ. In addition, phosphorylated C/EBPβ colocalizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin. The satellite DNA present in heterochromatin contains multiple C/EBP binding sites. DNA binding analysis shows that C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPα (p42 and p30 forms) can bind to satellite DNA as homo- or heterocomplexes in vitro. Importantly, GH rapidly and transiently increases binding of endogenous C/EBPβ from 3T3-F442A cells to satellite DNA. Further, the GH-promoted nuclear relocalization of C/EBPβ to pericentromeric heterochromatin was prevented by the MEK inhibitor U0126. This observation suggests that GH-dependent MAPK activation plays a role in the regulation of nuclear relocalization of C/EBPβ. Nuclear redistribution introduces a new level of transcriptional regulation in GH action, since GH-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear redistribution of C/EBPβ may be coordinated to achieve spatial-temporal control of gene expression.

Nuclear redistribution introduces a new level of transcriptional regulation in GH action, since GH-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear redistribution of C/EBPβ may be coordinated to achieve spatial-temporal control of gene expression. Chromatin is organized into higher order fibers in interphase chromosomes, which localize into discrete territories, providing an excellent scenario for establishing spatio-temporal regulation of gene transcription (1Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 2Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. MacLean N.A. Boisvert F. Lever M.A. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulatory proteins are generally restricted to several hundred discrete foci throughout the nucleoplasm (3Grande M.A. van der Kraan I. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, foci rich in some transcription factors such as E2F-1 or Oct1 show only minor overlap with sites of transcription or RNA polymerase II (3Grande M.A. van der Kraan I. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar), whereas steroid hormone receptors and RNA polymerase II show significant colocalization (5van Steensel B. van Binnendijk E.P.

Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of the transcription factor-rich foci in the nucleus that do not contain RNA polymerase II or nascent RNA is unclear. A simple explanation is that foci represent nonchromatin structures that function in the regulation of nucleoplasmic concentrations of gene regulatory factors and/or the assembly of multimolecular transcription factor complexes. This subnuclear organization of multimolecular complexes may dynamically participate in regulating the patterns of gene expression that are established and maintained during cellular differentiation. This level of regulation of gene expression may work coordinately in conjunction with changes in chromatin organization, establishing “open” or “closed” states for transcription. Among the nuclear proteins that participate in the regulation of gene expression is CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SFC, splicing factor compartment; HP, heterochromatic protein; GH, growth hormone; LAP, liver-enriched-activating protein; LIP, liver-enriched inhibitory protein. β, a transcription factor that belongs to the bZIP family of transcription factors (7Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ has three alternate translation products: 35- and 32-kDa proteins in murine cells known as LAP (Liver-enriched-activating protein) and a 20-kDa protein known as LIP (liver-enriched inhibitory protein) (8Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of LAP contains the transactivation domain, whereas LIP lacks this transactivation domain and acts as an inhibitor of transcription (8Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ plays an important role during differentiation of a number of cell types (9Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

The participation of C/EBPβ in a wide variety of physiological events suggests that multiple features of its regulation may contribute to diverse biological outcomes. One mode of regulation of C/EBPβ is by phosphorylation. It has recently been shown that C/EBPβ is present in multiple forms that exhibit different degrees of phosphorylation in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes (18Piwien-Pilipuk G. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44557-44565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of murine (m)LAP on Thr188 and mLIP on Thr37 is rapidly and transiently (5–15 min) induced by GH, as well as other agonists such as IGF-1 and PDGF. Phosphorylation of LAP at the MAPK site is required for LAP to be transcriptionally active in the context of the c-fos promoter (18Piwien-Pilipuk G. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44557-44565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequently, GH induces dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ, which leads to an increase in DNA binding of LAP complexes (19Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31597-31604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The GH-induced dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ is mediated, at least in part, by GH-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, resulting in inhibition of GSK-3 (20Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). C/EBPs play a central role in adipocyte differentiation (11Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 21Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) during which their nuclear localization changes. C/EBPβ and δ, which are diffusely distributed in the nuclei of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, acquire a punctate pattern of nuclear distribution 12–24 h after induction of differentiation, which corresponds to localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin (22Tang Q.-Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Further, C/EBPα also localizes in areas of pericentromeric heterochromatin concomitant with cessation of mitotic clonal expansion of the cells (22Tang Q.-Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the subnuclear distribution of C/EBPs may be associated with their roles during differentiation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the nuclear redistribution of C/EBPs. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts undergo GH-dependent adipocyte differentiation (23Morikawa M. Nixon T. Green H. Cell. 1982; 29: 783-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Nixon T. Green H. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In 3T3-F442A preadipocytes GH priming is required before induction of terminal differentiation (26Guller S. Corin R.E. Mynarcik D.C. London B.M. Sonenberg M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Yarwood S.J. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Houslay M.D. Kilgour E. Anderson N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8662-8668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, GH accounts for ∼60% of the differentiation-promoting activity in the serum (24Nixon T. Green H. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The present study examines the nuclear distribution of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, and how their distribution is regulated in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes in response to GH. C/EBPβ was found to exhibit a primarily diffuse and minutely speckled pattern of nuclear distribution in quiescent 3T3-F442A cells. Upon treatment with GH the diffuse pattern of C/EBPβ rapidly and dramatically changes to a punctate one. C/EBPβ relocalizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin, consistent with colocalization of C/EBPβ with markers for heterochromatin. On the other hand, C/EBPδ exhibits a diffuse nuclear distribution both in the presence and absence of GH. The rapid nuclear relocalization of C/EBPβ is blocked by MAPK inhibitors, suggesting that MAPK activation is required for GH-induced nuclear redistribution of C/EBPβ. Thus, tight regulation of transcription factor phosphorylation and subcellular redistribution may be coordinated to achieve spatial-temporal control of gene expression in response to a physiological stimulus such as GH.

Indirect Immunofluorescence—3T3-F442A cells were grown on coverslips in DMEM complete medium for 24 h, prior to 18 h of serum deprivation in DMEM with 1% BSA instead of serum. Cells were then treated with or without GH 500 ng/ml (23 nm) for the indicated periods of time. The coverslips were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and simultaneously fixed and permeabilized by immersion in cold methanol (–20 °C) for 2 h.

Coverslips were washed in PBS 1% BSA and counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). Dual-colored staining employed appropriate species-specific reagents, in which specificity was verified in control stainings. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 META.

Cells were transferred to tubes and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. Samples were homogenized (10 times) using a Dounce homogenizer with a loose pestle and were centrifuged 30 s at 13,000 rpm.

In some experiments, cell extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 μl of anti-CEBPβ (1:10 dilution), anti-P-C/EBPβ (1:10 dilution), anti-CREB (1:10 dilution), or anti ELK-1 (1:10 dilution) prior to EMSA, as indicated in figure legends. Complexes were separated by nondenaturing 7% PAGE followed by autoradiography. GH Promotes Nuclear Redistribution of C/EBPβ—The nucleus is highly organized and nuclear molecules exhibit a high mobility throughout the nucleoplasm to find their targets (29Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Nuclear compartments are therefore determined by the functional status of exchanging proteins which determines the composition, morphological appearance, and possibly function of a compartment. Since C/EBPβ is a ubiquitously distributed transcription factor regulated by GH by changes in its phosphorylation state (18Piwien-Pilipuk G. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol.

Indirect immunofluorescence reveals that C/EBPβ is localized in the nucleus of quiescent 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (Fig. 1a, panel A) showing a predominantly diffuse, minutely speckled distribution. GH treatment of the cells for as little as 5 min rapidly changes the nuclear pattern from diffuse to punctate (Fig. 1a, panel B versus A). Foci of intense staining (20–26 per nucleus) were seen within the nuclei of all cells examined. The nucleoli of cells were excluded from staining. The punctate pattern persists for 1–6 h of GH treatment (data not shown). In addition, the same punctate pattern of nuclear staining is observed when 3T3-F442A cells were treated with IGF-1 or PDGF (data not shown). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (Fig. 1a, panels E and F), whose bright fluorescent condensations in murine nucleus correspond to heterochromatic DNA located at centromeric regions of interphase chromosomes (30Miller O.J.

Cell Res. 1988; 179: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Merging of immunofluorescense for C/EBPβ (panel A) and DAPI (panel E) in control cells shows no coincidence (panel I). However, overlay of nuclear images from cells treated with GH (panels B and F) shows that C/EBPβ and DAPI staining do coincide (Fig. 1a, panel J), suggesting that GH promotes the relocalization of C/EBPβ to areas of heterochromatin. To examine further the relocalization of C/EBPβ to pericentromeric heterochromatin, heterochromatin protein 1-α (HP-1α), a constitutive non-histone heterochromatin protein (33Wreggett K.A. Hill F.

Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was labeled with anti-HP-1α antibodies. HP-1α exhibits the same pattern of distribution as C/EBPβ in cells treated with GH (Fig. 1a, panel D versus B), but not in control cells (panel C versus A). Merging of nuclear images shows coincidence of C/EBPβ and HP-1α only in GH-treated cells (Fig. 1a, panel H) but not in control cells (panel G), reinforcing that GH promotes the redistribution of C/EBPβ to areas of pericentric heterochromatin. C/EBPβ also colocalizes with kinetocore proteins known to be associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin as observed by labeling with a serum containing human autoantibodies against centromeric kinetocore proteins (data not shown). The intracellular localization of C/EBPβ was also confirmed by cell fractionation. C/EBPβ is a nuclear but not cytoplasmic protein in the absence (Fig. 1b, lane 5) or presence of GH (60 min) (Fig. 1b, lane 6), in agreement with indirect immunofluorescence. The immunoblot shows a GH-induced shift in the migration (bands a to b) of each of the three forms of C/EBPβ, consistent with GH-promoted dephosphorylation after 60 min in 3T3-F442A cells, as previously reported (18Piwien-Pilipuk G.

Taken together these results demonstrate that in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes C/EBPβ is a nuclear protein, which undergoes a rapid nuclear relocalization to pericentric heterochromatin upon GH treatment. C/EBPβ Foci Are Not Associated with Splicing Factor Compartments (SFCs)—Numerous studies have localized sites of active transcription, measured as [3H]uridine or Br-UTP incorporation into nascent RNA transcripts, at the periphery of nuclear domains enriched in splicing factors (35Wei X. Somanathan S. Samarabandu J. Berezney R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), called SFCs (36Spector D.L. Fu X.D. Maniatis T.

SFCs may serve as storage sites from which splicing factors are recruited to adjacent active transcription sites (38Misteli T. Caceres J.F. Spector D.L. Nature. 1997; 387: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Since splicing can take place as a co-transcriptional event coordinating splicing and transcription (37Misteli T. Spector D.L.

Double immunostaining for C/EBPβ (Fig. 2, panels A and B) and SC-35 (panels C and D) shows no colocalization of these two nuclear proteins, as observed when the nuclear images are merged (Fig. 2, panels G and H), indicating that neither"
https://openalex.org/W2064608584,"The nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule HLA-E acts as a ligand for CD94/NKG2 receptors on the surface of natural killer cells and a subset of T cells. HLA-E presents closely related nonameric peptide epitopes derived from the highly conserved signal sequences of classical major histocompatibility complex class I molecules as well as HLA-G. Their generation requires cleavage of the signal sequence by signal peptidase followed by the intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease, signal peptide peptidase. In this study, we have assessed the subsequent proteolytic requirements leading to generation of the nonameric HLA-E peptide epitopes. We show that proteasome activity is required for further processing of the peptide generated by signal peptide peptidase. This constitutes the first example of capture of a naturally derived short peptide by the proteasome, producing a class I peptide ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2076054059,"In breast cancer cells, 17-beta-estradiol (E2) upregulates the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a molecule transmitting insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signals through the PI-3K/Akt survival pathways. The stimulation of IRS-1 by E2 has been documented on the transcriptional level. Here we studied whether the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha affects IRS molecules post-transcriptionally. We used ER-alpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 cells with re-expressed ER-alpha. In MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under serum-free conditions, IRS-1 and IRS-2 were degraded through the 26S proteasome and calpain pathways. Re-expression of ER-alpha in MDA-MB-231 cells correlated with enhanced stability of IRS molecules. This effect coincided with significantly reduced ubiquitination of IRS-1 and IRS-2, but did not involve increased IRS-1 and IRS-2 transcription. The interference of ER-alpha with IRS-1 and IRS-2 turnover could rely on the competition for common degradation pathways, as in MDA-MB-231/ER cells, ER-alpha processing was blocked by proteasome and calpain inhibitors. Notably, a fraction of the cytosolic ER-alpha colocalized and coprecipitated with IRS-1 and IRS-2, indicating a possible common destination for these proteins. The stabilization of IRS-1 in MDA-MB-231/ER cells was paralleled by the upregulation of the IRS-1/Akt/GSK-3 pathway and improved survival in the presence of IGF-I, whereas IRS-2 was not involved in IGF-I signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1972354097,"Oxidative lipid membrane damage is known to promote the misfolding of Aβ42 into pathological β structure. In fully developed senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, however, it is the shorter and more soluble amyloid β protein, Aβ40, that predominates. To investigate the role of oxidative membrane damage in the misfolding of Aβ40, we have examined its interaction with supported lipid monolayer membranes using internal reflection infrared spectroscopy. Oxidatively damaged lipids modestly increased Aβ40 accumulation, with adsorption kinetics and a conformation that are distinct from that of Aβ42. In stark contrast, pretreatment of oxidatively damaged monolayer membranes with Aβ42 vigorously promoted Aβ40 accumulation and misfolding. Pretreatment of saturated or undamaged membranes with Aβ42 had no such effect. Parallel studies of lipid bilayer vesicles using a dye binding assay to detect fibril formation and electron microscopy to examine morphology demonstrated that Aβ42 pretreatment of oxidatively damaged membranes promoted the formation of mature Aβ40 amyloid fibrils. We conclude that oxidative membrane damage and Aβ42 act synergistically at an early stage to promote fibril formation by Aβ40. This synergy could be detected within minutes using internal reflection spectroscopy, whereas a dye-binding assay required several days and much higher protein concentrations to demonstrate this synergy.

Extracellular amyloid deposits known as senile or neuritic amyloid plaques are one of the defining histopathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ40 and Aβ42, amyloid β protein with 40 and 42 residues, respectively; APP, amyloid precursor protein; ATIR-FTIR, attenuated total internal reflectance-Fourier transform infrared; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoholine; SAPC, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene. The core of a neuritic plaque is a compact heterogeneous meshwork in which fibrillar forms of amyloid β (Aβ) proteins predominate. The best characterized Aβ proteins are 40 and 42 residues in length, varying at their COOH terminus. The 40-residue Aβ protein (Aβ40) and various amino- and carboxyl-terminal derivatives appear to be the predominant Aβ protein in the amyloid plaques of AD (1Mori H. Takio K. Ogawara M. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17082-17086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits (2Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K.

The 42-residue Aβ protein (Aβ42) appears to associate with GM1 ganglioside and is the predominate Aβ species in diffuse plaques (2Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y.

Because of its prevalence in early appearing lesions, its lower solubility, and its tendency to form and stimulate the formation of fibrillar aggregates, it has been proposed that Aβ42 serves to nucleate amyloid plaque formation (8Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar, 9Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T.

A model of this process appears to occur in solution, wherein a nucleation-dependent step in the process of fibril formation from Aβ proteins has been observed (8Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar, 10Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). This prompts one to look for conditions that promote nucleation by serving as “surrogate nuclei” or “folding templates.” Strategies to design synthetic templates for β sheet formation have been explored (12Nesloney C.L. Kelly J.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 739-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Choo D.W. Schneider J.P. Graciani N.R. Kelly J.W. Macromolecules. 1996; 29: 355-366Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such templates need not be large, inasmuch as some rather small ligands are known to promote fibril formation (14Kuner P. Bohrmann B. Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Huber G. Celenk S. Gruninger-Leitch F. Richards J.G. Jakob-Roetne R. Kemp J.A. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1673-1678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The possibility that lipid membranes might serve as templates or nucleation sites for Aβ proteins was suggested nearly a decade ago (8Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar), and an abundance of circumstantial evidence has appeared in the interim suggesting that lipid membranes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. For example, the Aβ proteins that aggregate into fibrils, toxic or otherwise, are derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), a membrane-anchored protein. Following its cleavage, Aβ proteins are associated with detergent-resistant lipid membrane domains in the brain (15Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W.M. Lansbury P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), specific lipid components (5Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), or even its membrane-anchored parent, APP (16Lorenzo A. Yuan M.L. Zhang Z.H. Paganetti P.A. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Mautino J. Sol V. Sommer B. Yankner B.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Lipid membranes of varying composition strongly influence the rate at which Aβ proteins form fibrils (17Choo-Smith L.P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Choo-Smith L.P. Surewicz W.K.

Ultrastructural studies suggest that fibril formation tends to occur first in portions of diffuse deposits that are closest to membranes (21Natte R. Yamaguchi H. Maat-Schieman M.L.C. Prins F.A.

Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and that intermediate forms give rise to pore-like assemblies within membranes (24Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that oxidatively damaged lipid membranes are much more effective than ordinary membranes at adsorbing Aβ proteins, and at misfolding them into pathological β structure (25Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10011-10016Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This observation brings to mind the associations previously noted between oxidative stress, metal ions, and the toxicity of Aβ or APP (26White A.R. Multhaup G. Maher F. Bellingham S. Camakaris J. Zheng H. Bush A.I. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9170-9179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lynch T. Cherny R.A. Bush A.I. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and indirect measures of lipid peroxidation that have more recently showed that oxidative stress correlates with amyloid plaque formation in animal models (28Pratico D. Uryu K. Leight S. Trojanowswki J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4183-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and with disease severity in humans (29Pratico D. Clark C.M. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that vitamin E, a lipophilic antioxidant, is relatively deficient in the post-mortem brain tissue of patients of Alzheimer's disease (30Zaman Z. Roche S. Fielden P. Frost P.G. Niriella D.C. Cayley A.C. Age Ageing. 1992; 21: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and its administration in pharmacological doses appears to slow the clinical progression of disease (31Sano M. Ernesto C. Thomas R.G. Klauber M.R. Schafer K. Grundman M. Woodbury P. Growdon J. Cotman D.W. Pfeiffer E. Schneider L.S. Thal L.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1216-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). We have now employed attenuated total internal reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATIR-FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate further into the role of membranes and oxidative damage in the pathological misfolding of Aβ proteins. ATIR-FTIR is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for studying proteins, lipid membranes, and protein-lipid interactions (32Axelsen P.H. Citra M.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 66: 227-253Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Dluhy R.A. Ping Z. Faucher K. Brockman J.M. Thin Solid Films. 1998; 329: 308-314Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Silvestro L.

Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It is an especially powerful technique for the study of polypeptides that form β structure because they exhibit a distinctive “splitting” of their amide I′ absorption. It may not be clear whether this β structure is parallel or antiparallel in mature amyloid fibrils (37Antzutkin O.N. Balbach J.J. Leapman R.D. Rizzo N.W. Reed J. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13045-13050Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), however, this question does not bear on the present analysis. ATIR-FTIR spectra of membrane-bound proteins are collected under conditions in which membrane lipids are highly ordered (as in ordinary lipid bilayers), and in which variables such as lipid composition, buffer composition, surface pressure, and temperature may be controlled. It yields quantitative information about the concentration, conformation, and orientation of various chemical groups on microgram samples. This degree of sensitivity enables the collection of complete spectra several times per minute for the assessment of adsorption kinetics. These studies reveal much earlier events in fibrillogenesis than do measures of fibril formation based on dye binding, and demonstrate that oxidatively damaged lipid membranes and Aβ42 are potently synergistic in promoting fibril formation by Aβ40. Materials—1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoholine (DMPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine, and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SAPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All three lipid species were ordered specially packaged in 5–15-mg quantities, under argon, in sealed glass ampules, and stored at –80 °C until the day of use. DMPC and unoxidized SAPC were prepared for use by evaporating the chloroform under nitrogen and redissolving in 9:1, hexane:ethanol. Lipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (38Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and Congo Red were purchased from Sigma. Lyophilized Aβ40 and Aβ42 were purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA) and American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Usually the materials from either source migrated as single bands in electrophoresis gels, and had expected molecular weights of 4330 and 4514 by mass spectrometry. However, some lots of material we received did not pass these tests. The proteins were dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol and stored at –20 °C. Before each experiment, aliquots of these stock solutions were evaporated, redissolved at a concentration of 90 μm protein in 30 mm HEPES in D2O, pD 7.5, and ultrafiltered with 10-kDa cutoff filters immediately before use to remove preformed fibrils. Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). Phospholipid Oxidation—Aqueous suspensions of pure SAPC in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, were extruded at 25 °C through 100-nm polycarbonate filters to produce unilamellar vesicles. A 100 μm suspension of these vesicles was oxidized with H2O2 (2 mm) and CuSO4 (200 μm) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, that had been presaturated with nitrogen gas. Peroxidation was monitored by following conjugated diene formation with UV absorption spectrometry at 234 nm (39Vossen R.C.R.M. van Dam-Mieras M.C.E. Hornstra G. Zwaal R.F.A. Lipids. 1993; 28: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Oxidation was terminated by withdrawing aliquots at the prescribed times, adding 75 μm BHT and 75 mm EDTA, followed immediately by vigorous extraction with two volumes of 2:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol and storage at –80 °C under argon until used.

Infrared Spectroscopy of Monolayers—Lipid monolayers were prepared in a Langmuir trough by applying lipids dissolved in hexane: ethanol to the surface of a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES in D2OatpD 7.5. The lipids applied in this manner consisted of 100% DMPC, a mixture of 20 mol % SAPC (unoxidized), 80 mol % DMPC, and 1 mol % BHT; or a mixture of 20 mol % SAPC (oxidized), 80 mol % DMPC, and 1 mol % BHT. The monolayer formed in the trough at the air-water interface was compressed to a surface pressure of 20 dynes/cm and applied onto a silane-treated germanium crystal as previously described (25Koppaka V.

The protein was introduced in 8-μg aliquots to a continuously stirred subphase compartment containing 6 ml of buffer. ATIR-FTIR spectra were collected in rapid-scanning mode as 1024 co-added interferograms using a Bio-Rad FTS-60A spectrometer, a liquid-nitrogen cooled MCT detector, a resolution of 2 cm–1, scanning speed of 20 MHz, triangular apodization, and one level of zero filling. An enclosure around the Langmuir trough is filled with argon to avoid spontaneous air oxidation of lipids at the air-water interface. As is typical for this instrument, non-level baseline correction, water vapor subtraction, and smoothing manipulations were not necessary and spectra are reproduced “raw” with only flat and level baseline correction. Spectra were fitted using IRfit, a procedure that fits a limited set of component bands simultaneously to several spectra (45Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The aim of this analysis is to describe a set of related spectra with a minimum number of adjustable parameters. For the collection of spectra in kinetics mode, the resolution was set to 4 cm–1, the scanning speed was increased to 40 kHz, and a complete spectrum was recorded every 15 s by coadding 78 interferograms. All spectroscopic studies were performed at 27 °C, i.e. slightly above the phase transition temperature of pure DMPC. Vesicle Extrusion and Fibril Assay—Lipid mixtures consisting of 90% DMPC and 10% of either pure SAPC or oxidized SAPC in chloroform were evaporated, suspended in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, by bath sonication, and extruded at 25 °C through 100-nm polycarbonate filters to produce unilamellar vesicles. Aliquots of stock Aβ protein solutions in hexafluoro-2-propanol were evaporated and redissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to yield concentrations of 0.16 mg/ml for Aβ42 and 0.5 mg/ml for Aβ40. The final concentrations of lipid, Aβ42, and Aβ40 in the aggregation mixture were adjusted to 10 μm, 12 μg/ml, and 48 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated at room temperature with continuous gentle agitation for multiday intervals during which aggregation occurred. 30-μl aliquots of these mixtures were added to 110 μl of 10 μm Congo Red in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Fibril formation was assayed by spectrophotometric measurements of Congo Red binding (48Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 49Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Amyloid, Prions, and Other Protein Aggregates. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Negative Staining Electron Microscopy—Fibrillized Aβ40 was adsorbed onto 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, and visualized with a JOEL 100CX transmission electron microscope (EM) (Peabody, MA). EM images were captured with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Bridgewater, MA) using AMT software (Danvers, MA). Individual Proteins on Lipid Monolayer Membranes—Monolayer membranes of three types were prepared for examination with ATIR-FTIR: saturated (100% DMPC), unoxidized (20% SAPC and 80% DMPC), and oxidized (20% oxidized SAPC and 80% DMPC). The monolayers were formed in a Langmuir trough and applied onto germanium crystals as previously described (46Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1465-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 8-μg injections of Aβ proteins were made into 6 ml of subphase buffer under the crystal yielding subphase concentrations of ∼0.3 μm. Protein accumulation was measured by calculating the total amide I′ band area in spectra collected over 15-s intervals (a prime mark is added to amide I references when exchangeable hydrogens have been replaced with deuterium). Aβ40 accumulates to a significantly greater degree on oxidized membranes than on saturated or unoxidized membranes, similar in some respects to the behavior reported previously for Aβ42 (25Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10011-10016Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of Aβ40 on oxidized membranes differed from that of Aβ42 in two significant ways. First, Aβ40 accumulation reached a plateau within 15 min and remained at this level for the remainder of the initial 60-min “seeding” period. In contrast, Aβ42 accumulation on the oxidized membrane continued over the initial 60-min seeding period without reaching a plateau (Fig. 1). Second, the ATIR-FTIR spectrum of membrane-adsorbed Aβ40 exhibited a prominent band at 1628 cm–1 but minimal absorption between 1680 and 1690 cm–1. In contrast, the spectrum of membrane-adsorbed Aβ42 exhibited the characteristic split amide I′ band (Fig. 2, a and b).Fig. 2Amide I′ bands in the ATIR-FTIR spectra of Aβ proteins. Experimental data are represented by discrete symbols; individual component bands obtained from IRfit are shown in thin lines, and the sum of the fit components is represented by a thick solid line overlying most of the data points. The experimental data were derived from 1024 co-added interferograms recorded at 2 cm–1 resolution, and reproduced without smoothing, water vapor subtraction, deconvolution, or other manipulations to enhance resolution or apparent signal to noise ratio. A flat level baseline correction has been applied. a, Aβ42 absorbed to an monolayer containing oxidized lipids (SAPCOX). b, spectrum of unseeded Aβ40 on SAPCOX corresponding to time = 4 h in Fig. 1. The absorption maximum is 0.0011. c, Aβ42-seeded Aβ40 on SAPCOX at time = 4 h in Fig. 1. The absorption maximum is 0.0032, and the integrated area of the amide I′ band is about 5-fold larger that that shown in panel b. d, dry Aβ40 fibrils, formed after 10 days incubation in dilute HEPES buffer and evaporated onto an internal reflection crystal. e, dry Aβ40 in dilute HEPES buffer immediately evaporated onto an internal reflection crystal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mixed Proteins on Oxidized Lipid Monolayer Membranes— After oxidized membranes were exposed to subphase buffers containing either 8 μgofAβ40 or 8 μg of Aβ42 for 1 h, a series of injections containing 8 μg of Aβ40 were made into the subphase. In preparations initially exposed only to Aβ40, subsequent injections of Aβ40 up to a total of 40 μg had little effect on the total amount of protein that accumulated (Fig. 1), or on the amide I′ band shape. Similarly, injections of Aβ42 under oxidized membranes initially seeded with Aβ40 did not result in significant protein accumulation. In preparations initially seeded with Aβ42, however, injections of Aβ40 resulted in markedly increased protein accumulations. Moreover, each injection of Aβ40 raised the integrated absorbance to a new plateau, indicating that membrane binding sites were not saturated, and suggesting that each plateau represented depletion of protein from the subphase by adsorption to the supported membrane. Protein could not be detected in the subphase with bicinchoninic acid reagent at these times, however, the starting concentrations of protein were only barely within detection limits. Control experiments with saturated and unoxidized membranes seeded with Aβ42 yielded results that were indistinguishable from those of the unseeded preparations (data not shown). Other control experiments demonstrate that Aβ40 does not effectively seed Aβ42 accumulation, suggesting that the Aβ40 that does accumulate interferes with the ability of Aβ42 to promote protein accumulation. It should be noted that 1 mol % BHT was present in both the unoxidized and oxidized lipid samples and thus, cannot account for the behavior of Aβ40 on oxidatively damaged membranes. As reported previously (25Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10011-10016Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), BHT is added to all samples of unsaturated lipid because the effects of oxidative damage disappear after prolonged exposure of unsaturated monolayers to atmospheric oxygen. We conclude from these observations that oxidative damage and Aβ42 work synergistically to cause the accumulation and misfolding of Aβ40. The data in our previous report describing the interaction of Aβ42 with oxidatively damaged lipid membranes spanned only 60 min, and could not be extended because of environmental and instrumentation instabilities. The results in this report span continuous 4-h intervals. These much longer observation times were made possible by technical improvements that enhance signal stability and reduce noise, including tightly controlled ambient temperatures in the lab environment, higher output purge gas generators, and an enclosure around the instrumentation that helps stabilize temperatures and exclude water vapor by retaining exhausted purge gas around the outside of the spectrometer. Mixed Proteins on Oxidized Lipid Vesicles—To determine whether the synergy between oxidatively damaged monolayer membranes and Aβ42 could be demonstrated in bilayer membranes, and by more established means, we performed analogous experiments with unilamellar lipid vesicles using a Congo Red binding assay to detect fibril formation. The results shown in Fig. 3 compare unoxidized and oxidized lipid vesicles that were treated either with Aβ40 alone or pre-treated with Aβ42 followed by Aβ40. When 10 μm Aβ40 was mixed with 10 μm unoxidized lipid in the form of vesicles, there was a marginally detectable amount of Congo Red binding to fibrils after 3 days. There was no significant binding detected when vesicles were composed of oxidized lipid, or when vesicles were not present (data not shown). With unoxidized lipid, pretreatment of lipid vesicles with 2.5 μm Aβ42 for 1 day before adding 10 μm Aβ40 also caused only a marginally significant increase in Congo Red binding after 2 days. We conclude that the conditions of these experiments give rise to minimal, if any, spontaneous fibrillogenesis over a 3-day incubation. These results are consistent with prior reports indicating that the concentration of Aβ40 in our vesicle experiments is only slightly above its solubility limit, whereas the concentration of Aβ42 is well below its solubility limit (9Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). In contrast, the use of oxidized lipid and pretreatment with Aβ42 in this type of experiment caused a marked increase in Congo Red binding after 2 days of incubation (Fig. 3). Examination of this preparation by electron microscopy after 3 days incubation showed that fibrils, 10 nm in diameter and 500–1000 nm long, had formed (Fig. 4). Vesicles used in these experiments contained 10% unoxidized or oxidized lipid, whereas the monolayer experiments were performed with 20% unoxidized or oxidized lipid. The use of 20% oxidized SAPC was problematic in vesicle experiments because it enhanced fibril formation to such a degree that Aβ40 fibrils formed after 3 days with or without seeding by Aβ42. This suggests that oxidized lipids can promote Aβ40 misfolding in the absence of Aβ42. However, this observation was made at an Aβ40 concentration of 10 μm, i.e. slightly above its thermodynamic solubility limit in pure solution of 9 μm (9Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). It was not detected in our ATIR-FTIR experiments where the Aβ40 concentration was only 0.3 μm in the subphase buffer. Reducing the unoxidized and oxidized lipid concentrations to 10% virtually eliminated fibril formation by Aβ40 alone over the 3-day period of observation. These obser"

Melanomas are tumors arising from normal melanocytes that, if undetected at an early stage, are highly invasive and poorly treatable.

We addressed the role of integrin-mediated adhesion in ERK1/2 signaling in human melanoma cells and primary melanocytes. Basal ERK1/2 activity was low, and growth factor activation was adhesion-dependent in normal human melanocytes. By contrast in mutant B-Raf-expressing melanoma cells (SK-MEL-24 and SK-MEL-28), the ERK1/2 pathway was constitutively active, and adhesion-dependent regulation of ERK1/2 activity was by-passed. Furthermore, in melanoma cells, ERK1/2 translocated to the nucleus and regulated transcription events in an adhesion-independent manner.

Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Integrins are the main receptors that recognize fibronectin, laminin, and collagen within the ECM (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Engagement and clustering of integrins leads to the formation of focal adhesions that link to the actin cytoskeleton, initiation of cell spreading, and the establishment of a platform that regulates signaling events (3Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 cascade impacts on cell proliferation and survival, and this pathway is regulated by adhesion (4Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 5Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Growth factors activate the ERK1/2 pathway by binding and activating cell surface receptors. Activated receptors recruit adaptor proteins leading to enhanced GTP loading of Ras, which recruits Raf family kinases to the membrane where the latter are activated. Three isoforms of Raf have been identified, A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1 (also known as C-Raf) (6Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.-L. Cell. Signaling. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Knockout studies have demonstrated important differences in their roles (7Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Beck T.W. Hahn H. Bernal R. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 8Pritchard C.A. Bolin L. Slattery R. Murray R. McMahon M. Curr.

Raf isoforms initiate a kinase cascade that sequentially activates mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2. We and others (reviewed in Refs. 3Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 5Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) have shown that loss of adhesion impairs growth factor-mediated ERK1/2 activation and ERK translocation to the nucleus in fibroblast and endothelial cells. Adhesion effects on the ERK1/2 pathway provide a possible mechanistic basis for adhesion control of cell proliferation and survival. In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin D1 couples to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 to regulate retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation. Induction of cyclin D1 is dependent upon both adhesion and growth factors (9Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and ERK1/2 signaling regulates cyclin D1 at the transcriptional level (10Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 11Kerkhoff E. Rapp U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whether ERK1/2 activation is sufficient for cyclin D1 induction in the absence of integrin engagement remains unclear. In one case, activation of ERK1/2 in suspended cells by inducible expression of Raf-1 was insufficient to induce cyclin D1 and subsequent G1 cell cycle events (12Le Gall M. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in other work (13Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), inducible expression of active MEK and resulting activation of ERK1/2 induced cyclin D1 in non-adherent cells. The difference in effects on G1 cell cycle events between these two studies is likely due to the extent of adhesion-dependent regulation of activated ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (14Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). ERK1/2-mediated protein phosphorylation and regulation of gene transcription also elicits pro-survival signals (15Lewis T.S. Hunt J.B. Aveline L.D. Jonscher K.R. Louie D.F. Yeh J.M. Nahreini T.S.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As with cell cycle studies, different effects have been observed upon recovering ERK1/2 activation in suspended cells on protection from anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by loss of adhesion or adhesion to an inappropriate ECM. Enhancing ERK1/2 activity in non-adherent conditions through expression of Raf-1 in breast cancer cells or by activation of the EGF receptor in keratinocytes leads to protection from anoikis (16Schulze A. Lehmann K. Jefferies H.B.J. McMahon M. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Jost M. Huggett T.M. Kari C. Rodeck U. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Other studies in endothelial and epithelial cell lines indicate that activation of ERK1/2 is insufficient or only partially protects cells from anoikis (19Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Susceptibility to anoikis despite high ERK1/2 activation has been shown to correlate with impaired trafficking of ERK1/2 to the nucleus (21Danilkovitch A. Donley S. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2218-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Lai J.-M. Wu S. Huang D.-Y. Chang Z.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7581-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together, these studies highlight the need for increased understanding of adhesion-dependent regulation of ERK1/2 signaling events and how this control impacts on cell proliferation and survival. During malignant conversion, cells become self-sufficient in proliferation and survival signals (23Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are constitutively active in a variety of tumor cell types (24Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which ERK1/2 remain highly active and promote transcriptional events in the absence of adhesion has not been well established in malignant cells. We focused on melanoma cell lines and their normal precursors, melanocytes, because mutations in B-Raf, a component in the ERK1/2 pathway, are associated with two-thirds of melanomas (25Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A.

Nature. 2002; 418: 934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The most common mutation in B-Raf is a valine to glutamic acid substitution at residue 599 (V599E) located within the activation loop. This phosphomimetic substitution results in constitutive B-Raf activity and activation of ERK1/2 when overexpressed in COS-7 fibroblasts (25Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A. Mould C. Parker A. Stevens C. Watt S. Hooper S.

Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8397) Google Scholar). We show that basal ERK1/2 activity is low in normal human melanocytes, and growth factor activation of ERK1/2 is impaired in non-adherent cells as compared with cells adherent to fibronectin. In contrast, SK-MEL-24 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells that harbor mutant V599E B-Raf display constitutively high ERK1/2 activation in serum-free conditions. Furthermore, ERK1/2 activity, translocation to the nucleus, and regulation of transcriptional events are maintained in cells in the absence of integrin-mediated adhesion. Expression of V599E B-Raf in primary melanocytes is sufficient to promote ERK1/2 signaling independent of adhesion. The data indicate that adhesion regulates ERK1/2 activation in melanocytes and that this control is by-passed by mutation of B-Raf in malignant melanoma cells. Isolation of Primary Melanocytes—Primary human melanocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins, as previously described (27Scott G. Cassidy L. Busacco A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Foreskin tissue was incubated with dispase to separate the epidermis from the dermis. Separated epidermal sheets were incubated with trypsin for 20 min at 37 °C and vortexed, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were cultured in MCDB 153 medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) containing 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.05% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 ng/ml basic FGF, and 8 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. All procedures were carried out according to the Research Subject Review Board at the University of Rochester. Cell Culture—The human melanoma SK-MEL-24 and SK-MEL-28 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.5% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection—Primary melanocytes were transfected with Trans-It reagent (Mirus, Madison WI). Melanoma cell lines were transfected with Maxfect (Molecula Research Laboratories, Herndon, VA). Lipo-fectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for transfecting COS-7 cells. All transfections were performed according to the manufacturers' protocols. The BRAF V599E containing plasmid was donated kindly by Dr. Richard Marais, Institute of Cancer Research, London (25Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H.

Cell Adhesion Assays and Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were briefly serum-starved before detachment with trypsin. Cells were pelleted in 153 medium (melanocytes) or MEM (SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-24 cells) containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD). Cells were washed once and then incubated non-adherently in the appropriate medium containing 0.5% BSA at 37 °C on a rotator. After 45 min, cells were plated onto ECM-coated dishes or maintained in suspension for between 3 and 9 h. The ECM components used were human fibronectin and vitronectin (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), both at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. In melanocyte experiments, some cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml basic FGF (BD Biosciences) for 15 min. Cell lysates were prepared as previously described (28Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.2 μm calyculin A, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride HCl, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g prior to protein analysis. Luciferase-based Elk-1 Reporter Assays—For Elk-1 transactivation assays, cells were transfected with three plasmids, pFA2-Elk-1, pFRluc, and pRL-CMV. pFA2-Elk-1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) encodes a fusion between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the trans-activation domain of Elk-1. pFR-luc (Stratagene) is a GAL4-based reporter plasmid controlling the transcription of Firefly luciferase. pRL-CMV-luc (Promega, Madison, WI) encodes Renilla luciferase under the control of the CMV promoter and was included for normalization. Luciferase levels in adherent and non-adherent cells were determined using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Cells were extracted in passive lysis buffer and 20 μl of lysate was incubated with 100 μl of luciferin reagent. Firefly luminescence was measured for 10 s in a Turner Designs 20/20 luminometer. Subsequently, 100 μl of Stop and Glo® reagent was added, and the specific luminescence from Renilla luciferase was recorded for an additional 10 s. Within each sample, Firefly activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and subsequently incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies that recognize phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), total ERK1/2 (clone K-23, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), B-Raf (clone C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and MKP-2 (clone S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were used. Membranes were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugates (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Western blots were developed using a SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Immunoreactivity was detected and quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager and Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Immunofluorescence—Cells were either plated onto fibronectincoated coverslips for 2 h at 37 °C or, for non-adherent conditions, maintained in suspension for 1 h and 55 min and then attached to polylysine-coated coverslips for 5 min. No cell spreading was observed on polylysine under these conditions. Cells were fixed and incubated with phospho-ERK1/2 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) primary and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary (Molecular Probes) antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst reagent 33342 (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent staining was viewed on an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Images were captured using a Spot charge-coupled device camera and processed using deconvolution Slide Book software. Adhesion to Fibronectin Regulates Growth Factor Activation of ERK1/2 in Primary Melanocytes—Adhesion to the ECM regulates signaling events that promote cell proliferation and survival (3Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Initially, we analyzed whether adhesion controls growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 in primary human melanocytes, a cell type that has not been well characterized for adhesion control of signaling events. In melanocytes, basic FGF is known to activate ERK1/2 and enhance cell growth (29Nesbit M. Nesbit H.K. Bennett J. Andl T. Hsu M.Y. Dejesus E. McBrian M. Gupta A.R. Eck S.L. Herlyn M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6469-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Tada A. Pereira E. Beitner-Johnson D. Kavanagh R. Abdel-Malek Z.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 316-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Serum-deprived primary melanocytes were either maintained in suspension or allowed to adhere to fibronectin before stimulation with FGF. Basal ERK1/2 activities were low in serum-free conditions in both suspended and adherent cells, as determined by Western blot analysis of cell lysates with phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (Fig. 1A). FGF treatment resulted in efficient ERK1/2 activation in cells adherent to fibronectin but weak activation in suspended melanocytes. Low level ERK1/2 activation was also observed in FGF-treated cells that were attached non-specifically to polylysine-coated dishes (data not shown). Consistent with anti-phospho ERK1/2 analysis, a mobility shift that is indicative of phosphorylation was detected only in adherent FGF-stimulated cells upon Western blotting with an antibody to total ERK1/2. Quantification of Western blot data showed that FGF-mediated ERK1/2 activity was ∼3-fold higher in fibronectin-adherent melanocytes compared with suspended cells (Fig. 1B). These findings demonstrate that adhesion of primary melanocytes to the ECM is permissive for FGF activation of ERK1/2. Constitutive Activation of ERK1/2 in V599E B-Raf-expressing Melanoma Cells—It was reported recently that individual point mutations in B-Raf that lead to its constitutive activation are frequently found in melanoma cells (25Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A. Mould C. Parker A. Stevens C. Watt S. Hooper S. Wilson R. Jayatilake H. Gusterson B.A. Cooper C. Shipley J. Hargrave D. Pritchard-Jones K. Maitland N. Chenevix-Trench G. Riggins G.J. Bigner D.D. Palmieri G. Cossu A. Flanagan A. Nicholson A. Ho J.W. Leung S.Y. Yuen S.T. Weber B.L. Seigler H.F. Darrow T.L. Paterson H. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Wooster R. Stratton M.R. Futreal P.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8397) Google Scholar). Because B-Raf is an upstream component in the MEK to ERK1/2 kinase module, we analyzed whether ERK1/2 were activated in human melanoma cell lines. Two melanoma lines were tested, SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-24, that carry the most common activating B-Raf mutation (V599E) (25Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A. Mould C. Parker A. Stevens C. Watt S. Hooper S. Wilson R. Jayatilake H. Gusterson B.A. Cooper C. Shipley J. Hargrave D. Pritchard-Jones K. Maitland N. Chenevix-Trench G. Riggins G.J. Bigner D.D. Palmieri G. Cossu A. Flanagan A. Nicholson A. Ho J.W. Leung S.Y. Yuen S.T. Weber B.L. Seigler H.F. Darrow T.L. Paterson H. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Wooster R. Stratton M.R. Futreal P.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8397) Google Scholar). Under serum-free conditions, ERK1/2 activities were high in the SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-24 cells, as determined by Western blot analysis with phospho-ERK antibodies (Fig. 2). Treatment with the MEK inhibitor compound, U0126, inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and serum failed to enhance ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both cell lines. These results indicate that the ERK1/2 pathway is constitutively active downstream of mutant B-Raf in the SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-24 cells. Activation of ERK1/2 Is Adhesion-independent in Melanoma Cells—We have previously shown that expression of an activated form of Raf-1, known as 22W Raf, is able to recover ERK1 activity in suspended NIH 3T3 cells (14Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition to Raf-1, B-Raf, and A-Raf act as MAP3K in the ERK1/2 cascade (6Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.-L. Cell. Signaling. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We asked whether ERK1/2 activation is adhesion-independent in malignant melanoma cell lines harboring mutant V599E B-Raf. SK-MEL-24 cells maintained in suspension or adhered to ECM components in serum-free conditions were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting for phospho- and total ERK1/2. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was highly active in SK-MEL-24 cells that were either suspended or replated onto fibronectin over a 9-h time course (Fig. 3A). Mobility-shifted ERK1/2, corresponding to activation, is evident in the Western blot of SK-MEL-24 cell lysates with total ERK1/2 antibody. Similarly, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was high in both non-adherent and adherent SK-MEL-28 cells over a 9-h time course (Fig. 3B). Comparable results were observed whether SK-MEL-28 cells were replated onto vitronectin or fibronectin-coated dishes (data not shown). Thus, ERK1/2 are activated regardless of adhesion in mutant B-Raf expressing melanoma cell lines. Activated ERK Localizes to the Nucleus in Adherent and Non-adherent Melanoma Cells—Our published findings in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts show that adhesion regulates both growth factor activation and the nuclear accumulation of activated ERKs (14Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To determine in melanoma cells whether ERK1/2 are subject to adhesion regulation downstream of activation, we analyzed phospho-ERK accumulation in the nucleus of B-Raf V599E-expressing SK-MEL-28 cells. By deconvolution immunofluorescence, we observed phospho-ERK staining was highly localized to the nucleus in the majority of non-adherent and adherent cells (Fig. 4). As expected, treatment with U0126 reduced levels of phospho-ERK staining. These data show that the localization of activated ERK1/2 to the nucleus is not dependent upon adhesion in SK-MEL-28 cells. The Effect of Adhesion on GAL4-Elk-1 Transactivation and MKP-2 Levels in Melanoma Cells—In the nucleus, ERK1/2 phosphorylate transcription factors, including Elk-1 (31Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). We next examined ERK1/2-induced activation of a reporter driven by Elk-1. Cells were transfected with GAL4 Elk-1 fusion and firefly luciferase reporter constructs and either maintained in suspension or replated onto fibronectin for 3 or 6 h. GAL4-Elk-1-driven luciferase activity was constitutively high and was unaffected by loss of adhesion in both SK-MEL-24 and SK-MEL-28 cells (Fig. 5A). In both melanoma cells lines, GAL4-Elk-1 activity was inhibited dramatically upon treatment with the MEK inhibitor, U0126. We also analyzed the expression level of MAP kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP2) that is regulated at the transcriptional level by ERK1/2 (32Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). MKP2 levels were readily detectable by Western blot analysis of lysates from adherent SK-MEL-24 and SK-MEL-28 cells under serum-free conditions (Fig. 5B). Expression of MKP2 was maintained in cells upon loss of adhesion over the 9-h time period but was dramatically down-regulated upon inhibition of MEK. Together, these data indicate that activated ERK1/2 in mutant V599E B-Raf cells are able to promote transcription events in the absence of cell adhesion. Expression of Mutant B-Raf Initiates Adhesion-independent ERK1/2 Signaling in Melanocytes—To test whether mutations in B-Raf are causative for adhesion-independent ERK1/2 signaling, we utilized a construct encoding V599E B-Raf that contains the most common B-Raf mutation found in melanomas. Transfection of this construct into COS-7 cells resulted in the expression of a 95-kDa protein that was detected with anti-B-Raf antibodies but was not present in control transfected cell lysates (Fig. 6A). Next, normal human melanocytes were transfected with mutant V599E B-Raf or control vector, in addition to GAL4 Elk-1 fusion and firefly luciferase reporter constructs. Cells were either maintained in suspension or readhered to fibronectin for 6 h before analysis of GAL4-Elk-1-driven luciferase activity. GAL4-Elk-1 transactivation was low in control transfected cells in both non-adherent and adherent conditions (Fig. 6B). Notably, V599E B-Raf transfection initiated efficient GAL4-Elk-1 transactivation in both suspended and adherent melanocytes. Despite marked GAL4-Elk-1-driven luciferase activity, we were unable to detect expression of exogenous B-Raf in melanocyte cell lysates by Western analysis due to lower transfection efficiency than COS-7 cells. Nevertheless, because ERK1/2 regulates Elk-1 activity, these results indicate that V599E B-Raf is sufficient to activate ERK1/2 signaling in an adhesion independent manner in normal melanocytes. Integrin-mediated adhesion plays an important role in cell proliferation, survival, and migration (3Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 5Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To understand how integrins control these processes, we have studied adhesion-dependent regulation of growth factor signaling through the ERK1/2 cascade. Our finding that adhesion regulates FGF activation of ERK1/2 in normal primary melanocytes is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of adhesion control of a growth factor-activated kinase cascade in these cells. Our observations are consistent with published results in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, in which adhesion and growth factor-mediated signals have been found to converge at the level of activation of the growth factor receptor, Raf, and MEK (33Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 34Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31223-31228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In melanocytes, it is likely that the point of convergence occurs at or above B-Raf activation, because ERK1/2 signaling is adhesion-independent in V599E B-Raf-expressing melanocytes and melanoma cells. We are presently performing further experiments to determine the exact adhesion regulated step leading to ERK1/2 activation in melanocytes. In addition to regulation of growth factor activation, adhesion regulates trafficking of ERK1/2 to the nucleus in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (14Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Danilkovitch A. Donley S. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7581-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); an effect that is likely mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin beta subunit (40Hirsch E. Barberis L. Brancaccio M. Azzolino O. Xu D. Kyriakis J.M. Silengo L. Giancotti F.G. Tarone G. Fassler R. Altruda F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our initial data indicate that this step is not strongly adhesion-dependent in melanocytes, because V599E B-Raf-initiated Elk-1 transactivation is comparable in suspended and adherent cells. However, V599E B-Raf is highly active and persistently activates ERK1/2, hence further experiments are required to determine whether under alternative conditions, for example transient ERK1/2 activation or expression of other Raf isoforms, ERK1/2 trafficking to the nucleus is regulated by adhesion in melanocytes. Adhesion regulation of ERK1/2 is likely critical for melanocyte proliferation and survival. Basic FGF that is secreted from keratinocytes is a known factor that promotes melanocyte proliferation (41Halaban R. Langdon R. Birchall N. Cuono C. Baird A. Scott G. Moellmann G. McGuire J. J.

Similarly, the ERK1/2 pathway is known to regulate G1 cell cycle progression in normal human melanocytes and melanoma cell lines (25Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S.

MacKiewicz A. Behrmann I. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Melanocyte survival is also dependent upon adhesion (27Scott G. Cassidy L. Busacco A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MEK promotes apoptosis in human melanoma cells (17Jost M. Huggett T.M. Kari C. Rodeck U. Mol.

Cheresh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8856-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Notably, levels of β3 integrin are increased during the vertical phase of melanoma growth (47Albelda S.M. Mette S.A. Elder D.E. Stewart R. Damjanovich L. Herlyn M. Buck C.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6757-6764PubMed Google Scholar, 48Van Belle P.A. Elenitsas R. Satyamoorthy K. Wolfe J.T. Guerry D. Schuchter L. Van Belle T.J. Albelda S. Tahin P. Herlyn M. Elder D.E. Hum. Pathol. 1999; 30: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of adhesion-dependent control of ERK1/2 signal transduction may be a critical step in neoplastic conversion. Although normal cells require both adhesion and soluble mitogens for growth, malignant cells are able to by-pass these needs (23Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). The identification of mutations in B-Raf that are associated with melanomas prompted us to address whether adhesion-dependent regulation of ERK1/2 signaling was altered in melanoma cells. Both ERK1 and -2 were constitutively active in SK-MEL-24 and SK-MEL-28 cells, consistent with recent reports on other melanoma cell lines and tissue sections (44Kortylewski M. Heinrich P.C. Kauffmann M.E. Bohm M. MacKiewicz A. Behrmann I. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 49Cohen C. Zavala-Pompa A. Sequeira J.H. Shoji M. Sexton D.G. Cotsonis G.

Enhanced Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is known to promote transcription of genes linked to cell proliferation, survival, and invasion (16Schulze A. Lehmann K. Jefferies H.B.J. McMahon M. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our data in melanoma cells show that ERK1/2 are efficiently activated, accumulate in the nucleus, and promote transcriptional events in an adhesion-independent manner. Both SK-MEK-28 and SK-MEL-24 cells display anchorage-independent properties (51Cirielli C. Riccioni T. Yang C. Pili R. Gloe T. Chang J. Inyaku K. Passaniti A. Capogrossi M.C. Int. J.

Conner, G. Scott, and A. E. Aplin, unpublished observations. Thus, our findings indicate that one event leading to anchorage-independence is the ability to overcome integrin-dependent control of the ERK1/2 cascade. We were able to by-pass this control of ERK1/2 signaling in normal melanocytes by expression of V599E B-Raf. B-Raf is an activator of MEK in the ERK1/2 pathway in melanocytes (53Busca R. Abbe P.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the significance of control of ERK1/2 signaling for the malignant conversion of melanocytes is underscored by the knowledge that the BRAF gene is mutated in approximately two-thirds of melanomas (25Davies H.

Thus, inhibition of B-Raf or downstream components in the ERK1/2 cascade has potential as therapeutic strategy to block melanoma growth. In summary, our findings provide a link between alterations in adhesion-dependent regulation of growth factor activation of ERK1/2 and the acquisition of malignant properties. Efficient ERK1/2 activation is dependent upon both adhesion and growth factors in normal melanocytes but is independent of these cues in melanoma cells (for model see Fig. 7). These findings highlight the importance of adhesion-dependent regulation of the ERK1/2 pathway for normal cell processes and the significance of alterations in this control for transformation and the acquisition of anchorage-independent properties.

https://openalex.org/W2107471930,"Sensory rhodopsins (SRs) are light receptors that belong to the growing family of microbial rhodopsins. SRs have now been found in all three major domains of life including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. One of the most extensively studied sensory rhodopsins is SRII, which controls a blue light avoidance motility response in the halophilic archaeon Natronobacterium pharaonis. This seven-helix integral membrane protein forms a tight intermolecular complex with its cognate transducer protein, HtrII. In this work, the structural changes occurring in a fusion complex consisting of SRII and the two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) of HtrII were investigated by time-resolved Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy. Although most of the structural changes observed in SRII are conserved in the fusion complex, several distinct changes are found. A reduction in the intensity of a prominent amide I band observed for SRII indicates that its structural changes are altered in the fusion complex, possibly because of the close interaction of TM2 with the F helix, which interferes with the F helix outward tilt. Deprotonation of at least one Asp/Glu residue is detected in the transducer-free receptor with a pKa near 7 that is abolished or altered in the fusion complex. Changes are also detected in spectral regions characteristic of Asn and Tyr vibrations. At high hydration levels, transducer-fusion interactions lead to a stabilization of an M-like intermediate that most likely corresponds to an active signaling form of the transducer. These findings are discussed in the context of a recently elucidated x-ray structure of the fusion complex.

Sensory rhodopsin (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sensory rhodopsin; BR, bacteriorhodopsin; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; TM, transmembrane; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: SR, sensory rhodopsin; BR, bacteriorhodopsin; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; TM, transmembrane; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. II is a seven-helix integral membrane protein found in halophilic archaea that functions as a light receptor for negative phototaxis (1Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Together with sensory rhodopsin I (SRI), which is a dual photoattractant/photorepellent receptor (2Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a light-driven proton pump; and halorhodopsin, a light-driven chloride pump, these proteins belong to a widespread family of photoactive retinylidene proteins or microbial rhodopsins (3Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Microbial rhodopsins have several common features including an all-trans-retinylidene chromophore covalently attached to the protein via a protonated Schiff base linkage. Light absorption results in an all-trans → 13-cis-isomerization of the chromophore that triggers subsequent conformational changes associated with a photocycle characteristic of each protein. Members of the microbial rhodopsin family have recently been found in diverse organisms including marine proteobacteria (4Beja O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Leclerc M. DeLong E.F.

Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and lower eukaryotes such as Neurospora crassa (6Bieszke J.A. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Borkovich K.A. Spudich J.L.

Sensory rhodopsin II transmits the photorepellent signal to the cell cytoplasm by activating the transmembrane domain of its cognate transducer HtrII (8Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The photocycle of SRII comprises several photointermediates (10Hirayama J. Imamoto Y. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Tomioka H. Yoshizawa T.

Takahashi T. Johnson R. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10686-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have explored various aspects of the receptor-transducer interaction primarily in SRII from Natronobacterium pharaonis. Photocycle kinetics in the detergent-solubilized SRII-HtrII complex was measured by Sudo et al. (15Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), who concluded that the decay of the M intermediate is slowed in the presence of transducer. On the other hand, no change in the photocycle rate was observed for the same complex reconstituted in lipids (16Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 916-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Measurements of transient voltage and pH changes in membranes containing transducer-free SRII demonstrated that the receptor (but not the receptor-transducer complex) functions as a light-driven proton pump, although with less efficiency than BR (17Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 916-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Schmies G. Engelhard M. Wood P.G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SRI also exhibits light-driven proton pumping (19Bogomolni R.A. Stoeckenius W. Szundi I. Perozo E. Olson K.D. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10188-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) inhibited by its cognate transducer HtrI by closure of its cytoplasmic proton-conducting channel (20Spudich J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 747-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the conformational change that opens the cytoplasmic channel, believed to involve an outward tilting of helix F, is hindered by transducer interaction in both sensory rhodopsins (1Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). High resolution x-ray crystallographic structures have been obtained of the receptor dark state (21Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22Royant A. Nollert P. Edman K. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Navarro J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10131-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and more recently a fusion complex formed between SRII and a truncated form of HtrII consisting of the two transmembrane helices, TM1 and TM2, and a short membrane-proximal region (9Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The latter study reveals close interaction between helices F and G of the receptor and TM2 of the transducer, including a bond formed between Tyr199 (helix G) and Asn74 (TM2). Current models of signal transduction in this system predict that an outward tilting of helix F, as observed in BR, causes a rotation, piston-like motion or other movement of TM2 that is propagated toward the more distal methyl-accepting and kinase regions of the transducer (9Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Spudich J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this process, the Tyr199–Asn74 bond may be disrupted. This possibility is consistent with photocycle studies utilizing the Y199F mutant of SRII (24Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 427-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EPR studies of spin-labeled SRII and its complex with HtrII also indicate that outward tilting of the receptor helix F displaces transmembrane helices of the transducer HtrII from their initial positions (25Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since its original application to BR (26Rothschild K.J. Zagaeski M. Cantore W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Siebert F. Maentele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), FTIR difference spectroscopy has been successfully applied to a variety of membrane proteins (28Vogel R. Siebert F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) including transducer-free sensory rhodopsin II (29Engelhard M. Scharf B. Siebert F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J.

J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We report here an extension of this approach to study protein-protein interactions in a SRII-HtrII fusion complex. FTIR difference spectra were obtained of transducer-free SRII and SRII fused to the transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) and truncated cytoplasmic portion of the transducer. Our findings reveal bands associated with the interaction of the transducer and receptor including the deprotonation of one or more Asp/Glu residues and a possible disruption of the Tyr199/Asn74 interaction observed in the resting state of the SRII-HtrII complex. In contrast to some models that predict an increase in structural rearrangement of the protein backbone, we observed an overall decrease in structural changes as reflected by bands in the amide I region. In addition, at high hydration levels, the presence of the transducer stabilizes the receptor during the photocycle in the late M intermediate, which is likely to be a signal transducing form of the complex. Plasmid Construction—In construct JS008 the sopII gene from N. pharaonis strain DSM2160 was placed under control of the bop promoter in a pKJ301-derivative, as described by Kunji et al. (34Kunji E.R. Spudich E.N. Grisshammer R. Henderson R. Spudich J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). JS018 encodes a fusion protein in which full-length SRII and the 147 N-terminal residues of HtrII are joined by the flexible linker ASASNGASA. The fusion gene was also placed in pKJ301 under control of the bop promoter. Purification of His-tagged SRII and SRII-HtrII Complex—Purification of His-tagged proteins was performed by a modification of the procedure previously described (35Krebs M.P. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, two 2-liter flasks containing 1.8 liters of complex medium and mevinolin (1.0 μg/μl) were inoculated with 5.5 ml of liquid culture of the transformant strains JS008 and JS018. The cultures were grown to stationary phase (A 600 = ∼0.7) under illumination at 37 °C with 240 rpm rotary shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 120 ml of sonication buffer (2 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) in the presence of 40 mg of DNase (Sigma). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation. The membranes were collected by centrifugation (39,000 × g for 60 min), and the pellets were resuspended in a total combined volume of 36 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm MES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) with 1.0% w/v octylglucoside. His-tagged protein was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography by adding 1.0 ml of His·Bind resin to 36 ml of solubilized sample and shaken at 4 °C for at least 3 h. The bound resin was applied to a 50-cm chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The packed His-tagged SRII-bound resin was washed with 10 ml of solubilization buffer followed by 10 ml of the wash buffer E50 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 1% octylglucoside, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.5). The protein was eluted by the addition of elution buffer E150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole, 1% octylglucoside, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.5). The eluted protein was concentrated to the final concentration of 1.4 mg/ml for SRII and 0.2 mg/ml for SRII-HtrII. Proteoliposome Reconstitution—Purified His-tagged SRII and the fusion complex were reconstituted in phospholipids by the dialysis procedure previously described (35Krebs M.P. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the work reported here, the protein-to-lipid ratio was 1:6.5 (w/w). Extraction of halobacterial phospholipids used in the reconstitution procedures was performed as previously described (30Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rapid Scan Time-resolved FTIR Difference Spectroscopy—A stock suspension of membranes (10 mg/ml) containing SRII or the SRII-HtrII complex in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, or in 25 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, was kept in the refrigerator prior to use. The protein films were prepared by depositing 5–10 μl of this suspension onto a polished 2-mm-thick, 25-mm-diameter BaF2 window (Wilmad, Buena, NJ) and then placing the sample in a dry box for ∼1 h. The films were rehydrated via the vapor phase and then sealed in a temperature-controlled infrared cell (model TFC; Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY) using a second BaF2 window. Alternatively, the samples were saturated with water by gently washing dry films with ∼100 μl of the buffer solution and then removing the excess solution. The level of hydration was monitored by the absolute absorption IR spectra. The amount of water in samples with complete water saturation was at least 50% higher compared with the samples hydrated via the vapor phase as estimated from the increase of the absorption bands near 3400 and 1640 cm–1 because of the bulk water. For H2O → D2O exchange, the dry protein films were rehydrated with 50 μl of D2O, allowed to dry and then rehydrated in the infrared cell as described above with D2O. The spectra were recorded with a BRUKER IFS 66 v/s FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics) as described previously (36Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) at a 4 cm–1 spectral resolution and 240 kHz scanner velocity corresponding to the data acquisition window of 18 ms. Four individual spectra collected within 85 ms after initiation of the photocycle were averaged to produce the final spectrum. Fig. 1 (top) shows the FTIR difference spectrum of SRII reconstituted in Halobacterium salinarum phospholipids at pH 8 and 298 K. The spectrum was recorded ata4cm–1 resolution using rapid scan FTIR (37Braiman M.S. Ahl P.L. Rothschild K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5221-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and averaged over the first 85 ms of the photocycle. The recovery rate of the protein dark state was estimated by measuring the decay of intensity of the negative ethylenic C=C stretching band of the chromophore at 1545 cm–1 (Ref. 38Gellini C. Luttenberg B. Sydor J. Engelhard M. Hildebrandt P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; see Ref. 36Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar for details). A best fit single exponential curve was obtained using regression analysis, and the exponential time decay constant was determined as between 200 and 250 ms, somewhat faster than the slowest time constant obtained by flash photolysis experiments (340 ms) (12Scharf B. Pevec B. Hess B. Engelhard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The spectrum shown in Fig. 1 is very similar to the late M intermediate spectra (101-ms half-time) of SRII recorded using step-scan FTIR at 37 °Cand8cm–1 resolution (32Hein M. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to the band at 1545 (–) cm–1, negative bands corresponding to the C–C stretch of the chromophore in the dark state SRII appear at 1242, 1200, and 1163 cm–1 (38Gellini C. Luttenberg B. Sydor J. Engelhard M. Hildebrandt P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, a positive band at 1570 (+) corresponds to the C=C stretching mode of the M intermediate (38Gellini C. Luttenberg B. Sydor J. Engelhard M. Hildebrandt P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An additional, small positive band appears near 1530 cm–1 assigned to the C=C stretch mode of the O intermediate (32Hein M. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Gellini C. Luttenberg B. Sydor J. Engelhard M. Hildebrandt P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In general, the O and possibly N photointermediates have been found to be present in dynamic equilibrium with the M state (13Chizhov I. Schmies G. Seidel R. Sydor J.R. Luttenberg B. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and therefore may not be easily separated from the M state by varying the pH or temperature. In addition to vibrations of the retinylidene chromophore, several bands in the C=O carboxylic acid stretch region (1700–1800 cm–1) and the amide I region (1600–1700 cm–1) can be assigned to protein vibrations. For example, the positive band at 1764 cm–1 arises from the protonation of the Schiff base counterion (Asp75) (33Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in analogy with a similar band found near this frequency in almost all other microbial rhodopsins including BR (26Rothschild K.J. Zagaeski M. Cantore W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and NOP-1 (36Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A previously unreported negative band also appears at 1724 cm–1 that becomes more intense for spectra recorded at pH 6 (Fig. 1, bottom). Because no positive component is seen, this band most likely reflects the deprotonation of an as yet unidentified Asp/Glu residue that has a pKa at or below 7. A similar band is also observed in the low temperature spectrum of transducer-free SRII at 243 K (data not shown). Its assignment to an Asp/Glu group is also indicated by the disappearance of this band in D2O (Fig. 1, inset) and its possible downshift to 1719 cm–1. An additional positive/negative pair of bands at 1707/1701 cm–1 has been assigned using site-directed mutagenesis to Asn105 in the K and M intermediates of SRII (33Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the corresponding residue, Asp115, in BR also responds to photoisomerization as early as the K intermediate (39Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Marti T. Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 (inset), these bands are not appreciably affected by H2O → D2O exchange. Bands also appear in the amide I region at 1686 (–), 1664 (–), 1644 (+), 1633 (–), and 1618 (+) cm–1 in agreement with earlier studies (29Engelhard M. Scharf B. Siebert F.

A small shoulder at 1657 cm–1 (Fig. 1, inset) most likely corresponds to the C=N stretch of the protonated Schiff base, which downshifts as expected to near 1633 cm–1 in D2O (32Hein M. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Siebert F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The negative band at 1664 cm–1 is of particular interest because earlier studies on BR using polarized FTIR associate a negative band at a slightly higher frequency (1669 cm–1) to a small outward tilting (away from the membrane normal) of the α-helical structure (40Earnest T.N. Roepe P. Braiman M.S. Gillespie J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7793-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Time-resolved FTIR difference spectra were also recorded of the SRII-HtrII fusion complex (Fig. 2) under identical conditions as described above for the transducer-free SRII. Although the transducer-free and fusion complex exhibit similar difference spectra, several distinct highly reproducible alterations were found and are discussed below. Chromophore—Negative peaks characteristic of the dark-adapted SRII at 1545, 1242, 1200, and 1163 cm–1 (see above) and of the M intermediate at 1570 cm–1 are still present in the fusion complex. However, the intensity of the 1545 (–) cm–1 band is somewhat reduced compared with SRII. This phenomenon might be due to the formation of an N-like intermediate that exhibits a positive band with a slightly upshifted ethylenic stretch frequency that cancels the negative 1545 cm–1 band in analogy to a similar effect in BR (41Bousché O. Braiman M. He Y.W. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11063-11067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, such an upshifted band is evident in fusion samples studied under conditions of high humidity as described below (see Fig. 4). Alternatively, a positive band could arise from contributions of the amide II mode. Contributions of the O intermediate, which gives rise to a band at 1530 cm–1, are slightly reduced at pH 8 in the fusion complex (Fig. 2, top) compared with the receptor alone and thus could not account for the reduced intensity of the 1545 (–)cm–1 band. Asp/Glu Carboxylic Acid Groups—The region above 1700 cm–1 undergoes several distinct changes. At both pH 6 and 8, the band at 1724 cm–1 is absent, indicating that this group is no longer undergoing a deprotonation in the fusion complex. One possibility is that this band arises from Asp193 in helix G, which corresponds to the proton release group, Glu204 in BR (see “Discussion”). In addition, a new negative band appears near 1715 cm–1 in the fusion complex in H2O, but not D2O, indicating it originates from a carboxylic acid group. It is possible that this band is simply downshifted from the 1724 cm–1 band observed in the transducer-free receptor. However, it appears to be present at both pH 8 and 6 (Fig. 2) and thus is likely to arise from a completely different group. It may reflect the deprotonation of an Asp/Glu group on the transducer such as Glu43 on TM1, which is hydrogen-bonded to Thr189 on helix F (9Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast to the 1724 cm–1 peak, the positive band at 1764 cm–1 caused by Asp75 appears at the same frequency and undergoes an identical 12 cm–1 downshift in D2O in both spectra (Fig. 3). Because the C=O stretching frequency and extent of its D2O-induced shift are sensitive to the hydrogen bonding strength (42Maeda A. Sasaki J. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Chang M. Ni B. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4684-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the environment of Asp75 seems to be unchanged by the presence of transducer. Asn/Gln C=O Groups—The positive/negative band at 1707/ 1701 cm–1 assigned to Asn105 (33Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is replaced by a more intense negative doublet at 1701/1688 cm–1 (Fig. 2, insets). Interactive subtraction of the two spectra reveals that the 1707/1701 cm–1 feature is still present but superimposed on an additional negative band located near 1694 cm–1 (Fig. 3, inset). Such a feature would be consistent with an additional Asn or Gln residue undergoing a structural change. One possibility is Asn74 on TM2 which hydrogen bonds with Tyr199 of the receptor (9Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Bueldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that this band, which falls in the amide I region, reflects alterations in secondary structure of the transducer. The 1701/1688 (–) cm–1 doublet is also present in the D2O spectra (Fig. 3), although the intensity of the 1701 cm–1 band is reduced, possibly because of the downshift of the 1694 (–) cm–1 band observed in the H2O double difference spectrum to near 1689 cm–1 upon the D2O exchange. A frequency down-shift caused by the H2O → D2O exchange is compatible with assignment of this band to either an Asn or amide I vibration (43Parker F.S.

Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Tyrosine Groups—Alterations are observed in the 1250–1280 cm–1 region (Fig. 2, insets), which is typical for the vibration modes of tyrosine such as previously observed for the case of BR and assigned to Tyr185 (45Braiman M.S.

https://openalex.org/W2090052046,"When Chlamydomonas gametes of opposite mating type are mixed together, flagellar adhesion through sex-specific adhesion molecules triggers a transient elevation of intracellular cAMP, leading to gamete activation in preparation for cell-cell fusion and zygote formation. Here, we have identified a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity that is stimulated by flagellar adhesion. We determined that the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibited fertilization, and that fertilization was rescued by dibutyryl cAMP, indicating that the genistein-sensitive step was upstream of the increase in cAMP. Incubation with ATP of flagella isolated from non-adhering and adhering gametes followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that adhesion activated a flagellar PTK that phosphorylated a 105-kDa flagellar protein. Assays using an exogenous protein-tyrosine kinase substrate confirmed that the activated PTK could be detected only in flagella isolated from adhering gametes. Our results indicate that stimulation of the PTK is a very early event during fertilization. Activation of the PTK was blocked when gametes underwent flagellar adhesion in the presence of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, but not in the presence of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, H8, which (unlike staurosporine) does not block the increases in cAMP. In addition, incubation of gametes of a single mating type in dibutyryl cAMP failed to activate the PTK. Finally, flagella adhesion between plus and minus fla10-1 gametes, which have a temperature-sensitive lesion in the microtubule motor protein kinesin-II, failed to activate the PTK at elevated temperatures.

Gamete activation includes cell wall loss, movement of proteins (including agglutinins) from the cell body to the flagella, modification of the flagellar tip, phosphorylation of a gamete-specific homeodomain protein involved in activation of zygote-specific genes (1Zhao H. Lu M. Singh R. Snell W.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2767-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), activation of mating structures, and redistribution of the adhesion/fusion protein Fus1 onto the surface of the mt+ mating structure (Ref. 2Misamore M.J.

Microbiol. 2000; 3: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several years ago it was shown that one of the earliest biochemical events triggered by flagellar adhesion is a 10–20-fold increase in intracellular cAMP (4Pijst H.L.A. van Driel R. Janssens P.M.W. Musgrave A. van den Ende H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 174: 132-136Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) brought about by adhesion-induced activation of a flagellar adenylyl cyclase (6Saito T. Small L. Goodenough U.W. J.

Related experiments showing that addition of dibutyryl cAMP to gametes of a single mating type induced all of the events known to occur during flagellar adhesion has confirmed that cAMP is a key second messenger in Chlamydomonas fertilization (3Pan J. Snell W.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistent with a central role for cAMP in gamete activation, H8, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A does not interfere with flagellar adhesion (5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or the adhesion-induced rise in intracellular cAMP (9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but all of the downstream events that normally accompany the increase in cAMP are blocked by H8. In previous studies we have established that the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocked flagellar adhesion-induced activation of the gamete-specific flagellar adenylyl cyclase (7Zhang Y.H. Ross E.M. Snell W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22954-22959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Biol.

More recently, we determined that the microtubule motor protein, kinesin-II, also is essential for the flagellar adhesion-induced increase in cAMP (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that fla10-1 gametes, which have a mutation in the kinesin-II gene (11Huang B. Rifkin M.R. Luck D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 72: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Lux F.G.D. Dutcher S.K. Genetics. 1991; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Walther Z. Vashishtha M. Hall J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), exhibited wild type levels of flagellar adhesion, but failed to undergo gamete activation (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Piperno G. Mead K. Henderson S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that the fla10 gametes were blocked at the step that couples agglutinin interactions to activation of adenylyl cyclase. Here, we have investigated the very early events that occur following flagellar adhesion to identify a flagellar protein kinase activity stimulated by adhesion, and we examined the role of kinesin-II in protein kinase activation. We show that incubation of gametes in the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, does not interfere with flagellar adhesion, but inhibits the gamete activation that follows as assessed by gamete fusion. The block can be overcome by incubation of the gametes in dibutyryl cAMP, implicating a protein-tyrosine kinase in the pathway that connects flagellar adhesion to activation of adenylyl cyclase. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that immediately after flagellar adhesion is initiated, a flagellar protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) is activated whose substrate is a soluble, ∼105-kDa flagellar protein. Our data indicate that flagellar adhesion per se, and not the downstream events, including protein kinase A activation and gamete fusion that normally accompany flagellar adhesion, is sufficient to activate the PTK. Moreover, microtubule-based motility and intraflagellar transport are connected to regulation of the PTK, because the PTK is not activated during flagellar adhesion between fla10-1 mt+ and mt– gametes, which have a lesion in the microtubule motor protein, kinesin-II. Chemicals and Reagents—Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-Tyr(P)) 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), HEPES, N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (H8), staurosporine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2-cAMP), cAMP, ATP, papaverine, and genistein were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The ECL Western blotting kit was from Amersham Biosciences. Cells and Cell Culture—Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains 21gr (mt+) (CC-1690), 6145c (mt–) (CC-1691), fus1-1 (mt+) (CC-1158) (all available from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center, Duke University), and strains fla10-1 (4930 3–4, mt+) and fla10-1 (4930 6–2, mt–) (provided by Dr. Susan Dutcher, Washington University, St. Louis) were cultured vegetatively in liquid culture with aeration and gametic cells were obtained as described previously (15Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 48-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To activate gametes of a single mating type, cells were incubated with 15 mm Bt2-cAMP and 150 μm papaverine in N-free medium for ∼30 min. Assessments of gamete activation as determined by assaying cell wall loss and zygote formation as determined by formation of quadriflagellated cells were carried out as described previously (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the experiments at 32 °C, wild-type gametes and fla10-1 mutant gametes were incubated with illumination in a water bath with constant aeration. Isolation of Flagella—Flagella were isolated by use of the pH shock method of Witman et al. (16Witman G.B. Carlson K. Berliner J. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 507-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. Gametes (typically ∼6 liters, at 5 × 106 cells per ml in N-free medium) were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 3 min and resuspended in 5% sucrose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The cells were placed on ice and the flagella were immediately detached by rapidly reducing the pH to 4.5 using 0.5 m acetic acid with constant stirring. Deflagellation, which usually occurred within 15 s, was confirmed using phase-contrast microscopy and the cells were neutralized with 0.5 m KOH. Cell bodies were removed by centrifugation through a 15-ml cushion of 25% sucrose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, in 50-ml conical tubes at 3,000 × g for 9 min. The remaining cell bodies were removed from the top layer by centrifugation through a second 25% sucrose, 20 mm HEPES layer. Flagella were harvested from the overlying supernatant by centrifugation in an HB-4 rotor at 8,000 rpm for 15 min. The resulting pellet was thoroughly resuspended to a concentration of ∼3 mg/ml protein in 5% sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing a 1/100 dilution of the protease inhibitor mixture for plant cells from Sigma (catalogue number P9599). The suspension was divided into small portions, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. For fractionation, flagella (∼300 μg of protein in 100 μl 5% sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) isolated from mixed plus and minus gametes and frozen as described above were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Sigma 1–15K refrigerated table top centrifuge, rotor number 12132) for 20 min to yield the freeze/thaw supernatant fraction and the disrupted, sedimented flagella. The sedimented flagella were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A that contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, kept on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged again as above to yield the 0.1% Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction. The sedimented material was resuspended by pipetting and sonication in 100 μl of buffer A. Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent of Pierce using crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard. Assays for Protein-tyrosine Kinase Activity—Flagellar PTK activity was assayed in vitro using both endogenous substrates and an exogenously added PTK substrate. For assays using endogenous flagellar proteins as substrates, samples (5 μl) of whole flagella (∼3 μg/μl protein) or flagellar fractions (∼0.3–3.0 μg/μl protein) in 5% sucrose, 20 mm HEPES buffer were mixed with 5 μl of 2× PTK buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 2% Sigma plant protease inhibitor mixture) at 23 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends. Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by addition of 5 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.4 m dithiothreitol. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were cooled on ice and loaded onto 8% mini-slab gels. Electrophoresis was performed at 48 mA for 1.5 h as described previously (17Wilson N.F. O'Connell J.S. Lu M. Snell W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34383-34388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To assay for PTK activity using an exogenous substrate, we used the dot-blot method of Allis et al. (18Allis C.D. Chicoine L.G. Glover C.V. White E.M. Gorovsky M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with the peptide poly((l-glutamic acid:l-tyrosine)EY4:1) (PGT) as substrate. The freeze/thaw supernatants of flagella (10 μl in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, buffer containing 0.3 μg/μl protein) isolated from mt+ gametes alone, mt– gametes alone, and from adhering mt+ and mt– gametes were incubated with 10 μl of PTK buffer that contained 0.3 mg/ml PGT (Sigma) for 0–30 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of stop reagent (0.25 m EDTA + 0.25 m EGTA, pH 8.0) and 5-μl portions were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran™ B85, Schleicher & Schuell Inc., Keene, NH) followed by processing to detect phosphotyrosine by use of the method described below for immunoblotting. Immunoblot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, and 192 mm glycine at 100 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 1× TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) (19Hulen D. Baron A. Salisbury J. Clarke M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Tyr(P) 4G10 in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, membranes were washed three times with 1× TBST for about 20 min and incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase in blocking solution. The membrane was washed and developed with ECL Western blotting reagents as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, proteins were detected after immunoblotting by staining the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for ∼5 min, followed by destaining in methanol:acetic acid:water (5:1:5). To determine whether protein-tyrosine kinase activity was required during flagellar adhesion-induced gamete activation in Chlamydomonas, we used the PTK inhibitor, genistein. We pretreated mt+ and mt– gametes in genistein for 30 min, mixed the cells together in the continued presence of the inhibitor, and assessed zygote formation as a measure of gamete activation. Phase-contrast and bright field microscopy (not shown) indicated that the inhibitor had little effect on flagellar adhesion, with 80–90% of the cells forming the large, swirling clumps of adhering cells that typify cell-cell adhesion in this highly motile organism. On the other hand, the inhibitor had a significant effect on gamete fusion, an event that only activated gametes can undergo, blocking fusion by 30% at 10 μg/ml and 87% at 20 μg/ml (Fig. 1). To determine whether the genistein blocked cell fusion per se, or if the block was upstream of the adhesion-dependent increase in cAMP, gametes that had been incubated in genistein subsequently were incubated in dibutyryl cAMP and papaverine, a treatment known to induce gamete activation (5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and then mixed together. As shown in Fig. 1, the Bt2-cAMP treatment overcame the genistein inhibition of fusion. The reversal of inhibition by incubation of the gametes in dibutyryl cAMP was consistent with the idea that the genistein-sensitive step in the signaling pathway was upstream of the increase in cAMP induced by flagellar adhesion. These results implicated a PTK activity early during flagellar adhesion-induced gamete activation. A Protein-tyrosine Kinase That Phosphorylates a 105-kDa Protein Is Activated by Flagellar Adhesion—To test for activation of PTKs induced by flagellar adhesion, we isolated flagella from mt+ gametes alone and mt– gametes alone, and from mt+ and mt– gametes that were undergoing flagellar adhesion and gamete activation. Each of the flagellar samples was incubated for 10 min in a protein kinase assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). As shown in Fig. 2 (left panel), a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼105 kDa was readily and consistently detected in the adhering sample (mt+ and mt–) and was not present in flagella isolated from mt+ or mt– gametes alone (mt+, mt–). The middle panel in Fig. 2 shows the immunoblot stained with Coomassie Blue. The presence of approximately equal amounts of tubulin, which are the two strongly stained bands at ∼50 kDa, documented the comparable loading of the lanes. The right panel in Fig. 2 shows results from a control experiment in which the detergent-soluble, matrix fraction (see below) of flagella isolated from adhering gametes was assayed for PTK in the absence and the presence of ATP. The phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was detected only when the assay was carried out in the presence of ATP. These results suggested that a flagellar PTK that phosphorylated a 105-kDa flagellar protein was activated soon after mt+ and mt– gametes were mixed together and underwent flagellar adhesion. Fig. 3A shows a time course for the in vitro phosphorylation assay. Samples prepared from flagella isolated from mt+ gametes alone (mt+), from mt– gametes alone (mt–), and from adhering mt+ and mt– gametes that had been mixed together for 10 min (mt+ & mt–) were incubated as above in the protein kinase assay buffer for the indicated times followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). Phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was not detected in any of the samples at 0 min and did not appear at any time in the flagellar samples from the mt+ or mt– gametes alone. In the flagellar samples isolated from adhering mt+ and mt– gametes (mt+ & mt–), phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was detectable within 2 min after the incubation with ATP began and continued to increase during the 15-min assay. To determine whether the results were because of activation of a PTK or, for example, a change in accessibility of the substrate, we used an exogenous protein-tyrosine kinase substrate, polyglutamine tyrosine (4:1) (PGT) to assay for an adhesion-induced increase in PTK activity. Samples from flagella isolated from mt+ gametes alone, mt– gametes alone, and from adhering mt+ and mt– gametes were incubated with protein kinase buffer that included PGT. At the indicated times, samples were spotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and after several washes, the blot was processed to detect phosphotyrosine with the 4G10 antibody used for immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, there was substantial phosphorylation of the peptide substrate only in samples from adhering gametes (mt+ & mt–; PGT). Control assays, which did not contain PGT, carried out with flagellar samples from adhering gametes displayed a low level of activity (mt+ & mt–; no PGT), which presumably was because of phosphorylation of the endogenous 105-kDa substrate. The control, non-adhering mt+ and mt– samples (mt+, mt–) showed only a low level of activity that was much less than that exhibited by the samples from the adhering cells. Thus, experiments using endogenous and exogenous substrates indicated that flagellar adhesion activated a flagellar PTK. We investigated the time during fertilization when the PTK was activated. To do this, mt+ and mt– gametes were mixed together and at various times after mixing, the flagella were detached and isolated and samples were assayed for the presence of the active PTK. As shown in Fig. 4A while PTK activity was high in flagella isolated from gametes that had been mixed for 3 min or more, the PTK activity was detectable in flagella isolated from gametes that had been mixed for only 30 s. These results indicated that PTK activation took place very soon after gametes adhered to each other, most likely before gamete fusion, for example, which begins to take place 3–5 min after mixing. To further examine the properties of the PTK and its 105-kDa protein substrate, we identified the flagellar compartment in which the PTK and the substrate were localized. For fractionation, the flagella were disrupted by freezing and thawing and the sample was centrifuged to yield the freeze/thaw supernatant (matrix fraction). The sedimented flagella with their disrupted membranes (20Zhang Y. Snell W.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 21Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 993-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) were further fractionated by detergent extraction and centrifugation and equivalent portions of each fraction were assayed for PTK activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, phosphorylation of the 105-kDa protein was detected only in the starting sample of whole flagella and in the initial freeze/thaw supernatant from the disrupted flagella. The results indicated that both the protein kinase and its substrate were released from flagella by freezing and thawing. Activation of the Flagellar PTK Occurs at a Very Early Step during Gamete Interactions—We used the protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H8 to examine the stage during flagellar adhesion and gamete activation that the PTK was activated. Previously, we showed that while flagellar adhesion was unaffected by these inhibitors, gamete activation was blocked, albeit at different steps by each inhibitor. The staurosporine-sensitive block is upstream of activation of adenylyl cyclase, as cAMP levels fail to increase when gametes undergo flagellar adhesion in the presence of staurosporine (9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have also shown that H8, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, does not block the flagellar adhesion-induced increase in cAMP, but inhibits steps in gamete activation, including cell wall release and cell-cell fusion, that are down-stream of activation of adenylyl cyclase (9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test the effects of the inhibitors on activation of the PTK, we preincubated mt+ and mt– gametes in each inhibitor and mixed the cells together in the continued presence of the inhibitors. Examination by light microscopy indicated that, as previously reported (9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), flagellar adhesion occurred normally between mt+ and mt– gametes in the presence of each of the inhibitors, but cell fusion was blocked (not shown). Flagella were isolated from mt+ and mt– gametes that were mixed together in the presence and absence of each of the inhibitors as well as from control, non-treated, adhering cells and assayed for the PTK activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, the PTK became activated in flagella of control, adhering cells (C) and in flagella isolated from gametes adhering in the presence of H8, whereas activation of the PTK did not occur in flagella isolated from gametes that had undergone flagellar adhesion in the presence of staurosporine (St). These results indicated that activation of the PTK required a staurosporine-sensitive step and suggested that the PTK was activated at an early stage during gamete activation, down-stream of agglutinin interactions and flagellar adhesion and upstream of the appearance of cAMP. In an independent test of the results indicating that activation of the PTK was upstream of cyclic nucleotide-activated processes, including gamete fusion, we used fus1-1 mt+ gametes, which are capable of undergoing flagellar adhesion and gamete activation, but are unable to fuse (22Goodenough U.W. Hwang C. Martin H. Genetics. 1976; 82: 169-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Goodenough U. Armbrust E. Campbell A. Ferris P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 21-44Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). fus1-1 mt+ gametes were mixed with wild type mt– gametes and, 3 min after mixing, flagella were isolated and subjected to the in vitro PTK assay. As expected, the gametes underwent flagellar adhesion and gamete activation as evidenced by cell wall loss, but they did not fuse to form quadriflagellated zygotes (not shown). On the other hand, the in vitro assay showed that the PTK was activated (Fig. 5B). Thus, consistent with the H8 experiment above, flagellar adhesion in the absence of gamete fusion was sufficient to activate the PTK (Fig. 5B). It was also possible that activation of the PTK did not require flagellar adhesion per se, but was downstream of the increase in cAMP and involved a cAMP-induced event that was not sensitive to H8. We tested this idea by assaying for the PTK activity in flagella isolated from gametes of a single mating type that were activated by incubation in dibutyryl cAMP and papaverine. The requirement for flagellar adhesion to initiate many of the cellular events that prepare gametes for cell fusion can be bypassed by incubating gametes of a single mating type in the cell-permeable cAMP analogue, Bt2-cAMP and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, papaverine (5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We incubated gametes of a single mating type in Bt2-cAMP for 30 min, confirmed that they had become activated as determined by an assay for cell wall loss (not shown), and then assessed activation of the PTK. As shown in Fig. 5C, flagellar samples from adhering gametes exhibited the expected phosphorylation of the 105-kDa protein, whereas flagella isolated from mt+ gametes or mt– gametes alone activated by Bt2-cAMP failed to show active PTK in the in vitro assay. These results indicated that activation of the PTK required flagellar adhesion and was upstream of the appearance of cAMP. As a further test for a possible role for cAMP in activating the PTK, we assessed whether inclusion of cAMP in the PTK assay would stimulate the PTK activity in flagellar samples isolated from mt+ or mt– gametes alone. As shown in Fig. 5C, inclusion of cAMP in the assay of flagella isolated from gametes of a single mating type did not lead to activation of the PTK. The PTK Is Not Activated during Flagellar Adhesion in fla10-1 Gametes, Which Contain a Lesion in the Microtubule Motor Protein Kinesin-II—Previously, we showed that coupling of flagellar adhesion to the increase in cAMP was disrupted in gametes of the fla10-1 mutant (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Piperno G. Mead K. Henderson S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which express a kinesin-II with a temperature-sensitive defect in the 90-kDa motor subunit FLA10 because of a single amino acid substitution in the motor domain (13Walther Z. Vashishtha M. Hall J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The defective kinesin-II is expressed in fla10-1 gametes, but at much lower levels than in wild type cells. When fla10-1 cells are grown at room temperature they are fully flagellated and exhibit IFT. On the other hand when grown at elevated temperature (32 °C), the cells do not have flagella (13Walther Z. Vashishtha M. Hall J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J.

In cells grown at room temperature and shifted to 32 °C, IFT particle movement ceases after about 40 min and within 1–2 h, the flagella begin to resorb (12Lux F.G.D. Dutcher S.K. Genetics. 1991; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Himelblau A.L. Beech P.L. Fuster J.C. Rosenbaum J.L. J.

For our experiments, fla10-1 mt+ and fla10-1 mt– gametes cultured at 21 °C were shifted to 32 °C for 40 min, mixed together, and their flagella were isolated 10 min after mixing. Flagella also were isolated from adhering mt+ fla10-1 gametes and mt– fla10-1 gametes that were mixed together at 21 °C, from wild type gametes mixed together at 21 °C, and from wild gametes shifted to 32 °C for 40 min before being mixed together for 3 min. As shown in Fig. 6, when analyzed by the in vitro assay, flagellar samples from wild type gametes mixed at 32 °C showed a slight reduction in ability to phosphorylate the 105-kDa protein compared with flagellar samples isolated from wild type gametes mixed at 21 °C. On the other hand, although phosphorylation of the 105-kDa protein was similar to wild type levels in assays of the 21 °C fla10-1 samples, phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was not detected in assays of the 32 °C fla10-1 samples. The bottom panel of Fig. 6, which is a loading control, shows the same samples probed with an antibody against a 48-kDa Chlamydomonas protein (25Kurvari V. Zhang Y.H. Luo Y.X. Snell W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Luo Y. Emmett K. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and documents equivalent protein loading. Thus, coupled with their failure to undergo increases in cAMP during flagellar adhesion at elevated temperature (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), fla10-1 gametes also failed to show flagellar adhesion-induced activation of the PTK. Previous studies on the molecular events regulated by flagellar adhesion during fertilization in Chlamydomonas indicated that flagellar protein kinases are activated at an early step after adhesion between mt+ and mt– flagella, before the adhesion-induced increase in cAMP (7Zhang Y.H. Ross E.M. Snell W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22954-22959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Biol.

In addition, we recently reported that in cells with a defect in the microtubule motor protein kinesin-II, gamete activation was blocked at a step downstream of flagellar adhesion but upstream of the adhesion-induced increase in cAMP (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we identified a protein-tyrosine kinase activity that was regulated by flagellar adhesion per se, and not by the downstream events that accompany flagellar adhesion such as increased levels of cAMP, activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, or cell-cell fusion. Initial experiments with the PTK inhibitor genistein implicated PTK activity in fertilization downstream of flagellar adhesion and upstream of the increase in cAMP (Fig. 1). Use of in vitro PTK assays revealed a PTK activity that was present in flagella isolated from adhering gametes and that was nearly undetectable in flagella isolated from gametes of either mating type that had not been mixed with gametes of the opposite mating type (and therefore had not undergone flagellar adhesion). Importantly, flagellar adhesion was sufficient to activate the PTK, but not in gametes with a lesion in the microtubule motor protein, kinesin-II. A working model consistent with these data is that flagellar adhesion leads to a rapid stimulation of PTK activity in a pathway involving kinesin-II-dependent intraflagellar transport. PTK activation is followed, in turn, by activation of the adenylyl cyclase and gamete activation (Fig. 7). For detection of the activated PTK in these experiments, it was essential to incubate the flagellar samples with ATP before carrying out SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2, when ATP was left out of the in vitro assay, phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was not detected; similarly, in the experiments to examine the relationship between the extent of phosphorylation and assay time, no phosphorylation of the 105-kDa protein was detected in the 0 time point sample. Previous experiments from our laboratory and others (7Zhang Y.H. Ross E.M. Snell W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22954-22959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Bloodgood R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) on protein kinase activity in Chlamydomonas have shown that flagella contain high levels of protein phosphatase activity, and the omission of phosphatase inhibitors in the in vitro assay used in the current experiments led to much reduced levels of phosphorylation (not shown). Use of the exogenous PTK substrate PGT was important as an independent confirmation of PTK activation and also should be useful for future experiments to identify and further characterize this adhesion-regulated PTK. Several independent approaches indicated that activation of the PTK was a very early event during gamete activation: activation required flagellar adhesion, occurred within seconds after gametes of opposite mating type were mixed together, and took place at the same time or earlier than the increases in levels of cAMP shown previously (5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results strongly indicated that PTK activation was not dependent on increases in cAMP or cell fusion and was induced by flagellar adhesion per se. Thus, fus1-1 mutant gametes, which are capable of flagellar adhesion but not gamete fusion, showed adhesion-dependent activation of the PTK. Similarly, when gametes underwent flagellar adhesion in the presence of the inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, H8, gamete activation was blocked as assessed by the absence of cell wall loss and gamete fusion, but the PTK still was activated. And, while incubation of gametes of a single mating type in dibutyryl cAMP bypasses the requirement for flagellar adhesion and induces the cellular changes that normally accompany flagellar adhesion, the PTK was not activated in such artificially activated cells. In addition, inclusion of cAMP in the in vitro assay for PTK activity in flagella isolated from gametes of a single mating type did not lead to activation of the PTK. Whereas the evidence is compelling that PTK activation is not downstream of activation of adenylyl cyclase and that regulation of both activities is tightly coupled to flagellar adhesion, determining whether PTK activation is upstream of activation of the flagellar adenylyl cyclase or in a parallel signaling pathway remains to be achieved. Activation of the PTK (Fig. 4) and increases in cAMP (5Pasquale S.M. Goodenough U.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2279-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are the earliest biochemical or cellular events that have been demonstrated after flagellar adhesion is initiated, occurring within seconds after cells are mixed together. Activation of the PTK (Fig. 5) and the increase in cAMP and gamete activation are blocked when cells undergo flagellar adhesion in staurosporine (9Zhang Y. Snell W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that the activity of one or more protein kinases is essential for activation of the PTK and the adenylyl cyclase. Finally, adhesion-induced stimulation of the PTK (Fig. 6), increases in cAMP and gamete activation (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) fail in fla10-1 gametes, which have a lesion in the microtubule motor protein kinesin-II (13Walther Z. Vashishtha M. Hall J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The simplest model that explains the data is that a single signaling pathway is initiated by flagellar adhesion. Because cAMP-regulated events are down-stream of the PTK, it is likely that the PTK is upstream of adenylyl cyclase. In addition, all of the cellular events characterized to date that compose gamete activation, including flagellar tip activation, movement of agglutinin molecules from the cell body to the flagella, cell wall loss, and activation of mating structures are downstream of activation of adenylyl cyclase. That is, all these cellular responses can be induced by incubation of gametes of a single mating type in dibutyryl cAMP. Therefore, if the PTK is part of a signaling pathway that is independent of cAMP, the events induced by that putative pathway have not yet been reported. The observation that fla10-1 gametes at elevated temperature fail to activate the PTK (Fig. 6) is the second demonstration that kinesin-II plays a direct or indirect role in adhesion-induced signaling in Chlamydomonas (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Pan J. Snell W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Microtubule motor proteins have been implicated in other signal transduction pathways in Chlamydomonas (10Pan J. Snell W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Pan J. Snell W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 3Pan J.

Biol. 2002; 3: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) and it will be interesting to determine the role of kinesin-II function in coupling agglutinin interactions during flagellar adhesion to gamete activation. For example, kinesin-II-dependent movement of IFT particles might be required for maintaining proper levels of key signaling proteins in the flagella. Or, binding between mt+ and mt– agglutinin molecules might trigger conformational changes in the interacting molecules that induce them to associate with kinesin-II or IFT particles as an early step in signal transduction. The results presented here should now make it possible to continue a detailed dissection of the molecular pathways that underlie cell-cell adhesion-induced signal transduction during fertilization in Chlamydomonas.

https://openalex.org/W2066410227,"Two hepatocarcinoma cell lines, the Hepa-1 wild-type (c1c7) and the beta-subunit mutated (c4) lacking hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activity, were differentially susceptible to apoptosis by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The c4 cells were 40% apoptotic 48 h after HGF treatment. On the contrary, the wild-type c1c7 cells showed modest signs of apoptosis only at 72 h. The revertant vT[2] cells, consisting of c4 cells stably transfected with HIF-1beta expression vector, behaved as the parental cells. To understand the mechanisms of this different sensitivity, we examined a panel of genes involved in apoptosis: ornithine decarboxylase, c-Myc and p53 protein levels progressively decreased while JNK1, caspase 8 and 3 activities persistently increased in c4 cells undergoing apoptosis. Distinct time-related events in c1c7 cells were the transient activations of JNK1 and caspase 8 followed by the accumulation of ODC and c-Myc proteins. The proapoptotic effect of HGF in c4 hepatocarcinoma cells seems to be related to HIF-1 deficiency with loss of cytoprotective and signalling functions. This may contribute to the triggering of the extrinsic pathway consisting in caspase 8 activation, which in turn causes BID cleavage and cytochrome c release. The effector caspase 3 is also activated."

https://openalex.org/W2163031867,"To investigate the subcellular distributions of Smad proteins, the intracellular mediators of transforming growth factor-β family cytokines, we examined their sequences for nuclear export signals (NES). We found a leucine-rich NES-like motif (termed NES2) in the central linker region of the receptor-regulated Smads that is absent from the other two classes of Smads (Co-Smads and I-Smads). In microinjection assays, NES2 peptide caused nuclear export of a fused glutathione S-transferase protein. Mutations in NES2 converted Smad1 from an even distribution throughout the cells into an exclusive nuclear localization in both transiently and stably expressing cell lines, and this nuclear enrichment was more pronounced than that induced by mutations in NES1. Furthermore, overexpression of CRM1, the cellular export receptor, transforms Smad1 into a mostly cytoplasmic profile by enhancing its nuclear export. The Smad1 NES2 mutant but not the Smad1 NES1 mutant is mostly resistant to this cytoplasmic targeting, indicating that NES2, not NES1, is the major target for CRM1 in Smad1. We further confirmed the functionality of NES2 by a heterokaryon assay. The Smad1 NES1 mutant displays good ligand responsiveness and moderately lowered transcriptional activity compared with wild type Smad1. In contrast, the Smad1 NES2 mutant shows a severe disruption in reporter gene activation, minimal response to bone morphogenetic protein stimulation, and significantly lowered bone morphogenetic protein-induced phosphorylation, which may be the reason for its deficient transcription activity. Thus, we have defined a major NES in Smad1 that is essential for its ligand-induced coupling with cell surface receptors and hence, transcriptional activity. Our study, along with recent studies of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins, demonstrate that continued nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is a common requisite for the active signaling of R-Smads. Although conserved in other R-Smads such as Smad3, NES2 is not functional in these R-Smads because CRM1 overexpression fails to target them to cytoplasm.

Smad proteins are intracellular mediators of TGF-β 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; R-Smad, receptor-regulated Smads; NES, nuclear export signals; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; WT, wild-type. family cytokines and modulate a variety of important biological processes such as growth control, wound repair, bone morphogenesis, and immune responses. After binding to their respective type II receptors, TGF-β family cytokines induce the heterodimerization of type I and type II receptors, resulting in the activation of the kinase activity of type I receptors, which proceeds to phosphorylate Smad proteins at their C termini. This phosphorylation event stimulates nuclear translocation of Smads and their transcriptional activities inside the nucleus (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smads are classified into three subclasses based on structure and function. Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) directly interact with activated TGF-β type I receptors and undergo phosphorylation at the C terminus. This class includes Smad1, -5, and -8, which mediate BMP signaling events, and Smad2 and -3, which mediate TGF-β signaling. Co-Smads do not directly bind to the receptors and are not phosphorylated at the C terminus. Rather, they form obligatory partners with R-Smads to facilitate signal transduction. The only mammalian member of this class is Smad4. Inhibitory Smads include Smad6 and Smad7 in animal cells. They are generally viewed as antagonistic to TGF-β or BMP signaling by competing with R-Smads for binding to activated type I receptors and for complex formation with Smad4. Expression of Smad6 and -7 is up-regulated by TGF-β stimulation, thus constituting a negative feedback regulation of its signaling pathways (2Wrana J. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Smads contain two highly conserved domains: the MH1 domain, located at the N terminus and responsible for DNA binding; and the MH2 domain, located at the C terminus and responsible for transcriptional activation and complex formation between different Smads. These are joined in the middle by a more variable proline-rich linker region whose functions remain unclear. Recently, a nuclear export signal (NES) has been identified in the Smad4 linker region that mediates its nuclear exclusion (3Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Repts. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The intracellular distribution of a transcription factor is critical to its functions. The nuclear localization of a protein is usually controlled by two opposing signals: nuclear localization signal (NLS) and NES. NLSs, exemplified by the polybasic T-antigen NLS (monopartite basic NLS) and nucleoplasmin NLS (bipartite basic NLS), are defined as a short peptide motif that is both necessary and sufficient for the nuclear translocation of a protein. Conversely, an NES, such as the leucine-rich NES of HIV Rev protein, is a short sequence that is necessary and sufficient for nuclear export of its host protein. Certain transcription factors are constitutively nuclear because of the presence of an active NLS and the absence of an NES. However, some other transcriptional factors, such as the tumor suppressor p53, contain both an NLS and NES, resulting in their constant shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The regulation of this shuttling activity constitutes a critical cellular mechanism to modulate the activities of these transcription factors (4Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 5Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 6Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, R-Smads mostly exist in the cytoplasm; upon ligand activation, they undergo C-terminal phosphorylation, which exposes a basic NLS motif in their MH1 domain and results in its nuclear translocation (7Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Smad4 contains an NES in the segment joining the MH1 domain and the linker, which prevents its nuclear accumulation. It can only achieve nuclear localization after forming a complex with active R-Smads, which sequesters the NES (3Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Repts. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that at steady-state Smad1 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. BMP addition triggers Smad1 phosphorylation and accumulation in the nucleus. Mutations in the N-terminal basic NLS-like motif of Smad1, conserved among all Smads, eliminated its ligand-induced nuclear translocation without affecting its other functions including DNA-binding or complex formation with Smad4. Overexpression of CRM1, the major nuclear export receptor, resulted in Smad1 relocalization to the cytoplasm and inhibition of BMP-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad1. Conversely, addition of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1-mediated nuclear export, induced rapid nuclear accumulation of Smad1. Thus, in addition to the NLS, Smad1 also contains a functional NES(s) and is subject to constant nucleocytoplasmic shuttling regardless of ligand stimulation. The steady-state distribution of Smad1, therefore, reflects a balance between the opposing NLS and NES signals. BMP stimulates Smad1 nuclear accumulation by suppressing its nuclear export and tipping the balance in favor of nuclear import (10Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We identified a C-terminal NES motif (termed NES1) in Smad1 that is functional in driving the nuclear export of a fused GST protein, and mutation of this motif shifts the localization of Smad1 to a partial nuclear profile (10Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, we now report that NES1 is not the only functional NES in Smad1, because overexpression of CRM1 resulted in relocalization of a Smad1 NES1 mutant to the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1), suggesting the existence of another active NES (NES2). Here we report the discovery of NES2 in the adjoining region of Smad1 MH1 and linker domain. Importantly, NES2 appears to be the major NES in Smad1 that is essential for its ligand-induced coupling with cell surface receptors and, hence, its transcriptional activity. Cell Lines and Constructs—GFP-tagged Smad1 was constructed using the Clontech pEGFP-C1 vector, which allows Smad1 fusion to the C terminus of eGFP. Primers corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions of Smad1 were tagged with BglII and EcoRI sites, respectively, and used in PCR with human Smad1 cDNA as template (Pfu polymerase, Stratagene). The products were confirmed by sequencing, digested with BglII and EcoRI, and subcloned into the pEGFP vector. To generate a retroviral vector encoding a GFP-Smad1 fusion, the pEGFP-Smad1 vector was digested with AgeI and SalI and then ligated into a similarly restricted pMX vector to create the pMX-GFP-Smad1 (7Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transfection of this vector allows moderate expression levels of the target protein in mammalian cell lines. BOSC, Mv1LU, or C2C12 cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations of specific amino acids in Smad1 NES1, NES2, and Smad3 NES1 and NES2 were carried out with the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Microinjection—Peptides corresponding to wild-type Smad1 NES2 (130VESPVLPPVLV) or mutant NES2 (VESPAAPPAAV) were fused in-frame to the C terminus of GST and expressed in BL21 cells. Various GST-NES fusion proteins were purified at 0.5–1.0 mg/ml concentration in injection buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl), combined 1:1 with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (15 mg/ml at 4 mol of fluorescein isothiocyanate/mol of dextran, M r 70,000; Molecular Probes) and injected into the nuclei of 35% confluent 3T3 fibroblast cells using an Eppendorf Injectman system at the Keck Microscope Facility at the Whitehead Institute. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, injected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. GST-NES fusion proteins were detected with goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed by donkey anti-goat secondary antibody-Texas Red conjugate (Molecular Probes). Luciferase Assays—Twenty-four hours before transfection, Mv1Lu cells or C2C12 cells were seeded in triplicate at 2 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. 0.75 μg each of 12xGCCG-Luciferase construct (11Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), 0.5 μg of constitutively active ALK3QD, and 0.4 μg of indicated Smad1 vectors were co-transfected per well using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). 0.3 μg of pSVβ (Clontech), encoding β-galactosidase, was included in each sample to control for transfection efficiency. Thirty-six hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described previously (7Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Heterokaryon Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling Assay—Human HeLa cells and mouse NIH 3T3 cells were separately cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were first transfected with GFP-Smad1 constructs by FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, HeLa cells were mixed with an equal number of NIH 3T3 cells and seeded onto 6-well plates. After overnight incubation, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the culture medium to inhibit protein synthesis. After 1–2 h, the co-cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fused with 50% polyethylene glycol 3500 (Sigma) in serum-free medium for 1–2 min, washed twice with medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and incubated in DMEM plus 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for another 1 h before fixation. Before visualization under fluorescence microscope for the GFP signal, the cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to distinguish between HeLa and 3T3 cell nuclei. Smad1 Immunoprecipitation and Phosphoserine Immunoblot— COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-Smad1 WT or NES2–. 24 h post-transfection, cells were starved in DMEM plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 4–6 h and then treated with 100 ng/ml BMP-4 for 1 h. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer plus phosphatase inhibitors (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol plus complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) with NaCl adjusted to 400 mm). After centrifugation, clarified lysates were diluted 1:1 with water and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Smad1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 20–30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added to recover the immune complex, which was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Total GFP-Smad1 in the immunoprecipitate was displayed by anti-GFP immunoblot, serine-phosphorylated Smad1 was revealed with anti-phosphoserine antibody (Zymed Labs, San Francisco, CA). Smad1 Contains a Second NES in the Linker Region— Smad1 shuttles continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm and contains a leucine-rich NES near its C terminus (termed NES1) that is conserved among R-Smads and Co-Smads but not I-Smads (10Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A GFP fusion of WT Smad1 transiently expressed in BOSC cells is uniformly distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 1, panel 1). The best characterized nuclear export pathway uses a leucine-rich NES, which is recognized by the export receptor CRM1. Co-expression of Crm1 resulted in the cytoplasmic redistribution of GFP-WT Smad1, suggesting the presence of a Crm1-dependent NES in Smad1 (10Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutation of the previously identified NES1 (406LTKMCTIRM → 406ATKACTIRM, Smad1 NES1–) resulted in a nuclear enrichment of Smad1 (10 Fig. 1, panel 3). However, overexpression of CRM1 still promoted relocalization of Smad1 NES1– to the cytoplasm (panel 4), indicating that there is another functional NES in Smad1. GFP itself was uniformly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm and did not relocalize on CRM1 coexpression (panels 5 and 6). To identify the other NES(s) in Smad1, we scanned its sequence and noticed a leucine-rich NES-like motif in the N-terminal region of the central linker: 130VESPVLPP V LV; large hydrophobic residues that are presumably critical for the export functions are underlined. Multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 2) demonstrates that this NES motif (termed “NES2”) is well conserved among the mammalian R-Smads of both the BMP and TGF-β pathways (Smad1, -2, -3, and -5) as well as invertebrate R-Smad homologues such as Drosophila MAD and Caenorhabditis elegans Sma-2 (data not shown). However, I-Smads such as Smad6 and -7 lack the second half of this motif including the last three large hydrophobic residues (VLV). Also, despite the fact that NES2 is located in the region of R-Smads that corresponds to that of the Smad4 NES, it is clearly absent from the Co-Smads such as Smad4 and Medea (not shown, Drosophila Smad4 orthologue), which contain a distinct NES. Because NES2 maps to the region joining the MH1 domain and central linker, this may confer greater flexibility and accessibility for its interaction with other proteins. In the Smad3 MH1 domain crystal structure (13Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), the NES2 is at the extreme C terminus of the segment and appears disordered. NES2 Is Functional in a Microinjection Assay—To confirm that Smad1 NES2 behaves as a nuclear export signal, we first studied its export ability in a microinjection assay (Fig. 3A). This assay has been previously used to demonstrate the export capacities of various NES signals (14Elfgang C. Rosorius O. Hofer L. Jaksche H. Hauber J. Bevec D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6229-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Changing the large hydrophobic residues of many CRM1-dependent NESs to alanine disrupts the export functions of the NES (15Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Repts. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because NES2 contains two groups of hydrophobic residues: 130VESPVLPPVLV (underlined), we mutated both groups of “VL” to alanines to eliminate the presumed export functions of NES2 (130VESPVLPPVLV → VESPAAPPAAV). GST fusion proteins with either WT NES2 or mutant NES2 were purified and injected into the nuclei of NIH 3T3-L1 cells. As controls, a GST fusion with the NES of HIV Rev protein was excluded from the nucleus (panels 1 and 2), whereas a GST fusion with a mutated version of the Rev NES (M10), known to be inactive in nuclear export (14Elfgang C. Rosorius O. Hofer L. Jaksche H. Hauber J. Bevec D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6229-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was not exported (panels 3 and 4), validating the injection assay. A GST fusion with the Smad1 NES2 peptide showed complete nuclear export (panels 5 and 6), whereas a GST fusion with the mutant NES2 was mostly retained within the nucleus (panels 7 and 8), demonstrating the export activity of NES2. Notably, in our system, over 85% of cells injected with GST-Rev NES displayed nuclear export, compared with 57% of cells injected with GST-Smad1 NES2 (the others showed partial nuclear extrusion, Fig. 3A, inset). This suggests that the Smad1 NES2 may constitute a weaker NES than the Rev NES in this assay system. NES2 Is the Major NES in Smad1—To confirm that the identified NES2 is functional not only in GST fusion proteins but also in the context of intact Smad1 protein in vivo, we transiently expressed several NES-mutated GFP-Smad1 fusions in 293T cells (Fig. 3B). At steady-state, Smad1 is distributed throughout the cells, whereas the Smad1 NES1– is more nuclear than cytoplasmic (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 3). In contrast, the Smad1 NES2– was exclusively nuclear (panel 5) with the extent of nuclear accumulation more pronounced than that of Smad1 NES1– (compare panel 5 with panel 3). More importantly, whereas CRM1 co-expression relocalized both WT Smad1 and the Smad1 NES1– to the cytoplasm, the nuclear profile of Smad1 NES2– was mostly unperturbed by the co-expression of CRM1 (compare panel 6 with panels 2 and 4). Quantitative analysis of the CRM1 overexpression results indicates that in cells expressing WT Smad1, 96% showed cytoplasmic distribution; and in cells expressing the Smad1 NES1–, 86% displayed cytoplasmic localization. In contrast, among the cells expressing the Smad1 NES2–, only 17% showed a predominantly cytoplasm profile (Fig. 3C), indicating that NES2 is the major NES in Smad1. Interestingly, when only the first pair of hydrophobic residues (134VL) in NES2 were mutated to alanines (130VESPVLPPVLV → VESPAAPPVLV: Smad1 NES2/134VL → AA), or only the second pair of hydrophobic residues (138VL) were mutated to alanines (130VESPVLPPVLV → VESPVLPPAAV: Smad1 NES2/138-VL → AA), Smad1 also became mostly nuclear (Fig. 3B, panels 7 and 9). However, compared with Smad1 NES2–, these partial mutants showed increased CRM1 sensitivity (Fig. 3, B, panels 8 and 10, and C), suggesting that changing only one pair of VL residues results in incomplete destruction of NES2 export functions. The expression levels of the Smad1 NES1– and NES2– were similar to that of WT Smad1, and CRM1 co-expression did not significantly influence these levels (Fig. 3B, inset, upper panel). The expression levels of the partial NES2 mutants (Smad1 NES2/134VL → AA and NES2/138VL → AA) were also analyzed and found to be similar to that of WT Smad1 (data not shown). Additionally, the CRM1 immunoblot revealed low levels of CRM1 in cells transfected with Smad1 alone, representing the endogenous CRM1 protein. It also showed enhanced CRM1 levels in cells co-transfected with CRM1 (Fig. 3B, inset, lower panel). The Nuclear Localization of Smad1 NES2 – Can Be Reversed by Addition of an Exogenous NES—Smad1 NES2– accumulates in the nucleus, which may be caused either by disruption of its nuclear export or by newly acquired interactions with nuclear resident proteins. If the nuclear enrichment of Smad1 NES2– is caused by disruption of an existing NES in Smad1, its nuclear localization could be reversed by the addition of an exogenous NES. However, if it is because of nuclear retention, addition of a new NES is unlikely to reverse the observed nuclear accumulation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we fused the previously characterized Smad4 NES sequence, “GIDLSGLTLQ” (critical leucine or leucine-like residues underlined, Refs. 3Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Repts. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and 9Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), to the N terminus of Smad1 NES2– and investigated its distribution profile (Fig. 3D). The N-terminal fusion was chosen because C-terminal fusion may block the ligand-induced phosphorylation of Smad1 C-terminal serine residues and render it functionally inactive (16Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In contrast to its original nuclear profile, fusion of the Smad4 NES to Smad1 NES2– resulted in the redistribution of the protein to the cytoplasm (panel 2). Addition of leptomycin B, a drug that specifically inactivates Crm1, results in the nuclear accumulation of the protein (panel 3), indicating that the cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein is because of active nuclear export. This proves that the nuclear enrichment of Smad1 NES2– is because of the disruption of a pre-existing NES. It also implies that Smad4 NES is stronger than the Smad1 NES2, because WT Smad1 is distributed throughout the cells while Smad4 NES fusion to Smad1 NES2– is mostly nuclear-excluded. To ascertain that the constitutive nuclear accumulation of Smad1 NES2– is not complicated by transient overexpression, we expressed it in a stable Mv1LU cell line so that the GFP-Smad1 expression level would be more similar to that of the endogenous Smad1 (about 3-fold overexpression) (Fig. 3E). Consistent with Fig. 3B, the WT GFP-Smad1 fusion appears throughout the cells, whereas GFP-Smad1 NES2– was mostly nuclear. Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of the Smad1 MH1 Domain Further Confirms the Functionality of NES2—Although NES2 is located in the C-terminal region of the Smad1 MH1 domain, the isolated Smad1 MH1 domain is predominantly nuclear at steady-state because of the existence of an N-terminal basic NLS (43KKLKKKK, Ref. 10Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Smad1 MH1 domain may actively shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm driven by the NLS and NES2 signals in a ligand-independent manner. To confirm this, we employed a heterokaryon shuttling assay (17Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-Smad1 MH1 domain, which is exclusively nuclear, and then fused with untransfected mouse 3T3 cells (Fig. 4). Nuclei of 3T3 cells can be easily distinguished from the HeLa cell nuclei by their stippled appearance after Hoescht staining. If Smad1 MH1 does shuttle, the GFP signal will be found in both HeLa and 3T3 nuclei. If Smad1 MH1 domain is not subject to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, the GFP signal will be restricted to HeLa cell nuclei and absent from 3T3 cell nuclei. In fact, the GFP-Smad1 MH1 domain was also found in the 3T3 cell nuclei, indicating that the Smad1 MH1 domain can exit the original HeLa cell nuclei and then enter the 3T3 cell nuclei, thus establishing its shuttling ability (Fig. 4, panels 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9). To ascertain if NES2 mediates the nuclear export of the Smad1 MH1 domain during the shuttling, we mutated NES2 in the Smad1 MH1 domain in the same way as we mutated NES2 in full-length Smad1 (Fig. 3). Strikingly, this mutation eliminated the translocation of Smad1 MH1 domain into the 3T3 cell nuclei (panels a–c), confirming that NES2 is responsible for the nuclear export of the Smad1 MH1 domain. Quantitative analysis of over 70 GFP-positive HeLa-3T3 fusion cells showed that in 74% of the cases, Smad1 MH1 NES2– was confined to the HeLa cell nuclei and only 26% of cells displayed limited translocation into the 3T3 nuclei. In comparison, among the HeLa-3T3 fusion cells expressing WT Smad1 MH1, less than 5% showed exclusive HeLa nuclei staining, whereas 95% of the cells showed signal in both HeLa and 3T3 nuclei (data not shown). Because full-length Smad1 NES2– is mostly nuclear under steady-state conditions, we also tested its shuttling ability (panels d–f). Not surprisingly, Smad1 NES2– fails to shuttle from the HeLa cell nuclei into 3T3 cell nuclei, again corroborating the importance of NES2 in Smad1 nuclear export. Because WT Smad1 is not predominantly nuclear, we were not able to test its shuttling ability with this assay. NES2 Is Required for Smad1 Transcriptional Activity in Response to BMP Stimulation—Next we tested the transcriptional activity of the Smad1 NES2– to assess the role NES2 plays in Smad1 signaling. We transfected Mv1Lu cells or C2C12 cells with WT Smad1 or its various NES mutant constructs and the Smad1/Smad5-specific 15xGCCG-luciferase reporter (11Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K.

Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), together or not with the constitutively active BMP type IA receptor (ALK3 Q204D) to mimic the presence or absence of BMP stimulation (Fig. 5).

We showed previously that phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is increased in conditions favoring mitochondrial development and during growth in the absence of inositol. Interestingly, the regulatory effects of inositol were not altered in ino2, ino4, or opi1 mutants suggesting that regulation in response to inositol is not at the level of gene transcription. We report here that steady state mRNA levels of the PGS1 gene, which encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, were not altered by inositol or choline. Growth in the presence of the inositol-depleting drug valproate led to an increase in phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase activity unaccompanied by increased PGS1 mRNA. PGS1 mRNA abundance was not decreased in ino2 or ino4 mutants and was unaffected in an opi1 mutant. Therefore, regulation of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase by inositol is not mediated at the level of mRNA abundance and does not require the INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory circuit. PGS1 was increased in glycerol/ethanol compared with glucose media and was maximally expressed as cells entered the stationary phase. Deletion of the mitochondrial genome did not affect PGS1 expression. Thus, whereas inositol controls phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase activity, regulation of PGS1 expression occurs primarily in response to mitochondrial development cues.

Phospholipid biosynthetic pathways have been extensively characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phospholipid synthesis proceeds via a three-branched pathway from the central intermediate CDP-DAG.

Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The central feature of this regulation is repression by inositol and choline. A consensus sequence inositol choline-responsive element, also termed UAS INO , was found in the promoter regions of genes coordinately regulated by inositol. In the absence of inositol, heterodimers of the positive transcriptional regulators Ino2p and Ino4p bind to the UAS INO to activate transcription. In the presence of inositol, the OPI1 gene product acts to repress transcription. Transcriptional control of UAS INO -containing genes is uniquely affected by the growth phase. Expression is maximal during logarithmic growth and is reduced as cells enter the stationary phase (11Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Repression of these genes in the stationary phase may be correlated with the repression mechanism involving the two major phospholipid precursors, inositol and choline, because both mechanisms of regulation share two common characteristics (12Griac P. Henry S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2043-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). First, they require a functional UAS INO sequence in the promoter region of targeted genes, which may serve as the cis-element for the activation of transcription. Second, ongoing PC synthesis is essential for the repression of gene expression. The biosynthesis of CL is conserved in all eukaryotic organisms. It occurs via three enzymatic reactions (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 237-288Crossref Scopus (665) Google Scholar). PGPS catalyzes the committed step of CL synthesis, formation of PGP from CDP-DAG and glycerol-3-P. PGP phosphatase dephosphorylates PGP to PG. CL synthase catalyzes the final step of CL synthesis, condensation of CDP-DAG and PG to form CL. In contrast to the phosphatidylinositol and PC branches, biosynthesis of CL occurs solely in the mitochondria. Therefore, regulation of CL synthesis may be expected to respond not only to cross-pathway control by inositol and choline but also to cues affecting mitochondrial development. Like many enzymes in the phosphatidylinositol and PC branches, PGPS, the committed enzyme of CL synthesis, is subject to coordinate control by the phospholipid precursors inositol and choline (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of regulation at the level of gene expression has not been elucidated. Previous studies suggested that regulation of the CL pathway by inositol occurs via a mechanism that differs from that of the PC and inositol biosynthetic pathways. Activity of the first pathway enzyme, PGPS, is reduced ∼70% when cells are grown in the presence of exogenous inositol in S. cerevisiae. However, enzyme activity is not affected in ino2, ino4, or opi1 mutants, suggesting that control by inositol is not mediated at the level of PGS1 transcription (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to enzymes encoded by UAS INO -containing genes, PGPS activity increases 2–4-fold in the early stationary phase (14Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the lack of a functional UAS INO sequence in the PGS1 promoter. Nevertheless, in an analysis of PGS1 expression using a plasmid-borne lacZ reporter construct under control of the putative PGS1 promoter, β-galactosidase activity was decreased 2–3-fold during growth in the presence of inositol. This regulation was attributed to a potential UAS INO element 284 bp 5′ to the PGS1 open reading frame (15Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11638-11642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, this element has an UAS INO that has an A in place of a T in the critical third position, which was shown to be functionally inactive (16Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is likely that the reporter construct on a multicopy plasmid does not accurately reflect PGS1 regulation as it occurs in the genome. Regulation of the CL biosynthetic pathway by inositol has been observed in higher eukaryotic organisms as well as yeast. Addition of inositol to lung microsomes inhibited PG synthesis up to 94% (17Hallman M. Epstein B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and PG levels increased more than 10-fold during inositol starvation in two independently isolated inositol-auxotroph Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (18Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jackowski S. Voelker D.R. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16830-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate such regulation remain elusive.

To determine how PGS1 expression is regulated we measured PGS1 mRNA abundance directly. Our studies revealed that regulation of PGPS activity by inositol is not mediated at the level of mRNA abundance, and it does not require the INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory circuit. Rather, transcriptional regulation of PGS1 occurs primarily by derepression during the stationary growth phase when mitochondrial development is increased. All chemicals used were reagent grade or better. [α-32P]UTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. CDP-DAG was obtained from Life Science Resources, and l-[2-3H]glycerol 3-phosphate (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals.

Dieckmann Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction—A 1143-bp PGS1 coding sequence was amplified from yeast chromosomal DNA using PGS1 5′ (5′-ACGACTCGTTTGCTCCAACT-3′) and PGS1 3′ (5′-TACGCCTCTTTGCCATTCTCT-3′). The PCR reaction products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pGEM-PGS1, was linearized with ClaI for the synthesis of the PGS1 riboprobe. Disruption of PGS1—The S. cerevisiae PGS1 gene was replaced by TRP1 using a one-step gene replacement strategy in which 1220 bp from the center of the open reading frame beginning 263 bp after the start codon was replaced with 862 bp of the TRP1 gene. Transformants of diploid cells were selected on Trp– drop out synthetic medium. Dissection of tetrads produced haploid strains that contain only one copy of the disrupted PGS1 gene. Disruption of PGS1 was confirmed by PCR using primers against the TRP1 sequence (Trp5′, 5′-CGCAAACTTTCACCAATGGA-3′) and the sequence 3′ to the PGS1 coding sequence (PGS23193′, 5′-AGGGCATTTCCATTACTTCCA-3′). Isolation of rho0 Mutants—Isolation of ethidium bromide-induced rho0 mutants was performed as described previously (25Goldring E.S. Grossman L.I. Krupnick D. Cryer D.R. Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to saturation in synthetic minimal medium with 2% glucose and 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide (filter-sterilized). A second culture was inoculated from the first in the same medium and grown to saturation. Single colonies were streaked on YPD. Essentially all single colonies were rho0 mutants. The resulting strains were crossed with a series of rho– tester strains 104, 105, 106, and 107. Failure to complement any of the tester strains confirmed the loss of mitochondrial genome. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—Yeast strains were grown to the early stationary growth phase in synthetic medium with 2% sucrose. Total RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) and treated with DNase to avoid DNA contamination. RT-PCR was performed using the RT-PCR Access System from Promega. PGS1 mRNA was amplified using primers RTpgs15′ (5′-AAGCGAGACTGAGTTGGTGG-3′) and RTpgs13′ (5′-ATGAGACGCCCTTTGATTGG-3′). The internal control ACT1 was amplified using primers RTact15′ (5′-TGAGGTTGCTGGTTTGGTTA-3′) and RTact13′ (5′-TTGTGGTGAACGATAGATGGA-3′). Standard reactions used 30 cycles, 50 pmol of each primer, and 100 ng/μl RNA in 50 μl. RT-PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis. The intensity of DNA products was analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software. The products of PGS1 from each RNA preparation were normalized to ACT1. Northern Analysis—Cells were grown in minimal synthetic medium with either glucose or glycerol/ethanol as a carbon source. Inositol, choline, or valproate was added when indicated. Cells were harvested at the indicated times; RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) and fractionated on an agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled PGS1 and INO1 riboprobes followed by a riboprobe for the constitutively expressed ribosomal protein gene TCM1 to normalize for loading variation. RNA probes for Northern analysis were synthesized using the Promega Riboprobe System and from plasmids linearized with restriction enzymes as follows (plasmid, restriction enzyme, RNA polymerase, respectively): pGEM-PGS1, ClaI, T7 (PGS1); pJH310, HindIII, T7 (INO1) (27Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); pAB309, EcoRI, SP6 (TCM1) (27Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); pPLG, BamHI (ACT1) (28Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results were quantitated by phosphorimaging. Preparation of Mitochondrial Extracts—Mitochondrial extracts were prepared as described previously (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed once with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm sucrose, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer 1). Pellets were resuspended in Buffer 1 to a concentration of 1 g/ml (wet weight), and cells were broken by vortexing with glass beads for five 1-min intervals, with cooling of the cells on ice between intervals. Extracts were centrifuged in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatants were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The mitochondrial pellets were washed twice with Buffer 1, suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% glucose, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer 2) to a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml (wet weight), and stored at –80 °C. Analysis of Protein Concentration and PGPS Enzyme Activity—Mitochondrial extracts were assayed for protein concentration by the method of Bradford with a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as the standard. PGPS activity was assayed at 30 °C by quantitating the incorporation of 0.5 mm [2-3H]glycerol 3-phosphate (4,000 cpm/nmol) into chloroform-soluble material as described previously (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm MES HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm CDP-DAG, 1 mm Triton X-100, and mitochondrial extract corresponding to 100 μg of protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min immediately following the addition of labeled substrate. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl/methanol. Chloroform (1 ml) and 1 m MgCl2 (1.5 ml) were added to each assay tube. The tubes were then vortexed and the phases were separated by brief centrifugation. Aliquots of 0.5 ml of the chloroform layer were transferred into scintillation vials and then dried under a nitrogen stream. Organic counting scintillant (3 ml) was added, and the radioactivity in each sample was determined with an LS-3801 liquid scintillation counter. Triplicate samples were assayed for each point, and a blank tube containing crude extract that was inactivated before the reaction was included as a control for each sample. Specific activities were defined as units/mg of protein, where 1 unit is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of product/min at 30 °C. Identification of PGS1 Transcripts—The PGS1 transcript was identified by comparison of RNA from wild-type and pgs1Δ strains. Total RNA from pgs1Δ and isogenic wild-type strains was isolated and hybridized with a PGS1 riboprobe. A 1.7-kb PGS1 mRNA was observed only in RNA from the wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from the wild-type and pgs1Δ mutant confirmed this result. As seen in Fig. 1B, PGS1 was amplified only from wild-type RNA. PGS1 Expression Peaks in the Early Stationary Phase— Maximum activities of CDP-DAG synthase, PS synthase, and the phospholipid N-methyltransferases were found in the exponential growth phase in cells grown in complete synthetic medium (29Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Gaynor P.M. Ho C.T. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 533-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the structural genes coding for those enzymes showed a similar expression pattern. In contrast, PGPS enzyme activity increased as cells enter the stationary phase (14Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with enzyme activity maximal PGS1 mRNA levels were observed as cells entered the stationary phase (Fig. 2B) in contrast to the UAS INO -containing gene INO1, which was fully derepressed in the logarithmic phase and decreased as cells entered the stationary phase (Fig. 2B). PGS1 mRNA Abundance Is Not Altered by Inositol and Choline—As discussed above, PGPS enzyme activity is decreased in the presence of inositol. To determine whether the effect of inositol is because of transcriptional regulation, the effect of inositol on the steady state level of PGS1 mRNA was examined in cells grown to the early stationary growth phase. PGS1 mRNA abundance was not altered in cells growing in the presence of exogenous inositol or choline (Fig. 3A). In contrast, expression of INO1, which is known to be repressed by inositol, was reduced more than 10-fold (Fig. 3B). (INO1 expression was measured in the logarithmic phase, which is the time of maximal expression of this gene (see Fig. 2).) We showed previously that PGPS activity was decreased within minutes after inositol supplementation (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We looked at PGS1 expression as a function of time after addition of inositol. PGS1 mRNA levels did not decrease after the addition of inositol, as seen in Fig. 4A, although PGPS enzyme activity was significantly decreased within 60 min following supplementation with inositol (Fig. 4C). In contrast, expression of INO1 was fully repressed within 30 min following the addition of inositol (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Decreased PGP synthase activity in the presence of inositol is not accompanied by a decrease in PGS1 expression. Wild-type cells (SH302) were grown to the mid-logarithmic growth phase in synthetic medium lacking inositol. 75 μm inositol was added to half of the flasks at time 0, and cells were harvested at the indicated times. Northern analysis was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Expression of PGS1 (A) and INO1 (B) was normalized by comparison with TCM1. Data showed are representative of two independent experiments. PGPS activity was assayed (C) in mitochondrial extracts of cells harvested at time 0 and 60 min following inositol supplementation. □, no inositol; ▪, 75 μm inositol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Valproate-induced Inositol Depletion on PGS1 Expression—VPA is an 8-carbon branched fatty acid used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. VPA causes a decrease in intracellular inositol mass leading to a dramatic increase in expression of INO1 in S. cerevisiae (30Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Geenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of inositol depletion on PGS1 expression PGS1 mRNA abundance was measured in cells grown in the presence of VPA. As shown in Fig. 5A, VPA did not lead to an increase in PGS1 mRNA levels under conditions that led to more than 10-fold increase in INO1 mRNA (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the rate of synthesis of PG was increased up to 3-fold in the presence of VPA. 2S. Ju and M. L. Greenberg, submitted for publication. Consistent with this observation, cells grown in the presence of VPA exhibited a 2-fold increase in PGPS activity (Fig. 5C). Therefore, inositol depletion by VPA led to an increase in PGPS enzyme activity with no concomitant increase in PGS1 expression. Derepression of PGS1 Expression in the Positive Regulatory Mutants ino2 and ino4 —The INO2 and INO4 gene products are required for the derepression of UAS INO -containing phospholipid biosynthesis genes in the absence of exogenous inositol. A mutation in either INO2 or INO4 significantly reduces the expression of UAS INO -containing genes (10Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ino2 and ino4 mutants require exogenous inositol for growth because these mutants fail to express the INO1 gene product required for de novo inositol synthesis (31Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7077-7085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, wild-type levels of PGPS activity were found in ino2 and ino4 mutants suggesting that INO2 and INO4 are not required for derepression of PGPS (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, PGS1 expression was characterized in ino2 and ino4 mutants. PGS1 expression was observed at derepressed levels in both mutants in all conditions (Fig. 6A) in contrast to the INO1 gene, which was barely detectable in these mutants (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, PGS1 expression was increased 2–3-fold in the ino4 mutant, which suggests a possible negative regulatory role of the INO4 gene product in transcription of PGS1. The Steady State Level of PGS1 mRNA Is Not Altered in the opi1 Mutant—Disruption of the negative regulatory gene OPI1 results in constitutive overexpression of UAS INO -containing genes (10Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The opi1 mutant excretes inositol (32Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because of overexpression of the INO1 gene even in inositol-free medium. PGPS activity, however, was reduced in the opi1 mutant (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggesting that OPI1 does not cause repression of PGS1 expression. PGS1 mRNA abundance was measured in the opi1 mutant. As seen in Fig. 7A, wild-type levels of PGS1 were observed in the opi1 mutant in the absence of inositol. In contrast, INO1 levels were more than 20-fold higher in the opi1 mutant than in the wild type in inositol-free medium (Fig. 7B). These findings and those in Fig. 6 demonstrate that transcriptional control of PGS1 is not mediated by the INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory circuit. Effect of Mitochondrial Development on PGS1 mRNA Abundance—PGPS activity is regulated by factors affecting mitochondrial development, such as growth phase, carbon source, and mitochondrial genome (14Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only 30–70% of wild-type levels of PGPS activity are present in mutants lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho0 mutants) compared with isogenic rho+ strains. To determine whether decreased PGPS activity in rho0 mutants can be explained by decreased PGS1 mRNA, mRNA abundance was compared in rho0 and rho+ cells that were isogenic with respect to nuclear DNA. In synthetic glucose medium, PGS1 mRNA was fully derepressed in the rho0 mutant (Fig. 8B). Therefore, the decrease in PGPS activity in the rho0 mutant is not because of decreased PGS1 expression. PGPS activity is increased 2–3-fold in non-fermentable versus fermentable medium (14Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGS1 mRNA levels were measured in wild-type cells grown in the presence of glucose or glycerol/ethanol as the sole carbon source (Fig. 9B). In the mid-logarithmic growth phase, PGS1 mRNA levels were about 2-fold higher in glycerol/ethanol. However, glucose-grown cells exhibited an increase in PGS1 as cells entered the stationary phase, at which point PGS1 mRNA abundance was higher in glucose than in glycerol/ethanol. In this report, we used Northern analysis to look directly at the mRNA abundance of the PGS1 gene in response to regulatory stimuli and concluded the following points. Regulation of PGPS activity by inositol does not occur at the level of mRNA abundance and is not mediated by the INO2-INO4-OPI1 genetic regulatory circuit. Therefore, cross-pathway control of general and mitochondria-specific phospholipid pathways occurs by different regulatory mechanisms. In glucose, PGS1 expression increases during the stationary growth phase. In the logarithmic phase, the increase in PGPS in glycerol/ethanol versus glucose is accompanied by an increase in PGS1 mRNA. However, the decrease in PGPS activity in the absence of a mitochondrial genome is not accompanied by a decrease in PGS1 mRNA. Therefore, PGS1 expression is controlled by the mitochondrial development factors including growth phase and carbon source. Loss of mitochondrial genome, which does lead to decreased PGPS activity, is unaccompanied by altered PGS1 expression. Our finding that regulation of PGPS by inositol is not via transcriptional control of PGS1 by INO2-INO4-OPI1 is consistent with the results of a previous study in which PGPS enzyme activity was measured in response to inositol supplementation (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Specifically, that PGS1 expression is fully derepressed in ino2 and ino4 null mutants (Fig. 6) is in accord with the finding that PGPS enzyme activity was not altered in these mutants. Similarly, mutation in the OPI1 gene did not lead to increased activity of PGPS (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) nor did it affect regulation of PGS1 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, inositol depletion induced by the drug VPA stimulated synthesis of PG without an accompanying increase in PGS1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 5). These results are also predicted by the lack of a functional UAS INO element in the promoter region of PGS1 (16Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, the increased expression of PGS1 in the stationary phase (Fig. 2) differs from the characteristic increase in expression of UAS INO -containing genes during the logarithmic phase of growth. Our findings are not in agreement with results obtained from a study in which PGS1 promoter sequences fused to a reporter construct on an exogenous plasmid appeared to be regulated by inositol (15Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11638-11642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In that study, activity of the reporter gene was correlated with expression of native PGS1 mRNA even though it is clear that promoter-driven reporter constructs do not necessarily reflect the regulatory control of a gene in its natural chromosomal context (33Miller L.L. Lopes J.M. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Regulatory sequences may not be present in the construct, and the effects of histone modification and chromatin structure are not necessarily observed with an extrachromosomal reporter. Therefore, it is unlikely that the reporter construct reflected regulation of native PGS1. PGPS activity responds to mitochondrial development factors such as loss of the mitochondrial genome, carbon source, and growth phase. Loss of the mitochondrial genome did not affect PGS1 expression (Fig. 8), whereas carbon source and growth phase did (Figs. 2 and 9). In this regard, regulation of PGS1 is in concert with expression of the CRD1 gene encoding CL synthase, expression of which increases 7–10-fold in the early stationary phase (34Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, in contrast to the other phospholipids, synthesis of the mitochondrial lipid CL increases during the stationary phase during growth in glucose, a time in which mitochondrial development increases to respond to the switch from fermentative to respiratory growth. In fact, the relative CL composition doubles as cells enter the stationary phase (35Jakovcic S.G. Getz S. Rabinowitz M. Jacob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 40: 490-502Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Gallet P.F. Petit J.M. Maftah A. Zachowski A. Julien R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CL may play an important role in cell survival during the stationary growth phase, as both pgs1 and crd1 null mutants lose viability during prolonged liquid culture at elevated temperature (19Jackowski S. Voelker D.R. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16830-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3Q. Zhong and M. L. Greenberg, unpublished data. How PGPS activity is regulated by factors that do not effect PGS1 expression is not known. PGPS activity drops within 20 min following addition of exogenous inositol to the growth medium (13Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The rapidity of this response could be attributed to degradation or inactivation of the protein in the presence of inositol. In a cardiac cell line, stimulation of PGPS activity by n-acetylsphingosine is attenuated when cells are exposed to phosphatase inhibitors. In addition, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP(CPT-cAMP), a non-hydrolyzable cAMP analogue that activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase, stimulates PGPS activity (37Xu F.Y. Kelley S.L. Hatch G.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that phosphorylation may be involved in the regulation of mammalian PGPS. At least one enzyme in general phospholipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae, PS synthase, is regulated by phosphorylation. This enzyme, which catalyzes the committed step of PC synthesis, is inactivated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation (38Kinney A.J. Carman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7962-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PGPS in S. cerevisiae has not been studied. Experiments to characterize the mechanism underlying PGPS regulation in response to inositol are in progress. In addition to the regulation of enzyme activity, decreased synthesis of PG by inositol may also be because of a shift in the pool of CDP-DAG in response to inositol. When yeast cells are grown in the presence of exogenous inositol, the partitioning of CDP-DAG shifts toward the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol at the expense of PS (39Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like PS, the rate of synthesis of PG and CL in S. cerevisiae is significantly decreased in the presence of inositol. 4D. Vaden, personal communication. In summary, although both the mitochondrial and general phospholipid pathways are subject to cross-pathway control by inositol and choline, we have shown here that regulation of the mitochondrial pathway does not involve the same genetic regulatory circuit as the general pathway enzymes. Whereas PGPS activity is decreased in the presence of inositol, regulation of PGS1 expression occurs primarily in response to mitochondrial development cues. We thank John M. Lopes, Deirdre Vaden, Daobin Ding, Zhiming Gu, Shulin Ju, and Vishal Gohil for valuable discussion and advice.

A ubiquitous Ca2+ influx pathway that contributes significantly to the generation of Ca2+ i signals, especially in non-excitable cells, is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Consequently, the modulation of SOCE current affects Ca2+ i dynamics and thus the ensuing cellular response. Therefore, it is important to define the mechanisms that regulate SOCE. Here we show that a rise in Ca2+ i potentiates SOCE. This potentiation is mediated by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), because inhibition of endogenous CaMKII activity abrogates Ca2+ i -mediated SOCE potentiation and expression of constitutively active CaMKII potentiates SOCE current independently of Ca2+ i. Moreover, we present evidence that CaMKII potentiates SOCE by altering SOCE channel gating.

This is possible because of the specificity encoded in the spatial, temporal, and amplitude features of Ca2+ signals, which are generated because of either Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. The interplay between these two Ca2+ sources results in specific Ca2+ i dynamics, which lead to a particular cellular response. A ubiquitous Ca2+ influx pathway activated downstream of phospholipase-coupled receptors is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). SOCE is important for various cellular functions including store refilling (2Parekh A.B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Stühmer W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 653-671Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), regulation of exocytosis (3Fomina A.F. Nowycky M.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3711-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sperm capacitation (4O'Toole C.M. Arnoult C. Darszon A. Steinhardt R.A. Florman H.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and T-cell activation (5Serafini A. Lewis R.S. Clipstone N.A. Bram R. Fanger C. Fiering S. Herzenberg L.A. Crabtree G.R. Immunity. 1995; 3: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Fanger C. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because SOCE contributes significantly to the generation of Ca2+ i dynamics, it is important in specifying the ensuing cellular response. SOCE is defined as Ca2+ influx activated in response to intracellular Ca2+ store depletion. Although, store depletion is the primary required signal for SOCE activation, additional distinct mechanisms modulate SOCE activity (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Characterizing such SOCE modulators is crucial to understanding the mechanisms by which SOCE contributes to defining specific cellular responses. In this paper, we show that both Ca2+i and Ca2+ -calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) positively modulate SOCE current (ISOC). Both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ have been shown to modulate SOCE activity in a complex fashion. This is best characterized for the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) (7Lewis R.S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is the first described SOCE current. Hallmarks of ICRAC include inward rectification, an ionic selectivity sequence of Ca2+ > Ba2+ > Mn2+ ≫ Na+, and a small unitary Ca2+ conductance estimated to be ∼20 femtoSiemens (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 9Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ has been shown to negatively regulate ISOC by two mechanisms. 1) Fast Ca2+-dependent inactivation is due to inhibition of ISOC, arguably following Ca2+ binding to an intracellular site (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 10Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (660) Google Scholar). 2) Slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation is due in part to store refilling but also has a store-independent component that is poorly understood (11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+ o) potentiates ISOC through a process termed Ca2+-dependent potentiation (CDP). CDP is attributed to a positive effect of extracellular Ca2+ on ISOC (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Christian E.P. Spence K.T. Togo J.A. Dargis P.G. Patel J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and probably results from Ca2+ binding to an extracellular site on the channel because it can be replicated by Ni2+ (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ni2+ does not permeate SOCE channels but potentiates the Ca2+ current through SOCE channels (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CDP alters channel gating and not permeation (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), because current inactivation (which is dependent on permeation (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar)) remains unchanged during CDP. In this paper, we describe a novel positive regulation of ISOC by intracellular Ca2+ through CaMKII in Xenopus oocytes. Xenopus oocyte SOCE current has similar characteristics to I crac including high Ca2+ selectivity, inward rectification (14Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and as shown here extracellular Ca2+-dependent potentiation. Allowing a Ca2+ i rise during SOCE activation results in larger ISOC. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active CaMKII (CaMKIIca) also leads to enhancement of ISOC. CaMKII potentiates ISOC by dramatically increasing the levels of CDP. Because CDP affects SOCE channel gating, our data argue that CaMKII potentiates SOCE by altering gating. CaMKII-mediated potentiation of ISOC has important physiological consequences because store depletion is physiologically accompanied by a rise in Ca2+ i. Because CaMKII is able to decode Ca2+ i dynamics into different levels of enzyme activity (15De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), CaMKII-mediated potentiation of ISOC provides a mechanism for Ca2+ to regulate its own entry into the cell depending on the levels and kinetics of Ca2+ release following receptor activation. Oocyte and Electrophysiological Methods—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared as described previously (16Machaca K. Haun S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). SOCE was activated by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with either ionomycin (10 μm) or thapsigargin (1 μm for ≥3 h unless otherwise indicated). Oocytes were injected with 7 nmol of BAPTA to buffer the Ca2+ i rise and block the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– current (ICl,Ca) that would otherwise mask the SOCE current. Assuming an oocyte volume of 1 μl, this would result in a final concentration of ∼7 mm BAPTA that completely blocks ICl,Ca. Oocytes were voltage-clamped with two microelectrodes by the use of a GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–2 megaohms. Voltage stimulation and data acquisition were controlled using a pClamp8 (Axon Instruments). Current data were filtered at 10 kHz, digitized, and analyzed using Clampfit9.0 (Axon Instruments) and Origin® software (Microcal Software Inc.). ISOC was typically measured in 30 Ca2+ solution (in mm: 55 NaCl, 30 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4), and Ca2+-free solution in ISOC-recording experiments was 70 Mg2+ (in mm: 70 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4). ISOC time course is plotted as the mean current 30–35 ms after the voltage step, and the leak current at the beginning of the experiment was subtracted. Ca2+-activated Cl– currents were recorded in Ringer solution (in mm: 123 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 18 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4) or Ca2+-free Ringer solution that had the same composition as Ringer solution with the exception that CaCl2 was omitted, MgCl2 increased to 5 mm, and 0.1 mm EGTA was added. cRNA for injection into oocytes was transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine SP6 transcription kit (Ambion). Both pGEM3–5HT1c and pSP-CaMKII(T286D) were linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with SP6 polymerase. Ca2 + Imaging—Xenopus oocytes were injected with ∼7.6 μm Ca2+-Green-1 coupled to 70 kDa of dextran and voltage-clamped as described above. The dye was allowed at least 30 min to equilibrate within the oocyte. Imaging experiments were performed in Ringer and Ca2+-free Ringer solutions. Confocal Ca2+ imaging was performed using an Olympus Fluoview confocal scanning system fitted to IX70 microscope using a ×10 (0.3 numerical aperture) objective. Images (256 × 256 pixels) were collected and analyzed using Olympus Fluoview software. CaMKII Assay—CaMKII kinase activity was measured by lysing oocytes (20 μl/oocyte) in CaMKII extraction buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2,1mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at –70 °C until use in the kinase assay. The CaMKII kinase was performed using the SignaTECT™ kinase kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Intracellular Ca2 + Potentiates SOCE—Physiological activation of SOCE is invariably preceded by a rise in Ca2+ i because of Ca2+ release from stores. Although it is clear that Ca2+ i is not required for SOCE activation, it is not known whether this Ca2+ i modulates ISOC. To address this issue, we activated SOCE under conditions that either allow an intracellular Ca2+ rise or not. To activate SOCE in the absence of a Ca2+ i rise, we injected cells with BAPTA and then depleted Ca2+ stores with ionomycin (BAPTA-Ion). This results in the activation of a characteristic SOCE current as previously described (Fig. 1B, filled squares) (14Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Machaca K. Haun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38710-38715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To allow a Ca2+ i rise during SOCE activation, Ca2+ stores were depleted with ionomycin followed by repetitive hyperpolarization to induce Ca2+ influx (Ion-BAPTA). The cell was then injected with BAPTA, and ISOC was recorded (Fig. 1B, open circles). Treating cells according to the Ion-BAPTA protocol resulted in a significant (p = 1.6 × 10–7) potentiation of ISOC levels compared with control oocyte (BAPTA-Ion) (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, allowing a Ca2+ i rise during SOCE activation leads to current potentiation. The Ca2+-mediated potentiation of SOCE described above was obtained under conditions designed to maximize Ca2+ i rise by hyperpolarization-induced Ca2+ influx. To determine whether such Ca2+ influx is required for ISOC potentiation, a similar experiment was performed without hyperpolarization using the ion-BAPTA protocol, that is Ca2+ stores were simply depleted in the absence of BAPTA injection. In this case, ISOC was also potentiated (Fig. 1D), showing that hyperpolarization per se is not required for the observed Ca2+ i -mediated ISOC potentiation. As discussed above, SOCE has been shown to be potentiated by extracellular Ca2+, which affects SOCE channel gating in a process referred to as CDP (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To avoid confusion with CDP, we will refer to the intracellular Ca2+ effect on ISOC as Ca2+i-mediated potentiation (CMP). CMP provides a fitting feedback mechanism between Ca2+ release and SOCE. This is especially relevant because as shown by Parekh et al. (18Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), SOCE activation is an all or nothing process (18Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). That is even partial depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores results in full activation of ISOC. To determine the relationship between store Ca2+ load and ISOC magnitude in Xenopus oocytes, SOCE was measured by Ca2+ imaging in voltage-clamped cells, which allows simultaneous recording of Ca2+ i and SOCE in the same cell (Fig. 2) (19Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membrane potential was stepped repetitively to +40 mV (where Ca2+ influx is minimal) and –140 mV (to induce Ca2+ influx through SOCE). Under these conditions, the difference in Ca2+ fluorescence at –140 and +40 mV (Fig. 2, open triangles) provides a reliable measure of SOCE and correlates well with ISOC (19Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To induce partial store depletion, cells were treated with thapsigargin (1 μm) for 1 h (complete store depletion requires ≥3 h), which results in SOCE activation as indicated by the increased fluorescence at –40 V (Fig. 2, open circles). Injection of IP3 leads to further Ca2+ release (Fig. 2, squares & circles), confirming that thapsigargin induced partial store depletion. However, the additional store depletion following IP3 injection does not augment SOCE (Fig. 2, open triangles), indicating that SOCE magnitude does not correlate well with the extent of store depletion. This shows that increased store depletion, at least in the range tested, does not translate into a larger SOCE, arguing that SOCE is modulated by other signaling pathways after store depletion. Fig. 1 shows that one such modulatory pathway is the Ca2+ i levels during SOCE activation. Correlation between Receptor-induced Ca2 + Mobilization and SOCE—To assess the physiological relevance of CMP, we sought to determine whether it could be observed following IP3-linked receptor stimulation. We were interested in inducing different levels of Ca2+ i rise while minimizing experimental manipulation of Ca2+ i (such as BAPTA injection or ionomycin treatment). Our approach was to express the G-protein-coupled serotonin receptor (5HT1c) and monitor changes in the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– currents as markers of Ca2+ i (19Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 5HT1c stimulation with serotonin (5HT) results in IP3 production through phospholipase-β activation (20Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Ca2+-activated Cl– currents (ICl1 and ICl1T) faithfully report Ca2+ i changes below the plasma membrane in terms of amplitude and kinetics (19Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ICl1 activates in response to Ca2+ release from internal stores, whereas ICl1T responds to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. During Ca2+ release, ICl1 activates as a sustained outward current upon depolarization (+40 mV, Fig. 3A, upper trace). Ca2+ release results in store depletion and SOCE activation. Ca2+ flowing through SOCE channels activates ICl1T as a transient current, only when the depolarization pulse is preceded by a hyperpolarization step, which induces Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3A, lower trace). ICl1T is transient because the Ca2+ that enters through SOCE channels during the –140-mV pulse dissipates rapidly during the subsequent 40-mV pulse, leading to ICl1T current decay (Fig, 3A, lower trace) (19Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (for a more detailed description of the relationship between Ca2+ signals and Ca2+-activated Cl– currents, see Refs. 19Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, and 22Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, monitoring ICl1 and ICl1T allows the real-time determination of Ca2+ i (ICl1) and SOCE (ICl1T) levels following 5HT1c activation. To generate graded Ca2+ release responses and determine the effect on SOCE, we injected cells with different amounts of 5HT1c cRNA (10 or 30 ng) and allowed them to express for 2 days. Cells were then stimulated with 5HT (10 μm) (Fig. 3, B and C), leading to Ca2+ release, which activates ICl1 (Fig. 3, B and C, squares) followed by ICl1T due to SOCE activation (Fig. 3, B and C, circles). ICl1T activates to a certain threshold and gradually returns to base line as a result of Ca2+ store refilling and SOCE inactivation (Fig. 3, B and C, circles). Cells injected with 10 ng of 5HT1c cRNA produced a smaller ICl1 (Fig. 3B) than those injected with 30 ng of the receptor (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, ICl1T activated to a lower threshold and inactivated more rapidly in cells injected with 10 ng of 5HT1c receptor cRNA (Fig. 3, compare B with C, circles). The responses of the Cl– currents summarized in Fig. 3D show that both Ca2+ i (as indicated by ICl1) and SOCE (as indicated by ICl1T) were significantly enhanced at high 5HT1c (30 ng) expression. Therefore, enhanced Ca2+ release correlates with larger SOCE. A simple explanation for these data is that receptor stimulation in cells expressing high levels of 5HT1c leads to a more dramatic Ca2+ store depletion and larger SOCE. However, as shown in Fig. 2, the extent of Ca2+ store depletion does not linearly correlate with SOCE magnitude. Therefore, SOCE potentiation as reported by ICl1T in cells expressing more 5HT1c receptors is probably because of some mechanism other than the extent of store depletion. CMP of ISOC provides such a mechanism. High 5HT1c expression produces increased Ca2+ i as indicated by ICl1, which would be expected to potentiate ISOC (ICl1T) through CMP. Note that store depletion provides a required signal for SOCE activation, but the extent of store depletion per se does not modulate SOCE magnitude. Rather, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 argue that it is the magnitude of the Ca2+ i rise that modulates SOCE through CMP. Clearly the magnitude of Ca2+ i rise can correlate with the extent of store depletion. These data reveal a subtle but important distinction in the mechanism of SOCE modulation and are consistent with the notion that CMP is a physiologically relevant modulator of SOCE. The positive correlation between Ca2+ i and SOCE described above is not limited to Xenopus oocytes. Gailly et al. (23Gailly P.H. Hermans E. Gillis J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 635-646Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) described a similar relationship in Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Gailly P.H. Hermans E. Gillis J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 635-646Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), arguing that CMP is a widespread mechanism of SOCE regulation. CaMKII Potentiates SOCE—Ca2+ i -mediated potentiation of ISOC could be either direct or indirect through the activation of Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors. A direct Ca2+-mediated potentiation of ISOC is unlikely because Ca2+ has been shown to inactivate ISOC, probably through a direct effect on SOCE channels (fast Ca2+-dependent inactivation) (8Zweifach A.

This finding suggests that CMP is the result of activation of Ca2+-dependent effectors, which in turn act on SOCE. A primary candidate for such an effector pathway is the Ca2+-CaM-activated protein kinase pathway. The most widespread Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinase is CaMKII, which is expressed in Xenopus oocytes (24Stevens I. Rondelez E. Merlevede W. Goris J. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). If Ca2+ potentiates ISOC through CaMKII, it is expected that ectopic activation of CaMKII would lead to increased ISOC levels. We used a constitutively active CaMKII mutant (CaMKIIca) to determine whether CaMKII activation potentiates ISOC. The CaMKII holoenzyme is a multisubunit complex that is kept inactive by an autoinhibitory domain. The binding of Ca2+-CaM relieves autoinhibition and stimulates autophosphorylation at Thr-286, rendering the enzyme Ca2+-CaM-independent (25Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). CaMKIIca is a T286D mutation that mimics the effects of autophosphorylation by replacing Thr-286 with Asp, resulting in a Ca2+-CaM-independent and thus constitutively active CaMKII (26Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We injected oocytes with CaMKIIca and measured ISOC (Fig. 4A). Expression of CaMKIIca results in an ∼3-fold increase in ISOC (p = 1.1 × 10–7) (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with CMP acting through CaMKII. In addition, CaMKIIca-mediated ISOC potentiation is expected to be independent of Ca2+ i because CaMKIIca is Ca2+-CaM-independent. This prediction is confirmed in CaMKIIca-expressing cells, as ISOC is potentiated whether store depletion is preceded by a rise in Ca2+ i (Ion-BAPTA) or not (BAPTA-Ion) (Fig. 4C). This finding further suggests that Ca2+-mediated potentiation is primarily through CaMKII activation, because no additive effect on ISOC is observed in CaMKIIca-expressing cells subjected to the Ion-BAPTA protocol (Fig. 4C). To directly confirm CaMKIIca expression, we measured CaMKII-specific activity in lysates from control and CaMKIIca-injected cells. Cells expressing CaMKIIca had higher levels of CaMKII activity (Fig. 4D), showing that CaMKIIca was expressed and functional in these cells. Because specific activity was measured in the absence of Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 4D), CaMKII activity data confirm the Ca2+-CaM independence of CaMKIIca. It is important to note that the expression of CaMKIIca by itself is not sufficient to activate ISOC (Fig. 4A, circles). In CaMKIIca-expressing cells, store depletion is still required to activate SOCE because no ISOC is detected before ionomycin treatment (Fig. 4A, circles). However, ISOC levels reach a significantly larger maximal amplitude in CaMKIIca-expressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, CaMKII is not a component of the SOCE activation pathway induced in response to store depletion but rather positively modulates SOCE activity following SOCE activation. If CMP is acting through CaMKII, CaMKII should be activated in cells where a Ca2+ i rise is induced (Ion-BAPTA). We were unable to detect such an increase in CaMKII activity in oocytes treated according to the Ion-BAPTA protocol. This result argues that either Ca2+ and CaMKII potentiate ISOC by separate mechanisms or that CaMKII activation is transient and/or spatially localized, resulting in small changes in CaMKII activity that are difficult to detect in whole cell lysates. Furthermore, basal CaMKII activity was quite variable in oocytes donated from different females, making it difficult to reliably measure a small increase in CaMKII activity in different batches of cells. However, a Ca2+ i rise has been shown to activate endogenous CaMKII in Xenopus oocytes using an in vivo CaMKII-specific kinase assay (27Matifat F. Fournier F. Lorca T. Capony J.P. Brule G. Collin T. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, if CMP is mediated by CaMKII, blocking endogenous CaMKII should inhibit CMP. Therefore, we blocked endogenous CaMKII and determined the effect on SOCE. Oocytes were injected with AIP, a specific inhibitory peptide of CaMKII that mimics the autoinhibitory domain and blocks CaMKII activity (28Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Allowing a Ca2+ i rise in control oocytes (Ion-BAPTA) potentiates ISOC by ∼2-fold but not in cells injected with the CaMKII inhibitor AIP (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, AIP added to the CaMKII assay blocks kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). These data show that inhibiting endogenous CaMKII activity blocks CMP, supporting the conclusion that Ca2+ i potentiates SOCE through CaMKII activation. Mechanism of CaMKII Action on SOCE—Because SOCE is activated in response to store depletion, CaMKII could potentiate ISOC by targeting either the coupling mechanism between Ca2+ stores and SOCE or the SOCE channel. To differentiate between these possibilities and obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of action of CaMKII, we wanted to study the effects of CaMKII independently of store depletion. This was accomplished by irreversibly depleting Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin before CaMKIIca expression (Fig. 6). Oocytes were incubated in thapsigargin (1 μm) for 3 h to fully deplete Ca2+ store followed by CaMKIIca cRNA injection and incubation in nominally Ca2+-free (50 μm free Ca2+) solution. Control cells were treated with thapsigargin alone. Under these conditions, store depletion is complete before CaMKIIca expression and store Ca2+ load remains low throughout the experiment because thapsigargin irreversibly inhibits the ER Ca2+-ATPase. This allows us to study the effects of CaMKII on ISOC after store depletion and determine whether CaMKII is affecting the coupling mechanism or SOCE channel gating or permeation. In this experiment, SOCE was activated in the absence of the conducting ion (Ca2+) and therefore no SOCE current was observed at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 6A). Switching control (thapsigargin-treated) oocytes to a Ca2+-containing solution produced an initial ISOC that was further enhanced over time, eventually saturating (Max ISOC) within ∼6 min (Fig. 6A, squares). This behavior is the result of classical CDP where extracellular Ca2+ exerts a positive effect on SOCE channel gating (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Christian E.P. Spence K.T. Togo J.A. Dargis P.G. Patel J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CDP can be estimated as the ratio of maximal ISOC/initial ISOC (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and is 3.11 ± 0.23 in thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 6B). Surprisingly, exposing CaMKIIca-expressing cells to Ca2+-containing solution results in an initial ISOC with a similar amplitude to initial ISOC in control cells (Fig. 6A, open circles). However, ISOC in CaMKIIca-expressing cells gradually increased to significantly higher levels than in control cells (Fig. 6A, open circles). This shows that CaMKIIca expression does not affect initial ISOC levels but results in a significantly (p = 1.46 × 10–5) larger maximal ISOC (Fig. 6B). It follows that CDP, calculated as the ratio of maximal/initial ISOC, was also augmented (5.72 ± 0.61) in CaMKIIca-expressing cells (Fig. 6B). Therefore, CaMKII potentiates ISOC by increasing the levels of CDP without affecting initial ISOC levels, even after prolonged expression of CaMKIIca. These data provide important insights into the mechanism of action of CaMKII. The whole cell SOCE current is defined by the following equation: ISOC = NP oi, where N is the number of active channels, P o is the probability of opening, and i is the single channel conductance. Therefore, CaMKII can potentiate ISOC by increasing either N, i, or P o. If CaMKII was affecting the coupling mechanism, an increase in the number of active channels (N) is expected. The fact that CaMKIIca expression does not enhance initial ISOC provides evidence against an increase in channel number (N) or single channel conductance (i) (Fig. 6, A and B). This is because initial ISOC is due to current flowing through all of the open channels after Ca2+ addition. If either N or i was augmented by CaMKII, initial ISOC would be larger in CaMKIIca-expressing cells. This hypothesis argues that CaMKII potentiates ISOC by enhancing the probability of opening (P o) of SOCE channels. The observed increase in CDP levels in CaMKIIca-expressing cells strongly supports the conclusion that CaMKII potentiates ISOC by increasing P o. This is because CDP has been shown to be the result of extracellular Ca2+ exerting a positive effect on SOCE channel gating (P o) (12Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Christian E.P. Spence K.T. Togo J.A. Dargis P.G. Patel J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Representative current traces in response to a step pulse to –120 mV (Fig. 6C) and a voltage ramp from –140 to 50 mV (Fig. 6D) obtained from control (Thaps) and CaMKIIca-injected cells (Thaps-CaMKca) are shown. The time points during the experiments at which the traces were obtained are indicated in Fig. 6A (Thaps, open symbols; Thaps-CaMKca, filled symbols). Note the similar levels of initial ISOC in both treatments (Fig. 6C, open and filled stars). Initial ISOC traces from CaMKIIca-injected cells show a time-dependent increase in current amplitude (Fig. 6C, filled star) that is due to CDP occurring during the 500-ms duration of the voltage pulse. Zweifach and Lewis (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) have shown that the extent of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICRAC following a brief hyperpolarization depends on the single channel current (i) (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). That is, increased unitary current (i) results in a faster rate of ICRAC inactivation. Assuming that the same relationship holds for Xenopus oocyte ISOC, if CaMKII increases unitary conductance (i), we expect a faster ISOC inactivation rate shortly after the hyperpolarization pulse. However, the rate of ISOC inactivation shortly after (100 ms) hyperpolarization is similar between control and CaMKIIca-expressing cells (Fig. 6E). In fact, at steady-state, control cells exhibit a more marked ISOC inactivation (Fig. 6E). These inactivation kinetics argue that CaMKII does not enhance ISOC unitary conductance. Superimposed current-voltage relationships from control and CaMKIIca-injected cells were similar (Fig. 6F), indicating that CaMKII does not affect the voltage dependence of ISOC. These results argue that CaMKIIca potentiates ISOC by targeting SOCE channel gating and not the coupling mechanism between Ca2+ stores and SOCE. Three pieces of evidences support the conclusion that CaMKII potentiates ISOC by affecting channel gating (P o) and not channel number (N) or unitary conductance (i): 1) similar levels of initial ISOC in control and CaMKIIca-expressing cells (Fig. 6, A and B) arguing against an effect of CaMKII on N or i. 2) enhanced CDP in CaMKIIca-expressing cells (Fig. 6B), suggesting that CaMKII enhances channel P o. 3) similar ISOC inactivation rates shortly after hyperpolarization in control and CaMKIIca-expressing cells (Fig. 6E) arguing against an increase in unitary conductance (i). Ca2+ i has been shown to negatively regulate ISOC by inducing channel inactivation either directly or through store refilling (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 10Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here we show that Ca2+ i can in addition have a potentiating effect on SOCE. The Ca2+ i effect on SOCE is probably the result of CaMKII activation, because Ca2+ i , because inhibition of endogenous CaMKII activity blocks CMP and expression of CaMKIIca is sufficient to potentiate ISOC independently of Ca2+ i. Although CaMKII potentiates ISOC, it is not sufficient by itself to activate SOCE independently of store depletion (Fig. 4A). This observation is consistent with the fact that a Ca2+ i rise is not required for SOCE activation (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CaMKII pathway modulates SOCE activity but is not an essential component of the SOCE activation pathway in response to store depletion. For CaMKII to exert its effects, SOCE has to be activated by store depletion. Using pharmacological inhibitors, a role for CaMKII in skeletal muscle SOCE (29Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16134-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and myosin light chain kinase (a Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinase related to CaMKII (25Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar)) in endothelial SOCE (30Norwood N. Moore T.M. Dean D.A. Bhattacharjee R. Li M. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L815-L824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been postulated. This finding argues that CaMKII modulation of ISOC is a widespread mechanism that is not cell type-specific. Nonetheless, a previous report by Matifat et al. (27Matifat F. Fournier F. Lorca T. Capony J.P. Brule G. Collin T. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggests a negative effect of CaMKII on SOCE in Xenopus oocytes. However, it is not clear from this study that the reported CaMKII effect was due to SOCE modulation because the Ca2+-activated Cl– current was used as an indicator of SOCE, making it impossible to differentiate between an effect of CaMKII on the Cl– current or SOCE. In contrast, we have directly measured the SOCE current while modulating CaMKII activity and show that CaMKII activation potentiates ISOC. This finding argues that the effects of CaMKII reported by Matifat et al. (27Matifat F. Fournier F. Lorca T. Capony J.P. Brule G. Collin T. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) are due to modulation of the Cl– currents or other Ca2+ influx pathways in the oocyte. CaMKII provides an excellent modulator of SOCE activity because of its ability to decode spatial and temporal information encoded in Ca2+ i signals into different levels of kinase activity. This capacity is attributable to spatial and structural features of CaMKII. CaMKII localizes to specific subcellular compartments such as the nucleus and cytoskeleton (31Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), and its activity increases exponentially based on the number and frequency of Ca2+ i oscillation (15De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 33Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These exceptional attributes allow CaMKII to provide specificity to Ca2+ i signals by differentially activating effectors based on the kinetics of Ca2+ i signals. CaMKII plays important roles in regulating various cellular functions such as gene expression, cell cycle progression, and learning and memory (25Hook S.S. Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 34Hudmon A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 473-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that SOCE can now be added to the list of cellular functions modulated by CaMKII. In a similar fashion to the CaMKII effect on SOCE described here, CaMKII has been shown to augment both L-type (Cav1.x) (35Dzhura I. Wu Y. Colbran R.J. Balser J.R. Anderson M.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and T-type (Cav3.x) (36Barrett P.Q. Lu H.K. Colbran R. Czernik A. Pancrazio J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1694-C1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Ca2+ currents. CaMKII regulation of SOCE described in this paper is reminiscent of Ca2+-dependent facilitation of inward L-type Ca2+ current. As Ca2+ i increases, L-type Ca2+ current is enhanced in a process termed facilitation (37McCarron J.G. McGeown J.G. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Fay F.S. Walsh Jr., J.V. Nature. 1992; 357: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This facilitation is mediated by CaMKII, which increases the open probability of L-type channels (35Dzhura I. Wu Y. Colbran R.J. Balser J.R. Anderson M.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Our data strongly argue that CaMKII potentiates ISOC in a similar fashion by altering channel gating (see Fig. 6). This similarity in the mechanism of action of CaMKII on both voltage-gated and store-operated Ca2+ channels argues for a common cross-talk between Ca2+ i kinetics and Ca2+ influx pathways. It is attractive to postulate that CaMKII provides a mechanism for phospholipase-linked receptors to differentially modulate SOCE activity. That is, the spatiotemporal features of the Ca2+ i signals downstream of receptor activation differentially activate CaMKII and thus SOCE. In addition to the CaMKII-mediated regulation of SOCE described here, SOCE has been shown to be modulated by protein kinase C (38Petersen C.C. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32246-32253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Both protein kinase C and CaMKII are downstream kinases that can be induced following activation of phospholipase-linked receptors. Therefore, the interplay between various modulatory mechanisms in a specific cellular context combines to generate different levels of Ca2+ influx through SOCE. This Ca2+ influx affects Ca2+ i kinetics and thus Ca2+-dependent cellular responses. Consequently, CaMKII regulation of SOCE is likely to have broad and important physiological consequences.

We extracted and affinity-purified epitope-tagged Limulus rhodopsin expressed from a cDNA or cRNA from these systems. We found that all three culture systems could efficiently synthesize the opsin polypeptide in quantities comparable with that found for bovine opsin. However, none of the systems expressed a protein that stably bound 11-cis-retinal.

This may be a general property of invertebrate opsins and may underlie some of the functional differences between invertebrate and vertebrate visual pigments. In all animals, visual pigments consist of an apoprotein and bound chromophore, usually 11-cis-retinal (most animals), 3,4-didehydro-11-cis-retinal (some fish, amphibia, and reptiles), or 3-hydroxy-11-cis-retinal (some insects) (1Seki T. Vogt K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 3Ebrey T. Koutalos Y. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 2001; 20: 49-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Typically, in both vertebrates and invertebrates the visual pigment is very stable in the dark, with thermal isomerization rates measured in years (4Birge R.R. Barlow R.B. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 55: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Barlow R.B. Birge R.R. Kaplan E. Tallent J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This stability contributes significantly to the overall limit of visual sensitivity. In addition, the mechanism of visual pigment activation is similar in vertebrates and invertebrates, in that absorption of a photon causes the isomerization of the chromophore from the cis to the trans conformation. This event initiates a series of conformational changes in the chromophore-protein complex that lead to the formation of an active state that interacts with G-proteins to regulate membrane conductance (6Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7Filipek S. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev.

Despite these similarities, the invertebrate and vertebrate pigments differ in at least two significant ways. First, the active states have different thermal stabilities. In vertebrates, the active state, metarhodopsin II bleaches (or decomposes) rapidly into the apoprotein and free all-trans-retinal. In contrast, invertebrate metarhodopsin (M) is stable under physiological conditions (for a review, see Ref. 9Hillman P. Hochstein S. Minke B. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 668-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, the regeneration of pigment containing the 11-cis-chromophore following exposure to light differs between vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrate opsins can bind 11-cis-retinal, synthesized enzymatically in the adjacent pigment epithelium, and spontaneously form the Schiff's base linkage, apparently without any additional protein cofactors (2Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In invertebrates, the pigment can be efficiently converted back to the dark-adapted state by light at ambient temperature, a process called photoregeneration, or by thermal isomerization of the chromophore (9Hillman P. Hochstein S. Minke B. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 668-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Photoregeneration is the main mechanism by which the rhodopsin concentration is maintained in bright light (10Hamdorf K. Autrum H. Handbook of Sensory Physiology. Vol. VII/6A.

Studies to investigate the molecular bases for the differences between vertebrate and invertebrate pigments have been limited by the lack of a suitable expression system for invertebrate opsins that would be comparable with those available for vertebrate opsins (13Oprian D.

We find that none of the common systems used for the expression of vertebrate opsin produce a Limulus opsin capable of binding retinal. In fact, our findings suggest that one or more protein cofactors in invertebrate photoreceptors are necessary for the functional expression of the Limulus visual pigment. COS1 Expression Vector—The Limulus rhodopsin cDNA, Lim Rh1 (20Smith W.C. Price D.A. Greenberg R.M. Battelle B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6150-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pMT3 (21Khorana H.G. Knox B.E. Nasi E. Swanson R. Thompson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In order to facilitate detection and purification of the expressed protein, the carboxyl five amino acids of Limulus rhodopsin were replaced with 14 amino acids from bovine rhodopsin, thus introducing the epitope recognized by the 1D4 monoclonal antibody (22Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA, Lim Rh1-1D4, contained 180 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence, the coding region for amino acids 1-362 (of 367 total) from Lim Rh1 (including an alanine at position 105, which is a polymorphic site in Limulus (20Smith W.C. Price D.A. Greenberg R.M. Battelle B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6150-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), and the cDNA for amino acids 330-348 from bovine rhodopsin. Sf9 Expression Vector—Lim Rh1-1D4 was transferred into the SmaI-NotI restriction sites of the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen). To form the infecting virus, this construct was recombined with Baculogold DNA (Pharmingen) in Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Drosophila Expression Vector—An expression construct was generated in which either the Lim Rh1-1D4 cDNA (referred to as P{Rh1+LimMT} or wild type Lim Rh1 cDNA (referred to as P{Rh1+Lim}) was cloned into an expression cassette containing 2.5 kb of Drosophila ninaE promoter sequence, the transcription initiation site, 33 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, a short polylinker, and 650 bp from the 3′-end of the ninaE gene that includes the polyadenylation signal (23Townson S.M. Chang B.S. Salcedo E. Chadwell L.V. Pierce N.E. Britt S.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2412-2422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both constructs were subcloned into the y + marked P-element vector “C4” (24Chou W.H. Hall K.J. Wilson D.B. Wideman C.L. Townson S.M. Chadwell L.V. Britt S.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Lim Rh1-1D4 was cloned into the EcoRI-NotI restriction sites of pALTER1 (Invitrogen). Capped RNA was prepared by run-off transcription using NotI-linearized plasmid and T7 polymerase (either RiboMax or RiboMax kit from Promega or Ambion, respectively). Transcripts were polyadenylated in vitro, purified using oligo(dT) chromatography (PolyATtract, Promega, Inc.), and quantified using UV spectroscopy. Final RNA samples were suspended in water. mRNA—Retinas from adult Limulus polyphemus (200 animals), collected in summer and fall near Woods Hole, Massachusetts, were isolated and used either immediately for RNA extraction or frozen in dry ice and stored at -70 °C until use. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and poly(A)+ RNA isolated using oligo(dT) chromatography (PolyATtract; Promega) and eluted in water at a concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml. COS1 cells were grown and transfected using the DEAE-dextran protocol (25Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). All Limulus rhodopsin transfection experiments were performed in parallel with bovine rhodopsin transfections as a positive control. Transfected cells were allowed to incubate 48-72 h post-transfection. Three methods were used for regeneration of visual pigment. In method 1 (26Starace D.M. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), reconstitution was carried out in the dark by incubation of cells suspended in Buffer Y (50 mm HEPES, pH 6.6, l40 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and benzamidine) with 5 μm 11-cis-retinal (in ethanol) for 3-18 h at 4 °C. In method 2, cell membranes were first isolated (27Robinson P. Cohen G. Zhukovsky E. Oprian D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and then resuspended in 67 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, containing protease inhibitors. Reconstitution was carried out with 2 μm 11-cis-retinal at 4 °C for 3 h. To remove retinal, membranes were washed with 4% BSA 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; ERG, electroretinogram; DM, dodecyl maltoside. in 67 mm NaPO4. In method 3, COS1 cells were grown in the dark in the presence of 5 μm 11-cis-retinal, beginning 24 h after DNA addition. The medium was changed twice prior to harvest of the cells. Pigment formation was determined by taking UV-visible spectra of protein purified using immunoaffinity chromatography (26Starace D.M. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or by measuring light-dark difference visible spectra on solubilized membranes. Membranes were solubilized using 2% digitonin or 1% DM on ice for 20 min with occasional homogenization with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a JA-20 (Beckman) rotor at 19,000 rpm for 45 min. The top 9/10 of the supernatant was removed and transferred to a new tube for spectral analysis. The insect cell line, Sf9, from Invitrogen was cultured in Sf-900II SFM (Invitrogen) with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. The titer of the amplified Baculo/LimRh1-1D4 was about 108 plaque-forming units as estimated by end-point assay. Sf9 cells at 5-6 × 106 cells/ml were infected with the Baculo/LimRh1-1D4 by incubating cells, recombinant viruses and fresh medium, mixed in the ratio of 10:1:20 (v/v/v). Sf9 cells were harvested 1-4 days after infection. To reconstitute the opsin with chromophore, Sf9 cells were harvested 2 days after infection. The chromophore, 11-cis-retinal or all-trans-retinal, was added to a final concentration of 2 μm 1 day after infection and again at each of the following steps: cell harvesting, membrane solubilization, and immunoaffinity purification. Infected cells were harvested as previously described (28DeCaluwe G.L. DeGrip W.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cell membranes were solubilized in buffer A (5 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors) with 1% DM on ice for 20 min. The following 14 protease inhibitors were used in each step of the purification: aprotinin, benzamidine, calpain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, phenanthroline, phenylalanine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, tosyl arginine methyl ester, tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone, tosyl phenylethyochloromethylketone, antipain, and p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid. All of these inhibitors were from Sigma and were used in a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, with the exception of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm). The unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 43,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The expressed opsin was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and used for spectral analysis. P{Rh1+LimRh1} and P{Rh1+LimRh1-1D4} were injected into yw;sr ninaE17 mutant embryos, and multiple independent P-element-mediated germ line transformants were obtained, as previously described (24Chou W.H. Hall K.J. Wilson D.B. Wideman C.L. Townson S.M. Chadwell L.V. Britt S.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Four homozygous lines containing P{Rh1+Lim1} on the X (line 4), second (line 242), and third (lines 30 and 155) chromosomes were retained. Six lines of flies that contained P{Rh1+Lim-1D4} on the X (lines 63 and 69), second (lines 133 and 147), and third (lines (93 and 179) chromosomes were retained. The strains used in this study were constructed using visible markers and balancer chromosomes. The following mutant alleles were used: ninaE17 , norpAP24 , and Gαq1 . Xenopus oocytes were isolated as previously described (29Knox B.E. Barlow R.B. Thompson D.A. Swanson R. Nasi E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 50-100 nl of RNA solution and cultured for 3-6 days in MBS solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.6, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin). Limulus lateral eyes were dissected from 150 adult animals over a period of 3 days. Dissections of the retina from the cornea were done in ambient room light, and animals were not dark-adapted beforehand. Retinas were placed in saline solution (275 mm NaCl, 3.7 mm KCl, 8.0 mm CaCl2, 7.0 mm MgCl2, and 23 mm MgSO4), covered in foil, and allowed to dark-adapt for 3 h. Retinas were divided into batches of 40 eyes, spun briefly to remove saline, flushed with N2, quick frozen on dry ice and stored at -70 °C. All procedures were carried out in the dark. Limulus eyes (40Pearn M.T. Randall L.L. Shortridge R.D. Burg M.G. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were allowed to thaw on ice, suspended in 67 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, containing 5 μg/ml protease inhibitors (benzamidine, pepstatin, leupeptin), and homogenized in a glass tissue grinder. This homogenate was layered on a 45% sucrose cushion and spun in an SW-27 rotor at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C for 25 min. The membrane band was collected, and the pellet was rehomogenized. The membrane fractions were pooled and diluted 10-fold with phosphate buffer to lower the sucrose concentration, and membranes were collected by centrifugation in a Ti35 rotor at 30,000 rpm for 25 min. The pellet was solubilized with 0.3 ml of a solution containing 2% digitonin or 1% DM in phosphate buffer and incubated in ice for 1 h. The solubilized solution was centrifuged in a JA-20 rotor at 19,000 rpm for 30 min. The top portion of the supernatant was removed and used for spectral analysis. Bleached membranes were prepared by suspending in 10 ml of 0.1 m NH2OH in phosphate buffer. The membranes were put on ice and exposed to the light projector (Eastman Kodak Co. projector equipped with a 300-watt tungsten bulb and a high pass 515-nm cut-off filter) for 3 h with occasional mixing. Membranes were centrifuged in a 70Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm for 15 min. To remove the retinal oxime, the membranes were washed twice in phosphate buffer containing 2% BSA and resuspended in phosphate buffer. Bleached membranes (from 40 eyes) were reconstituted with retinal using two methods. In method 1, membranes were incubated with 5 μm 11-cis-retinal at 4 °C. The incubated membranes were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 2% BSA in phosphate buffer, and each solubilized with 0.6 ml of 2% digitonin in phosphate buffer for 1 h. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the top portion of the supernatant was taken for spectral analysis. In method 2, a Limulus eye extract, containing soluble proteins including putative retinal photoisomerase activity, was prepared (30Smith W.C. Friedman M.A. Goldsmith T.H. Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 8: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Limulus retina (∼48) were homogenized in 5 ml of PI buffer (0.1 m NaPO4, pH 6.8). The homogenate was spun at 8,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was re-extracted in another 5 ml of buffer PI and respun. The two supernatants were pooled (10 ml total) and used as a soluble Limulus eye extract. For reconstitution, membranes were prepared from Limulus retina as usual. The resuspended membranes were divided into two. One aliquot was bleached with NH2OH and subsequently washed with 2% BSA as described above. The other aliquot was not bleached. Membranes were resuspended in either 2.5 ml of buffer PI or 2.5 ml of eye extract, and a retinal solution containing a 2:1 molar ratio of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal) was added to a final 5 μm concentration. Samples were mixed at 4 °C overnight, washed two times with 2% BSA in phosphate buffer, and finally solubilized in 0.7 ml of 2% digitonin in phosphate buffer for spectral analysis. Protein samples were digested with N-glycanase as described by Kaushal et al. (31Kaushal S. Ridge K. Khorana H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Solubilized protein samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. LimRh1-1D4 was detected using 1D4 IgG and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase was visualized using DAB/NiCl2. Blots were scanned, and figures were prepared using Photoshop (Adobe). COS1 cells were grown on gelatin-coated cover slips and transfected as usual. After 48 h, cells were fixed with cold (-20 °C) methanol followed by acetone. Opsin was detected using 1D4 antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. UV-visible absorption spectra of purified visual pigments and solubilized membranes were recorded in the indicated buffers at 20 °C with a Beckman DU 640 single beam spectrophotometer. Bleaching illumination was provided with light from a 300-watt projector (Kodak) at a distance of 50-60 cm. Unfiltered light from the projector was termed white light, and a high pass colored glass cut-off filter (>515 nm; Edmund Scientific, Inc.) was used as indicated. Total radiant energy of the light stimuli was measured using an optical power meter (3M Photodyne) equipped with a calibrated silicon photodiode (EGG, Inc.). Unfiltered light delivered 4.0 milliwatts. Spectra (4-6 scans) were obtained from the sample before and after illumination. All spectra were averaged and analyzed using SigmaPlot Software (Jandel). Microscopy—The immunohistochemistry using the 1D4 antibody and confocal imaging were performed as previously described (24Chou W.H. Hall K.J. Wilson D.B. Wideman C.L. Townson S.M. Chadwell L.V. Britt S.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The confocal image was collected using a Zeiss LSM-310 microscope (Thornwood, NY). Electrophysiology—Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded from immobilized white-eyed flies using glass microelectrodes filled with normal saline (0.9% NaCl, w/v) as previously described (23Townson S.M. Chang B.S. Salcedo E. Chadwell L.V. Pierce N.E. Britt S.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2412-2422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chou W.H. Hall K.J. Wilson D.B. Wideman C.L. Townson S.M. Chadwell L.V. Britt S.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Spectral sensitivity was measured using a modification of the voltage clamp method of Franceschini (32Franceschini N. Invest. Opthalmol. 1979; 5Google Scholar, 33Franceschini N. Borsellino A. Cervetto L. Photoreceptors. Plenum, New York1984: 319-350Crossref Google Scholar), which we have described in detail elsewhere (23Townson S.M. Chang B.S. Salcedo E. Chadwell L.V. Pierce N.E. Britt S.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2412-2422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the amplitude of the ERG response to a flickering (10 Hz) monochromatic stimulus was maintained at a criterion level while the wavelength of stimulating light was varied during a scan. Throughout the scan, the criterion response was maintained by constantly adjusting the light intensity using a proportional integral-derivative algorithm (34Corripio A.B. Tuning of Industrial Control Systems. Instrument Society of, Research Triangle Park, NC1990Google Scholar). Spectral sensitivity was defined as the inverse of the light flux required to produce the criterion response, taking into account the wavelength and intensity of the stimulating light (i.e. spectral sensitivity ∝ 1/(light intensity × wavelength)). Sensitivity data were normalized to an amplitude of 1.0 at the wavelength of maximal sensitivity, averaged, and smoothed with a window of 10 nm. Rhodopsin Nomogram Modeling—Spectral sensitivity measured in vivo in the fly's eye was curve-fit to the theoretical rhodopsin absorption using the exponential function described by Stavenga et al. (35Stavenga D.G. Smits R.P. Hoenders B.J. Vision Res. 1993; 33: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, the spectral shape of the rhodopsin α-band absorption can be described by the following log normal function: α = A × exp[-a 0 x 2(1 + a 1 x + a 2 x 2)], where x = 10log(λ/λmax), A = 1, a 0 = 380, a 1 = 6.09, and a 2 = 3a 12/8. The curve-fitting routine was implemented in KaleidaGraph™ (version 3.08d, Synergy Software, Reading, PA) using the Levenberg-Marquardt (nonlinear least-squares) algorithm. The computer solved for the λmax and amplitude of the rhodopsin absorption spectrum and calculated the S.D. value for each variable and the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r). The effect of β-band absorption (λmax = 340 nm) was ignored, because this is likely to be minimal in the measured region (450-600 nm). Immunoprecipitation—Oocytes were injected with ∼50 ng of LimRh1-1D4 cRNA and cultured in labeling medium (MBS containing 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and 10 μCi/μl [35S] TRANS label (ICN, Inc.)) for 4 days. The medium was replaced each day with fresh labeling medium. Oocytes were washed in modified Barth's saline and homogenized in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, and 0.5% dodecyl maltoside (10 μl/oocyte). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Opsin was immunoprecipitated using 1D4-Sepharose and eluted from the resin with competing peptide. 35S-Labeled proteins were resolved on 12% acrylamide gels and exposed to x-ray film. Electrophysiology—The procedure for recording light responses has been described previously (29Knox B.E. Barlow R.B. Thompson D.A. Swanson R. Nasi E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were selected 4-7 days postinjection and analyzed using a two-electrode (2-5 megaohms) voltage clamp. Pigment generation was performed following impalement of the oocytes by switching the bath solution to one containing 5-10 μm 11-cis-retinal. Light responses were elicited by exposing the cell to a stimulus delivered through an optical light guide. Responses were digitized and collected using pCLAMP. Native Pigment—As a preliminary study for heterologous expression of a Limulus opsin cDNA, we characterized the photobleaching and regeneration properties of detergent extracts from lateral eye membranes (Fig. 1). In digitonin, there was a broad absorbance between 400 and 500 nm that arose from screening pigments, thus preventing direct observation of the visual pigment. However, exposure of the extract to light caused a loss of absorbance at ∼540 nm and an increase at ∼370 nm (Fig. 1B). The difference spectrum fit the profile expected for an 11-cis-retinal-based rhodopsin. The visual pigment was quite stable in detergent extracts when kept in the dark, with only a minor loss of absorbance after 18 h (Fig. 1B). The same results were obtained with membranes that were solubilized in dodecyl maltoside (data not shown). Rhodopsin could be isolated from dark-adapted and light-adapted animals as long as the retina was incubated in the dark prior to extraction (Fig. 1C). This shows that the M form of the visual pigment efficiently thermally converts back to R in the dark. The chromophore could be completely removed from the visual pigment by exposing to light in the presence of hydroxylamine, resulting in no light-sensitive spectra. We attempted to regenerate the visual pigment by two methods. In the first, membranes were incubated with 11-cis-retinal in the dark before solubilization with digitonin. There were no light-sensitive changes detectable (Fig. 1C). In the second method, membranes were incubated with an extract of soluble proteins from Limulus retina and either 11-cis- or all-trans-retinal. Again, no detectable visual pigment was regenerated. The reason that chromophore did not bind apoprotein is not clear. One possibility is that the chromophore must bind to the opsin co-translationally, prior to conformational changes that form the final pigment. Alternatively, there might be accessory proteins not extracted or stable under our conditions (e.g. integral or peripheral membrane proteins) required for insertion of chromophore into the apoprotein. Expression in COS1 Cells—COS1 cells were transfected with an epitope-tagged Limulus opsin expression plasmid. Western analysis (Fig. 2A) of the purified protein showed that the expressed Limulus opsin was found in a number of different sized bands: a major broad band at 39 kDa, aggregated species of the size of dimers and trimers, and a proteolytic fragment at 21 kDa. Treatment of Limulus opsin with N-glycanase caused a mobility increase of monomer and higher aggregates, indicative of the removal of N-linked carbohydrate. Transfected COS1 cells were incubated with 11-cis-retinal, and the protein was solubilized in 1% dodecyl maltoside and then purified using immunoaffinity chromatography. The recovered protein did not have any associated retinal as measured by absorbance spectroscopy (Fig. 2B) or by dark-light difference. In order to determine whether the purification protocol caused the protein to release retinal, 11-cis-retinal was added directly to the purified protein sample. No l"
https://openalex.org/W2102121642,"Transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by the v-Jun oncoprotein correlates with a downregulation of the extracellular matrix protein SPARC and repression of the corresponding mRNA. Repression of SPARC contributes to the oncogenic process by facilitating tumor development in vivo. A proximal promoter fragment, designated -124/+16, is responsible for high constitutive activity of the SPARC gene and is the target of repression by v-Jun. In this paper, using electrophoretic mobility shift and pull-down assays in vitro, and transient transfections and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in Sp1/3-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells and in chick embryo fibroblasts, we show that (i) Sp1 and/or Sp3 is required for constitutive activation of SPARC transcription, by binding directly to the GGA-rich -92/-57 fragment; and (ii) v-Jun does not bind -124/+16 directly, but binds to the GGA-rich fragment indirectly, most likely through a physical interaction with Sp1/3. Moreover, a transactivation-proficient v-Jun derivative, designated v-Jun/cebp/glz, which cannot bind Jun DNA motifs anymore and cannot heterodimerize, is still capable of downregulating SPARC efficiently. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that v-Jun downregulates SPARC through the formation of a DNA-Sp1/3-v-Jun, chromatin-associated complex."

Activation of PLCβ3 by Gα and Gβγ subunits has been fairly well characterized, but little is known about other protein interactions that may also regulate PLCβ3 function. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library with the amino terminus of PLCβ3 has yielded potential PLCβ3 interacting proteins including calmodulin (CaM). Physical interaction between CaM and PLCβ3 is supported by a positive secondary screen in yeast and the identification of a CaM binding site in the amino terminus of PLCβ3. Co-precipitation of in vitro translated and transcribed amino- and carboxyl-terminal PLCβ3 revealed CaM binding at a putative amino-terminal binding site. Direct physical interaction of PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 isoforms with CaM is supported by pull-down of both isoenzymes with CaM-Sepharose beads from 1321N1 cell lysates. CaM inhibitors reduced M1-muscarinic receptor stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells consistent with a physiologic role for CaM in modulation of PLCβ activity.

All four mammalian PLCβ isoenzymes are activated by Gαq-type G-protein subunits to various degrees, but only PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 are activated by Gβγ dimers. PLCβs, with some isoenzyme differences, may be purified from both cytosolic and particulate fractions of cells (11Ryu S.H. Cho K.S. Lee K.Y. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12511-12518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jhon D.-Y. Lee H.-H. Park D. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that in addition to activation, translocation to substrate at the membrane or maintenance of the enzyme at the plasma membrane may be an additional means of regulation. PLCβ proteins, as a family, contain at least five distinct structural domains, identified by homology to the crystal structure of PLCδ1 (13Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The amino terminus contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a known protein interaction and membrane-binding domain that may be also a region for Gβγ subunits interaction with PLCβ2 and -β3 isoforms (14Barr A.J. Ali H. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Smrcka A.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In all PLCβ isoenzymes, the PH domain is followed sequentially by four EF-hand domains, which frequently bind Ca2+ in other protein contexts but whose function in PLCβs has yet to be characterized. The middle third of the PLCβ proteins contains catalytic X and Y domains, the activity of which requires a Ca2+ co-factor. The COOH-terminal portion of PLCβ isozymes has recently been crystallized as a dimer from the turkey PLCβ homologue and hypothesized to be the domain responsible for the dimerization of the full-length enzyme (16Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This region also contains a site for activation by Gαq subunits (17Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Whereas there is significant homology among mammalian PLCβ isotypes (35–55% in full-length protein and 80–90% in catalytic domains), the differences in G-protein selectivity for activation and subcellular localization among isotypes suggest that each has unique mechanisms of regulation. Given the ubiquitous distribution of PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 and their differential regulation by Gβγ G-protein subunits, isoenzyme-specific modifiers of PLCβ3 activity may be postulated. A yeast two-hybrid method was used to screen a mouse cDNA library and identify proteins that interact with the PH and/or the EF-hand domain of PLCβ3. Several candidates have been identified, most intriguing being calmodulin (CaM). PLCβ3 is a Ca2+-sensitive protein whose activation leads to increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. CaM acts as an intracellular Ca2+ sensor and is a known regulator of other membrane-associated proteins and thus is a good candidate for interaction with and regulation of PLCβ3. We have detected PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 expression in 1321N1 human astrocytomas, and using this cell line as a model system, determined that CaM is a regulator of G protein-coupled receptor-stimulated PLCβ activity. Materials—KN-62, KN-93, KN-92, W-13, and fluphenazine were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Mediatech Cellgro (Herden, VA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). myo-[3H]Inositol and protein A-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. PLCβ-selective polyclonal rabbit antisera and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ImmuneStar™ chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Bio-Rad. CaM-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. pBTM116 and pBL1 vectors, and L40 and PL3α Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains were kindly provided by Dr. Mark Leid (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (21Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. cDNA coding for the amino-terminal PH and EF-hand domain regions of PLCβ3 (amino acids 2–315; PH-EF-β3) was PCR amplified to incorporate 5′ EcoRI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites with the following primers: 5′-ATATATCTCGAGGCGGGCGC and 3′-TATATACTCGAGTCAAGATCCAGGGCTTCCAGGG. The PCR-amplified fragment was subcloned into pBTM116 (a tryptophan-selectable yeast expression plasmid) in-frame with the lexA DNA-binding domain as the “bait” vector. PCR amplification and in-frame insertion was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using pBTM116-specific forward and reverse sequencing primers. A random-primed mouse brain cDNA library subcloned in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain into the pACT2 vector (a leucine-selectable yeast expression plasmid; Clontech) was used for prey selection. S. cerevisiae L40 reporter yeast strain with an integrated lexA operon in front of HIS3 and lacZ genes was doubly transformed with bait vector, pBTM116-PH-EF-β3, and the mouse brain cDNA library in pACT2. Approximately 1 × 104 yeast transformants were screened for HIS3 reporter activity on His–Leu–Trp– selection plates in the presence of 50 mm aminotriazole to suppress residual HIS3 expression in the absence of interaction. 150 growth-positive clones were isolated and screened for β-galactosidase activity in liquid assay as described previously (21Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Positive clones with β-galactosidase activities of at least twice background (defined by β-galactosidase activity from L40 yeast transformed with bait plasmid only) were selected for further characterization. For amplification and sequencing of positive clones, growth selection- and β-galactosidase-positive yeast were grown for 3 days on His–Leu– medium to allow for loss of bait plasmid. Plasmid DNA was isolated, amplified using pACT2 forward and reverse primers (Clontech), sequenced with the same primers, and analyzed by BLAST search (National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine) for similarity to known sequences. Previously identified sequences were assessed in a secondary yeast two-hybrid screen for interaction with PH-EF-β3 in a different vector context. For secondary screening, positive clones in the pACT2 vector were co-transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain PL3α along with pBL1 (a histidine-selectable yeast expression plasmid) containing the PH-EF-PLCβ3 fragment subcloned in-frame with the estrogen receptor DNA-binding domain. PL3α yeast contain a URA3 reporter activity under the control of estrogen response elements. Transformants were selected for growth on Ura–His–Leu– medium. Inositol Phosphate Assay—Inositol phosphate (IP) assays were performed with 1321N1 cells as previously reported (23Filtz T.M. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar). 1321N1 cells were routinely subcultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum and standard antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For IP assays, 1321N1 cells were subcultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then labeled overnight with myo-[3H]inositol, 1 μCi/0.5 ml/well, prepared in sterile inositol-free, bicarbonate-buffered DMEM without additives. Following radiolabeling, cells were pre-treated for 30 min (KN-62, KN-92, and KN-93) or 10 min (W-13 and fluphenazine) in 20 mm Hepes-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4 (HDMEM), at 37 °C in room air. After pre-treatment, 10 mm LiCl was added for 10 min followed by stimulation of muscarinic receptors with 1 mm carbachol for 20 min. Following stimulation, cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and the soluble lysate was ether extracted three times. Inositol phosphates (IP, IP2, and IP3) were purified by anion exchange chromatography with ammonium formate. Lipids were solubilized with 1 n NaOH and collected to quantitate [3H]inositol phospholipids. Samples were harvested into scintillation vials and radioactivity was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. Percent (%) conversion was calculated as ([3H]inositol phosphates (dpm))/([3H]inositol phospholipids (dpm) + [3H]inositol phosphates (dpm)). All assays were performed in triplicate and values reported reflect an average of at least three experiments ± S.E. Student's t tests were performed to assess statistical significance where indicated. Cell Fractionation and Immunoprecipitation—1321N1 cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate and grown for 3 days under standard conditions. On day 3, cells were washed twice with HDMEM and collected by scraping and pelleting at 500 × g for 5 min. Cold lysis buffer (0.6 ml: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors, 200 μm benzamidine, 200 μm PMSF, 2 μm pepstatin A, and 2 μm leupeptin) was added to each sample and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and a 50-μl fraction was saved as crude lysate. The remainder of the lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g, 4 °C, for 5 min to pellet nuclei and intact cells. The low speed supernatant was centrifuged at 300,000 × g, 4 °C, for 25 min, separating soluble and particulate fractions. The particulate (membrane) fraction was resuspended in 0.6 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with inversion. After extraction, the membrane fraction was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C, for 30 min to pellet detergent-insoluble particulates. Supernatant was saved as membrane extract. For immunoprecipitation, anti-PLCβ isozyme-selective polyclonal antibodies were added to soluble (cytosol) and membrane extract fractions at a 1:200 dilution and incubated at 4 °C overnight with continuous inversion. Immune complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose that had been washed and equilibrated in extraction buffer (v/v) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper, incubated with PLCβ-selective polyclonal antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies at 1:5000 dilution, and visualized with alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescent substrate (ImmuneStar™) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For preparation of cell lysates for CaM-Sepharose 4B binding assay, 1321N1 cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate and grown for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Plated cells were washed twice with HDMEM. Cells were scraped into tubes and pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. Cold lysis buffer (0.6 ml: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl, and protease inhibitors) was added to each sample and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g, 4 °C, for 5 min to pellet nuclei and intact cells prior to incubation with CaM-Sepharose 4B beads as described below. Transcription and Translation of Radiolabeled Proteins—[35S]Methionine-labeled amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal PLCβ3 were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using the in vitro TnT™ quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 1 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid containing cDNA sequence for the amino-(amino acids 1–313, N-PLCβ3) or carboxyl-(amino acids 670–1173, C-PLCβ3) terminal sequences of PLCβ3 was incubated with TnT™ reticulocyte lysate and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine in a total volume of 50 μl for 90 min at 30 °C. Labeling efficiency and level of protein expression were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and autofluororadiography (described below). CaM-Sepharose 4B Binding Assay—The CaM-Sepharose binding assay with [35S]methionine-labeled proteins was performed according to the protocol of Chuang et al. (24Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. CaM-Sepharose 4B resin was washed twice in 500 μlofdH2O, 4 °C, and equilibrated for 1 h in binding buffers (30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) made with calcium calibration buffers (K2EGTA and/or CaE-GTA in varying amounts) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Free Ca2+ concentrations ranged from 0 to 39 μm. Equivalent radioactive quantities of radiolabeled 35S-N-PLCβ3 or 35S-C-PLCβ3 were incubated with 50 μl of pre-equilibrated calmodulin-Sepharose 4B resin in a total volume of 500 μl overnight at 4 °C with inversion. Unbound material was removed by washing three times with 200 μl of binding buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the final pellet and the calmodulin-Sepharose precipitants were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. For autofluororadiography the resultant gel was soaked in glacial acetic acid for 20 min, impregnated with 10% 2,4-diphenyloxazole scintillant for 15 min, and rinsed in ddH2O for 10 min before being dried to Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The gels were exposed overnight to x-ray film and the 35S-radioactive bands were visualized. For cell lysates (prepared as described in the cell fractionation and immunoprecipitation section) 70 μl of a 50% slurry of CaM-Sepharose 4B resin was equilibrated in extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm CaCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and added to each lysate sample. Samples were incubated at 4 °C with inversion for 1 h. After incubation the pelleted beads were washed three times in extraction buffer at 4 °C; after the final wash, proteins were eluted from the beads with the addition of 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins in the supernatant were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper followed by Western blotting as described above with PLCβ-selective polyclonal antibodies. Identification of CaM/PLCβ 3 Interaction—To identify novel protein interactions with PLCβ3, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screening system. A mouse brain cDNA library was screened with the NH2-terminal region (PH and EF-hand domains) of PLCβ3 as bait. Of the positive clones identified in this screen, full-length mouse calmodulin was isolated at least three times and interaction was confirmed by a β-galactosidase assay (Table I) and a secondary growth screen as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1).Table ISpecific interaction of PLCβ 3 with CaMSelected positive clones-Fold above backgroundCalmodulin3.514-3-3η7.5γ-Actin4.0Cytochrome c oxidase3.5 Open table in a new tab The Calmodulin Binding Site—Binding site search and analysis site The Calmodulin Target Database 2calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/pub_pages/general/index.htm. was used for computer analysis of the PLCβ3 protein sequence. Three putative calmodulin-binding sites were identified in the full-length PLCβ3 protein sequence by hydropathy, α-helical propensity, residue weight, residue charge, hydrophobic residue content, helical class, and occurrence of key residues. Two of these sites are located in the COOH-terminal region and one in the NH2-terminal region of PLCβ3. The NH2-terminal CaM-binding site is shared by PLCβ1 and has 90% identity to the NH2-terminal-binding site in PLCβ3 (Fig. 2A). When compared with other CaM-binding domains, conserved hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids were identified in the PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 sequences consistent with putative calmodulin-binding domains (Fig. 2B). PLCβ 3 and PLCβ 1 Are Expressed in 1321N1 Cells—1321N1 cells express Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors that are activated by carbachol to hydrolyze phospholipids (25Evans T. Helper J.R. Masters S.B. Brown J.H. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To establish which PLCβ isoforms are expressed in 1321N1 cells to mediate G protein-activated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, we performed immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using PLCβ isoenzyme selective antibodies. We determined that PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 isoenzymes are expressed in 1321N1 cells, whereas PLCβ2 and PLCβ4 are not expressed at detectable levels (Fig. 3). Having confirmed the presence of PLCβ3 in 1321N1 cells, we investigated the possible interaction of the enzyme with calmodulin in vitro. N-PLCβ 3 Physically Interacts with CaM—To verify that the CaM-binding domains of PLCβ3 physically interact with CaM, a co-precipitation assay was performed using 35S-radiolabeled NH2-terminal (N-PLCβ3) or C-terminal (C-PLCβ3) regions of PLCβ3 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and CaM-Sepharose beads. In vitro transcription and translation and 35S radiolabeling of N-PLCβ3 and C-PLCβ3 were verified by SDS-PAGE and autofluororadiography (not shown). Co-precipitation assays were performed with 35S-N-PLCβ3 (Fig. 4A) in the presence of binding buffers containing the indicated concentrations of free Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). N-PLCβ3 protein bound most strongly in the buffer containing no free Ca2+ and bound less effectively with increased Ca2+. Co-precipitation of C-PLCβ3 (Fig. 4B) with CaM-Sepharose in the presence of binding buffers containing the indicated concentrations of free Ca2+ revealed that C-PLCβ3 did not bind CaM-Sepharose under any of the above conditions (Fig. 4B). Binding of N-PLCβ3 to CaM occurred in the absence of free Ca2+ in the presence of varying NaCl concentrations up to 200 mm (data not shown). Full-length PLCβ 3 and PLCβ 1 Are Isolated from Cell Lysates by CaM-Sepharose Beads—To determine whether the physical interaction between CaM and N-PLCβ3 identified by the in vitro co-precipitation assay occurred with the full-length protein, we used CaM-Sepharose beads to precipitate PLCβ3 or PLCβ1 from 1321N1 whole cell lysates. Cell lysates (supernatant from a low speed centrifugation) were incubated overnight with CaM-Sepharose beads in 1% Triton X-100. The beads were pelleted, washed, and the CaM-binding proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunodetected with PLCβ3- or PLCβ1-specific antibodies. Fig. 5 (third and fourth lanes) shows that both PLCβ3 (top panel) and PLCβ1 (bottom panel) can be immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with CaM-Sepharose. Isolation of PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 from 1321N1 cell lysates with CaM-Sepharose supports an interaction between PLCβ and CaM, and suggests physiological relevance for CaM binding to PLCβ3 and PLCβ1. Calmodulin Antagonists Inhibit Activity of PLCβ in Vivo—To ascertain the potential physiological consequences of the interaction between CaM and PLCβ, we treated 1321N1 cells with CaM inhibitors (W-13 and fluphenazine) and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors (KN-93 and KN-62), and assayed for effects on PLCβ activity by measuring subsequent carbachol-stimulated IP hydrolysis. CaM antagonists, W-13 and fluphenazine, reduced carbachol-stimulated IP hydrolysis in intact 1321N1 cells by 52 and 60%, respectively, compared with carbachol stimulation of vehicle pre-treated cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that CaM is supportive of PLCβ activity in 1321N1 cells. To determine whether the inhibition of PLCβ activity by W-13 was sensitive to stimulation of IP hydrolysis or changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, we investigated effects of calmodulin inhibitor W-13 on IP hydrolysis either concurrent with carbachol activation or 10 min post-activation. When W-13 was added concurrently with carbachol, IP hydrolysis was inhibited by 50%, whereas only 25% inhibition occurred when W-13 was added 10 min post-activation (Fig. 5B). To address whether CaM kinase may mediate the effects of CaM on PLCβ activity, 1321N1 cells were treated with CaMKII inhibitors, 30 μm KN-93 or 2 μm KN-62 (26Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 27Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1321N1 cells pre-treated with CaMKII inhibitors for 30 min, there was no effect on basal or carbachol-stimulated IP hydrolysis (Fig. 6). CaMKII inhibitors had no effect on basal or carbachol-stimulated IP hydrolysis in 1321N1 cells at concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm (data not shown). The lack of effect of CaMKII antagonists in this system supports a physiological role for direct interaction between PLCβ enzymes and CaM without requiring activation of CaMKII. The PLCβ class of enzymes is a key component in G-protein-linked receptor-mediated signaling cascades. In response to external cellular stimuli and subsequent activation of G protein-coupled receptors, PLCβ is responsible for the production of IP3 and DAG, two important second messengers in a variety of cellular functions. Examples of a few of the receptors that act through the G-protein/PLCβ pathway include thromboxane A2, bradykinin, angiotensin, histamine, vasopressin, M1-type muscarinic cholinergic, and thyroid stimulating hormone. Efforts are being made to elucidate differences in signaling through PLCβ pathways to identify tissue and/or receptor-specific targets for regulation. Novel putative regulators of PLCβ isoenzymes identified recently include: NHERF2, which is postulated to interact with the 8-amino acid carboxyl terminus of PLCβ3 (19Hwang J.-I. Heo K. Shin K.-J.

In 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, PLCβ3 segregates mostly with cellular particulate rather than soluble fractions, whereas the cellular distribution of PLCβ1 is such that it is primarily isolated from soluble fractions. 3T. M. Filtz, unpublished observations. In addition to different subcellular locations of these enzymes in 1321N1 cells, previous work in other cell lines describe differences in activation among the isozymes (33Rhee S.-G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 34Arthur J.F. Matkovich S.J. Mitchell C.J. Biden T.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Biol.

Our laboratory has sought to identify novel regulators of PLCβ3 and/or PLCβ1 isozyme signaling. Full-length CaM was identified as a possible PLCβ3 interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library. Sequence analysis of the full-length PLCβ3 protein reveals three putative CaM-binding sites, one in the amino terminus and two in the carboxyl tail of the protein. PLCβ1 has a CaM-binding site in the NH2-terminal with 90% identity to the PLCβ3 CaM-binding site. The best described CaM binding motif is an IQ motif (35Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); however, other non-IQ CaM-binding domains, both Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent, have been identified as short 16–35-amino acid regions that segregate hydrophobic residues from basic and polar residues on an α-helical wheel projection (36Rhoads A.R.

The CaM-binding site identified in the NH2-terminal regions of PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 have a similar distribution of amphiphilic residues as these non-IQ motif CaM-binding proteins (Fig. 2B). PLCβ enzymes are Ca2+-sensitive proteins (12Jhon D.-Y. Lee H.-H. Park D. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Anionic phospholipid-binding sites and CaM-binding sites share some similarities and may overlap in certain proteins. Ca2+/CaM attenuates the ability of PIP3 to inhibit RGS4 intrinsic GTPase activity without activating RGS directly (38Popov S.G. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol.

Membrane association of G protein-coupled receptor kinases is required for activation and is enhanced by phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and Gβγ subunits (43Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C.

The presence of a CaM-binding site in the NH2-terminal region of PLCβ, and the isolation of PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 from cell lysates with CaM-Sepharose beads, suggest that CaM is a PLCβ regulatory protein that had not been previously recognized. We demonstrated by co-precipitation assays that CaM binds PLCβ3 through the NH2-terminal region. These data suggest that N-PLCβ3 is a Ca2+-independent CaM-binding peptide (Fig. 4). Data to support physiological significance of a CaM/PLCβ interaction is shown by the isolation of both PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 isoforms from 1321N1 cell lysates by CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 5). Inhibition of CaM by W-13 was shown to reduce inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (Fig. 6, A and B) in vivo consistent with an inhibition of PLCβ activity. Inhibition was seen when cells were treated with W-13 prior to activation when intracellular Ca2+ levels are low, and when cells were treated concurrent with activation or 10 min post-activation when intracellular Ca2+ levels are changing because of the activation of PLCβ. These data suggest that CaM is integral in the muscarinic receptor-activated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis pathway, and the association of PLCβ with CaM may be independent of intracellular Ca2+ levels similar to the Ca2+ independence of CaM binding N-PLCβ3 (Fig. 4A). In neural tissues where concentrations of CaM and CaM-binding proteins are very high (46Kakiuchi S. Yasuda S. Yamazaki R. Teshima Y. Kanda K. Kakiuchi R. Sobue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), many CaM-binding proteins are known to associate with CaM when intracellular Ca2+ levels are very low and even in the presence of chelators (47Gnegy M.E. Prog. Drug Res. 1995; 45: 33-65PubMed Google Scholar). Neuromodulin binds CaM in the presence of EGTA and Ca2+ disrupts binding (48Masure H. Alexander K. Wakim B. Storm D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), similar to the profile seen with N-PLCβ3 binding of CaM (Fig. 4A). Inducible nitric-oxide synthase is an example of a protein that binds CaM independent of Ca2+ levels and is then activated by CaM maximally at 0.1 nm free Ca2+ in vitro (49Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Data herein support a direct interaction between PLCβ and CaM and maintain that regulation of PLCβ activity by calmodulin is not acting through CaMKII. Previous work by others has shown an inhibition of carbachol-stimulated PLCβ3 activity with CaMKII inhibitors in PLCβ3-transfected COS cells, suggesting that CaMKII is an activator of PLCβ3 activity (50Yue C. Sanborn B.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We were not able to repeat this finding in 1321N1 cells endogenously expressing PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Regulation and phosphorylation of PLCβ3 may occur through a different mechanism in 1321N1 cells distinct from exogenously expressing transfected cells. We propose a model whereby CaM facilitates PLCβ activity, possibly by increasing access to substrate. While cognizant that the in vivo activity of CaM inhibitors to inhibit inositol phospholipid hydrolysis may result from effects on any member of the pathway from M1 receptor to G-protein to PLCβ, the association of CaM in vitro with N-PLCβ3 and the co-precipitation of PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 by CaM-Sepharose suggest that PLCβ isozymes are at least one target affected by CaM. We are currently working to determine the differential effects of CaM on PLCβ3 and PLCβ1 activity, membrane association, or stimulation by G-proteins. We thank Drs. Mark Leid and Dorina Avram for furnishing reagents, technical advice, and helpful conversations regarding the yeast two-hybrid assay system. We also thank Dr. Sonia Anderson and Dean Malencik for help with Ca2+ buffer calculations and providing expert advice on CaM binding experiments and Dr. Monica Skinner for reading of the manuscript."

Hence, p75NTR seems central to the injury response and we wished to determine the signals that regulate its expression. Here, we demonstrate that tonicity mediated cell swelling rapidly activates transcription of the endogenous p75NTR gene and of a p75NTR promoter-reporter gene in various cell types.

Damage to the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system represents a major medical problem, because of the lack of spontaneous tissue repair and the limited availability of tools for therapeutic intervention. Traumatic injury, epileptic seizures, microbial infections, ischemia, and others result in cerebral edema, inflammation, and ultimately death of neuronal and non-neuronal cells (1Doble A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 163-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 2Fishman R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1975; 293: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 3Sykova E. Vargova L. Prokopova S.

The cause of cell death is not entirely understood, but may be because of physical damage, release of cytokines by infiltrating inflammatory cells, and/or production of radicals, including nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NT, neurotrophin; NTR, neurotrophin receptor; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester; BIS, bisindolylmaleimide I; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; DAF-FM diacetate, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate; l-NAME, N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; 7-NiNa, 7-nitroindazole sodium salt; MGD, N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate; cPTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; RT, reverse transcriptase; RLU, relative light unit; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; NGF, nerve growth factor.

Injury-induced expression of p75NTR, the common receptor for neurotrophins (NT) may also contribute to apoptosis (8Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 9Hempstead B.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Neurite regeneration in the damaged central nervous system is muted by the Nogo receptor pathway, which requires the p75NTR receptor to transduce the repressing signal (10Fournier A.E. Strittmatter S.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Thus, increased p75NTR expression is central to the injury response in nervous tissue. The p75NTR receptor is a 75-kDa glycoprotein with an extracellular domain containing four cysteine-rich repeats required for NT binding, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that lacks catalytic activity, yet contains a Type II death domain (8Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 9Hempstead B.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Binding of NTs to p75NTR can activate different signaling pathways, including NFκB, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and production of ceramide (12Lee F.S. Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Chao M.V. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently, p75NTR was shown to preferentially bind the uncleaved form of NTs (pro-NT) with high affinity, thereby inducing cell death (13Beattie M.S. Harrington A.W. Lee R. Kim J.Y. Boyce S.L. Longo F.M. Bresnahan J.C. Hempstead B.L. Yoon S.O. Neuron. 2002; 36: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). p75NTR also regulates RhoA activity, consistent with its role in neurite outgrowth, and the receptor plays a pivotal role in myelination in the peripheral nervous system (14Yamashita T. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 15Cosgaya J.M. Chan J.R. Shooter E.M. Science. 2002; 298: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Expression of p75NTR occurs in the developing central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, but is also found outside the nervous system and animals with complete p75NTR ablation have a high mortality rate because of severe defects in the vascular and nervous systems (16von Schack D. Casademunt E. Schweigreiter R. Meyer M. Bibel M. Dechant G. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 977-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The transcriptional control of p75NTR shows characteristics of a house-keeping gene and various agents either positively or negatively regulate its expression, yet no consensus mechanism of transcriptional control has emerged (17Roux P.P. Barker P.A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 203-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Given the importance of p75NTR in the injury response, we wished to determine the cellular signals that lead to its expression. We utilized an in vitro model that closely mimics injury conditions in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that cell swelling, a common response to tissue damage, ubiquitously activates p75NTR transcription in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Transcription activation occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis and requires the enzymatic activities of phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), and include nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Thus, p75NTR is an early effector gene of the NO signal pathway activated by volume stress, thereby implicating NO in p75NTR-regulated functions including neurite outgrowth and cell death. Reagents— l-Arginine, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, mannitol, EGTA, and thapsigargin were obtained from Sigma. BAPTA-AM and DAF-FM diacetate were purchased from Molecular Probes. Bisindolylmaleimide I (BIS), ionomycin, l-NAME, 7-NiNa, MGD, cPTIO, Rottlerin, U73122, and U73433 were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—All cell lines were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific), supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 4 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Hypoosmotic medium was prepared by dilution of complete growth medium with water to indicated osmolarities and confirmed with an osmometer (Advanced Instruments).

Chem. 1985; 260: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, unless otherwise noted. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10% serum for 4 h according to manufacturers instructions. Typically, 1 μg of DNA and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per well of a 24-well plate and luciferase activity was determined from triplicates. Luciferase expression was assayed using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Tropix) according to the manufacturers instructions. RT-PCR—Total RNA was harvested from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Equal amounts of each RNA sample (1–5 μg) were reverse transcribed using the Superscript Preamplification system for First-Strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen) followed by PCR amplification using the following protocol: 95 °C for 5 min, 5 cycles of 94 °Cfor5s,72 °C for 4 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 4 min, and 20 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 4 min. A 1.3-kb product was generated from the human p75NTR mRNA and RT-PCR amplification was done in the absence of RT as internal control. FasL was amplified as described (23Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification of the murine p75NTR was performed with primers from Promega. RT-PCR of β-actin expression was monitored using primers specific for human, mouse, and rat β-actin cDNA (Promega). Flow Cytometry—p75NTR surface expression was analyzed as described (24Matsushima H. Bogenmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5015-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured cells were resuspended using PBS with 5 mm EDTA, washed in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum) at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with ME20.4 antibody (22Grob P.M. Ross A.H. Koprowski H. Bothwell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) for 1 h. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and analyzed by FACS. Quantitation of FACS data was done based on mean fluorescence intensity as determined using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell Size Analysis—Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium with a defined osmolarity, and maximal cell size was determined from triplicate samples using a Coulter counter channelyzer (Beckman Instruments). Relative cell volume is expressed as the median channel of the distribution determined by the channelyzer. PAGE Gels and Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of total cell protein were loaded onto 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schull) as described (20Bogenmann E. Torres M. Matsushima H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1915-1925PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were immunoblotted with an anti-p75NTR antibody (Promega) at a 1:250 dilution using standard procedures. Blots were stripped and re-blotted with an anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) according to the manufactures instructions to demonstrate equal loading. Quantitation of Western blot data was done using Labworks software (UVP). 125I-NGF Affinity Cross-linking Analysis—Cells were grown in isotonic or hypotonic medium for 24 h, resuspended in PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. Cells (2 × 106) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in Krebs-Ringer solution supplemented with 1.25 nm125I-NGF (Amersham Biosciences, 1850 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of 200 nm unlabeled NGF. Cells were then incubated with BS3 (Pierce) (2 mm) for 15 min at room temperature, quenched with 80 mm glycine, washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline, and boiled in 2× SDS buffer. Complex formation was analyzed by PAGE gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Promoter Reporter Constructs—A 2.1-kb DNA fragment of the p75NTR promoter was amplified from normal human DNA using PCR primers located at –2000 (5′-ATCTTAGAAGCAGTCCCTGTCTGGAAGGAATGACTC-3′) and at +100 (5′-CGGCAGCGCTCGACTTCCAGCTC-3′), (transcription start site is considered 0). Amplification was done at 95 °C for 5 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 5 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 5 min, and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 5 min. The PCR fragment was cloned in the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega). The NFκB-luciferase reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. A. Baldwin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) and the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Dr. J. Horowitz (North Carolina State University, Durham, NC). We hypothesized that cell swelling, a common response to disruption of homeostasis by tissue damage, leads to p75NTR expression in vivo and decreasing the medium osmolarity would recapitulate these events in vitro. HTLA230 neuroblastoma cells that neither express the p75NTR nor the trkA genes were exposed to hypoosmotic (160 mosm/liter) medium and p75NTR expression was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total cellular RNA isolated from human melanoma (A875) cells known to express p75NTR was used as an internal reference. Consistent with the hypothesis, hypotonic medium-induced p75NTR expression in HTLA230 cells, which remained at a high level as long as the tonicity stress was applied, but subsided within hours upon reversal of the medium to isotonicity (Fig. 1A). The DNA sequence of the RT-PCR fragment was consistent with that of the human p75NTR mRNA (data not shown). Interestingly, 30 min exposure to this tonicity stress was not sufficient to activate p75NTR expression (Fig. 1B), but mRNA was detectable following a 1-h treatment. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not prevent stress-induced p75NTR transcription (Fig. 1C), thus suggesting that p75NTR is an early response gene. In contrast, actinomycin D abolished the increase in the p75NTR mRNA pool, demonstrating that p75NTR expression was due to de novo transcription, rather than stabilization of low abundant mRNA (Fig. 1D). HTLA230 cells were grown in either control or hypoosmotic (160 mosm/liter) medium for various time periods and the newly synthesized p75NTR receptor was characterized using Western blots, FACS, and receptor/ligand cross-linking. On Western blots, the anti-p75NTR antibody recognized 2 protein bands with molecular weights of 65,000 and 75,000 in A875 cells, consistent with the described recognition profile for the antibody (25Higuchi H. Yamashita T. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1790-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In HTLA230 cells, p75NTR expression was undetectable at the onset of the experiment, whereas the 2 p75NTR immunoreactive proteins were present within 12 h of exposure to hypotonic medium (Fig. 2A). FACS analysis of A875 cells using the anti-p75NTR antibody (ME20.4) followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody demonstrated high p75NTR surface expression (Fig. 2B). Staining of HTLA230 cells with the secondary antibody alone (row a) or with ME20.4 followed by the secondary antibody (row b) showed similar fluorescence intensity, consistent with a lack of p75NTR surface expression. Exposure of HTLA230 cells for 24 h to hypotonic medium did not alter the background fluorescence when cells were stained with the secondary antibody alone (row c), however, these cells showed a substantial shift in fluorescence intensity when stained with the primary and secondary antibodies (row d), consistent with p75NTR surface expression. This analysis demonstrated that HTLA230 cells exposed to hypoosmotic medium showed a 22-fold increase in fluorescence intensity when compared with untreated cells. This fluorescence intensity is ∼17 times lower than that seen in A875 cells. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-NGF (see “Materials and Methods”) was used to investigate the potential of the newly synthesized p75NTR to bind NGF. Incubation of A875 cells with 125I-NGF revealed a strong radioactive protein band with an approximate molecular weight of 100,000 consistent with the presence of a 125I-NGF·p75NTR complex (Fig. 2C). This complex was abrogated in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled NGF, thus demonstrating the specificity of the 125I-NGF·p75NTR complex. HTLA230 cells did not reveal a radioactive complex when grown in control medium, whereas a labeled protein band with a similar molecular weight as that seen in A875 was present in cells exposed to hypoosmotic medium. Similar data were seen with GOTO cells, another human neuroblastoma, where an abundant 125I-NGF·p75NTR complex was present in osmotically stressed cells. This complex was abrogated in the presence of excess unlabeled NGF, thus indicating the presence of a 125I-NGF·p75NTR complex. Hence, surface-bound p75NTR receptors are ligand binding competent and thus represent the full-length receptor (16von Schack D. Casademunt E. Schweigreiter R. Meyer M. Bibel M. Dechant G. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 977-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The observation that hypotonic medium induces p75NTR expression was not unique to HTLA230 cells. Analysis of a panel of human and murine cell lines using semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, or flow cytometry demonstrated that exposure to hypoosmotic medium activated p75NTR expression in almost all cell lines examined, albeit to various degrees (Table I). These cells included a series of neuronal, glial, and other tumor lines as well as normal human cells (i.e. HEK293 brain capillary endothelial cells (HBCEC)). Transcription activation occurred in cells with or without apparent basal level p75NTR expression, regardless of the developmental origin of the cells. p75NTR transcription activation was not detectable by RT-PCR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH3T3, 10T½), although p75NTR promoter-driven transgene expression was detectable (data not shown). The -fold increase in p75 expression upon exposure to hypotonic medium is given in Table I where quantitative analysis by flow cytometry or Western blotting was done.Table IAnalysis of p75NTR expression in various cell linesCell typeCell lineIncreased p75NTR in hypotonic-Fold increaseHumanNeuroblastomaHTLA230Yes22aAnalyzed by flow cytometry.NeuroblastomaGOTOYes30aAnalyzed by flow cytometry.NeuroblastomaSK-N-BE(2)YesNDbND, no quantitative data available.NeuroblastomaSK-N-SHYesNDGlioblastomaU-87 MGYes9cAnalyzed by Western blotting.MedulloblastomaDaoyYesNDMelanomaA875Yes3aAnalyzed by flow cytometry.Cervical carcinomaHeLaYesNDRetinoblastomaY79Yes24aAnalyzed by flow cytometry.Embryonic kidney293HEKYes16aAnalyzed by flow cytometry.Brain endothelial cellsHBCECYes118cAnalyzed by Western blotting.MurineCentral nervous systemB104YesNDFibroblastNIH3T3No0Fibroblast10T1/2NoNDa Analyzed by flow cytometry.b ND, no quantitative data available.c Analyzed by Western blotting. Open table in a new tab A 2.1-kb DNA fragment of the normal human p75NTR gene spanning from –2000 to +100 was PCR amplified and cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (see “Materials and Methods”) to facilitate a quantitative analysis of transcription activation. A875 melanoma cells, which are amenable to transfection, readily express the endogenous p75NTR gene, and demonstrate increased p75NTR expression upon cell swelling were transiently transfected with the p75NTR promoter-reporter gene, a CMV driven luciferase expression vector (CMV-luc), or a DHFR driven luciferase transgene. Cells were exposed 24 h later to either isotonic or hypotonic (160 mosm/liter) medium for 8 h, the relative light units (RLU) from triplicate cultures were determined, and the data represents the mean -fold increase in RLU/μg of protein from cells exposed to hypoosmotic medium over cells grown in isotonic medium (Fig. 3A). Constitutive expression of the CMV and the DHFR driven transgenes remained unchanged upon exposure of cells to hypoosmotic stress, whereas transcription of the p75NTR promoter-luciferase fusion gene was greater than 20-fold increased. Interestingly, both the DHFR and p75NTR promoter depend on the activities of members of the family of Sp transcription factors (26Dynan W.S. Sazer S. Tjian R. Schimke R.T. Nature. 1986; 319: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), suggesting that tonicity mediated transcription is not just a hallmark of Sp driven promoters, but a unique property of the p75NTR gene. Various degrees of transcription activation of the p75NTR reporter gene occurred in other cell lines (Fig. 3B), re-enacting tonicity induced increase in expression of the endogenous p75NTR gene (see Table I). Exposure of HTLA230 cells to medium of 160 mosm/liter rapidly induces a greater than 30% increase in cell volume (data not shown) and we hypothesized that processes accompanying cell swelling initiate cellular signals thereby triggering p75NTR expression. However, preparation of hypoosmotic medium reduces the concentration of all medium components (i.e. amino acids, vitamins, and salts), which could activate p75NTR expression. To test our hypothesis, we prepared hypoosmotic medium (160 mosm/liter) and added mannitol, a cell impermeable sugar, to restore isotonicity (320 mosm/liter). HTLA230 cells were then exposed to these culture conditions and expression of the endogenous p75NTR gene was determined (Fig. 4A). Cells grown in isotonic medium supplemented without (320 mosm/liter) or with (420 mosm/liter) mannitol (2.5%) did not express p75NTR, demonstrating that hypertonic medium does not induce p75NTR expression. In contrast, hypotonic medium (160 mosm/liter) induced p75NTR expression, which was completely abrogated in hypoosmotic medium supplemented with 2.5% mannitol (320 mosm/liter). Thus, induction of p75NTR expression is the consequence of decreased medium osmolarity, rather than an effect of reduced levels of medium components. To assess the relationship between osmolarity, cell volume, and transcription activity, A875 cells were transfected with the p75NTR promoter-luciferase fusion gene, exposed for 8 h to media with decreasing osmolarity and RLUs were determined. Maximal cell volume increase mediated by a given osmolarity was determined using a Coulter counter channelyzer (Fig. 4B). Data obtained demonstrated that incremental decreases in medium osmolarity induces increasingly greater maximal cell swelling, which is directly proportional to the increase in p75NTR promoter activity. More importantly, increased cell swelling is also proportional to elevated cell surface expression of p75NTR as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 4C). p75NTR surface expression increased up to 30-fold in osmotically stressed GOTO cells, which was ∼7-fold less than that seen in A875 cells. Thus, cell swelling is a novel mechanism whereby cells regulate p75NTR receptor density and ultimately p75NTR controlled functions. The Role of PLC Activation—Hypotonicity induced cell swelling has been shown to activate PLC, which converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (28Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). As a consequence, diacylglycerol may trigger the activation of PKC, whereas inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate can bind to its receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby stimulating calcium release from the internal stores (29Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Both increases in intracellular calcium [Ca2+] i and PKC activation are known to occur in response to hypotonic stress (30Pasantes-Morales H. Cardin V. Tuz K. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of PLC or any of its downstream effectors (i.e. PKC and [Ca2+] i) would abrogate swelling induced p75NTR expression if this signaling pathway is required. GOTO cells, transfected with the luciferase reporter construct, were exposed to hypoosmotic medium in the absence or presence of a widely used selective PLC inhibitor U73122 (10 μm) or its less active analog U73343 (10 μm) (31Godwin S.L. Soltoff S.P. Bone. 2002; 30: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was determined 8 h thereafter (Fig. 5A). Data obtained from triplicate cultures are expressed as % of control (RLU/μg of protein) and demonstrated that addition of U73122 dramatically reduced (>80%) swelling mediated p75NTR promoter-luciferase activity. In contrast, the less active compound U73343 showed only a 20% reduction and similar data were obtained with A875 cells (data not shown). Inhibition of PKC with either a broad spectrum inhibitor (BIS) (32Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a more specific inhibitor of PKCδ (Rottlerin) (33Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) blocked cell swelling induced transcription activation of p75NTR (Fig. 5B). Importantly, neither the duration of treatment nor the concentration of the employed inhibitors showed any effect on cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion (see Supplemental Materials Fig. 1A). Hence, these data are supportive of an important role of PLC and PKC in swelling induced p75NTR expression. The requirement for calcium-mediated signals was determined with HTLA230 cells by investigating mRNA expression of the endogenous p75NTR gene, because chelation of Ca2+ ions may affect general protein synthesis and hence reporter gene expression. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of BAPTA-AM (0, 1, 10, and 50 μm), a cell permeable calcium chelator, followed by growth for 8 h in hypoosmotic medium in the presence of BAPTA-AM (Fig. 6A). Swelling induced p75NTR transcription activation was abrogated in the presence of BAPTA-AM, demonstrating the need for intracellular Ca2+ signals. Similarly, depletion of the intracellular calcium stores with 10 μm thapsigargin significantly reduced swelling mediated p75NTR mRNA levels (Fig. 6B) consistent with the requirement for intracellular Ca2+ signals. Trypan blue exclusion analysis demonstrated that neither BAPTA-AM nor thapsigargin affected cell viability under hypotonic conditions (see Supplemental Materials Fig. 1B). However, extracellular Ca2+ ions seem not to be necessary, because the presence of EGTA (2.5 mm), a cell impermeable chelator, did not prevent p75NTR up-regulation (Fig. 6C). Nor were increases in [Ca2+] i sufficient as ionomycin (10 μm), a Ca2+ ionophore, activated transcription of the Fas ligand (FasL) gene as previously described (23Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar), but did not induce p75NTR transcription (Fig. 6D). Hence, we concluded that increased [Ca2+] i is necessary, but not sufficient for swelling induced p75NTR expression. Role of the NO/cGMP Pathway—Cellular stress as well as injury to the brain is associated with activation of NOS enzymes, which in the case of nNOS and eNOS requires Ca2+ ions (34Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar). Hypotonicity activates NO synthesis in various cells (35Kimura C. Koyama T. Oike M. Ito Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and we measured a tonicity mediated increase in NO in A875 cells using a fluorescent probe (DAF-FM diacetate) with high affinity for NO (see Supplemental Materials Fig. 2). To determine the requirement of NO for p75NTR up-regulation, we employed well characterized NO scavengers (i.e. cPTIO and MGD2-Fe) (36Ko G.Y. Kelly P.T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibitors of NOS enzymes (l-NAME and 7-NiNa) (34Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E"

Of the four β subunits that have been identified, β4 is of particular interest because mutation of its α1 subunit interaction domain produces severe neurological defects. Its differential distribution in the hippocampus prompted us to examine whether this subunit was responsible for the heterogeneity of hippocampal L-type calcium channels. To study the functional effects of the β4 subunit on native L-type calcium channels, we transfected β4 cDNA subcloned out of embryonic hippocampal neurons into PC12 cells, a cell line that contains the β1, β2, and β3 subunits but not the β4 subunit. Cell-attached single-channel recordings of L-type channel activity from untransfected and transfected PC12 cells compared with recordings obtained from hippocampal neurons revealed an effect of the β4 subunit on single-channel conductance. L-type channels in untransfected PC12 cells had a significantly smaller conductance (19.8 picosiemens (pS)) than L-type channels in hippocampal neurons (22 pS). After transfection of β4, however, L-type single-channel conductance was indistinguishable between the two cell types. Our data suggest that calcium channel β4 subunits affect the conductance of L-type calcium channels and that native hippocampal L-type channels contain the β4 subunit. β subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels influence channel behavior in numerous ways, including enhancing the targeting of α1 subunits to the plasma membrane and shifting the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation.

Our data suggest that calcium channel β4 subunits affect the conductance of L-type calcium channels and that native hippocampal L-type channels contain the β4 subunit. Voltage-gated calcium channels are multisubunit proteins that show considerable heterogeneity in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. All voltage-gated calcium channels have a central α1 subunit that contains the ion pore and the voltage sensor and is capable of conducting current on its own. In addition to the α1 subunit, channels are composed of several auxiliary subunits. Each calcium channel consists minimally of an α1, β, and α2/δ in a 1:1:1:1 molar ratio. The auxiliary subunits are in direct contact with the α1 subunit and influence several aspects of channel gating as well as targeting of the channel to the membrane (for review, see Ref. 1Catterall W.A Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Multiple genes have been identified that code for α1, β, and α2/δ subunits (10, 4, and 3, respectively) and the numerous potential combinations are a key contributor to the functional diversity of voltage-gated calcium channels. There are general relationships that exist between calcium channel type and function. In the central nervous system, P-type (Cav2.1) and N-type (Cav2.2) channels, formed from α1A and α1B subunits, respectively, are largely responsible for supplying the calcium influx required for release of neurotransmitter (for review, see Ref. 2Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). L-type channels (Cav1.2/1.3), the subject of this study, are formed from α1C and α1D subunits, and have been shown to be involved in some types of hippocampal synaptic plasticity (3Kapur A.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4786-4797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has provided evidence for distinct subtypes of L-type calcium channels in central nervous system neurons, referred to by us as Ls and Lp. The Ls channel resembles the “standard” cardiac L-type channel in its fundamental characteristics, whereas the Lp channel has a smaller single-channel conductance and shows a distinctive low voltage-dependent potentiation of its activity. In this study we focused on the potential role of a particular β subunit in producing this diversity. Four different genes coding for β subunits have been identified (for review, see Ref. 17Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). β subunits have no hydrophobic domains and thus are not anchored in the cell membrane. Instead, they are located intracellularly and bind to the α1 subunit through protein-protein interaction domains (for review, see Ref. 18Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Each of the β subunits has a distinctive distribution in the brain (19Castellano A. Wei X.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13877-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and predictions of α1-β interactions have been made based upon co-localization of the subunits (21Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant β subunits that associate with L-type channels in the hippocampus are β3 and β4 with the two being present at approximately equal levels (23Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13877-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The β4 subunit is also distinguished by binding to an additional α1 subunit interaction domain (24Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To understand the potential contribution of the β4 subunits to L-type channel heterogeneity, we utilized undifferentiated PC12 cells which contain β1–β3, but lack the β4 subunit (25Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also do not contain Lp channels. We found that transfection of the neuronal β4 subunit into PC12 cells increased L-type channel unitary conductance, but did not produce L-type channels that showed the voltage-dependent potentiation characteristic of Lp channels. Thus we conclude that the β4 subunit associates with native hippocampal L-type channels and accounts for their larger conductance as compared with PC12 L-type channels. Primary Hippocampal Cell Cultures—Hippocampal neurons were obtained from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats. Hippocampi were removed bilaterally and maintained in cold phosphate-buffered saline during dissection. The tissue was triturated in 2 ml of MEM 1The abbreviations used are: MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; nt, nucleotide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; pS, picosiemens. with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, and cells were plated on poly-d-lysine coated Petri dishes at a density of 106 cells/35 mm dish. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air/5% CO2 humidified incubator in serum-free medium made up of MEM and Ham's F12 (1:1) and containing 6 mg/ml glucose, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 μm putrescine, 30 nm selenium, and 0.5 units/ml and 0.5 mg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, respectively. Cells were used between 3 and 14 days in culture. Electrophysiological Recordings—Patch-clamp pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and filled with BaCl2-solution containing (in mm): 20 BaCl2, 90 choline cloride, 10 tetraethylammonium, and 10 HEPES (26Thibault O. Porter N.M. Landfield P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11792-11796Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell-attached single-channel recordings were obtained using standard techniques (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) in a solution containing (in mm): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 HEPES-KOH, and 5 EGTA. The L-channel agonist FPL 64176 was included in all recordings. Recordings were made with an Axopatch 200 amplifier, and data was sampled with an INDEC 15125 analog-to-digital converter at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Unless specified otherwise, the holding potential used was –70 mV. Voltage pulses were delivered at 5 s intervals. Leak and capacitative currents were subtracted digitally. Data Analysis—Open times and open probabilities were obtained from sweeps idealized with the half amplitude crossing criterion and cubic spline interpolation (28Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983: 191-263Crossref Google Scholar). Overall open probability was calculated from all sweeps in response to a particular stimulus, including nullsweeps. Tail currents were included in the analysis. Results from open time analysis were plotted on square root-log coordinates, and mean open times were estimated from the maximum likelihood fitting (29Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Data from all the experiments were summed and treated as a single distribution. PC12 Cell Culture—PC12 cells were grown in culture flasks and maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air/5% CO2 humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 7.5% horse serum, and 1 ml penicillin/Streptomycin (10,000 units/ml and 10 mg/ml, respectively). Once per week the cultures were fed and subdivided, using trypsin to lift cells off the bottom of the flasks, and as needed they were plated on 35 mm dishes coated with poly-d-lysine. Each batch of cells was passaged no more than 10 times before a new culture was started from the stock kept in liquid nitrogen. After plating, the cells were used for recordings within 1 week. Molecular Biology—Messenger RNA was isolated from hippocampal and PC12 cell cultures using Oligotex Direct mRNA kit from Qiagen and eluted in a volume of 40 μl. cDNA was synthesized immediately following mRNA isolation with 6 μl of mRNA per reaction, using the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase enzyme from Invitrogen. Two different kinds of primers were used for the cDNA synthesis, oligo (dT) primers and random hexamer primers, and the two reactions were carried out separately. cDNAs synthesized from these two types of primers were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and used as templates for PCR reactions. PCR primers used for amplification of β subunits and actin were designed based on published sequences. GenBank™ accession numbers for these sequences are as follows: rat β1 X61394, rat β2 M80545, rat β3 M88751, rat β4 L02315 and rat actin V01217. The sequences of the PCR primers were: β1 forward (nucleotide (nt) 1394–1413), AGG GAC CCT ACC TTG TTT CC; β1 reverse (nt 1869–1890), GAG CCT CTT CTC TCC CAG AAC; β2 forward (nt 1756–1781), GCT GAA GAA GAA CCT TGT CTG GAA CC; β2 reverse (nt 2185–2204), AGA GAC ACG CAC GGT CAT TG; β3 forward (nt 1103–1122), TGG ATG AGA ACC AGC TGG AC; β3 reverse (nt 1392–1411), GAGGCTGGTACAGGTCCTGG; β4 forward (nt 1464–1484), CTC TCT CAC CGT ATC CCA CAG; β4 reverse (nt 1813–1838), CTG GTT TAT CTT AGC AGT ACT ATG GC; actin forward (nt 262–281), TAC AAC CTC CTT GCA GCT CC; actin reverse (nt 2533–2552), TCA TTG CCG ATA GTG ATG AC. For subcloning β4 was amplified by PCR using the following primers: GCA CTG CAG ACC ATG TCG TCC TCC TAC GCC (5′ primer), and GCA ACC GCG GTC AAA GCC TAT GTC GGG AG (3′ primer). The amplified β4 DNA was subcloned into the bicistronic pIRES-EGFP vector (Clontech). LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cDNA constructs into PC12 cells 24 h after plating. Cells were incubated with LipofectAMINE/DNA mix for 4 h (2 μg DNA + 5 μl LipofectAMINE in 1 ml Opti-MEM), in the absence of antibiotics. Following transfection, Opti-MEM was replaced with PC12 growth medium. Electrophysiological recordings were started 48 h after transfection. We have shown previously that cultured hippocampal neurons possess two kinds of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, Lp and Ls, that differ in their response to depolarizing voltage pulses (12Kavalali E.T. Plummer M.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kavalali E.T. Plummer M.R. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and high frequency stimulation (16Schjött J.M. Plummer M.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4786-4797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, cell-attached single-channel recordings from undifferentiated PC12 cells made with identical procedures revealed L-type channel activity that was highly reminiscent of Ls channels in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1). None of the 28 recordings from PC12 cells, however, showed any sign of reopening activity, the defining characteristic of Lp channels. The recordings were typically greater than 30 min in duration (mean = 33.9 ± 3.0 min) and contained 3 channels (mean = 3.2 ± 0.3). Comparison of hippocampal Ls channel recordings and PC12 cell L-type recordings suggested that the two kinds of channels were very similar (Fig. 1, A and B). Measurement of the open time distributions confirmed this general impression (Fig. 1C). In the presence of 1 μm FPL 64176, two major open time components were observed that were not statistically different between hippocampal Ls channels and PC12 cell L-type channels (p > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The two kinds of channels were not identical, however. Measurement of unitary conductance showed that hippocampal Ls channels had a significantly higher slope conductance (22.0 ± 0.2 pS; n = 8) than PC12 cell L-type channels (19.8 ± 0.3 pS; n = 18; p < 0.05; Fig. 1D). Thus, PC12 cells appear to have only a single kind of L-type voltage-gated calcium channel that has properties similar to Ls channels in hippocampal neurons. The only detected difference between the two lies in their single channel conductance. We used this observation to determine whether differential expression of the calcium channel β4 subunit genes in the two cell types could account for this difference in single channel conductance. To assay for the presence of β subunits in hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells, mRNA was isolated from these cells and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription. There are four known genes for calcium channel β subunits (β1–β4), and four pairs of PCR primers were designed based on published sequences for these genes in rat. The primers were designed to amplify a C-terminal domain of these proteins. As a control for the absence of genomic DNA in the PCR reaction, PCR was also preformed using mRNA samples, which had not been subjected to reverse transcription. The PCR products were analyzed a 2% agarose gel. We found that all four pairs of β subunit primers amplified their respective cDNA targets from the hippocampal cultures, indicating that all four β subunit genes are expressed in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2). In the case of PC12 cells, cDNAs coding for β1, β2, and β3 were amplified, but cDNA for β4 was not, confirming other reports (25Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the gene for this β subunit is not expressed in PC12 cells (Fig. 2). The band for β2 from PC12 cells was weaker than the bands for β1 and β3, indicating less amplification. The amount of amplification of β2 varied depending on the specific condition of the PCR reaction (temperature and magnesium concentration). However, there was never any hint of amplification of β4 even under very different PCR conditions. There was also no amplification in any of the samples when reverse transcription was omitted, demonstrating a lack of genomic DNA contamination (Fig. 2, –) in the PCR reactions. As a positive control for the presence of cDNA in both hippocampal and PC12 samples, actin primers were used. The size of each PCR product was as predicted by the published sequence for the four β subunits and actin (496 base pairs (bp) for β1, 438 bp for β2, 308 bp for β3, 374 bp for β4, and 813 bp for actin). Because Ls channels in hippocampal neurons have a larger single channel conductance than L-type channels in PC12 cells, and because hippocampal neurons express a calcium channel β subunit that is not expressed by PC12 cells, it is possible that this calcium channel subunit contributes to the difference in single channel conductance. To test this hypothesis, we subcloned the neuronal β4 subunit into a bicistronic expression vector (pIRES) and transiently transfected PC12 cells to test if the presence of β4 would change the conductance of L-type channels in PC12 cells. This vector allows for the co-expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the β4 subunit as two separate molecules in the transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). When recording from PC12 cells transfected with β4 DNA, we found an increased single channel conductance of L-channels compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 3, C–F). To confirm this result, three separate β4 clones were tested. We consistently found an increase in the single channel conductance of transfected PC12 cell L-type channels in the three β4 clones (Fig. 4A). The conductance of L-type channels in control untransfected PC12 cells was 19.8 ± 0.3 pS (n = 18). In cells transfected with clones 1–3, it was 22.6 ± 0.3 pS (n = 11), 22.2 ± 0.4 pS (n = 7), and 22.3 ± 0.6 pS (n = 6), respectively. The increase in conductance was statistically significant for all three of the β4 clones tested (p < 0.01, t test). To examine the possibility that the change in conductance was a nonspecific consequence of β subunit overexpression, we transfected PC12 cells with the β3 subunit instead of the β4 subunit. In these cells, the mean unitary conductance of L-type channels was (20.3 ± 0.7 pS; n = 6) significantly different from cells transfected with the β4 subunit (22.4 ± 0.24 pS; n = 24; p < 0.01, t test), but not significantly different from the native PC12 cell L-type channels (19.8 ± 0.3 pS; p > 0.39, t test). The conductance of L-type channels in the transfected PC12 cells was also compared with that of native Ls channels in hippocampal neurons and was found to not be statistically different (22.4 ± 0.24 versus 22.0 ± 0.21 pS; p > 0.3; Fig. 4B). This is consistent with the idea that the β4 subunit is responsible for increasing the conductance of L-type channels in transfected PC12 cells, because neurons normally express the β4 subunit, and the difference in conductance is the only detectable difference between Ls channels in neurons and L-channels in PC12 cells.Fig. 4Three separate clones confirmed that single channel conductance of L-channels in PC12 cells increase in cells transfected with hippocampal β4 DNA. A, comparison of single channel conductance in PC12 cells transfected with three separate clones of hippocampal β4 DNA and untransfected cells. In all three clones the conductance was significantly higher than in untransfected cells, p < 0.01, n = 18 for untransfected cells, n = 11 for clone 1, n = 7 for clone 2, and n = 6 for clone 3 asterisks. B, comparison of single channel conductance of L-channels in transfected and untransfected PC12 cells and Ls channels in hippocampal neurons. The conductance of L-channels in transfected PC12 cells and Ls channels in hippocampal neurons were not significantly different, p > 0.05, n = 18 for untransfected PC12 cells, n = 24 for transfected PC12 cells, and n = 8 for Ls channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether transfection of the β4 subunit altered channel properties in addition to unitary conductance, we compared the activation profile of L-type calcium channels in transfected and untransfected PC12 cells (Fig. 5). There was no difference between the half-maximal activation voltages for control and transfected PC12 cells (3.6 ± 1.1 versus 3.3 ± 1.2 mV; p > 0.4). Fig. 5A shows combined data for all the clones, but the individual clones were also tested separately (n = 5 for all the data points for untransfected cells, and n = 9 for all the data points for transfected cells). We also examined the open time distributions between transfected and untransfected PC12 cells (Fig. 5B). As with the activation voltages, no statistically significant differences were found (p > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The extracted mean open times were 0.6 and 65 ms for untransfected cells and 0.6 and 70 ms for transfected cells. Thus the incorporation of the β4 subunit into the L-type channel complex appeared to affect unitary conductance selectively, without an obvious impact on channel kinetics. The effect of β4 transfection on the conductance of L-type channels in PC12 cells implies that this parameter can be used to gain insight into the subunit composition on native calcium channels. To this end we plotted frequency histograms of unitary conductance for Ls, Lp, L-type + β4 and control L-type. Our prediction was that the native channels should show relatively narrow, unimodal distributions, whereas the transfected cells might show a bimodal distribution (reflecting channels that did, and did not, incorporate the exogenous β4 subunit). Consistent with this, the conductance distributions for the Ls and Lp channels were narrow and non-overlapping, suggestive of the β4 subunit being part of native hippocampal Ls, but not Lp, channels (Fig. 6, top two plots). The conductance distribution of L-type channels in control PC12 cells, although somewhat broader than that of the neuronal Ls and Lp channels, was still obviously more restricted than the distribution of L-type channel conductances from the transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 6, bottom two plots). Conductances of L-type channels from the transfected PC12 cells spanned a range from 19 to 26 pS, with a single peak. Our interpretation of this result is that the majority of L-type channels incorporate the exogenous β4 subunit, although some do not, accounting for the small population of channels with relatively low conductances. Voltage-gated calcium channels play important physiological roles in neurons and other cells, and several hereditary human genetic diseases are the result of mutations in voltage-gated calcium channels (for review, see Ref. 30Pietrobon D. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 25: 31-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important, therefore, to understand how these channels function and how the different subunits interact to give channels their characteristics. We were interested in what role the β4 subunit plays in the diversity of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. To study this, we used two different cell types that are derived from different tissues in rat, hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells, the latter being a cell line originally derived from adrenal chromaffin cells (31Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). PCR analysis revealed that there is a difference in the expression pattern of one of the β4 subunit gene in these two tissues. Consistent with previous reports, β4 was not present in PC12 cells (25Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but was expressed in hippocampus (19Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13877-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This also agrees with the general finding that the β4 subunit is expressed almost exclusively in the brain (19Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our cell-attached single-channel recordings revealed that PC12 cells contained only a single kind of L-type channel, whereas hippocampal neurons contained two, Lp and Ls. Examination of these two cells types thus provided an ideal system for examining the potential contribution of the β4 subunit to the underlying molecular basis of the Lp/Ls differences in gating kinetics and unitary conductance. Previous work from our laboratory (12Kavalali E.T. Plummer M.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kavalali E.T. Plummer M.R. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) has shown that Lp channels display a characteristic change in their gating behavior following a conditioning depolarization. Quiescent Lp channels do not typically open at voltages more negative than –40 mV, but following a depolarization to greater than ∼0 mV these channels transiently show re-openings (not tail current openings) at voltages as negative as –90 mV. These re-openings are not observed in recordings of hippocampal Ls channels and were not observed in any of our recordings of PC12 cell L-type channels. An additional difference between Ls and Lp channels is that the unitary conductance of hippocampal Lp channels is significantly smaller than that of hippocampal Ls channels. Our single-channel recordings indicate that the population of PC12 cell L-type channels is relatively homogeneous with properties that were generally identical to hippocampal Ls channels. Interestingly, however, the unitary conductance of the PC12 cell Ls channels was significantly smaller than the hippocampal Ls channels (Fig. 1) but was indistinguishable from hippocampal Lp channels when compared under identical ionic conditions (19.8 ± 0.3 versus 19.7 ± 0.31 pS). 2J. M. Schjött and M. R. Plummer, unpublished observations. To determine whether the β4 subunit was involved in regulation of calcium channel gating or unitary conductance, the hippocampal neuron β4 gene was cloned out of hippocampal neurons and transfected into PC12 cells. Following transfection, the gating pattern of the L-type channels was unchanged, but the unitary conductance increased to a level not significantly different from Ls channels in hippocampal neurons. Thus, the key determinant of the conductance difference between the PC12 cell L-type channel, and the hippocampal Ls channel is likely to be the β4 subunit. The particular subunit combination responsible for Lp channel gating, however, remains unknown. The relatively small alteration in calcium channel behavior produced by transfection of the β4 subunit is also consistent with work on lethargic mice (lh) in which the β4 subunit is absent, but in which P-type calcium current is not grossly disturbed, presumably because of other β subunits substituting for β4 (32Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Burgess D.L. Biddlecome G.H. McDonough S.I. Diaz M.E. Zilinski C.A. Bean B.P. Campbell K.P. Noebels J.L Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 293-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The enhancement of the single channel conductance conferred by the β4 subunit in this study was ∼10%. This is in contrast to the much larger increase in L-type whole cell current seen when the cardiac muscle α1 subunit is co-expressed with β4 compared with α1 alone (19Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been established that intracellular calcium channel β subunits are involved in membrane targeting of L-type α1 subunits (34Perez-Garcia M.T. Kamp T.J. Marban E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105,: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Res. 2000; 86: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus a large part of the increase in the whole cell current seen when α1 and β4 are co-expressed may result from an increased number of functional channels in the plasma membrane. Although this chaperone function is a general feature of β subunits for all classes of voltage-gated ion channels (for review, see Ref. 40Hanlon M.R. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2886-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), our findings nevertheless leave open the possibility that part of the enhanced whole cell current can also be attributed to increases in the conductance of individual channels and that the four β subunits may have a differential effect in this regard. Although unitary conductance has been shown to be influenced by amino acid substitutions in the α1 subunit (41Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mikala G. Yamamoto S. Schwartz A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Dirksen R.T. Nakai J. Gonzalez A. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1402-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and not by cardiac β subunits (43Wakamori M. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Yatani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 44Gondo N. Ono K. Mannen K. Yatani A. Green S.A. Arita M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or β1–β3 (45Colecraft H.M. Alseikhan B. Takahashi S.X. Chaudhuri D. Mittman S. Yegnasubramanian V. Alvania R.S. Johns D.C. Marban E. Yue D.T. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), work by other investigators has provided indirect evidence that β subunits may be able modulate the conductance of voltage-gated calcium channels. First, β subunits have characteristic actions on L-type channel gating that can lead to differential effects on channel open probability (45Colecraft H.M. Alseikhan B. Takahashi S.X. Chaudhuri D. Mittman S. Yegnasubramanian V. Alvania R.S. Johns D.C. Marban E. Yue D.T. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). When coupled with the findings that L-type channels can display a variety of conductance states (46Cloues R.K. Sather W.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and that unitary conductance can be modified by conditioning voltage pulses (47Josephson I.R. Guia A. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2587-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and agonists that increase open probability (48Fan J. Yuan Y. Palade P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C565-C572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that conductance could also be affected as a consequence of changes in gating. In addition, single channel recordings from transfected COS7 cells revealed small as well as large conductance channels when α1 subunits were expressed alone. Co-expression of β2a and α2-δ subunits with α1 resulted in an increased proportion of large conductance channels, suggesting that the accessory subunits influence the conductance of the ion pore of α1 (49Meir A. Dolphin A.C. Neuron. 1998; 20: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There are, however, alternative mechanisms that could account for the increase in unitary conductance that do not involve a direct effect of β4 on channel permeation. For example, transfection of the non-native β4 into PC12 cells could recruit a different isoform of α1 subunit that has a larger conductance than the native α1 subunit. This could be consistent with work showing that the different β subunits can target α1 subunits to characteristic locations (38Brice N.L. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although targeting of α1C is the same regardless of the type of β subunit (38Brice N.L. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With regard to the composition of native hippocampal Lp and Ls channels, our data suggest that β4 is not part of the Lp channel complex because its conductance is smaller than Ls channels. Using the same logic, we predict that β4 is a part of the hippocampal neuron Ls channel complex. This conclusion is supported by the relatively narrow distributions of Lp and Ls channel conductances in hippocampal neurons. Unlike the transfected PC12 cells, in which the distribution of conductances is rather broad, suggesting a mixed population of L-type calcium channels in which only a subset have incorporated the β4 subunit, the hippocampal Ls channels may be composed exclusively of β4-containing channels. An interesting implication of this is that the β4 subunit, perhaps through a specialized binding domain (18Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 50Walker D. Bichet D. Geib S. Mori E. Cornet V. Snutch T.P. Mori Y. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12383-12390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), may preferentially bind to the α1C or α1D subunits as compared with the other β subunits. Our findings suggest that the different β subunits have differential effects on the current through the α1 subunit. PC12 cells expressed β1–β3, but an addition of β4 still resulted in an enhanced conductance. There are other examples of the four β subunits having differential effects on the current through the α1 subunit. β1, β2, and β4, but not β3, allow for voltage dependent facilitation when co-expressed with α1C (51Cens T. Restituito S. Vallentin A. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18308-18315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the four β subunits affect inactivation to different degrees (for review, see Ref. 52Stotz S.C. Zamponi G.W. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 176-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for differences in α1 and β association between different tissues (21Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13877-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and during development (53Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has even been shown that differences between α1B splice variants depends on which β subunit it is associated with (54Pan J.Q. Lipscombe D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4769-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, differential effects of the auxiliary subunits and differences in channel subunit composition in different tissues may serve as a mechanism to fine tune calcium channel function in the body.

The receptor, also designated the substance P or tachykinin 1 receptor, has been implicated in numerous physiological functions, which include modulatory roles in the central nervous system and proinflammatory action (for review see Refs. 2Maggi C.A.

The same studies revealed that the antagonist appeared to bind deeply into the protein, within a pocket formed by the transmembrane helices.Although site-directed mutagenesis identified residues important for ligand binding, it cannot differentiate side chains that have a direct coordination of the ligands from residues involved indirectly, such as through allosteric communication. For example, a Y216A substitution located near the fifth transmembrane domain at the intracellular/membrane interface is far removed from the putative substance P pocket, yet this substitution caused a 20–40-fold increase in the binding affinities for related neurokinins without effecting the affinity for substance P (10Huang R.-R.C. Huang D. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16467-16472Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consequently with mutational framework of the Nk1r established, biophysical studies were initiated to obtain a better understanding of the structural aspects of ligand binding and allosteric switching. For example, fluorescent analogues of CP-96,345 and substance P have identified the ligand moieties required for receptor binding and have provided information on the local microenvironments surrounding the ligand (11Tota M.R.

These studies also showed that modifications at Lys-3 of the agonist had little affect on its subnanomolar binding.Here we report the use of EPR to study the ligand binding to a G protein-coupled receptor. Because modifications of Lys-3 appeared to be well tolerated both in binding and function, we sought to investigate the nature of the substance P binding pocket using a ligand containing a nitroxide spin label attached at Lys-3, allowing analysis by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). This approach is amenable to solution studies of Nk1r in both live cells and isolated membranes. The activation of the Nk1r, like many G protein-coupled receptors, is carefully regulated by an endocytotic recycling pathway. As a method to observe receptor trafficking in real time, we have exploited the sensitivity of the nitroxyl moiety attached to the bound ligand to the reducing environment of the cell interior. In addition, because many G protein-coupled receptors (including the Nk1r) display both high and low affinity ligand binding (13Cascieri M.A. Ber E. Fong T.M. Sadowski S. Bansal A. Swain C. Seward E. Frances B. Burns D. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 458-463PubMed Google Scholar), it is desirable to resolve dynamically distinct populations of bound ligand. EPR possesses the capability to resolve multiple conformational states of a spin label in its environment, and is thus well suited for this aim. Furthermore, EPR measurements of the modified ligand are useful to characterize the chemical environment for the receptor location that surrounds the spin-labeled side chain (14Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Substance P was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (San Carlos, CA). Collagenase, ionomycin, bacitracin, leupeptin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin were purchased from Sigma. Bolton-Hunter 125I-substance P was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The protease inhibitor mixture was from Calbiochem. Fluo-3-AM was from Molecular Probes and pluronic F-127 was from Texas Fluorescence Labs. 1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-carboxylate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was from Toronto Research Chemicals. Gpp(NH)p was obtained from Biomol. [3H]SP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Synthesis of Spin-labeled Substance P—N ϵ -Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-carboxyl-Lys3-SP was generated by reacting 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-carboxylate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Fig. 1A, II) with N-Fmoc-protected substance P (Fig. 1A, I). The peptide was synthesized on Rink amide resin using an ABI 433 peptide synthesizer. The NH2-terminal Fmoc-protected peptide was cleaved off the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisol/ethylendithiol/water (90:2.5: 2.5:5). The crude peptide was precipitated in ether three times and lyophilized. The crude peptide (0.05 mmol) was redissolved in the mixture of 2 ml of acetonitrile and 5% NaHCO3 in water (50/50). The solution was chilled to 4 °C and to the solution was added 0.2 mmol of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate. The mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 2 h. We confirmed the complete consumption of the peptide by HPLC analysis. The reaction mixture was acidified (pH 2) by adding 1 n aqueous HCl and then purified by HPLC using Phenomenex LUNA 300 A column (pump A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, pump B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; gradient 5–45% B in 60 min). Fractions containing the expected mass as confirmed by mass spectrophotometry were combined and lyophilized. The dry powder of the spin-labeled peptide was re-dissolved in 0.5 ml of Me2SO and 0.2 mmol of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5,4,0)undec-7-ene. Complete removal of Fmoc was obtained in 5 min. The peptides in Me2SO were purified using HPLC under the same conditions described above. Fractions that contained >95% pure peptide were combined and lyophilized. Six mg (8%) of highly purified peptide were recovered. The measured mass of 1513.34 g/mol agreed with the calculated mass of 1513.5 g/mol.Cloning and Construction of Expression Vectors for Rat Nk1r—For generation of mRNA, cDNA encoding the rat tachykinin 1 receptor (Nk1r) or the fusion protein described below were cloned into the pAMV plasmid, kindly provided by C. Labarca (Henry Lester Lab, Caltech). The cDNA encoding the rat Nk1r was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CACTATAGGCTAGCCTCGCCATGGATAACGTCCTTCC-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-CTTATCATGTCTGCTCGAAGCGAATTCTTA-GGCCAGCATGTTAGAG-3′. These primers introduced NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Following digestion with NcoI and EcoRI, the amplified products were subcloned into the pAMV transcription vector. The gene encoding a chimera between the final residue of the rat Nk1r and the first residue of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) was a kind gift of Dr. M. Hanley (University of California, Davis, CA). The Nk1r-GFP fusion was cloned into the pAMV vector using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The pAMV vector containing either Nk1r or the Nk1r-GFP cDNA was linearized with NotI or FsPI to make templates for transcription. The mRNA for Nk1r and the Nk1r-GFP chimera was made by run-off transcription with the message machine T7 kit (Ambion) using the linearized transcripts described above.Generation of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Nk1r-GFP—A stable, isogenic transfection of the rat Nk1r-GFP chimera in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was achieved using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the Nk1r-GFP gene was subcloned into the pcDNA5/FRT plasmid using NcoI and XhoI. CHO cells (2 × 106) containing a single Flp recombinase target were then transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA5/FRT/Nk1r-GFP and 1 μg of the Flp recombinase expression vector (pOG44) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated overnight in Ham's F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum media. Cells were then split and serially diluted into 100-mm culture dishes in Ham's F-12 media containing, 10% fetal bovine serum, 600 μg/ml hygromycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Ham's Hyg+).CHO cells that had been transfected with the Nk1r-GFP fusion construct were sorted according to fluorescence emission at 505 nm with excitation at 488 nm using a Moflo flow cytometer (Cytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO). Cells were selected for a fluorescence intensity >1 × 103. Selected cells were then passaged and sorted three additional times to exclude a population of non-fluorescing cells. Localization of the fused protein was accomplished using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LS510, Zeiss Instruments) at wavelengths described above. Further verification that cells were expressing the chimeric receptor was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed against GFP (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom).Receptor Binding and SPSL Activation Properties in CHO Cells— Radioligand binding of spin-labeled substance P (SPSL) was measured using a cell line stably expressing the Nk1r (15Raddatz R. Crankshaw C.L. Snider R.M. Krause J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Competition binding assays were performed with Bolton-Hunter 125I-substance P (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a concentration of 50 pm. The SPSL was added at increasing concentrations, from 100 pm to 1 μm, to compete with the radiolabeled substance P (SP). To reach equilibrium, CHO cells expressing Nk1r (100,000 cells/well) were incubated in a pre-wetted Millipore Multiscreen 96-well BV filtration plate with both radiolabeled and SPSL at 4 °C for 2 h. Peptides and cells were prepared in Tris-buffered saline binding buffer: 50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). Following incubation, cells were filtered and washed using a Millipore vacuum manifold. Filters were punched from filtration plate and analyzed using a Packard Cobra II series auto-γ counter (Meriden, CT) to determine counts per min.Nonspecific binding was specified as the counts obtained with 1 μm unlabeled substance P in the presence of radiolabeled SP. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from the original counts/min measurements. To account for variation between experiments we normalized the data by calculating B/Bo for each peptide, where B is the counts/min of 125I-SP specifically bound in the presence of non-radioactive SP and Bo is the counts/min of 125I-SP specifically bound in the presence of 100 pm SP or the SPSL analogue. The data are plotted as a function of competitor concentration versus B/Bo. Sigmoidal (Hill, 3 parameter) regression was then performed for the native and spin-labeled ligand to determine the IC50 values, the concentration required to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled SP by 50%. All graphs were plotted using Sigma Plot software (Jandel Scientific).To determine the number of receptors expressed in each cell, saturation studies were carried out on live cells stably expressing the NK1r-GFP fusion protein. In a pre-wetted 96-well filter plate, cells (25,000 per well) were incubated in triplicate for each concentration in a range of 0.1–16 nm125I-SP for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline, individual filters were punched, and radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding 10 μm native ligand to each concentration of SPSL, and subtracted from the sample readings. B max and the Kd values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Each concentration was carried out in triplicate.The ability of SP and SPSL to activate the Nk1r was examined by measuring increases in intracellular Ca2+. CHO cells stably transfected with the cDNA of the rat Nk1r were obtained from James E. Krause (Neurogen Corporation, Branford, CT) and maintained as previously described (15Raddatz R. Crankshaw C.L. Snider R.M. Krause J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These CHO cells were cultured into Falcon 96-well plates and loaded with Fluo 3-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a Ca2+ indicator dye, with 0.1% pluronic F-127 (Texas Fluorescence Labs, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C in an extracellular solution containing: 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.3 mm CaCl2, and 2.5 mm probenecid. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations were measured using a FluoSTAR fluorescent plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC) by measuring the fluorescence emission at 520 nm and excitation at 480 nm.Dose-response curves were obtained by measuring the Ca2+ responses produced by adding various concentrations (1 pm, 100 pm, 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 μm) of SP and SPSL. Ionomycin (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 10 μm at the end of each experiment to normalize between experiments. Ca2+ responses were measured by subtracting the peak of each response from the baseline. Responses are expressed as a fraction of the ionomycin response. The experiment was performed 3 times providing a sample number of at least 10 for each concentration.Activation Properties of SPSL in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were isolated from mature female Xenopus laevis frogs by ovarectomy, and washed with oocyte Ringer's (OR2) solution containing 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) without Ca2+. The follicular layer was removed by gently rotating the oocytes at room temperature in a Ca2+-free OR2 supplemented with 2 mg/ml collagenase type IA for 60–80 min. The oocytes were then rinsed with OR2 until the rinse was clear. Stage VI oocytes were manually sorted under a microscope from the smaller oocytes, transferred to a modified L15 media (50% Leibovitz's L15 media (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.25% chick ovalbumin, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and allowed to recover for 18 h at 17 °C. Following recovery, 25 ng of Nk1r or Nk1r-GFP mRNA in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) were injected into the vegetal pole of the oocyte with a glass pulled pipette (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) using a picospritzer pressure device (General Valve Co., Houston, TX) at a concentration of 0.25 ng/nl. Oocytes were incubated for 24–48 h prior to assaying for receptor activation.For receptor activation analysis, oocytes were placed in a small perfusion chamber and held at –60 mV using a two-electrode voltage clamp instrument (Dagan model TEV-200, Minneapolis, MN). Glass electrodes (Sutter Instruments) were pulled with 2.5–5 MΩ resistance. After insertion of the electrodes the oocytes were allowed to heal until the transmembrane current stabilized. Oocytes were perfused with either 100 nm SP or SPSL for 20–40 s.EPR Measurements with Live Cells—CHO cells expressing either the Nk1r or the Nk1r-GFP chimera as well cells not expressing the receptor were cultured to 100% confluency in Ham's Hyg+ media. For each assay, 2 × 106 cells were rinsed with binding buffer A (phosphatebuffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin), centrifuged for 5 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of BBA containing 1 μm SPSL. The cells were gently rocked at 4 °C for 2 h, rinsed with 1 ml of BBA, and resuspended in 20 μl of BBA. For chase experiments, the rinsed cells were resuspended in 20 μl of BBA containing 1 μm SP and allowed to incubate for 50 min at 4 °C. Then, 9 μl of the cells suspension were loaded into glass capillaries for each sample. EPR measurements were performed using a JEOL X-band spectrophotometer fitted with a loop gap resonator (16Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar, 17Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All scans were performed at 4 °C. Spectra were obtained by a single 120-s scan over 100 gauss at a microwave power of 2 mW, a receiver gain of 500, and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of the individual spectrum. For power saturation studies, cells were loaded into gas permeable capillaries and measurements were carried out as described (18Altenbach C. Flitsch S.L. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7806-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Hernandez-Borrell J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15055-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For power saturation data, spectra were obtained in the presence of nitrogen, oxygen (equilibrated air), or 20 mm chromium oxalate (K3CrO3). Accessibility parameters were calculated from the spectra generated from the power saturation studies as described (20Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D. Khorana H. Hubbell W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).To estimate the number of surface receptors by EPR, the cells containing bound SPSL were maintained at 4 °C and then chased with 1 μm SP as described above. The chased signal was then double-integrated and the integrated intensity compared with the intensity of a known SPSL concentration. The number of receptors was calculated for the moles of chased peptide per μl, for a determined cell density.For endocytosis rates, SPSL was bound to cells as described above, resuspended to a cell density of 3.3 × 106 cells/ml, and then split into two separate samples and placed on ice. These samples were then incubated at either 37 or 4 °C. At specific time points, 0.5-ml aliquots were placed on ice, centrifuged for 30 s at 800 × g, and re-suspended to a final volume of 6.5 μl. The cell suspension was loaded into glass capillary sealed at one end and centrifuged for 1 min at 800 × g, and the EPR spectrum were acquired as described above for live cells. For controls against nonspecific reduction, SPSL was incubated at 37 °C with the non-transfected cells for the indicated times and the spin intensity was measured by EPR. Because exposure of cells to 1 μm staurosporine decreased the viability of cells as measured following EPR analysis, this control was also carried out in the presence of this agent to assess the possible contribution of nonspecific reduction because of increased cytoplasmic leakage. Cell viability for all samples after EPR recordings was determined by trypan blue staining.Radioligand Binding to Isolated Membranes—Membranes were prepared from CHO cells stably expressing the Nk1-GFPr. Briefly, 3.5 × 107 cells from five 100-mm cell culture plates were rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were then harvested by scraping in 15 ml of a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were then lysed using a 15-ml glass tight douncer with 100 strokes or until no intact cells remained as assessed by conventional light microscopy. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100× protease inhibitor) at a protein concentration of 1–5 mg/ml and stored at –80 °C until further use. For the binding assay, the membrane pellets were diluted into binding buffer (storage buffer with 0.04 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100 mm NaCl) to a final protein concentration of 5 μg/ml for each 200-μl binding reaction or 1 μg of membrane protein used for each sample. Binding reactions were carried out using a Millipore 96-well 0.22-μm GV-Durapore membrane plate. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then chilled to 4 °C before filtering. Samples were then rapidly filtered by vacuum filtration (Millipore vacuum manifold) followed by three rinses with 100 μl of ice-cold rinse buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA). Filters were punched and counted as described above for live cell binding. All binding reactions contained concentrations of [3H]SP from 0.1 to 20 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined by including 1 μm SP in the incubation.Binding of SPSL to CHO Membranes—Membrane preparations were made from ∼108 CHO cells expressing the Nk1r-GFP chimera as described above for saturation binding studies. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer at a protein concentration of 3.5 mg/ml. The membrane fractions were then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of 1 μm SPSL. The fractions were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, washed by resuspending in 1 ml of binding buffer, re-centrifuged, and then resuspended in binding buffer to a protein concentration of 70 mg/ml. For each sample, 5 μl of membrane suspension was then loaded into a glass capillary and analyzed as described above for the live cells but at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was examined using membrane preparations isolated from CHO cells lacking the Nk1 receptor. Mixtures of CHO membranes and SPSL were also incubated as described above in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm Gpp(NH)p. Power saturation of SPSL bound to membranes was obtained as described above for the live cells. The rotational correlation time (τR) was estimated according to the method of Ref. 21Knowles P.F.

John Wiley & Sons, London1976Google Scholar for a weakly immobilized spin label. τR=6.5×10-10ΔH0[(h0/h-1)12-1](Eq. 1) RESULTSSynthesis of a Spin-labeled Substance P Analogue—The scheme for synthesizing SPSL is shown in Fig. 1A. Initial efforts were made to derivatize the ϵ-amino group of Lys-3 shown Fig. 1A (I, bold) while the peptide was bound to the resin via its amino terminus. This solid phase derivatization would have made for a facile labeling step because separation from unreacted label (Fig. 1A, compound II) could be performed while the peptide remained covalently attached to the resin. Unfortunately, as determined by mass spectroscopy, the final trifluoroacetic acid cleavage step of the NH2-terminal amine led to decomposition of the spin label. A similar decomposition of the TOAC spin label was reported (22Marchetto R. Schreier S. Nakaie C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11042-11043Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consequently, a synthetic strategy was employed as shown in Fig. 1A, where the peptide was labeled following cleavage from the resin. Care was taken to ensure the peptide reaction with the spin label was at pH 7.5, because the Fmoc group protecting the terminal amine is readily removed under moderately basic conditions (23Bodanskzky M. Deshmane S.S. Martinez J. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 44Google Scholar, 24Atherton E. Bury C. Sheppard R.C. Williams B.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1979; 32: 3041-3042Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the pKa of the ϵ-amino group is 10.55, the reaction is not very efficient, resulting in a yield of 8% (Fig. 1B). However, the total amount of purified labeled peptide (6 mg) is more than sufficient for subsequent biochemical and spectroscopic studies. Whereas careful pH selection has been used to preferentially label the ϵ-amine group of lysine over the amino terminus, the separation of mixed-labeled products is technically more difficult than the separation of unreacted peptide from a single-derivatized form (12Turcatti G. Zoffmann S. Lowe 3rd, J.A. Drozda S.E. Chassaing G. Schwartz T.W. Chollet A. J. Biol.
