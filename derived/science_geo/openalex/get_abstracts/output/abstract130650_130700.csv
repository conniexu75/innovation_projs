https://openalex.org/W1972038609,"The crystal structure of a soluble, catalytically active form of adenylyl cyclase in a complex with its stimulatory heterotrimeric G protein α subunit (G s α ) and forskolin was determined to a resolution of 2.3 angstroms. When P-site inhibitors were soaked into native crystals of the complex, the active site of adenylyl cyclase was located and structural elements important for substrate recognition and catalysis were identified. On the basis of these and other structures, a molecular mechanism is proposed for the activation of adenylyl cyclase by G s α ."

https://openalex.org/W2322386893,"Overexpression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leads to proliferation of human malignant astrocytoma cells. Although oncogenic mutations affecting Ras are not prevalent in human malignant astrocytomas, we have investigated whether levels of activated Ras.GTP might be elevated in these tumors secondary to the mitogenic signals originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases. In support of this hypothesis high levels of Ras.GTP, similar to those found in oncogenic Ras transformed fibroblasts, were present in four established human malignant astrocytoma cell lines which express PDGFRs and EGFR, and 20 operative malignant astrocytoma specimens. Stimulation of PDGFR's and EGFR's induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein and its association with Grb2, suggesting a mechanism by which Ras may be activated in human malignant astrocytoma cells. Furthermore, blocking Ras activation by expression of the Ha-Ras-Asn17 dominant-negative mutant, or by farnesyl transferase inhibitors, decreased in vitro proliferation of the human astrocytoma cell lines. These results support the hypothesis that proliferative signals from receptor tyrosine kinases expressed by human malignant astrocytoma cells utilize the Ras mitogenic pathway. Pharmacological inhibitors of the Ras pathway may therefore be of therapeutic value in these presently terminal tumors."

Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role of integrin cytoplasmic domains in regulating Fn matrix assembly, implying that intracellular integrin-binding proteins may be involved in controlling extracellular Fn matrix assembly. We report here that overexpression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a newly identified serine/threonine kinase that binds to the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain, dramatically stimulated Fn matrix assembly in epithelial cells. The integrin-linked kinase activity is involved in transducing signals leading to the up-regulation of Fn matrix assembly, as overexpression of a kinase-inactive ILK mutant failed to enhance the matrix assembly. Moreover, the increase in Fn matrix assembly induced by ILK overexpression was accompanied by a substantial reduction in the cellular E-cadherin. Finally, we show that ILK-overexpressing epithelial cells readily formed tumors in nude mice, despite forming an extensive Fn matrix. These results identify ILK as an important regulator of pericellular Fn matrix assembly, and suggest a novel critical role of this integrin-linked kinase in cell growth, cell survival, and tumorigenesis.

Cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions play critical roles during many physiological and pathological processes including morphogenesis and tumorigenesis. Many of the cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions are mediated by cell adhesion molecules that are members of the integrin and cadherin families. Integrins are αβ heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that interact with extracellular (or other cell surface) molecules and cytoplasmic molecules, including cytoskeletal and catalytic signaling proteins (1Akiyama S.K.

Recent studies indicate that integrins not only receive signals from extracellular matrix but also actively participate in the assembly of extracellular matrix (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

The assembly of Fn matrix is a highly regulated cellular process in which soluble, dimeric Fn molecules are assembled into an insoluble, fibrillar pericellular matrix (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 6Mosher D.F. Sottile J. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 183-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A common feature of many oncogenically transformed cells is that they lose the ability of assembling a Fn matrix (13Hynes R.O. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, exceptions to the rule of neoplastic cells lacking Fn matrix clearly exist (9Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 14Ruoslahti E. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 87-97PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Fn matrix assembly is dramatically enhanced in hairy cell leukemia cells (15Burthem J. Cawley J.C. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1994; 14: 19-22PubMed Google Scholar, 16Burthem J. Cawley J.C. Blood. 1994; 83: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although it is true that Fn matrix assembly is altered in most neoplastic cells, the specific phenotype (inhibition or stimulation of Fn matrix assembly) is probably determined by the origin of the neoplastic cells and the initial target of the oncogenic transformation. Because Fn matrix has a major impact on cell adhesion, migration, cell growth, and cell differentiation (1Akiyama S.K. Nagata K. Yamada K.M. Biochim. Biophy.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), an understanding of the molecular mechanism by which cells control Fn matrix assembly may provide important information on tumorigenicity and may lead to new ways of controlling tumor growth. A number of studies have established that binding of Fn by specific integrins is critical in initiating Fn matrix assembly. Fn fragments containing the RGD-containing integrin binding site or antibodies recognizing the integrin binding site inhibited Fn matrix assembly in cultured cells and developing amphibian embryos (8Wu C.

Commun. 1996; 4: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, antibodies to α5β1 integrin reduced the deposition of Fn into extracellular matrix by fibroblasts (25Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 26Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2529-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The participation of Fn-binding integrins in Fn matrix assembly has been extensively studied in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Overexpressing α5β1 in CHO cells with endogenous α5β1 increased Fn deposition in extracellular matrix (28Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), whereas CHO B2 cells that are deficient in α5 (29Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) did not assemble plasma Fn into the extracellular matrix (30Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstituting α5β1 integrin expression by transfecting the CHO B2 cells with a full-length cDNA encoding the human α5 chain completely restored fibrillar Fn matrix assembly (30Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies established an important role of α5β1 integrin in supporting Fn matrix assembly by CHO cells. In addition to α5β1integrin, members of the β3 integrins (αIIbβ3 and αvβ3) also initiate Fn matrix assembly (8Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,24Wu C. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. McDonald J.A. Cell Adhes.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), although some of the other Fn-binding integrins such as α4β1 (32Wu C. Fields A.J. Kapteijn B.A. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 821-829PubMed Google Scholar) or αvβ1 (33Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) do not. The ability of cells to use multiple integrins to support Fn matrix assembly provides the cells with a versatile mechanism for control of Fn matrix assembly. It may also explain why certain cells, such as fibroblastic cells derived from α5 integrin null mutant embryos, assemble a Fn matrix in the absence of α5β1 (34Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary role of α5β1 in Fn matrix assembly appears to involve initiating the assembly, as Fn mutants lacking the α5β1 integrin binding site could not be assembled into Fn matrix unless in the presence of native Fn (35Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,36Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We recently found that activation of specific Fn-binding integrins, either by mutations at the integrin cytoplasmic domains or using activating antibodies, dramatically stimulated Fn matrix assembly (8Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,24Wu C. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. McDonald J.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the ability of a cell to assemble a Fn matrix is not only controlled by the types of integrins it expresses but also regulated by the Fn binding activity of the integrins. Previous studies have demonstrated that the extracellular ligand binding affinity of integrins can be controlled from within the cells (inside-out signaling) (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar, 5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 38Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 39O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 40Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active R-Ras in CHO cells bearing αIIbβ3integrin activated the integrin and resulted in increased Fn matrix assembly (37Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), whereas activation of Raf-1, probably via the extracellular signal-related kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, suppresses integrin activation and Fn matrix assembly (72Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, the molecular events that are immediately upstream of the integrins in the cellular control of Fn matrix assembly were not understood. A very attractive model is that cells control integrin activity and Fn matrix assembly via interactions of cytoplasmic regulatory proteins with integrin cytoplasmic domains. One promising candidate that may be involved in regulating Fn matrix assembly is integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a newly identified ankyrin-repeat containing serine/threonine kinase (41Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). ILK binds to the β cytoplasmic domains of both β1 and β3 integrins, and phosphorylates the β1cytoplasmic domain in vitro (41Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). We report here that overexpression of ILK in epithelial cells dramatically stimulated integrin-mediated Fn matrix assembly, down-regulated E-cadherin, and induced tumor formation in vivo. Our results identify ILK as an important regulator of pericellular Fn matrix assembly, and suggest a critical role for this integrin-linked kinase in cell-cell interactions and tumorigenesis.

The cellular levels of ILK and E-cadherin were determined by immunoblot using an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-ILK antibody 91–4 (41Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L.

Fn matrix assembly was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining of cell monolayers (8Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in the α-MEM medium containing 5% FBS and other additives as specified in each experiment. Cells were plated in 12-well HTCR slides (Cel-Line, Inc., Newfield, NJ; 50 μl/well) at a final density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in a 37 °C incubator under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and staining with the polyclonal rabbit anti-Fn antibody MC54 (20 μg/ml) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA; 2.5 μg/ml). Stained cell monolayers were observed using a Nikon FXA epifluorescence microscope, and representative fields were photographed using Kodak T-Max 400 or Ektachrome 1600 direct positive slide film. To obtain representative images, exposure times for different experimental conditions were fixed, using the positive,e.g. matrix-forming cells, as the index exposure length. In double staining experiments, 3.7% paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies from different species as specified in each experiment. After rinsing, the bound primary antibodies were detected with species-specific Cy3- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Stained cell monolayers were observed using a Nikon FXA epifluorescence microscope equipped with Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. For inhibition studies, ILK13-A4a cells that overexpress ILK were plated in 12-well HTCR slides in the α-MEM medium containing 5% FBS and other additives as specified (2 μm anti-29-kDa Fn fragment antibody, 2 μm rabbit control IgG, or 4.2 μm of one of the following Fn fragments: 110-kDa RGD-containing integrin-binding fragment of Fn, 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of Fn, or 60-kDa gelatin-binding fragment of Fn). The cells were cultured for 4 h, and then fixed and stained with the polyclonal rabbit anti-Fn antibody and the Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies as described above. To isolate and biochemically characterize extracellular matrix Fn, we cultured the cells in 100-mm tissue culture plates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) in α-MEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 3.6 mg/ml glucose, 10 μg/ml insulin, and other additives as specified in each experiment for two days. The cell monolayers were then washed three times with PBS containing 1 mm AEBSF and harvested with a cell scraper. The extracellular matrix fraction was isolated by sequential extraction of the cells with: 1) 3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 mm AEBSF; 2) 100 μg/ml DNase I in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm AEBSF; and 3) 2% deoxycholate in Tris, pH 8.8, 1 mm AEBSF (30Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fn in the deoxycholate-insoluble extracellular matrix fraction was analyzed by immunoblot with polyclonal rabbit anti-Fn antibody MC54 and an ECL detection kit as described previously (32Wu C. Fields A.J. Kapteijn B.A. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 821-829PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Fn in the matrix fractions was quantified by ELISA. In this assay, proteins in the matrix fractions derived from same number of cells were solubilized with 2% SDS in TBS (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and diluted 1:80 with 100 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.2) before adding to wells (100 μl of matrix proteins corresponding to 31 μg of cellular proteins) of polystyrene 96-well ELISA plates (Corning). After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, the remaining protein binding sites were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in 100 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.2) at 37 °C for 2 h. The wells were rinsed three times with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS, followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml of anti-Fn rabbit IgG (MC54) in TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 90 min. At the end of incubation, the wells were rinsed four times with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS. The wells were then incubated with an alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (60 ng/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch). After rinsing four times with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS and twice with TBS, bound alkaline phosphate conjugate was detected colorimetrically withp-nitrophenyl phosphate at 405 nm using an ELISA microplate reader. The amounts of Fn were calculated from theA 405 nm values based on a standard curve generated using purified bovine plasma Fn under identical experimental condition. The standard curve was linear within the range used. ILK13-A1a3 cells that overexpress ILK (3 × 105/well) and Ras-37 cells that overexpress Ha-RasVal-12 (2 × 103/well) were plated in 35-mm wells, in 0.3% agarose and assayed for colony growth after 3 weeks as described (41Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Fn fragments were incorporated in the agar at the final concentrations indicated. IEC-18, ILK14, or ILK13 cells were resuspended in PBS and inoculated subcutaneously into athymic nude mice (107/mouse). Six mice were inoculated per cell line. In situ tumor formation was assessed after 3 weeks. ILK13-Ala3 and ILK14-A2C3 cells growing in monolayer culture were harvested using 5 mm EDTA/PBS (pH 7.6), and the cells were washed twice in PBS. Cells were resuspended in serum-free medium and then transferred to plain tissue culture plates (Nunc) or tissue culture plates precoated with 10 μg/ml Fn (Life Technologies, Inc.) or maintained in suspension. For the suspension control cells were kept in a 50-ml rocker tube. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cell monolayer (for the adherent controls) and cell pellet (for the suspension controls) were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 unit/ml aprotonin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). FAK was immunoprecipitated from 400–500 μg of total cell extract using 4 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-p125FAK antibody and protein A-agarose conjugate (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.). Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and run on a 7.5% gel. Resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) and membrane blocked in 5% BSA (Sigma) in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4). Tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK was detected using the RC20H recombinant antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, Transduction) and ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). To determine whether ILK plays a role in regulation of Fn matrix assembly, we analyzed the ability of cells expressing different levels of ILK to assemble a Fn matrix. IEC-18 rat intestinal epithelial cells assembled a small amount of Fn matrix consisting of mostly short fibrils (Fig.1 A). ILK13-A1a3 cells, which were isolated from the IEC-18 cells stably transfected with a pRC/CMV expression vector containing full-length ILK coding sequence, express a much higher level of ILK than the parental IEC-18 cells (41Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The ILK-overexpressing ILK13-A1a3 cells assembled an extensive Fn matrix resembling that formed by fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B), whereas control transfectants (ILK14-A2C3), which express a level of ILK similar to that expressed by the parental IEC-18 cells, assembled a small amount of Fn matrix that is indistinguishable from that of the IEC-18 cells fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C). To exclude the possibility that the observed effect depends on a specific clone, we analyzed 10 additional cell lines that were independently isolated from the cells transfected with the pRC/CMV-ILK expression vector (ILK13-A4a, A1d11, A4c, A4c3, and A4i)"
https://openalex.org/W2043761739,"Intramolecular SH2 and SH3 interactions mediate enzymatic repression of the Src kinases. One mechanism of activation is disruption of these interactions by the formation of higher affinity SH2 and SH3 interactions with specific ligands. We show that a consensus Src SH3-binding site residing upstream of the Src SH2-binding site in FAK can function as a ligand for the Src SH3 domain. Surface plasmon resonance experiments indicate that a FAK peptide containing both the Src SH2- and SH3-binding sites exhibits increased affinity for Src. Furthermore, the presence of both sites <i>in vitro</i> more potently activates c-Src. A FAK mutant (FAK<sup>Pro-2</sup>) with substitutions destroying the SH3-binding site shows reduced binding to Src <i>in vivo</i>. This mutation also reduces Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation on the mutant itself and downstream substrates, such as paxillin. These observations suggest that an SH3-mediated interaction between Src-like kinases and FAK may be important for complex formation and downstream signaling <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2068290146,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a putative virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that inhibits monocyte functions, and this may involve antagonism of cell signaling pathways. The effects of LAM on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were examined. LAM promoted tyrosine dephosphorylation of multiple cell proteins and attenuated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. To examine whether these effects of LAM could be related to activation of a phosphatase, fractions from LAM-treated cells were analyzed for dephosphorylation of para-nitrophenol phosphate. The data show that LAM induced increased phosphatase activity associated with the membrane fraction. The Src homology 2 containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is important for signal termination and was examined as a potential target of LAM. Exposure of cells to LAM brought about (i) an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1, and (ii) translocation of the phosphatase to the membrane. Phosphatase assay of SHP-1 immunoprecipitated from LAM-treated cells, using phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase as substrate, indicated that LAM promoted increased activity of SHP-1 in vivo. LAM also activated SHP-1 directly in vitro. Exposure of cells to LAM also attenuated the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-12, and major histocompatibility class II molecules.

It has been estimated that there are approximately eight million new cases and three million deaths annually, worldwide, from tuberculosis (1Bloom B.R. Murray C.J.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). It is also believed that the causative agent of this disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, infects one-third of the world's population (2Kaufmann S.H.E. van Embden J.D.A. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 2-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis infects and resides exclusively within mononuclear phagocytes, and its ability to evade being killed within phagocytic cells has likely contributed to its longevity as a highly successful pathogen. Although many other microbes are killed when ingested by phagocytes, M. tuberculosis prevents its destruction by impairing critical macrophage functional responses (3Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. J. Exp.

Looker D.L. Vatter A.E. Crowle A.J. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of critical interest is the identity of the virulence factors responsible for macrophage deactivation. One potential candidate is the mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid, lipoarabinomannan (LAM). LAM is complex molecule consisting of a phosphatidylinositol moiety that anchors a large mannose core to the mycobacterial cell wall (14Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hunter S.W. Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mannose core contains multiple branched, arabinofuranosyl side chains. Comparative analyses of LAMs from different species of mycobacteria have shown that the non-reducing termini of the arabinofuranosyl side chains are differentially modified. For example,M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae modify the termini with mannose residues thereby yielding “man-LAM,” whereas rapidly growing mycobacterial species use inositolphosphates thereby giving rise to “ara-LAM” (16Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 12380-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is thought that these contrasting modifications are responsible for the marked differences in the biological activities of man-LAM and ara-LAM (16Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 12380-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Chatterjee D. Roberts A.D. Lowell K. Brennan P.J. Orme I.M. Infect.

Studies have shown that, in comparison to man-LAM, ara-LAM is a potent inducer of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukins-1, -6, and -10 (17Chatterjee D. Roberts A.D. Lowell K. Brennan P.J. Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Zhang Y. Doerfler M. Lee T.C. Guillemin B. Rom W.N. J. Clin.

Immun. 1996; 64: 399-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, both LAMs appear to be equipotent with respect to induction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (22Dahl K.E. Shiratsuchi H. Hamilton B.D. Ellner J.J. Toossi Z. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 399-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the early response genes, c-fos, KC,iNOS, and JE are induced by ara-LAM but not by man-LAM (18Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar, 23Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Liew F.V. Blackwell J.M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that M. tuberculosis has evolved mechanisms to “mask” man-LAM such that it has a diminished capacity to induce cytokines and other monocyte gene products that may be detrimental to the organism's survival. Other studies have revealed that LAM, derived from M. tuberculosis, actively inhibits properties of both macrophages and T cells. In macrophages for example, LAM is able to block many actions of IFN-γ, including tumor cell killing (24Sibley L.D. Adams L.B. Krahenbuhl J.L. Clin. Exp.

Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these actions of LAM may be related to inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) to scavenging of cytotoxic oxygen free radicals, or to both (26Chan J. Fan X. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1755-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T cells, LAM has been shown to suppress antigen-driven proliferation of a CD4+ T cell clone (27Moreno C. Melhert A. Lamb J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 74: 206-210Google Scholar). It has also been shown to inhibit the accumulation of mRNA for interleukins-2 and -3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol esters (28Chujor C.S. Kuhn B. Schwerer B. Bernheimer H. Levis W.R. Bevec D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This study examined the hypothesis that the inhibitory effects of LAM on mononuclear phagocytes may be related to altered cell signaling. The results show that LAM promotes tyrosine dephosphorylation of multiple proteins including MAPK. In the latter instance, this leads to impaired activation of the enzyme. These effects of LAM may be explained by the action of the Src homology 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), a tyrosine phosphatase known to be important for attenuating activation signals (29Jiao H.

In all experiments, unless otherwise indicated, the LAM (mannose capped) used was derived from the virulent, erdman strain of M. tuberculosis (32Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J.

Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositolmannoside is similar to lipomannan except that the mannan core contains fewer mannose residues (34Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both of the latter were derived from the virulent H37rv strain of M. tuberculosis. Fractions of peripheral blood enriched in white blood cells were obtained from the Cell Separator Unit (Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center). Monocytes were enriched (85–95% pure) by adherence as described previously (35Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of adherent cells were treated with either LAM, LPS, or both, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C prior to analysis. Cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells on ice (20 min) in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 100 nm microcystin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad ProteinDC and bovine serum albumin as standard. Monocyte cell lines were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). For acute studies, cells were rendered quiescent by culture in RPMI without FCS for 12–16 h at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. For chronic studies, log phase cells were washed in Hanks' solution and resuspended in RPMI without FCS, followed by the addition of mycobacterial cell wall components. Following treatments, cells were lysed immediately, and detergent-soluble material was frozen at −70 °C until further analysis. Following incubation of THP-1wt cells with either LAM or LPS, cells were fractionated essentially as described previously (36Knutson K.L. Hoenig M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, monocytes were scraped into hypotonic fractionation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nmmicrocystin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C while rotating. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate cytosolic from particulate fractions. The resulting pellets were extracted in fractionation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) to separate detergent-insoluble and -soluble material. The resulting supernatant was taken to represent a membrane fraction. Twenty micrograms of cytosolic and membrane fractions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-SHP-1 or anti-MAPK-ct antibodies. THP-1 cells were seeded at a density of 105 per cm2 and allowed to adhere and differentiate in the presence of PMA (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and adherent monolayers were replenished with culture medium. LAM or LPS was added to the cells for an additional 24 h followed by treatment with IFN-γ for 24 h more. To measure cell surface expression of HLA-DR, control and treated cells were incubated with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (clone HL38, Catlag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 30 min and then washed twice and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab)′2 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 30 min. All staining and washing procedures were performed at 4 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% NaN3 and 1% FCS. To control for cell viability, cells were incubated with propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml in staining buffer) for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in staining buffer. Fluorescence was analyzed using a Coulter Elite flow cytometer (Hialeah, FL). Viable cells were identified by exclusion of propidium iodide. Relative fluorescence intensities of 5000 cells were recorded as single-parameter histograms (log scale, 1024 channels, 4 log decades), and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated for each histogram. Results are expressed as MFI index which corresponds to the ratio: MFI of cells incubated with specific antibody/MFI of cells incubated with irrelevant isotype-matched IgG. Whole cell lysates, prepared in lysis buffer, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10), anti-SHP-1, or anti-MAPK-ct by previously described methods (37Nandan D. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated by incubating 0.5–1.5 mg of lysate with anti-SHP-1 for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose for an additional 2 h. To assess the amount of individual proteins immunoprecipitated in each sample, after detection of bound 4G10 Ab, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-SHP-1 or anti-MAPK-ct and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence as described (37Nandan D. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometry was performed using a Howtek Scanner and Quantity One software (PDI Bioscience, Aurora, Ontario, Canada). THP-1wt cells were preincubated with either LAM or LPS for 16–20 h, followed by the addition of 1 μg/ml LPS for 2 h. RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of RNA were subjected to an RNase protection assay, essentially as described previously (38Hobbs M. Weigle W.O. Noonan D.J. Torbett B.E. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J. Cardenas G.J. Ernst D.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3602-3614PubMed Google Scholar). Two cytokine-specific riboprobe template sets were tested, HL-14 and HL-21. These were assembled from EcoRI-linearized and purified subclones. The HL-14 template set synthesized riboprobes specific for interleukins-1α, -1β, -6, -10, TNF-β, TNFα, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TGF-β1, and rpL32. The HL-21 template set synthesized riboprobes specific for interleukins-2, -4, -5, -12 (p40 and p35), and -13, CD4, CD8, and rpL32. The respective nucleotide sequences and GenBank Accession numbers of the individual clones were previously described. 3Rochford, R., Cannon, M. J., Sabbe, R. E., Adusimilli, K., Picchio, G., Glynn, J. M., Nonnan, D. J., Mosier, D. E., and Hobbs, M., Viral Immunol., in press. Assays for protein tyrosine phosphatase activity were carried out using either para-nitrophenol phosphate (pNPP) or phosphorylated MAPK-1-GST as substrates. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysate protein as described above. For MAPK-1-GST dephosphorylation, the immunoprecipitates were further washed three times in phosphatase assay buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended in phosphatase assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). MAPK-1-GST coupled to glutathione-agarose was autophosphorylated in buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT for 30 min at 30 °C. The agarose beads were washed two times in autophosphorylation buffer without ATP and two times in phosphatase buffer without DTT. After resuspension in phosphatase assay buffer containing 1 mm DTT, the MAPK-1-GST beads were incubated with the SHP-1 immunoprecipitates for 1 h at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Blots were then stripped and reprobed with either anti-MAPK-1-GST or anti-SHP-1 to confirm equal loading of substrates and phosphatase enzyme. When pNPP was used as a substrate, the SHP-1 immunoprecipitates were washed further in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA and, 10 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitates were ultimately resuspended in the same buffer containing 2 mmpNPP followed by an incubation for 4 h at 30 °C. Absorbances of the samples were read at 405 nm as described previously (39Brumell J.H. Chan C.K. Butler J. Borregaard N. Siminovitch K.A. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activity is expressed as a percent of control. Phosphatase activity in cytosolic and membrane fractions was measured by incubating 25–50 μg of each fraction from control or treated cells in a buffer containing 50 mm imidazole Cl, pH 7.2, 1.0 mmEDTA, and 16 mm pNPP, for 30 min at 30 °C. Absorbances of the samples were measured as described above and expressed as percent of control optical density. To examine whether LAM modulates activation of MAPK, THP-1wt cells were preincubated with LAM for 16 h followed by the addition of PMA (100 nm) for 15 min. PMA reproducibly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 42-kDa protein which is positioned exactly with that of p42 MAPK2 (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation of this band was not evident in cells treated with either 0.1% serum (lane 1) or LAM alone (lane 3). On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK2, in response to PMA, was significantly attenuated in cells preincubated with LAM. Two other parameters of MAPK activation were also assessed. In response to PMA and secondary to the activation of MAPK kinase, MAPK becomes tyrosine-, serine-, and threonine-phosphorylated leading to its activation (40Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rossomando A. Wu J. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5221-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Adams P.D. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These phosphorylations are associated with retarded mobility (bandshifting) of the kinases as assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, bandshifting in response to PMA was clearly observed for both the p42 MAPK2 and p44 MAPK1 isoforms. Of particular interest was the finding that, although LAM markedly attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK2, this did not impair the bandshifting otherwise expected following treatment with PMA. Based on this finding, it would appear that bandshifting is a function of serine/threonine phosphorylations and that LAM selectively affects tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK. Of interest, while bandshifting was observed for p44 MAPK1, PMA was unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of this isoform, consistent with a previous report of the actions of PMA on p44 MAPK1 and p42 MAPK2 (43Zhang C. Hirasawa N. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4968-4975PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK activity was also assessed with myelin basic protein using an in-gel assay (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with previous reports (44Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar) that tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for activation of MAPK, it was found that treatment of cells with LAM inhibited the increased myelin basic protein phosphotransferase activity otherwise observed with PMA stimulation of (non-LAM-treated) control cells. To determine whether other tyrosine phosphorylation events are regulated by LAM, the effects of LAM on LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was assessed in normal human monocytes (Fig. 2). As expected, LPS treatment induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple monocyte proteins. Of interest, pretreatment of cells with LAM (2 μg/ml) for 16 h abrogated the effects of LPS in a manner similar to that observed with tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK2 induced by PMA. The autoradiogram shown in Fig. 2 A was analyzed by densitometry to identify bands that underwent increased phosphotyrosine labeling in response to LPS and to quantitate the effects of LAM on these events. The results of this analysis (Fig. 2 B) show that LPS induced marked increases in phosphotyrosine content in at least eight proteins. Pretreatment of cells with LAM virtually eliminated all of these increases. In contrast to the marked effects of LPS in phosphotyrosine labeling of certain bands (Fig. 2, Aand B), proteins in the 50–60-kDa range were less affected by LPS. Although the overall results of LAM were to promote tyrosine dephosphorylation, occasionally slight, likely insignificant, increases in tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in response to LAM alone. These changes were not consistently reproducible. In parallel experiments, it was also observed that LAM abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of monocyte proteins induced by IFN-γ (data not shown). When precursors of LAM were examined for thei"
https://openalex.org/W2065952313,"The biological effects of type IIA 14-kDa phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) on 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were studied. sPLA2 induced a release of [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) similar to that elicited by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a messenger acting via a G-protein-coupled receptor and a product of sPLA2 on lipid microvesicles. In contrast, no release of [1-14C]oleate could be detected in cells labeled with this fatty acid. As these findings pointed to a selective mechanism of [3H]AA release, it was hypothesized that sPLA2 could act by a signaling mechanism involving the activation of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), i.e. the type of PLA2 involved in the release of [3H]AA elicited by agonists. In keeping with this view, stimulation of 1321N1 cells with sPLA2 elicited the decrease in electrophoretic mobility that is characteristic of the phosphorylation of cPLA2, as well as activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, c-Jun kinase, and p38 MAP kinase. Incubation with sPLA2 of quiescent 1321N1 cells elicited a mitogenic response as judged from an increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Attempts to correlate the effect of extracellular PLA2 with the generation of LPA were negative. Incubation with pertussis toxin prior to the addition of either sPLA2 or LPA only showed abrogation of the response to LPA, thus suggesting the involvement of pertussis-sensitive Gi-proteins in the case of LPA. Treatments with inhibitors of the catalytic effect of sPLA2 such asp-bromophenacyl bromide and dithiothreitol did not prevent the effect on cPLA2 activation. In contrast, preincubation of 1321N1 cells with the antagonist of the sPLA2 receptorp-aminophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside-bovine serum albumin, blocked cPLA2 activation with a EC50 similar to that described for the inhibition of binding of sPLA2 to its receptor. Moreover, treatment of 1321N1 cells with the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD-98059 inhibited the activation of both cPLA2 and p42 MAP kinase produced by sPLA2. In summary, these data indicate the existence in astrocytoma cells of a signaling pathway triggered by engagement of a sPLA2-binding structure, that produces the release of [3H]AA by activating the MAP kinase cascade and cPLA2, and leads to a mitogenic response after longer periods of incubation.

Phospholipases A2 (phosphatidesn-2-acylhydrolases, EC 3.1.1.4) from mammalian tissues play a role in physiological functions such as defense mechanisms and the production of bioactive lipids (1Dennis E.A.

On the one hand, the 14-kDa type IIA PLA2 (sPLA2) behaves as an acute phase protein whose production is induced in a variety of immunoinflammatory conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and endotoxemia (4Vadas P.

Recent studies have shown the ability of sPLA2 to promote mitogenesis by acting on a cell surface receptor (9Arita H. Hanasaki K. Hanako T. Oda S. Teraoka H. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

A similar histological picture accompanied by inflammatory changes is produced by injection of sPLA2 in the skin of experimental animals (12Pruzanski W.P. Vadas P. Fornasier V. J. Invest.

Inflammation. 1993; 17: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, sPLA2 may initiate cell activation because of its ability to generate the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (14Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournie B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) plays a central role in the release of arachidonic acid (AA) triggered by growth factors and neurotransmitters (15Leslie C.C. Voelker D.R.

Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Since sPLA2is an ectoenzyme that first encounters the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayers, two means of interaction leading to cell signaling should be considered. (i) sPLA2 might interact with a binding structure on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, or (ii) sPLA2 might generate both unesterified fatty acid and lysophospholipid, e.g. lysophosphatidate (LPA) and lysophosphatydylcholine, which could act on signaling either as cofactors for protein kinase C or, in the case of LPA, by acting on specific receptors. This poses as a likely possibility that sPLA2 might ultimately lead to the activation of cPLA2 by eliciting a signaling cascade mimicking the usual transducing mechanism conveyed by the physiological activators of this enzyme. In this connection, it should mentioned that cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 has been suggested in signal transduction events in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages (21Wijkander J.

Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clone 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-98059 was a gift from Dr. Alan R. Saltiel (Parke Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, MI) (36Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580 was a gift from Dr. John C. Lee (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA) (37Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein with amino acids 1–223 of the N-terminal portion of c-Jun protein (a kind gift of Dr. Carmen Caelles, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Madrid, Spain) was expressed in bacteria using a pGEX-2T plasmid (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and purified with glutathione-agarose beads from Sigma. sPLA2 was purified from both plasma of patients with septicemia and culture medium according to the protocol described in Ref. 38Gijón M.A. Pérez C. Méndez E. Sánchez Crespo M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Briefly, heparin-agarose was used to bind sPLA2 from plasma. Fractions showing PLA2 activity in the [1-14C]oleate-labeled Escherichia coli assay were concentrated and loaded into a HiLoad Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Fractions containing PLA2after this step were made in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied into a C1/C8 reverse-phase FPLC column (ProRPC HR 5/2, Pharmacia LKB). Fractions showing PLA2 activity were pooled and evaporated to dryness in a Speed-Vac concentrator. Human recombinant type IIA phospholipase A2 was purified from cultures at superconfluence of line C127 mouse fibroblasts stably transfected with the coding sequence of type IIA PLA2 from human placenta (34Pernas P. Masliah J. Olivier J.L. Salvat C. Bereziat G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out in a total volume of 0.1 ml, according to the procedure of Elsbachet al. (39Elsbach P. Weiss J. Franson R.C. Beckerdite-Quagliata S. Schneider A. Harris L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11000-11009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with ≈5,000 dpm of [1-14C]oleate-labeled autoclaved E. coli of a K12 strain, containing 10–20 nmol of phospholipid, as assessed by the measurement of phospholipid-associated phosphate. The assay medium contained 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The reaction proceeded for 30 min and was stopped by addition of 0.04 ml of ice-cold 2n HCl and 0.02 ml of 10% BSA, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The radioactivity released into the supernatant was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Labeling with [3H]AA was performed in cells in monolayer that had been deprived of fetal calf serum for 16 h to render them quiescent. Labeling with [3H]AA was carried out for 2 h in the presence of 0.3 μCi of [3H]AA/ml. Labeling with 0.3 μCi/ml [1-14C]oleate and 1 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid was carried out under similar conditions but increasing the labeling period to overnight incubation. After labeling, cells were washed at 37 °C four or five times with medium, and finally allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C before addition of agonists or vehicle solution. The release of labeled [3H]AA and [1-14C]oleic acid acid was assessed in 0.2-ml aliquots of culture medium. Production of LPA was assessed from the incorporation of [3H]myristic acid into phosphatidic acid and was separated from the label incorporated in other phospholipid classes by two-dimensional chromatography using a system of solvents consisting of chloroform/methanol/28% ammonium hydroxide (6:4:1; v/v/v) in the first dimension and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (6:8:2:2:1; v/v/v) in the second dimension (40Tokomura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out with triplicate samples. Quiescent 1321N1 cells were treated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h with different agonists in the presence of 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. At the end of this period, the incubation was terminated with three washes with ice-cold 0.1 mMgCl2, and the radioactivity incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction measured. Cell lysates from preconfluent 1321N1 cells were loaded into a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a liquid transfer module from CBS Laboratories. The membranes were blocked with dry milk for 2 h, washed with Tris-buffered saline, and used for immunoblot using a rabbit polyclonal anti-cPLA2. When the purpose of the experiments was the detection of p42 MAP kinase, a semidry transfer system was used and the membrane was incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody. This was followed by incubation with sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and detection with the Amersham ECL system. For detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, the endogenous kinase was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-p38 MAP antibody. The immune complex was recovered using Gammabind G-Sepharose. After washing three times with Nonidet-P-40-buffer and twice with LiCl buffer, the beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase immunoprecipitated was determined by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody. To obtain the substrate for the kinase assay as a GST-c-Jun fusion protein, the procedure of Smith and Corcoran (41Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar) was followed. For this purpose, transformed XL1-blue cells containing a pGEX-2T plasmid encoding residues 1–223 of the N-terminal portion of c-Jun protein were grown in LB/ampicillin medium. The expression of the fusion protein was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. Cells were lysed using a probe sonicator and the fusion protein purified with glutathione-agarose beads. The cytosolic extracts for the kinase assay were obtained from the lysis of 5 × 106 1321N1 cells in 200 μl of a medium containing 25 mm Hepes, 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.7. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted in 600 μl of the above mentioned medium without NaCl, and mixed with 10 μg of GST-c-Jun protein and glutathione-agarose beads. The mixture was incubated under continuous shaking for 3–5 h at 4 °C, and then washed to remove the fraction not associated to the glutathione-agarose beads. The kinase reaction was carried out with 20 mm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a volume of 30 μl. The reaction was diluted in buffer and centrifugated to discard supernantant and then boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer and DTT. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Quantitation of the phosphorylation was carried out by densitometric scanning. Incubation of 1321N1 cells with sPLA2 at concentrations of 10 ng to 0.4 μg induced the release of [3H]AA into the medium (TableI, Fig.1 A). This release was similar to that produced by agonists acting on membrane receptors on this cell line, namely carbachol (25Bayón Y. Hernández M. Alonso A. Núñez L. Garcı́a-Sancho J. Leslie C.C. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), thrombin (26Hernández M. Bayón Y. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and LPA (Fig.1 B). Astrocytes labeled with [1-14C]oleic acid were treated with sPLA2 under the same conditions used for the assay of [3H]AA release. As shown in Table I, no significant release of [1-14C]oleic acid was observed. Since sPLA2 produces mitogenesis in astrocytes (9Arita H. Hanasaki K. Hanako T. Oda S. Teraoka H. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we addressed whether this response was also elicited in quiescent 1321N1 cells, using 10% fetal calf serum as a positive control and thrombin as a prototypic mitogenic agonist of this cell line (42Post G.R.

As shown in Table II, sPLA2 behaved as a mitogenic agonist somewhat more potent than thrombin.Table IEffect of sPLA 2 on [3 H]AA and [1- 14 C]oleate release by 1321N1 cellssPLA2[3H]AA[1-14C]Oleateμg/mldpmdpm0876 ± 123289 ± 230.011435 ± 345267 ± 320.12139 ± 197278 ± 560.42646 ± 424301 ± 79 Open table in a new tab Table IIIncorporation of [3 H]thymidine into acid-precipitable materialStimulus[3H]Thymidine%None12 ± 4Serum100 ± 0Thrombin (0.5 unit/ml)45 ± 13sPLA2 (0.1 μg/ml)51 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Since cPLA2 is the most specific enzyme that releases arachidonate from phospholipids, and sPLA2 does not display selectivity for any unsaturated fatty acid on the sn-2 position of phospholipids (43Seilhamer J.J.

McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5768-5775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sPLA2 responses might a priori reflect either a direct consequence of its catalytic activity or recruitment of the arachidonate-selective enzyme cPLA2. Considering that 1321N1 cells contain cPLA2 as the main PLA2activity detected in cell-free homogenates and the implication of this activity in the mobilization of [3H]AA produced by receptor stimulation (25Bayón Y. Hernández M. Alonso A. Núñez L. Garcı́a-Sancho J. Leslie C.C. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Hernández M. Bayón Y. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that activation cPLA2 could explain the release of [3H]AA triggered by sPLA2. The increase in catalytic activity of the 85-kDa PLA2 has been linked to phosphorylation of the enzyme, which results in reduced mobility upon electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, 0.1 μg/ml sPLA2 purified from the plasma of patients with septicemia induced phosphorylation of cPLA2. The activation of this protein shows a time course that clearly precedes [3H]AA release. Maximal amount of P-cPLA2 was achieved within 10–15 min and was maintained up to 30 min after cellular stimulation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the p42 MAP kinase preceded cPLA2 phosphorylation, since it was near maximal values at 5 min (Fig. 2 A). In vitro kinase assay of c-Jun kinase activity in lysates from cells stimulated with sPLA2showed an increase of the activity that peaked about 10 min after addition of sPLA2 (Fig.3 A). Blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody of the immunoprecipitate obtained with anti-p38 MAP antibody in lysates from 1321N1 cells, showed an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase of about 4-fold, 2 min after addition of sPLA2 (Fig. 3 B), thus suggesting that sPLA2 activates all the subgroups of the MAP kinase family following different time courses.Figure 3Effect of sPLA2 on c-Jun kinase activity 2nd on p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. 1321N1 cells were incubated with sPLA2 for the times indicated, and at the end of these periods, cell lysates were collected and used for in vitro assay of c-Jun kinase activity using GST-c-Jun protein and glutathione-agarose beads. Heat shock (HS) was used as a positive control for c-Jun kinase activation. This was carried out by incubating the cells for 2 min in medium preheated at 45 °C, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Quantitative analysis of the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was obtained by densitometric scanning and is expressed as fold-increase of basal activity (A). The experiment shown in B was carried out by immunoprecipitation of p38 MAP kinase from cell lysates, SDS-PAGE separation of the immunoprecipitate, and blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The histogram shows the densitometric scanning of the blots.P-Y-p38-MAP indicates p38 MAP kinase phosphorylated in tyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also investigated the effect of human recombinant sPLA2isolated from permanent transfected C127 fibroblasts. Stimulation of astrocytes with concentrations of human recombinant sPLA2above 0.1 μg/ml also resulted in a shift of the electrophoretic mobility of cPLA2 (Fig. 4). Similarly, the addition of type I PLA2 (pancreatic PLA2, 0.8–8 μg/ml) to 1321N1 astrocytoma cells also increased the amount of P-cPLA2 detected upon electrophoresis (Fig. 4). To confirm that the observed increase of the cPLA2 phosphorylation was due to sPLA2 rather than linked to a possible lipopolysaccharide contamination in the sPLA2 preparation from septic patients, we treated our cells with 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide. SDS-PAGE revealed that lipopolysaccharide is not able to induce cPLA2phosphorylation (data not shown), thus ruling out the view that the observed activation of cPLA2 could be due to contamination by lipopolysaccharide. Having established that addition of either of the two secreted forms of PLA2 induced phosphorylation of cPLA2, we hypothesized two possible mechanisms either a direct action of sPLA2 on its receptor or an indirect effect through lipid mediators generated as a consequence of its catalytic activity. Since LPA is a mitogenic agonist (reviewed in Ref. 45Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2314458206,"Signal transduction by beta-catenin involves its posttranslational stabilization and import to the nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors. Recent implications for beta-catenin signaling in cancer prompted us to examine colon cancer cell lines for the expression of LEF-1, a transcription factor that binds to beta-catenin. The analysis of several cell lines revealed the expression of LEF1 mRNA and a constitutive association of the LEF-1 protein with beta-catenin. In contrast to the colon cells, PC12 and 293 cells did not contain a beta-catenin-LEF-1 complex, even though both proteins were detected in cell lysates. In these cells, the association of endogenous LEF1 and beta-catenin was induced by stimulation with the wnt-1 proto-oncogene. The complex formed following transient stimulation with wnt-1 and also persisted in cells stably expressing wnt-1. Ectopic overexpression of beta-catenin in 293 cells also induced the assembly of the beta-catenin-LEF-1 complex and activated gene transcription from a LEF-1-dependent promotor. Expression of mutant oncogenic forms of beta-catenin identified in cancer cells resulted in higher levels of transcriptional activity. The results suggest that a cancer pathway driven by wnt-1, or mutant forms of beta-catenin, may involve the formation of a persistent transcriptionally active complex of beta-catenin and LEF1."
https://openalex.org/W1986857435,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) is one of a select group of proteins that can exit cells through an alternate, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus independent exocytic pathway. This alternate pathway has been termed protein export. In an attempt to better understand this process, we have identified a family of related compounds, “cardenolides,” that inhibit FGF-2 export.

Export of FGF-2 from COS-1 cells is selectively inhibited when co-transfected with expression vectors encoding the α-subunit and FGF-2. Moreover, antibodies to the α-subunit specifically co-immunoprecipitate FGF-2 along with the α-subunit while conversely, antibodies to FGF-2 specifically co-immunoprecipitate the α-subunit along with FGF-2. Finally, the ion transporting activities of the Na+,K+-ATPase can be uncoupled from protein export.

Growth factors act to modify cell growth and differentiation through interactions with the extracellular ligand-binding domains of their cognate plasma membrane receptors. Accordingly, it is generally well accepted that growth factors must be secreted from cells to elicit their biological effects. Over the last 20 years, a number of laboratories have designed a series of elegant experiments to show that protein secretion first requires targeting of the nascent polypeptide chain to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; hCGα, human chorionic gonadotropin-α; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PMTA, plasma membrane translocation apparatus. via a hydrophobic signal peptide sequence (1Blobel G.

Co-translational translocation of the secretory protein across the lipid bilayer of the ER involves passage through an aqueous channel that includes the Sec61p complex (4Hanein D. Matlack K.E.

Once in the ER lumen, secretory proteins are transported through the Golgi apparatus and vesicular intermediates that ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane, thereby releasing their protein cargo into the extracellular milieu. The primary translation product(s) of all secretory proteins include a hydrophobic signal peptide (leader) sequence. However, recently, a small number of extracellular proteins have been described that do not contain this leader peptide sequence (7Muesch A. Hartmann E. Rohde K. Rubartelli A. Sita R. Rapoport T.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 86-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, the selective release (export) of these “leaderless” proteins can be unequivocally distinguished from conventional ER/Golgi-mediated protein secretion, in a manner that is not a consequence of impaired plasma membrane integrity or cell death (8Rubartelli A.

However, even though their multifunctional extracellular activities have been well documented, the precise molecular mechanisms mediating their export are unknown. In an attempt to better understand the process responsible for FGF-2 export, we reasoned that small molecules causing specific perturbations of the plasma membrane might interfere with FGF-2 translocation and release. In this paper, we describe how this strategy led to the identification of a class of molecules known as cardenolides that alter the export of FGF-2 from transfected COS cells. COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Media containing varying concentrations of Na+ or K+ were prepared following the DMEM recipe (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the specific modifications as described below. When necessary, choline chloride was used to replace NaCl or KCl and to keep the final osmolarity constant. Except for essential and nonessential amino acids (× 50 and 100 stock solutions, respectively), cell culture grade media components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Sigma, or were of the highest quality available, prepared as separate stock solutions in dH2O and filter sterilized. To vary K+concentrations, the Na+ concentration was kept constant at 84.91 mm (44 mm NaHCO3, 0.91 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmsodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15 mm from the glutamine stock solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15 mmfrom the penicillin and streptomycin stock solution (Life Technologies, Inc.)). Choline chloride was substituted for NaCl and adjusted along with a KCl stock solution to achieve the desired final concentrations of K+. To vary Na+ concentrations, equimolar KHCO3 and KH2PO4 were substituted for NaHCO3 and NaH2PO4, respectively, KOH was used instead of NaOH to adjust pH, the penicillin and streptomycin solution was omitted, pyruvic acid was substituted for sodium pyruvate, a glutamine stock solution in dH2O was made from powder, the KCl concentration was maintained at 30 mm and choline chloride replaced NaCl to achieve the desired final Na+ concentrations. COS-1 cells were transfected as described previously with SV-40 based plasmid cDNA expression vectors encoding the 18-kDa isoform of human FGF-2, referred to as p18dx in a previous publication (12Florkiewicz R.Z.

Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or the α1-subunit of rat Na+,K+-ATPase (pCMVOuabain, PharMingen). Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected for 30 min with 10 μg of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA mixed with 1.0 ml of transfection (TX) buffer (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mmTris, pH 7.4). The TX buffer was removed and the cells were cultured in complete media supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma) for 90 min. Media containing chloroquine was removed, cells were washed two times with complete media and cultured in complete media until the next step in the experiment was performed. In co-transfection experiments we used 5 μg of each CsCl-purified plasmid DNA. Ouabagenin, digoxin, digoxigenin, digitoxin, and digitoxigenin were purchased from Sigma. Ouabain was purchased from Calbiochem. In experiments designed to determine IC50 values, 1 mm digitoxose (Sigma) served as a negative control. Unless otherwise stated, media containing cardenolides and digitoxose were prepared as follows. An initial 500 mm stock solution was prepared in 100% Me2SO. A dilution series of working stocks were prepared in chase media so that the final concentration of Me2SO was 2%. To determine IC50 values, working stocks were then added to cell culture media to give final cardenolide concentrations of 10−4 through 10−11 and a final Me2SO concentration of 0.2%. In the metabolic labeling experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the initial ouabain stock solutions were prepared directly in chase media and dissolved by heating briefly at 65 °C. Serial dilutions were prepared in chase media and used for the dose-response curve shown in Fig. 1, panel C.Figure 2Ouabain has no effect on hCGα secretion. COS-1 cells were transfected with an SV-40 based expression vector encoding hCGα, metabolically pulse-labeled 48 h thereafter, washed, and incubated in chase media in the absence (panel A) or presence of 20 mm ouabain (panel B). Ouabain was dissolved directly in chase media by heating briefly at 65 °C. At the times indicated, the cell (C) and corresponding media (M) fractions were processed, immune complexes prepared using rabbit polyclonal anti-hCGα antibody, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and the signal visualized by fluorography. The location of 14C-labeled molecular size standards are indicated at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Over the time course of the experiments described in Figs. 1 and 2, a number of criteria were used to determine the viability of COS-1 cells in the presence of varying concentrations of ouabain. COS-1 cells do appear to swell and would eventually die in the presence of ouabain, however, over the time course of these experiments no difference in viability could be detected between treated and control cells by the following assays: lactic dehydrogenase activity in conditioned media (Sigma), uptake and enzymatic conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-lacboxymethoxyphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (Progmega Corp.), and trypan blue dye exclusion (Life Technologies, Inc.). In addition, we have previously described the use of neomycin phosphotransferase as a marker for expression of a cytosolic protein in transfected COS-1 cells (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also conducted control metabolic pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of 10 mm ouabain with transfected COS-1 cells overexpressing the cytosolic protein neomycin phosphotransferase. No neomycin phosphotransferase was detected in conditioned media and the cell-associated signal remained the same. If ouabain was destroying COS-1 cells we would have expected metabolically labeled neomycin phosphotransferase in the media fraction and reduced signal in the cell fraction. Stock solutions were prepared to test compounds at the highest possible concentration without toxicity: thapsigargin (Calbiochem) an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase (17Ishii T. Lemas M.V. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2860-2865PubMed Google Scholar), 40 mm stock solution in 100% ethanol, the highest final concentration tested was 100 μm; and trifluoroperazine (Sigma), also an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein (23Hamada H. Hagiwara K.-I. Nakajima T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2860-2865PubMed Google Scholar), the highest final concentration tested was 10 μm. These compounds were shown to have no effect on FGF-2 export as determined by metabolic pulse-labeling, chase, and immunoprecipitation experiments as well as by using a standard sandwich ELISA. Forty to 48 h after DNA transfections, COS-1 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled for 15 min with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Trans35S-label, ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) in 1.0 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM as described (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After pulse labeling, cell monolayers were washed once with chase media composed of DMEM supplemented with 10 mm unlabeled methionine (Sigma), 10 mm unlabeled cysteine (Sigma), 20 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were then cultured in 2.0 ml of chase medium for the indicated lengths of time. Where noted, the chase medium was made from individual stocks to achieve the different final concentrations of K+ or Na+ as described above. Cell lysates and conditioned media fractions were processed for immunoprecipitations or Western transfer and immunoblotting as described previously (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, the media fraction was removed divided into two 1-ml samples and clarified by centrifugation, 13,000 RPM for 10 min at 4 °C. To each 1 ml of clarified media fraction 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer was added. Cells were removed from the plate using 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation, 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysis buffer used in these experiments contains 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), 0.5% deoxycholate (Sigma), 20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), 10 ng/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml leupeptin, and 10 ng/ml pepstatin (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Both cell and medium fractions were then incubated at 21 °C for 45 min with guinea pig anti-FGF-2 immune serum (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (1:200), rabbit anti-hCGα immune serum (Biodesign Inc.), or a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the α1-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). GammaBind G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added for an additional 30-min incubation at 21 °C. G-Sepharose-bound immune complexes were pelleted, washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and four times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation wash buffer (IP-wash buffer) containing the same protease inhibitors as lysis buffer. IP-wash buffer is 0.15m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (Bio-Rad). Immune complexes were eluted directly into Laemmli SDS gel sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% SDS-PAGE). The gel was processed for fluorography, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. To determine the IC50of each cardenolide or the effect of the other compounds listed in Table I, we used a standard sandwich ELISA technique. Briefly, quantitation of FGF-2 exported into conditioned media was measured using monoclonal antibody F155C prepared in our laboratories for capture followed by biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-FGF-2 antibody (R & D Systems Inc.). For ELISA, 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed for 75 s with 0.1 m NaCO3buffer which removes the majority of cell surface bound FGF-2 as previously shown (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cells were then cultured in media containing dilutions of the specific compound being tested, 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml heparin until the media fractions were removed, clarified, and the amount of FGF-2 measured.Table ICompounds tested as potential inhibitors of FGF-2 export from COS-1 cellsCompoundMolecular target± Export effectIC50 or highest concentration testedOuabainα1-Subunit/NKA+IC500.10 μmOuabageninα1-Subunit/NKA+IC50 1.50 μmDigoxinα1-Subunit/NKA+IC500.09 μmDigoxigeninα1-Subunit/NKA+IC50 0.40 μmDigitoxinα1-Subunit/NKA+IC500.14 μmDigitoxigeninα1-Subunit/NKA+IC50 1.20 μmThapsigarginCa2+-ATPase−1 μmBafilomycinH+-ATPase−50 nmAmilorideNa+ channel−1 mmGlibenclamideK+ channel−100 μmVerapamilP-glycoprotein−100 μmTrifuorperizineP-glycoprotein−10 μm Open table in a new tab For Western blot analysis, total proteins from 3 × 105 transfected or control COS-1 cells were prepared. Cells were removed from the tissue culture plate by incubation in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without MgCl2 and without CaCl2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA. Cells were pelleted, lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer, and clarified by centrifugation as described above. Supernatants from clarified cell extracts were mixed with 4 × Laemmli gel sample buffer, heated at 65 °C for 20 min, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane support (0.45 μm pore size, Schleicher and Schuell) in cold buffer containing 25 mm3-[dimethyl(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (Research Organics, Inc.), pH 9.5, 20% methanol for 90 min at constant amperage (0.4 amps). Western transfers were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in buffer containing 10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaN3, 0.35% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation Co., Los Angeles, CA). Transfers were incubated with primary monoclonal anti-α1-Na+,K+-ATPase antibody diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. After incubation with primary antibody, transfers were washed at room temperature with 1 liter (10 changes) of wash buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 500 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (Sigma), 5 mmNaN3, and 0.05% Tween 20. Transfers were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L, affinipure, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), washed in 1 liter of wash buffer, incubated for 1 h in 100 ml of blocking buffer containing 15 μCi of 125I-protein A (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) and washed with 1 liter of buffer as described above. Signal was visualized by autoradiography using RX Fuji Medical x-ray film. In a previous publication (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.M. Buechler R. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we provided evidence for the existence of an ATP-dependent plasma membrane translocation apparatus (PMTA) as a component of the FGF-2 export pathway. On this basis, it was proposed that specific perturbations of the plasma membrane might, as a consequence, interfere with FGF-2 export. For example, disrupting the movement of ions across the plasma membrane is known to interfere with the function of other proteins involved in the active transport of amino acids and glucose into cells (24Ullrich K.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1979; 41: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, in an attempt to identify small molecules that could alter the export of FGF-2, we evaluated those that were already known to modulate the activity of plasma membrane proteins involved in ion transport. One such molecule is the cardioglycoside ouabain. Ouabain belongs to a class of compounds called the cardenolides (cardioglycosides and their aglycone derivatives) that interact with the catalytic α-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase and thereby inhibit its ability to (i) exchange K+ for Na+, (ii) hydrolyze ATP, and (iii) maintain an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. When COS-1 cells are transfected with an expression vector encoding the 18-kDa isoform of FGF-2, they export this growth factor into the culture media in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.1, panel A). After an 8-h chase, approximately 60% of the 35S-metabolically labeled FGF-2 is detected in the conditioned media. When the identical experiment is performed with chase media supplemented with 100 μm of the cardioglycoside ouabain, the amount of metabolically labeled FGF-2 detected in the conditioned medium is reduced by over 75% (Fig. 1, panel B). Because the amounts of radiolabeled FGF-2 immunoprecipitated from the corresponding cell extracts remain relatively constant during the time course of these experiments, ouabain appears to block plasma membrane translocation of FGF-2 and not its intracellular stability. The inhibition of FGF-2 export is concentration-dependent with a half-maximal activity (IC50) of ∼0.1 μm ouabain (Fig. 1,panel C). The high initial concentration tested in the experiments shown in Fig. 1, panels B and C, necessitated that ouabain be dissolved directly in chase media by heating briefly at 65 °C. As a consequence of the well characterized effect of ouabain on Na+,K+-ATPase activity, COS-1 cells do increase in volume during these experiments. However, over the time course of these experiments, there is no difference between treated and control cell viability and/or plasma membrane integrity as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion and levels of lactic dehydrogenase activity in conditioned media. Therefore, the presence of ouabain in an 8-h pulse-chase experiment appears to block FGF-2 export from transfected COS-1 cells in the absence of detectable cytotoxicity or cell death. A number of ouabain-related compounds were also tested to determine if the ability to inhibit export of FGF-2 was shared by other members of the cardenolide family, which include the aglycone derivatives of the cardioglycoside. The cardenolides tested include ouabain, ouabagenin, digoxin, digoxigenin, digitoxin, and digitoxigenin (TableI). In these experiments we determined the IC50 value for each cardenolide. Dilutions of working stock solutions were prepared in chase media so that the final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%. All cardenolides capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of the α-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase were also found to inhibit FGF-2 protein export. Control metabolic pulse-labeling experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors of other ion transporters or channels to determine if the cardenolide effect on FGF-2 export was a general consequence of altering any ion transport process (Table I). Thapsigargin was used as an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, bafilomycin of vacuolar H+-ATPase, glibenclamide inhibits K+ channels, amiloride inhibits Na+ channels while verapamil and trifluoperazine were used to block transport activity of the multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein. All inhibitors were tested at the concentrations listed in Table I. When treated for 8 h in chase media, the concentrations listed are the highest that were not cytotoxic to COS-1 cells. None of these compounds blocked, reduced, or elevated the rate or extent of FGF-2 export from transfected COS-1 cells. Identical results were also obtained by sandwich ELISA. Together, these data imply that the only ion transporter or ion channel involved in regulating FGF-2 export appears to be Na+,K+-ATPase and that the cardenolides, as a class of molecules, specifically interfere with this process in COS-1 cells. The ER/Golgi-dependent secretion of hCGα from transfected COS-1 cells was used to determine if ouabain specifically blocks FGF-2 export. Secretion of hCGα from transfected COS-1 cells was examined in the absence (Fig.2, panel A) or presence (Fig.2, panel B) of ouabain. The appearance of35S-metabolically labeled hCGα in conditioned media was completely unaffected by the presence of as much as 20 mmouabain, approximately 80% of hCGα is still released into the conditioned media. In these experiments, we used the highest concentration of ouabain that can be easily dissolved in chase media (with brief heating at 65 °C) to emphasize that there is no effect on conventional ER/Golgi trafficking and secretion of hCGα. Likewise, lower concentrations of ouabain have no effect. In metabolic pulse-labeling or ELISA-based experiments, the ouabain-related cardioglycosides as well as their aglycone derivatives listed in TableI were also tested and shown to have no effect on secretion of hCGα (not shown). We conclude that cardenolides selectively interfere with export of FGF-2 from the cytosol into the extracellular milieu while having no obvious effect on conventional ER/Golgi-dependent protein trafficking and secretion from COS-1 cells.

This activity is modulated by alternative splicing and is thought to be mediated by receptors expressed in muscle fibers. An isoform of agrin that does not induce postsynaptic specializations binds with high affinity to dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Transcripts encoding this agrin isoform are expressed in a variety of non-muscle tissues. Here, we analyzed the tissue distribution of agrin and dystroglycan on the protein level and determined their binding affinities. We found that agrin is most abundant in lung, kidney, and brain. Only a little agrin was detected in skeletal muscle, and no agrin was found in liver. Dystroglycan was highly expressed in all tissues examined except in liver. In a solid-phase radioligand binding assay, agrin bound to dystroglycan from lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle with a dissociation constant between 1.8 and 2.2 nm, while the affinity to brain-derived dystroglycan was 4.6 nm. In adult kidney and lung, agrin co-purified and co-immunoprecipitated with dystroglycan, and both molecules were co-localized in embryonic tissue. These data show that the agrin isoform expressed in non-muscle tissue is a high-affinity binding partner of dystroglycan and they suggest that this interaction, like that between laminin and dystroglycan, may be important for the mechanical integrity of the tissue.

When applied to cultured chick myotubes, agrin leads to the formation of protein aggregates containing acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), acetylcholinesterase, and several other molecules that are also found at the neuromuscular junction in vivo (3Wallace B.G. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregating activity of agrin is strongly influenced by alternative mRNA splicing at two sites, called A and B in chick (y and z in rodents). While agrin isoforms that contain inserts at these sites are highly active in an AChR aggregation assay, an agrin isoform lacking the inserts, designated agrinA0B0, is inactive (4Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W.

We find that agrinA0B0 binds to α-dystroglycan isolated from adult chick lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle with a dissociation equilibrium constant of ∼ 2 nm. Binding to α-dystroglycan from adult chick brain was approximately 2-fold lower. In addition, agrin co-localized with β-dystroglycan in developing chicken kidney and lung. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that agrin and α-dystroglycan bind strongly to each other outside of the NMJ, suggesting that agrin may have a similar function as the laminins in linking the basement membrane to the DGC.RESULTSAs a first step we analyzed the tissue distribution of agrin and one of its binding proteins, α-dystroglycan, in the adult chick. To this end, homogenates of brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, and liver were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and assayed for agrin and β-dystroglycan immunoreactivity by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, agrin-like immunoreactivity with an apparent molecular mass between 400 and 600 kDa, was clearly detected in lung, kidney, and brain whereas no signal was seen in skeletal muscle and liver homogenates. Upon longer exposure agrin-like immunoreactivity with the high molecular mass could also be detected in skeletal muscle while we were not able to detect it in liver homogenates (data not shown). The tissue distribution of agrin in adult chicken brain, liver, and skeletal muscle is similar to that observed in the embryo, except that lower levels were detected in adult skeletal muscle (32Denzer A.J. Gesemann M. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One explanation for this may be that in adult muscle, agrin expression is restricted to the NMJ (8Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Reist N.E. Magill C. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Agrin-like immunoreactivity was also associated with discrete bands around 100 kDa. Proteins of similar size were purified from the electric organ ofT. californica (35Nitkin R.M. Smith M.A. Magill C. Fallon J.R. Yao Y.-M.M. Wallace B.G. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and were also observed in embryonic chick and rat tissue (32Denzer A.J. Gesemann M. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These bands may represent proteolytic fragments derived from full-length agrin.Since no antibodies are available that reliably recognize α-dystroglycan from chicken, we probed the same homogenates for the presence of β-dystroglycan, which is derived from the same precursor molecule and forms a tight complex with α-dystroglycan (19Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, β-dystroglycan was most abundant in brain, followed by lung, kidney,and skeletal muscle, but β-dystroglycan was not detected in liver homogenates. Hence, the amount of β-dystroglycan in these tissues correlates with that of agrin except in skeletal muscle where β-dystroglycan was very abundant, but only a little agrin-like immunoreactivity was found.Because lung, kidney,and muscle mainly express agrin transcripts encoding the splice variant lacking inserts at sites A and B (agrinA0B0; Refs. 7McMahan U.J.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6767-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next determined whether agrinA0B0 binds to α-dystroglycan isolated from these tissues. To this end, binding of agrinA0B0 to α-dystroglycan preparations isolated from a variety of tissues was analyzed by transfer overlay assays. As ligands, we used either iodinated full-length agrin (cAgrin7A0B0) or the 95-kDa COOH-terminal fragment, c95A0B0 (see Ref. 32Denzer A.J. Gesemann M. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar for nomenclature). As shown in Fig. 2, α-dystroglycan from all the tissues, except liver, gave a strong binding signal. No difference in α-dystroglycan binding was observed using recombinant full-length chick agrin (cAgrin7A0B0) or its COOH-terminal half (c95A0B0; Fig. 2), indicating that the NH2-terminal part of agrin does not substantially contribute to the binding. While α-dystroglycan from lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle had an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa, α-dystroglycan from brain was substantially smaller. Differences in the M r of α-dystroglycan have been observed by others using laminin-1 as a ligand (31Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 37Gee S.H. Blacher R.W. Douville P.J. Provost P.R. Yurchenco P.D. Carbonetto S. J. Biol.

Since the predicted molecular mass of the α-dystroglycan core protein is much smaller (∼74 kDa; Ref. 19Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), the difference is most likely due to its extensive post-translational glycosylation (15Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 38Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol.

The signals on transfer overlay assays were detected with as little as 2.5 nm iodinated ligand, suggesting a high-affinity binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan from all the tissues examined.Figure 2Transfer overlay assays with agrinA0B0 to detect α-dystroglycans from different chick tissues. Proteins were separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and overlaid either with a 95-kDa iodinated agrin fragment (125I-c95A0B0 (A)) or full-length chick agrin (125I-cAgrin7A0B0(B)). Each lane was incubated with 2.5 nmiodinated agrin. Origin of α-dystroglycan preparation is indicated.

As shown in Fig. 3, binding of c95A0B0 to α-dystroglycan from skeletal muscle, lung, kidney, and brain was detected at low nanomolar concentrations. We measured K d values between 2 and 5 nm(Table I), demonstrating that agrinA0B0 binds to α-dystroglycan with high affinity. Binding of 125I-c95A0B0 to α-dystroglycan from all tissues was Ca2+-dependent and was competed to more than 90% with 2 μm unlabeled c95A0B0 (data not shown). The approximately 2-fold higherK d for brain-derived α-dystroglycan is most likely due to its different glycosylation. In this context it is interesting to note that the binding of laminin-1 and laminin-2 to α-dystroglycan involves the carbohydrate moiety of α-dystroglycan (39Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J.

To see whether α-dystroglycan is associated with agrin in situ, we next tested the α-dystroglycan preparations from lung and kidney for the presence of agrin-like protein by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 A, agrin-like immunoreactivity was indeed detected in these preparations, but it had a reduced apparent molecular mass compared with agrin detected in tissue homogenates (see Fig. 1). As the binding site for dystroglycan is localized in the COOH-terminal part of agrin (see Fig. 2), the lowerM r of agrin found in α-dystroglycan preparations may be due to proteolytic cleavage within the amino-terminal portion of the molecule. Cleavage within this region would release a fragment that lacks the NtA domain of agrin, which is responsible for the binding of agrin to laminins (42Denzer A.J. Brandenberger R. Gesemann M. Chiquet M. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As the binding of agrin to laminin is of high affinity (42Denzer A.J. Brandenberger R. Gesemann M. Chiquet M. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), proteolytic degradation may be requisite to extract agrin from tissue under the mild conditions used to purify α-dystroglycan. To assure that the presence of agrin-like immunoreactivity in the α-dystroglycan preparation reflected an association of both molecules in situ, we tested whether immunoprecipitation with anti-agrin antibodies from total tissue homogenates would also enrich for β-dystroglycan. As shown in Fig. 4 B, β-dystroglycan was indeed present in these immunoprecipitations. These experiments thus show that agrin and α-dystroglycan are associated with each other in situ in adult kidney and lung.Figure 4Agrin is complexed with α-dystroglycanin situ. A, Western blot analysis using anti-agrin antibodies on α-dystroglycan purified from lung and kidney. No immunoreactive proteins were detected with an agrin preimmune serum (not shown). B, β-dystroglycan co-immunoprecipitates with agrin from adult lung and kidney. Western blot analysis using anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies on tissue extracts that had been precipitated with preimmune serum (pre-IS) or anti-agrin antiserum (α-agrin). As a control, total extract (extract) was included. In lung and kidney, β-dystroglycan is enriched in the agrin immunoprecipitates, while no specific signal is seen using preimmune serum. The band with a slightly higher molecular mass than β-dystroglycan, also seen with preimmune serum, represents cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody with the heavy chain of rabbit IgG. The blots using tissue extracts were exposed seven times longer than serum-treated samples. SDS-PAGE in all cases was 3–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Molecular masses in kilodaltons of standard proteins are given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To see whether agrin and dystroglycan could interact with each other during development, we next stained consecutive sections with anti-agrin or anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies. As shown in Fig.5, agrin-like immunoreactivity was highly concentrated in basement membranes of lung bronchioles and kidney tubules. At the light microscopic level, β-dystroglycan showed the same tissue distribution (Fig. 5, right column). No staining was detected with an agrin preimmune serum or in the absence of the β-dystroglycan antibody (data not shown). In summary, these data indicate that agrin and α-dystroglycan may also interact with each other during kidney and lung development.Figure 5Immunolocalization of agrin and β-dystroglycan during development of chick lung and kidney.Consecutive frozen sections of 15-day-old embryonic kidney and lung were stained either with anti-agrin or anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies as indicated. Both agrin and β-dystroglycan are localized in the basement membranes of developing kidney tubules or lung bronchioles.Bars = 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious work on the binding of agrin and dystroglycan dealt mainly with the functional consequences of this interaction in the formation of the NMJ. It has been shown that the agrin isoform lacking inserts at sites A and B (agrinA0B0), which is inactive in AChR aggregation, binds to skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan with higher affinity than the AChR-aggregating isoform agrinA4B8 (18Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,30Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the region of agrin sufficient for AChR aggregation is distinct from the binding site for α-dystroglycan, making it unlikely that the binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan is involved in the signaling mechanisms initiated by agrin (30Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 43Hopf C. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In a solid-phase radioligand binding assay agrinA0B0 binds to skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan with a dissociation constant of less than 2 nm (Table I). Using the same binding assay, aK d value of 8 nm was determined for laminin-1 and a mixture of laminin-2 and laminin-4 (24Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3817-3821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, agrin seems to bind to muscle α-dystroglycan with higher affinity than the laminins. We also noticed this difference in the binding affinities in inhibition experiments. While an excess of unlabeled agrinA0B0 was always very efficient in inhibiting the binding of iodinated laminin-1 to α-dystroglycan, the same concentration of unlabeled laminin-1 inhibited the binding of iodinated agrinA0B0 only partially. 2M. Gesemann and M. A. Ruegg, unpublished observation. In mature muscle fibers, agrin is concentrated at the NMJ and only little is detected in extrasynaptic regions (Fig. 1; Refs. 8Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar and 13Reist N.E. Magill C. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Agrin is therefore unlikely to be the major binding partner of α-dystroglycan in muscle fibers outside of the NMJ; instead, laminin-2 may have this role. The situation may, however, be different in adult kidney and lung, where agrin is expressed at high levels (Fig.1). Lung and kidney, like muscle fibers, express transcripts encoding agrinA0B0 (11Ma E. Morgan R. Godfrey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2943-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stone D.M. Nikolics K. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6767-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study now shows that agrinA0B0 binds to α-dystroglycan from both tissues with high affinity (K d values ∼2 nm) and that agrin is complexed with dystroglycan in vivo (Figs. 4and 5). Hence, the major binding protein for α-dystroglycan in adult kidney and lung may be agrin and not the laminins.In kidney, the binding of laminin-1 to α-dystroglycan has been suggested to be important during epithelial morphogenesis. This is mainly based on perturbation studies using polyclonal antibodies directed against proteolytic fragments E8 or E3 of laminin-1 (28Klein G. Langegger M. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1988; 55: 331-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or the function-blocking monoclonal antibody IIH6 directed against α-dystroglycan (29Durbeej M. Larsson E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In those studies, the antibodies perturbed the differentiation of mesenchyme into epithelium in organ cultures of embryonic kidneys. Here we show co-localization of β-dystroglycan and agrin in developing chick kidney tubules and lung bronchioles (Fig. 5). Although we used anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies instead of anti-α-dystroglycan antibodies, it is likely that the tissue distribution of the two proteins does not differ. Both proteins originate from the same precursor molecule (19Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), they tightly associate with each other, and in other species, no differences in the tissue distribution of α- and β-dystroglycan have been observed.

Here we demonstrate that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) achieves its N terminus topology through a variation of this mechanism that involves both co- and posttranslational translocation events. Using a series of defined chimeric and truncated proteins expressed in a reticulocyte lysate system, we have identified two topogenic determinants encoded within the first (TM1) and second (TM2) membrane-spanning segments of CFTR. Each sequence independently (i) directed endoplasmic reticulum targeting, (ii) translocated appropriate flanking residues, and (iii) achieved its proper membrane-spanning orientation. Signal sequence activity of TM1, however, was inefficient due to the presence of two charged residues, Glu92 and Lys95, located within its hydrophobic core. As a result, TM1 was able to direct correct topology for less than half of nascent CFTR chains. In contrast to TM1, TM2 signal sequence activity was both efficient and specific. Even in the absence of a functional TM1 signal sequence, TM2 was able to direct CFTR N terminus topology through a ribosome-dependent posttranslational mechanism. Mutating charged residues Glu92 and Lys95 to alanine improved TM1 signal sequence activity as well as the ability of TM1 to independently direct CFTR N terminus topology. Thus, a single functional signal sequence in either the first or second TM segment was sufficient for directing proper CFTR topology. These results identify two distinct and redundant translocation pathways for CFTR N terminus transmembrane assembly and support a model in which TM2 functions to ensure correct topology of CFTR chains that fail to translocate via TM1.

Whereas the molecular details of polytopic protein assembly into the ER membrane remain largely unknown, this process appears to require cytosolic and membrane bound components of the ER translocation machinery including signal recognition particle (25Anderson D. Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the Sec61 complex, and TRAM (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If polytopic proteins followed a strict mechanism of cotranslational translocation, then failure of a given topogenic determinant to target or translocate the nascent chain at the ER membrane would result in irreversible protein misfolding. Structural requirements for directing protein topology would therefore be predicted to significantly restrict sequence diversity of topogenic determinants (e.g.transmembrane (TM) segments and/or their flanking regions). For this reason, certain polytopic proteins appear to have developed variations on cotranslational assembly pathways. For example, during transmembrane assembly of the Escherichia coli lac permease protein, interactions between TM9 and TM10 were required to correctly position residue Arg302 within the bilayer and to ensure transmembrane topology of the TM9–10 peptide loop (28Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 29Calamia J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, membrane integration of human P-glycoprotein (MDR1) into the lipid bilayer required cooperativity between independent signal sequences encoded within TM1 and TM2 (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that interactions between topogenic determinants within the yeast protein Sec61p were involved in directing topology of weakly hydrophobic internal transmembrane segments (30Wilkinson B. Critchley A. Stirling C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shownin vitro that some but not all polytopic proteins are capable of assembling posttranslationally into the ER membrane after polypeptide synthesis has been completed (8Brown D. Simoni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1674-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Mueckler M. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 44: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Zhang J.-T. Chen M. Foote C. Nicholson B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite these studies however, the mechanisms by which multiple topogenic determinants cooperate to direct complex topology in a non-cotranslational manner remain poorly understood. In the current study we examine the biogenesis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR, and show that both cotranslational and posttranslational mechanisms are involved in establishing correct topology of the first two N terminus transmembrane segments. This mechanism of assembly resulted from the presence of charged residues (Glu92 and Lys95) located within the hydrophobic core of TM1, which markedly decreased TM1 signal sequence activity. Thus TM1 was capable of directing translocation for only a subset of CFTR chains, whereas signal sequence activity of TM2 was required to direct topology of remaining chains. CFTR N terminus biogenesis therefore does not rely on the sequential action of independent topogenic sequences to establish its multispanning topology. Rather CFTR utilizes two distinct and redundant translocation pathways: a cotranslational pathway directed by TM1 and a ribosome-dependent posttranslational pathway directed by TM2. An important consequence of this mechanism is that redundant topogenic information encoded by TM2 enables TM1 to acquire critical structural features that would otherwise interfere with conventional cotranslational assembly. E92A and K95A mutations were engineered into CFTR by site-directed mutagenesis using a single stranded (M-13) (plasmid pBQ 4.7) template and oligonucleotides TATATTTAGGCGCCGTCACCAAAGCAGT and GAAGTCACCGCTGCAGTACAGCCT as described (33Xiong X. Bragin A. Widdicombe J. Cohn J. Skach W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). AvaI/XbaI fragments containing the engineered mutations were then ligated into anAvaI/XbaI-digested pSPCFTR vector (34Hasegawa H. Skach W. Baker O. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V. Verkman A. Science. 1992; 258: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), generating plasmids pSPCFTR(E92A) and pSPCFTR(K95A). Plasmid pSPCFTR(E92A/K95A) was generated by PCR amplification of pSPCFTR(E92A) (sense primer (SP6 promoter) ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG, and antisense primer TACTGCAGCGGTGACGGCGCCTAA), digestion of the PCR fragment withAvaI/PstI (PstI encoded in antisense oligonucleotides) and ligation of the fragment into anAvaI/PstI digested pSPCFTRK95A vector. Plasmids pSPCFTR(G85E) and pSPCFTR(G91R) are described elsewhere (33Xiong X. Bragin A. Widdicombe J. Cohn J. Skach W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plasmids TM1.P, TM1.P(G85E), TM1.P(G91R), TM1.P(E92A), TM1.P(E95A), and TM1.P(E92A/E95A) were constructed by PCR amplification of WT or corresponding mutant CFTR plasmids (sense primer (SP6 promoter), antisense primer TAGATAGGTCACCATAGAGCGTTCCTCCT) and ligation ofHindIII/BstEII-digested PCR fragments into aHindIII/BstEII-digested vector, S.L.ST.gG.P (described in Ref. 18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids encode the CFTR N terminus through residue Ser118 fused to a 142 residue C terminus fragment (P) of bovine prolactin (11Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CFTR mutations ΔE115, E116K, E115K/E116K, and G126D were engineered by PCR overlap extension (35Ho N. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using sense primers: 1) CCGGATAACAAGGAACGCTCTATC, 2) GATAACAAGGAGAAACGCTCTATCGCG, 3) AACAAGAAAAAACGGTCCATCGCGATTTATCTAGGC, 4) GATTTATCTAGGCATAGACTTATGCCTTCTC, respectively, and complimentary antisense primers (not shown) to generate overlapping 5′ and 3′ PCR fragments. These fragments were fused in a subsequent PCR reaction as described (35Ho N. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). PCR fragments from this “fusion” reaction were digested with AvaI/XbaI and ligated intoAvaI/XbaI-digested pSPCFTR vector. Plasmids TM1–2.P encoding ΔE115, E116K, E115K/E116K, and G126D mutations were generated by PCR amplification of respective mutant pSPCFTR plasmids using sense primer (SP6 promoter) and antisense primer 5) AAATTTGGTCACCTTGTTGGAAAGGAGACT. PCR fragments were digested withHindIII/BstEII and ligated into aHindIII/BstEII-digested vector S.L.ST.gG.P (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resultant plasmids encode CFTR residues Met1–Asn186 followed by the P reporter. Plasmids TM1–2.P encoding mutations E116K/G126D and E115K/E116K/G126D were constructed by PCR overlap extension using primers 2 and 3 and pSPCFTR(G126D) template. Similarly, plasmids TM1–2.P containing E92A/K95A mutations together with (a) E115K/E116K, (b) E116K/G126D, or (c) E115K/E116K/G126D were generated by PCR overlap extension using the following strategies: (a) primer 3 (pSPCFTR(E92A/K95A) template); (b) primer 2 and (5′ template pSPCFTR(E92A/K95A) and 3′ template pSPCFTR(G126D); (c) primer 3 (5′ template pSPCFTR(E92A/K95A) 3′ template pSPCFTR(G126D)). Fusion PCR products from these reactions were digested with HindIII/BstEII and ligated into HindIII/BstEII-digested S.L.ST.gG.P. Plasmids encoding G85E together with E115K/E116K, E116K/G126D or E115K/E116K/G126D mutations were made in the identical manner except that pSPCFTR(G85E) was used as the template for the initial 5′ PCR reactions. ggTM2.P plasmids were generated by PCR amplification of WT and mutant CFTR using sense primer TACTGGCCATGGTCAACGCTTCCTATGACCCG and antisense primer 5. Resulting fragments were digested withNcoI (encoded in sense primer) and BstEII and ligated into NcoI/BstEII-digested S.L.ST.gG.P. This intermediate plasmid, pSPgTM2.P, was then digested withNcoI and ligated to a synthetic oligonucleotide linker containing NcoI compatible ends (sense strand CATGAACGGATCATC). The resultant plasmid encodes N terminus residues MNGSSMVN followed by CFTR residues Ala107–Asn186 followed by the P reporter. All constructs were sequenced throughout PCR-amplified or -mutagenized cDNA to verify the presence of appropriately engineered mutations and the absence of inadvertent PCR errors. mRNA was transcribedin vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using 2–4 μg of plasmid DNA in a 10-μl volume at 40 °C for 1 h as described (11Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription reaction mixture was translated directly in a transcription-linked rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system as described previously (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, canine pancreas microsomes (final concentration, 8.0 A 280) and/or the tripeptide Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr (final concentration, 0.2 mm) were added at the start of translation. Prior to proteolysis, chains synthesized on truncated mRNA (e.g.lacking a termination codon) were released from ribosomes by incubation in 1 mm puromycin at 24 °C for 10–15 min. For oocyte expression 50 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) (0.5 μl of a 10 × concentrated mixture) was added to 2 μl of transcription mixture and injected into matureXenopus laevis oocytes (XO) (50 nl/oocyte). Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for 3–4 h and homogenized on ice in 10 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KAc, 5 mmMgAc2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmTris (pH 7.5). Prior to proteolysis, CaCl2 was added to 10 mm final concentration. Proteinase K (PK) was added to RRL translation mixture or aliquots of oocyte homogenate (0.2 mg/ml final concentration) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1 h (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residual protease was inactivated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm) and rapidly mixing with 10 volumes of 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0 (preheated to 100 °C). Oocyte samples were subsequently diluted in >10 volumes of buffer A (0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0), incubated at 4 °C for 2–4 h, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were used for subsequent immunoprecipitation. Antiprolactin antisera (ICN Immunologicals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added to RRL translation mixtures diluted in 0.5 ml of buffer A (1:1000 dilution) or to clarified oocyte homogenates. After a 10–30 min preincubation, 5 μl of protein A Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) was added, and the samples were mixed at 4 °C for 2–10 h prior to washing three times with buffer A and twice with 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) fluorography, and autoradiography. Autoradiograms were digitized with an AGFA Studio Scan II, and band intensities were quantified on unmodified images using Adobe Photoshop software as described previously (17Skach W. Lingappa V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3202-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 20Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several different film exposure times were compared to ensure that determinations remained within the linear range. To define the translocation activity of CFTR-TM1, CFTR cDNA encoding residues Met1 through Ser118 was engineered in the N-terminal direction to a previously defined translocation reporter (P) (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a series of WT and mutant plasmids (Fig. 1). Plasmids were expressed in reticulocyte lysate supplemented with ER-derived canine pancreas microsomes, and topology of the P reporter was determined by its accessibility to exogenously added PK (18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polypeptides generated from WT plasmid TM1.P (Fig. 1, lane 1, downward arrow) gave rise to several prolactin-reactive fragments following PK digestion in the absence, but not the presence, of non-denaturing detergent (lanes 2 and 3, arrows). In these chains, the P reporter thus resided in the microsome (e.g. ER) lumen. Some of these translocated fragments were generated from full-length chains in which TM1 spanned the membrane with its N terminus oriented toward the cytosol (28-kDa band, lane 2, downward arrows), while smaller PK-protected fragments were also observed prior to protease digestion (19-kDa band, lanes 1 and 2,upward arrows; more evident in lanes 14 and 17). These latter fragments were dependent on the addition of ER membranes (data not shown) and were likely generated by signal peptidase cleavage of nascent chains at cryptic recognition sites unmasked by truncation of TM2 as has been observed previously for similar constructs (17Skach W. Lingappa V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3202-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 18Skach W. Lingappa V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Skach W. Shi L.-B.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to WT chains, no protease-protected fragments were observed for TM1.P(G85E) or TM1.P(G91R) chains, demonstrating that these inherited cystic fibrosis-related mutations abolished the ability of TM1 to direct translocation of the P reporter (lanes 4–6 and 7–9, respectively). Quantitation of autoradiograms in Fig. 1 and correction for methionine content of fragments revealed that CFTR-TM1 was significantly less efficient at directing P reporter translocation than other polytopic protein-derived signal sequences that have been examined in this same context. The P reporter resided in the ER lumen in only 12% of newly synthesized WT TM1.P chains compared with 80–95% translocation efficiency previously reported by us and others (15Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15532-15538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chavez R. Hall Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Skach W. Lingappa V.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because all TM1-flanking residues were included in these constructs, translocation efficiency of TM1 could not be explained by removal of topogenic information. Similarly, the P reporter has been shown to faithfully follow topogenic information in a wide variety of contexts and would not be expected to negatively influence TM1 activity (11Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, it seemed plausible that TM1 either lacked translocation specificity (i.e. some chains spanned the membrane in the opposite orientation with their N terminus translocated) or that primary structural features within TM1, such as charged residues Glu92 and/or Lys95, limited its signal sequence activity. We therefore examined translocation efficiency of polypeptides generated from plasmids TM1.P(E92A), TM1.P(K95A) and TM1.P(E92A/K95A). As shown in Fig. 1 A, lanes 10–18, the E92A and E92A/K95A mutations both improved TM1 signal sequence activity (43% and 79% of P translocated, respectively), whereas the K95A mutation by itself had little effect (10% of P translocated). This suggested that residues Glu92 and Lys95 within the hydrophobic core of TM1 directly reduced TM1 C terminus translocation activity and prevented TM1 from achieving a stable transmembrane orientation. To address whether the weak TM1 signal sequence activity observedin vitro might be due to artifacts introduced by the reconstituted cell free RRL system, we also examined TM1 signal sequence activity in microinjected X. laevis oocytes (Fig.1 B). These in vivo studies confirmed results obtained in vitro and demonstrated the following: (i) signal sequence activity of WT TM1 was significantly impaired (only 28% of chains translocated); (ii) G85E and G91R mutations essentially abolished TM1 signal sequence activity (<5% of chains translocated); and (iii) E92A and E92A/K95A mutations improved TM1 signal sequence activity (36% and 70% of chains translocated, respectively). If CFTR utilized a strict cotranslational mechanism of assembly, then the weak signal sequence activity of WT TM1 would result in failure of most CFTR chains to translocate and assemble properly in the ER membrane. This, however, was not the case because greater than 70% of WT as well as G85E and G91R chains achieved their correct N terminus topology in the ER membrane ((33) and Fig. 4). These results suggested that topogenic information in addition to TM1 must function to ensure correct CFTR topology. We therefore examined the signal sequence activity of TM2 using the plasmid ggTM2.P, which encodes two (engineered) N-linked glycosylation consensus sites 12 and 18 residues from the membrane-spanning segment, followed by TM2 together with its flanking sequences (CFTR residues Ala107–Asn186), followed by the P reporter (diagrammed in Fig. 2). For initial experiments, plasmid ggTM2.P was truncated at codon Asn186 (Fig.2 A). N-linked glycosylation of ggTM2 polypeptides was demonstrated by the appearance of a slower migrating band in the presence of microsomal membranes but not in the presence of a peptide inhibitor (AcNYT) of oligosaccharyltransferase (Fig. 2 A,downward arrow). N terminus glycosylation was also observed in the presence of microsomal membranes for ggTM2.P chains containing the P reporter (65% of chains glycosylated) (Fig. 2 B). Both glycosylated and unglycosylated full-length ggTM2.P chains were accessible to protease (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3), and immunoprecipitation with antiprolactin antisera confirmed that the P reporter was cytosolic (lanes 4–6). Thus TM2 directed an N-trans (or type I) transmembrane topology in which N terminus flanking residues resided in the ER lumen and C terminus residues faced the cytosol. This topology is consistent with the predicted orientation for TM2 in native CFTR (37Denning G. Ostedgaard L. Cheng S. Smith A. Welsh M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C.

However, estimating translocation efficiency by N-linked glycosylation is more difficult because utilization of consensus sites is context dependent. Lack of ggTM2.P glycosylation might therefore have resulted either from failure of the chain to translocate into the microsome lumen or failure of a particular translocated consensus site to be utilized by oligosaccharyltransferase.

Analysis of 5′-cDNA sequence identified a new translation initiation site that is in frame and 204 nucleotides upstream of the previously designated start site. Conceptual translation from this upstream AUG produces a protein containing 68 additional N-terminal amino acids. This “XL” region contains three potential PKA phosphorylation sites but shares no homology with other regions of calpastatin or with any known protein. Immunoblot studies demonstrated that heart and liver contain a calpastatin protein of 145 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that comigrates with full-length bacterially expressed calpastatin and calpastatin produced by coupled in vitro transcription-translation from the upstream AUG. An antibody raised against the XL region recognized the 145-kDa band, demonstrating that the upstream AUG is utilized and that the 145-kDa band represents full-length calpastatin in vivo. Transient transfection assays demonstrated that sequence within 272 nucleotides upstream of transcription initiation of the calpastatin gene is sufficient to direct moderate level transcription. Promoter sequences further upstream act to inhibit or stimulate transcriptional activity. Exposure of transfected cells to dibutyryl cAMP resulted in a 7–20-fold increase in promoter activity for constructs containing at least 272 nucleotides of upstream promoter sequence.

Deletion analysis indicates that at least one cAMP-responsive element resides within 102 nucleotides of transcription initiation.

BMPs were first identified by their osteoinductive effects, inducing ectopic bone formation when implanted in skeletal muscle, and have an important role as regulators of skeletal development in vivo. In vitro, BMP-2 is able to transdifferentiate myogenic C2C12 cells into the osteoblastic phenotype. In this report, we show that the osteoinductive effects of BMP-2 in C2C12 cells are mediated by bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-IA in combination with both activin receptor type II and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II. We also analyzed the expression levels of nuclear protooncogenes to understand early transcriptional events induced by BMP-2. We show thatjunB is an immediate early gene induced by BMP-2 and transforming growth factor-β. BMP-2 induces transcriptional activation of JunB expression as early as 30 min after ligand addition, reaching maximal levels after 90 min. Increase of JunB mRNA correlates with a higher AP-1 binding activity. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of JunB is sufficient to inhibit expression of myoblast differentiation markers in C2C12 cells. These data, taken together, show the involvement of JunB in the early steps of inhibition of myogenic differentiation induced by transforming growth factor-β family members.

During mammalian development, pluripotent mesenchymal cells give rise to several specialized cell types, including cells with myogenic, osteogenic, or adipogenic potential. This differentiation process consists of at least two stages. In the first step or commitment, upon certain stimuli, undifferentiated cells become committed to a particular lineage. Later, during terminal differentiation, cells acquire specific phenotypes by expressing genes encoding a set of proteins unique to a certain type of cells. The best known example of master genes governing cell fate are the family of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; BMPR-I, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I; TβR-I, transforming growth factor-β receptor type I; ActR-II, activin receptor type II; BMPR-II, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. transcription factors (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In muscle, the bHLH factors MyoD and Myf-5 play a role in lineage determination, whereas myogenin and MRF4 appear soon thereafter to execute the differentiation program (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Rawls A. Olson E.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other examples of such factors are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members, which control adipocyte differentiation or the transcription factor Cbfa1, recently found as an activator of osteoblast differentiation (3Spiegelman B.M.

The fact that ectopic expression of each these factors is sufficient to induce a unique differentiation program or even to transdifferentiate cells from other lineages emphasizes their key function (6Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 7Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Each specific cell commitment and differentiation program is ultimately controlled by signals and regulatory pathways that converge to activate a small number of transcription factors. These mechanisms involve cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, as well as extracellular diffusible factors. Among the latter, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been shown to be regulators of skeletal development (9Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). They were originally identified by their osteoinductive effects, inducing ectopic bone formation when exogenously implanted in rat or mouse muscle (10Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). Furthermore, knock-out mice showed marked skeletal defects (11Kingsley D.M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). BMP-2/4 also play a role in inductive interactions during early development, regulating dorso-ventral patterning and mesoderm induction (16Graff J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 171-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to their function during morphogenesis and determination of the body axis, BMPs are also involved in later stages of development. BMPs not only stimulate maturation of osteoblast precursor cells, they also convert the differentiation pathway of myoblastic cells into the osteoblast lineage (17Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily encompassing TGF-βs, activins, and Mullerian inhibiting substance. BMPs and other members of the TGF-β superfamily exert their biological function by interacting with two types of related transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, known as type I and type II (18Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). For both TGF-β and activin, receptor activation requires binding of ligand to the type II receptor, which then recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor (19Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on the GS region activates the kinase activity of the type I receptor, which propagates the signal to downstream substrates (19Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 20Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The BMP receptor system is somewhat different. They also require heteromeric complex formation for signaling, but, unlike TGF-β or activin, BMP type I receptors are able to bind the factor without coexpression of type II receptors; however, both together achieve high affinity binding (21ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rosenweig B.L.

Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Downstream signaling by these receptors is mediated by the recently identified family of Smad proteins (18Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 24Derynck R. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1226-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In response to receptor activation, Smad proteins become phosphorylated at their carboxyl termini and translocate into the nucleus (25Hoodless P. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 26Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Recent results support the notion that distinct Smad family members transduce signaling from specific receptor combinations. Smad1 is a BMP signal transducer, and the closely related Smad2 and Smad3 are TGF-β/activin signal transducers. Smad4/DPC4, originally found as a gene mutated in pancreatic carcinomas (28Hahn S.A. Scutte M. Hoque A.T.M.S Moskaluk C.A. daCosta L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar), functions as a shared partner, which hetero-oligomerizes with all other Smads upon phosphorylation (29Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Once into the nucleus, Smad complexes probably exert a direct role in transcriptional control. Consistent with this function, transcriptional activity of various Smad proteins and association of Smad2 with the DNA-binding protein FAST1 have recently been shown (30Chen X. Rubock M. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 383: 691-696Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms involved in BMP signaling are beginning to emerge, the precise BMP receptor combinations as well as early transcriptional events that mediate the osteogenic differentiation effects of BMP in muscular tissues have remained elusive. Here, we report that the osteoinductive response to BMP-2 in C2C12 cells is mediated by the type I receptor BMPR-IA in combination with both type II receptors BMPR-II and ActR-II. Additionally, to understand early events induced by BMP-2, we analyzed the expression level of nuclear protooncogenes. Results presented here indicate thatjunB is an immediate early gene transcriptionally induced by BMP-2. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of JunB is sufficient to inhibit expression of myogenic markers on C2C12 cells. Therefore, these data suggest the involvement of JunB in the inhibition of myogenic differentiation induced by BMP-2. α-Actin and α-acetylcholine receptor promoter regions fused to a CAT reporter were kindly provided by Dr. Kocniezcny (Purdue University; West Lafayette, IN) (31Kong Y.

Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cold Buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by flicking the tube. After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were vortexed for 10 s and then centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 20–100 μl of cold buffer C (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min, and the supernatant fraction were stored at −70 °C. The protein content was determined using the Bradford protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The AP-1 oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (Promega) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Four micrograms of the nuclear protein were diluted to a final volume of 20 μl in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1.25 μg of poly(dI-dC); 0.2 pmol of labeled probe (4 × 104 cpm) was added after 15 min. After an additional 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel, 0.25 × TBE, and 4% glycerol, and resolved at 20 mA for 2.5 h. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. C2C12 myoblasts constitute an in vitro model system to study the ability of BMPs to alter cell lineage from the myogenic to the osteogenic phenotype. C2C12 cells differentiate into multinucleated myotubes when concentration of serum is reduced from 20% to 2%. BMP-2 inhibits myotube formation, inducing osteoblastic markers such as alkaline phosphatase activity or osteocalcin production (17Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Treatment with 1 nm BMP-2 or 1 nm TGF-β completely inhibited myotube formation and myosin expression on C2C12 cells exposed to differentiation media (Fig.1 A). This BMP2-dependent inhibition of myogenic differentiation could be also seen using reporter constructs containing muscle-specific promoter regions of myogenic markers such as α-actin or α-acetylcholine receptor. Addition of 1 nm BMP-2 to cells treated with differentiation media inhibited 50–70% of their CAT reporter activity (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of reporter expression is not a general transcriptional effect of BMP-2 since expression from constitutive promoters did not show any change (data not shown). C2C12 cells express extremely low levels of alkaline phosphatase and other osteoblastic markers when cultured both in proliferative or differentiation media. Time-course studies show that, of all the TGF-β superfamily members tested, only BMP-2 is able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase expression, beginning to appear within 2 days, and increasing until day 4 (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that different members of of the TGF-β superfamily have distinct biological effects on selection of C2C12 terminal differentiation. We analyzed the expression and binding affinity of distinct activin and BMP receptors in C2C12 cells to determine which receptor combinations are involved in osteogenic BMP responses. Northern analysis indicates that C2C12 cells express BMPR-II and ActR-II as activin/BMP type II receptors and ActR-I and BMPR-IA as type I receptors (Fig.2 A). In contrast, both ActR-IIB and BMPR-IB were expressed below detection limits of either Northern or reverse transcription-PCR analysis (data not shown). We also tested binding of BMP-2 to the endogenous receptors expressed in C2C12 cells. Immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked receptor complexes using antiserum against BMPR-IA gave a strong signal of about 75 kDa (Fig. 2 B). A labeled band could be seen in immunoprecipitates using an antiserum against ActR-II. In addition, a weak signal was detected when antiserum against BMPR-IB was used. This signal could be generated by a small number of BMPR-IB receptor mRNA that could not be detected by reverse transcription-PCR. Alternatively, since BMPR-IB antibody was raised against peptides derived from its juxtamembrane region (35ten Dijke P. Yamashita H.D.L. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and BMPR-IA and -IB have closely related juxtamembrane regions, it is likely that the antibody against BMPR-IB cross-reacts with small amounts of BMPR-IA. Although it has been reported that ActR-I is able to bind BMP-2/4 when overexpressed in COS-1 cells (23Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), using the same immunoprecipitation approach, we could not detect any BMP-2 binding to ActR-I at physiological receptor levels. Some cross-linking studies showed that when transiently transfected, type I receptors for BMP are capable of binding to BMP2/4 without coexpression of the type II receptor (21ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To confirm these data and exclude the possibility that endogenous type II receptor expressed in these cells could allow binding to type I receptors, we analyzed the ability of distinct purified type I receptors to bind BMP-2 in vitro. Epitope-tagged BMP-2 receptors expressed in COS cells were immunopurified and subjected sequentially to binding and cross-linking to 125I-BMP-2. This binding assay showed specific binding of the ligand to BMPR-IA compared with control lanes derived from mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with transforming growth factor-β receptor type I (TβR-I), which is unable to bind BMP-2. In agreement with the in vivo assays, purified ActR-I was also unable to bind BMP-2 by itself (Fig. 2 C). Altogether, these results suggest that the major receptor complexes involved in osteogenic responses of BMP-2 are those including BMPR-IA in combination with ActR-II and probably BMPR-II. TGF-β has been shown to modulate expression of several nuclear protooncogenes in epithelial and fibroblastic cells (37Pertovaara L. Sistonen L. Bos T. Vogt P. Keski-Oja J. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38Mauviel A. Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, knock-out mice for transcription factors involved in AP-1 function, such as c-Fos or ATF2, exhibited profound defects in bone formation (39Johnson R.S. Spiegelman B.M. Papaionnou V. Cell. 1992; 71: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 40Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Collins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These two lines of evidence led us to investigate the expression levels of nuclear protooncogenes to understand early transcriptional events in myogenic/osteogenic transdifferentiation processes induced by BMP-2. RNAs from C2C12 cells cultured with or without 1 nm BMP-2 in differentiation media were analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of c-jun, junD, or c-mycwas not significantly modified at any time point, either with or without ligand addition. However, 1 nm BMP-2 transiently increased JunB mRNA. Induction of JunB is detected as early as 30 min after BMP-2 addition, reaching maximal (9-fold over control levels) levels after 90 min and decreasing thereafter. Interestingly, we also detected a sharp induction of c-fos transcription at 30 min, followed by a rapid decline to control levels. Nevertheless, this induction was observed both in BMP-2-treated and untreated cells, suggesting this effect was likely due to media replacement and is not a consequence of BMP-2 addition. We next assessed whether induction of JunB is dependent on new protein synthesis. C2C12 cells were treated with BMP-2 for 90 min, together with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), or the RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D (1 μg/ml). Northern analysis revealed an even higher induction of JunB mRNA in the presence of cycloheximide and a complete block of induction when actinomycin D was added (Fig. 4). We also tested the effects of other members of the TGF-β superfamily on JunB mRNA levels. TGF-β at 1 nm strongly induced JunB mRNA, whereas no significant induction was detected in RNA from C2C12 cells treated with 1 nm activin A (Fig. 4). Transient cell transfections with a JunB promoter/CAT reporter gene construct were performed to confirm whether BMP-2 and TGF-β regulate JunB mRNA steady state levels through modulation of its transcription rate. R1B/L17 clone, which is unresponsive to TGF-β due to mutations at its receptor type I (32Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and C2C12 cells were transfected with a CAT construct containing a 3-kilobase proximal region of mouse JunB promoter and treated with BMP-2 or TGF-β both at 1 nm. Assay of CAT activity after 16 h of incubation indicated that both factors induced promoter activity 2–3-fold as compared with control cultures in C2C12 cells, whereas only BMP-2 was able to stimulate CAT activity in L17 cells (Fig.5). Thus, these results indicate that the enhancement of junB gene expression in myogenic cells does not require protein synthesis and is mediated, at least in part, by modulation of its promoter activity. AP-1 is a collective term referring to homo- and heterodimeric transcription factors composed of members of the Jun, Fos, or ATF families that bind to a common DNA site known as the AP-1 binding site. Distinct combinations of AP-1 factors regulate different target genes and thus execute distinct biological functions (41Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). We tested if higher expression levels of JunB mRNA induced by BMP-2 correlate with higher AP-1 function. Gel mobility shifts were performed with a radiolabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide incubated in the presence of nuclear extracts from cells treated with or without 1 nmBMP-2 at different times. As shown in Fig.6, we obtained a single shifted band. This band was completely competed with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (data not shown). There was a binding increase in extracts from cells treated or not with factor for 1 h. This BMP-independent increase is likely to be due to the strong activation of c-Fos transcription, seen at 30 min in Fig. 3, since it has been described that c-Fos can be rate-limiting in the formation of heterodimers with the other AP-1 members (41Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). At later times, the intensity of the shifted band progressively increased in extracts from cells treated with BMP-2 in respect to their control counterparts. Preincubation of the extracts with antibody against JunB partly abrogates the binding, further suggesting the involvement of JunB in these AP-1 complexes (Fig. 6). These data suggest that induction of JunB results in formation of transcriptionally active AP-1 complexes specific for JunB-regulated genes. Whereas both BMP-2 and TGF-β induce JunB transcription and inhibit myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, only BMP-2 is able to transdiff"

Analyses of the immunoreactivity between neutral fraction glycolipids derived from various species of parasitic nematodes have indicated a high degree of serological cross-reactivity (1Baumeister S.

Little is known as to the biological activity of glycolipids, in general, and parasitic helminth-derived glycolipids, in particular, as regards their putative modulation of the host immune response via the cytokine network. Gangliosides have been found to be inhibitory in terms of cytokine synthesis and release (15Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Käfferlein E. Haas J.G. Meyer N. Ströbel M. Weber C. Flieger D. J.

Because of the physico-chemical similarity between glycosphingolipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria and the induction by the latter of bioactive protein mediators in the host, i.e. cytokines, responsible for the effects of endotoxemia (17Rietschel E.T.

An atypical, zwitterionic glycosphingolipid (as regards the linkage of the glucuronic acid residue to the ceramide moiety and the presence of nonacetylated glucosamine) from the LPS-negative, Gram-negative bacteriumSphingomonas paucimobilis induced the synthesis and release of the human mononuclear cell-derived, inflammation-associated cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1, and IL-6 but with approximately 10,000-fold less activity than LPS, in this respect. We report here on the structures and biological activity of two immunoreactive, zwitterionic fraction glycosphingolipids from A. suum in terms of their ability to stimulate the production of the human mononuclear cell-derived, inflammation-associated cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. Undamaged, washed adult male and female worms were collected from the local abattoir and stored at −70 °C until further use. LPS from Salmonella friedenau was kindly donated by H. Brade (Borstel Research Institute). Worms (800 g wet weight) were pulverized at −20 °C in a precooled Waring blendor and lyophilized. Glycolipids were isolated and purified as described previously (3Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Zähringer U. Geyer R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In short, glycolipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/water 10:10:1 (by vol), chloroform, methanol, 0.8 m aqueous sodium acetate 30:60:8 (by vol), and 2-propanol, n-hexane, water 55:20:25 (by vol) and evaporated to dryness. To remove most of the contaminating triglycerides, the residue was treated with acetone at 4 °C for 2 h. Neutral (N-/Nz-) and acidic glycosphingolipids were separated by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated with and the sample taken up in chloroform/methanol/water 30:60:8 (by vol). N-/Nz- glycosphingolipids were obtained in the flow-through, and the acidic glycosphingolipids were eluted with chloroform, methanol, aqueous 0.8 m sodium acetate 30:60:8 (by vol). Neutral (N-) and zwitterionic (Nz-) glycolipid fractions were further fractionated on a silica gel60 column (Merck). Homogeneous, zwitterionic components A and C were obtained by isocratic elution with chloroform/methanol/water 10:10:2.5 (by vol) from a silica gel60 column (1 × 50 cm, 70–250 mesh; Merck). The isolated Nz-glycosphingolipids, component A and C, and ceramide pentahexoside (CPH) derived from component A by HF treatment (see below) were subjected to sterile distilled water dialysis to remove potential cell culture-perturbing contaminants and traces of organic solvents. After Speed-Vac lyophilization, the glycosphingolipids were resuspended at 1 mg/ml in sterile distilled water, sonicated, and stored at −20 °C until further use. As a positive control, S. friedenau-derived LPS was solubilized in pyrogen-free phosphate-buffered saline at 1 mg/ml, neutralized with triethylamine, sonicated, and stored at 4 °C until further use. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were isolated with Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia) on density gradient centrifugation. The washed PBMC (106/ml) were cultured in U-form microtiter plates (Greiner, Nürtingen, Germany) at 200 μl in RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics, 10% heat-inactivated human serum, and the relevant glycolipid. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C (5% CO2), the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min and investigated for cytokine activity. The supernatants of glycolipid-stimulated PBMC were analyzed by bioassay as to the cytokine activities of TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 (19Feist W. Ulmer A.J. Wang M.H. Musehold J. Schlüter C. Gerdes J. Herzbeck H. Brade H. Kusumoto S. Diamantstein T. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.D. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 89: 73-90Crossref Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of TNF-α was determined with the TNF-sensitive L929 fibrosarcoma cell line (20Feist W. Ulmer A.J. Musehold J. Brade H. Kusumoto S. Flad H.D. Immunobiology. 1989; 179: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The proliferative capacity of IL-1 was assayed with human dermal fibroblasts (21Loppnow H. Flad H.D. Dürrbaum I. Musehold J. Fetting R. Ulmer A.J. Herzbeck H. Brandt E. Immunobiology. 1989; 179: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The proliferation of IL-6-dependent murine B9.9–3A4 hybridoma cells was applied to determine IL-6 activity. For HPTLC separation, HPTLC silica gel60 plates (Merck) were used. Glycolipids were dissolved at 2 μg/μl in chloroform/methanol/water 10:10:3 (by vol). For reproducibility, HPTLC was performed according to Nores et al. (22Nores G.A. Mizutamari R.K. Kremer D.M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 686: 155-157Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chloroform/methanol/water 10:10:3 (by vol) was used as the running solvent. For two-dimensional HPTLC, chloroform, methanol, 2% aqueous ammonia 10:10:3 (by vol) was employed as the second direction-running solvent. Glycosphingolipids were visualized using I2 vapor and/or by spraying the plates with orcinol/sulfuric acid (carbohydrate-positive compounds) or ninhydrin (free amino groups) and heating. For immunostaining, the developed HPTLC plates were fixed with polyisobutylmethylacrylate (Röhm & Haas, Darmstadt, Germany), blocked with phosphate-buffered saline and bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the phosphocholine-specific monoclonal antibody TEPC-15 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, as described elsewhere (1Baumeister S. Dennis R.D. Klünder R. Schares G. Zahner H. Geyer E. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1994; 16: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse Ig (Dako Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) was used as the secondary antibody. MALDI-TOF-MS data were obtained using a Vision 2000 instrument (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) operating in the positive-ion reflectron and linear modes. Ions were formed by a pulsed, ultraviolet laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) at 10 g/liter in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile 1:2 (by vol). LSIMS was carried out with a MAT 900 mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT) equipped with a cesium gun, which was operated at an emission current of 2–3 μA. Mass spectra were recorded at an acceleration potential of 5 kV with a resolution of approximately 3,000 and were acquired using a DEC 2100 data system. Spectra of native, peracetylated, or permethylated glycosphingolipids were recorded in the positive-ion mode using 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (Aldrich) as matrix. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 333 K on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer with deuterium-exchanged samples (0.9 mg each) for solutions in Me2SO-d 6 (99.96%; Aldrich) containing 2% (by vol) 2H2O (99.96%; Aldrich) using the 1H signal of dimethyl sulfoxide-d 5 (δH 2.49) as internal reference. All one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments like two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and two- and three-step related coherence transfer (RCT-1 and -2), were performed using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR, Version 1.3). Nz-glycosphingolipids (native or permethylated) were dried in a stream of nitrogen and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with 50–200 μl of HF (48%; Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Excess was removed in a stream of nitrogen at room temperature. Nz-glycosphingolipids were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 g/liter sodium taurodeoxycholate, and 0.5 milliunits of endoglycoceramidase (Sigma) were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, another 0.5 milliunits of enzyme were added. The reaction was stopped after 48 h by adding 400 μl of H2O and 400 μl of water-saturated n-butanol for phase separation of the reaction products. Nz-oligosaccharides obtained by endoglycoceramidase cleavage were reductively pyridylaminated (23Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 368-369Google Scholar) and the pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were separated by amino-phase HPLC, as described previously (24Lochnit G. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were cleaved after obligatory HF treatment with either α-d-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) from coffee beans (Boehringer Mannheim),N-acetyl-β-d-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) from jack beans (Sigma), or β-d-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25) fromHelix pomatia (Oxford Glycosystems, Abingdon, UK). For cleavage, the dried oligosaccharides were taken up in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with 50 milliunits of α-galactosidase, 166 milliunits of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and 25 milliunits of β-mannosidase, respectively. Nz-glycosphingolipids (20 μg) were permethylated both before or after HF treatment and hydrolyzed (25Paz-Parente J. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricard G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol acetates obtained after sodium borohydride reduction and peracetylation were analyzed by capillary GLC/MS using the instrumentation and microtechniques described elsewhere (26Geyer R. Geyer H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 86-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nz-glycosphingolipids were peracetylated with acetic acid/trifluoroacetic anhydride 1:2 (by vol) for 10 min at room temperature (27Dell A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Phosphocholine was released by HF treatment of Nz-glycosphingolipid components A and C. Liberated choline residues were derivatized with pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride (Supelco, Deisenhofen, Germany) and analyzed by LSIMS. Ethanolamine was identified as its 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-derivative by HPLC (28Hensel J. Hintz M. Karas M. Linder D. Stahl B. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) after HF treatment of component C. Nz-glycosphingolipid component C was treated with 200 μl of 750 mm aqueous sodium carbonate containing 20 μl of methyl iodide for 2 h at 50 °C (29Höltje J.V. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Höltje J.V. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6072-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thereafter, desalted on a reverse-phase cartridge (31Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For fatty acid analysis, Nz-glycosphingolipids (1–10 nmol) were hydrolyzed according to Gaver and Sweeley (32Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The resultant fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by capillary GLC/MS using the instrumentation described previously (26Geyer R. Geyer H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 86-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the separation of fatty acid species, a fused silica capillary column (DB1, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 60 m; ICT, Bad Homburg, Germany) was used. The column temperature was increased from 80 °C at 7 °C/min to a final temperature of 320 °C and held isothermally for 10 min. Spectra were recorded either after chemical ionization (CI-MS) with ammonia or electron-impact ionization (EI-MS) at an electron energy of 2.4033 × 10−17 J or 1.1215 × 10−17 J, respectively. For determination of the absolute configuration at C-2 of the contained hydroxy fatty acids, they were converted to the corresponding (R)-phenylethylamides and trifluoroacetylated as described previously (3Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Zähringer U. Geyer R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Sphingoid bases were analyzed after conversion to the corresponding fatty acids by periodate and periodate/permanganate oxidation as their methyl and picolinyl esters as described elsewhere (3Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Zähringer U. Geyer R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipids were separated into a neutral and acidic fraction by anion-exchange column chromatography. Two-dimensional HPTLC of the resultant neutral fraction indicated the presence of two groups of glycosphingolipids: N-neutral, Nz-neutral zwitterionic glycosphingolipids (see Fig.1). For isolation of the two main zwitterionic components A and C, the neutral fraction was subfractionated into a neutral and neutral zwitterionic fraction by silica gel column chromatography. A further silica gel column chromatography yielded four fractions designed as components A, B1, B2, and C. The fractions B1 and B2 represent nonhomogeneous, minor zwitterionic components and will not be discussed further in this publication. The two zwitterionic components A and C were separated on HPTLC by chloroform/methanol/water 10:10:3 (by vol) as running solvent. Both components gave positive reactions on incubation with iodine vapor, spraying with orcinol/sulfuric acid, and molybdate reagent (organic phosphate groups). HPTLC-immunostaining with the phosphocholine-specific monoclonal antibody TEPC-15 is shown in Fig.2. Due to the approximately 50-fold higher sensitivity of HPTLC-immunostaining, additional, minor species of components A and C resulting from heterogeneities in their lipid moieties were also visualized. The component C also reacted with ninhydrin, indicating the presence of a free amino group. HF treatment of the zwitterionic compounds yielded glycosphingolipids with migration properties on HPTLC similar to CPH, which showed no reaction with TEPC-15 or ninhydrin. Choline was identified after HF treatment of the components A and C by derivatization with pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride and analysis by LSIMS, yielding a molecular ion [M]+ atm/z 250. Ethanolamine was identified after HF treatment of compound C as its 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl derivative by HPLC and co-chromatography with the standard (data not shown). Since we consider A. suum merely as a model for the human parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides, allin vitro procedures were performed with human and not porcine PBMC. The zwitterionic components A and C and the component A-derived CPH were assayed as to their biological activity in inducing the inflammatory monokines TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 because of the postulated similarities in physico-chemical properties and biological activity between glycosphingolipids and LPS. Components A and C, but not ceramide pentasaccharide, were shown to be biologically active in terms of a dose-dependant response in the release of TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 (see Fig. 3). For IL-1 and IL-6, this dose dependence of cytokine release was evident up to and including 1000 ng/ml component A, with the apparent presumption that higher concentrations were inhibitory at the cellular level. Of the two zwitterionic glycolipids tested, component A was the more bioactive in inducing the monokines TNF-α and IL-1; component A and to a lesser extent component C were also capable of inducing low levels of IL-6 activity as demonstrated in three separate experiments (data not shown). The apparent inconsistency in concentration levels measured was due to the inherent between-experiment variability of the bioassay system with different human donors. For structural analysis, the zwitterionic components A and C were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS, LSIMS, methylation analysis, and exoglycosidase digestion. The results of MALDI-TOF-MS and LSIMS are summarized in Table I and methylation data in TableII.Table IAnalysis of zwitterionic glycosphingolipids A and C from A. suum by MALDI-TOF-MS and LSIMSComponentPseudomolecular ions obtained byCompositionMALDI-TOF-MSLSIMS− HF+ HFCalculatedLinearReflectorCalculatedLinearReflectorCalculatedA17321-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1732.01-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.15681-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.15681-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1566.91-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1710b1710.0bd17:1.C24h:0-Hex3HexNAc2PC1734.01-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1568.91-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1712b1712.0bd17:0.C24h:0-Hex3HexNAc2PC1669c1669.0c1899e,g1899.3e,g1671.0c1901.3e,g1653d1652.9d1921 c,g,i1921.3 c,g,i1654.9d1923 c,g,i1923.3 c,g,i2340b,h2340.2b,h2342b,h2342.2b,hC1833b1833.0b15681-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.15681-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1566.91-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1833b1833.0bd17:1.C24h:0-Hex3HexNAc2PC PE1835.0b1568.91-a, [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.1835.0bd17:0.C24h:0-Hex3HexNAc2PC PE1813f1812.0f1899e,g1899.3e,g1814.0f1901.3e,g1921 c,g,i1921.3 c,g,i1923 c,g,i1923.3 c,g,i2463b,h2463.2b,h2465b,h2465.2b,h1-a , [M + Na]+; b, [M + H]+; c, [(M − 87) + 2Na + H]+; d, [(M − 87) + Na + Li + H]+; e, [(M − 87) + Na + 2H]+; f, [(M − 45) + Na + 2H]+; g, permethylated; h, peracetylated; i, after the addition of sodium acetate.

After HF treatment, a pseudomolecular ion ([M + Na]+) atm/z 1568 was measured in linear and reflectron mode for components A and C, indicating a homologous glycolipid backbone with the composition Hex3HexNAc2-Cer corresponding to component CPH of the neutral glycolipid fraction ofA. suum (3Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Zähringer U. Geyer R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Positive-ion LSIMS of the native zwitterionic compounds A and C revealed pseudomolecular ions at m/z 1710, 1712 ([M + H]+) and 1833 ([M + H]+), respectively (see Table I). After permethylation, pseudomolecular ions at m/z 1899 ([{M − 87} + Na + 2H]+; loss of choline) were observed for both compounds due to the loss of the phosphoethanolamine substituent in component C during the permethylation procedure; the addition of sodium acetate shifted the pseudomolecular ions ([{M − 87} + 2Na + H]+) to m/z 1921, 1923. Pseudomolecular ions ([M + H]+) atm/z 2340, 2342 and m/z2463, 2465 were, respectively, observed after peracetylation of the two zwitterionic compounds (see Fig. 5), whereas pseudomolecular ions at m/z 2298, 2300 and 2379, 2381 and 2421, 2423, respectively, are most likely due to incomplete acetylation and/or ketene elimination. To locate the monosaccharide linkage and phosphodiester substitution positions, methylation analysis of the two zwitterionic compounds A and C was performed with the permethylation procedures both before or after HF treatment (Table II). If the permethylation procedure was performed after HF treatment, the compounds A and C showed similar results with terminal galactose, 3-substituted mannose, 4-substituted glucose, 4-substituted N-acetylglucosamine, and 3-substituted N-acetylgalactosamine (Table II, columns A1 and C1). HF treatment after the permethylation procedure revealed for compound A the presence of a 4,6-disubstitutedN-acetylglucosamine (Table II, column A2) that indicated location of the phosphocholine substituent at the C-6 ofN-acetylglucosamine. For compound C, a 4,6-disubstitutedN-acetylglucosamine and a 3,6-disubstituted mannose were found along with 3-substituted mannose (Table II, column C2), the latter of which is formed due to the lability of the phosphoethanolamine substituent to the conditions of the permethylation procedure (33Helling F.

If the phosphoethanolamine substituent was stabilized by methylation to choline before permethylation, the major mannose constituent was found to be 3,6-disubstituted mannose, indicating the localization of phosphoethanolamine at the C-6 of mannose (Table II, column C3). The zwitterionic glycolipids were cleaved by endoglycoceramidase, and the liberated oligosaccharides were reductively pyridylaminated and isolated by amino-phase HPLC.

https://openalex.org/W2320141410,"It has been shown recently that expression of p21 is enhanced by paclitaxel. This cytotoxic compound induces mitotic spindle damage resulting in blockade of the mitotic cell cycle associated or not with apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we showed that, in MCF-7 cells, paclitaxel induced accumulation of p21 in cells with a G2/M DNA content, corresponding to cells either in abnormal mitosis or in an interphase-like state (decondensed chromatin) with multiple nuclei. In MCF-7 cells, the increase in p21 was subsequent to the mitotic arrest and was associated with the exit from abnormal mitosis leading to formation of cells with micronuclei. In this cell line, we noted a relationship between the elevation of p21 expression and the inhibition of p34cdc2 activity. High levels of p21 protein were also found to be associated with inactive p34cdc2/cyclin B protein complex after treatment with paclitaxel. Treatment with p21 antisense oligonucleotide partially blocked induction of p21 expression by paclitaxel and significantly reduced survival of MCF-7 cells exposed to this agent. In NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, which are deficient in basal and paclitaxel-induced p21 expression, paclitaxel led to a prolonged activation of p34cdc2 and a delayed mitotic exit associated with apoptotic cell death. These observations suggest that p21 is not required for the mitotic arrest in response to paclitaxel, but argue in favor of a role for this inhibitor in facilitating the exit from abnormal mitosis. This effectively enhances cell survival after paclitaxel-induced spindle damage."
https://openalex.org/W2035402519,"The interleukin-2 CD28 response element (CD28RE) acts as a composite enhancer, in conjunction with a 3′-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE)-like element, to confer CD28 receptor-dependent inducibility to the interleukin-2 promoter in T-cells. When inserted as a single copy upstream of a basal promoter, this composite enhancer, termed the CD28RE-TRE, is both highly active and CD28-inducible in transactivation assays. A multicomponent nuclear protein complex that binds the CD28RE-TRE was isolated by DNA affinity chromatography from nuclear extracts of mitogen- and CD28 receptor-costimulated human T-cells. Immunological and biochemical analyses of this complex reveal the presence of c-Rel, ATF-1, and CREB2 as major DNA-binding components. Coexpression of c-Rel in combination with ATF-1, CREB2, or ATF-1/CREB2 leads to synergistic transactivation of a CD28RE-TRE reporter plasmid in quiescent Jurkat T-cells. Furthermore, CD28-dependent transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE is specifically inhibited by cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) dominant-negative expression vectors. Moreover, mutant promoter constructs in which the internal 5′-CD28RE and 3′-TRE-like sequences have been topologically positioned 180° out of phase with one another show loss of mitogen- and CD28-dependent inducibility. Finally, the addition of the CREB-binding transcriptional coactivator p300 leads to a dramatic CREB-dependent increase in both mitogen- and CD28-mediated transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE. These findings demonstrate that full physiological responsiveness to CD28 receptor stimulation in T-cells is dependent on topologically linked sequences within the CD28RE-TRE composite enhancer and provide strong support of a direct role for the CREB family of transcription factors and p300/CREB-binding protein coactivator proteins in cytokine gene induction during T-cell activation.

The extensive characterization of the molecular processes governing immune activation of T-lymphoctyes has produced one of the most instructive and informative model systems in the field of signal transduction biology (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 2Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A major area of interest to both signal transduction biologists and immunologists has been the elucidation of the mechanisms through which combined signals, derived from the T-cell surface, are integrated to achieve specific biological responses in the activated T-cell. In the case of T-lymphocyte immune activation, the generation of a fully functional immune response is dependent on the integration of dual signals that originate from cell-cell interactions between the antigen-reactive T-cell and the antigen-presenting B-cell or macrophage. The first of these signals is provided by the T-cell receptor, which makes contact with its target antigen in the context of the major histocompatibility complex type II receptor on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. In cell culture systems, this first antigen receptor-dependent signal can be replaced pharmacologically by mitogenic combinations such as ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IL-2, interleukin-2; CD28RE, CD28 response element; CD28RC, CD28RE-TRE-binding (response) complex; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TRE, TPA response element; bZIP, basic leucine zipper; aZIP, acidic extension leucine zipper; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. or phytohemagglutinin and PMA (4Weiss A. Imboden J. Shoback D. Stobo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The second signal is derived from additional events that are triggered by receptor-mediated interactions with accessory molecules on the T-cell surface. One such accessory molecule is CD28, which interacts with its counter-receptors B7-1 and B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (5Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A.

Science. 1991; 251 (and references therein): 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The interaction between the B7 counter-receptors and CD28 can be mimicked to a large extent by activating monoclonal antibodies (e.g. mAb 9.3) specific for the human CD28 receptor (11June C.H. Bluestone J.A. Nadler L.M. Thompson C.B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12June C.H. Jackson K.M. Ledbetter J.A. Leiden J.M. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. J. Autoimmun. 1989; 2: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Together with mitogenic signals that mimic the occupied T-cell antigen receptor, the CD28 receptor agonists provide a costimulus that leads to full T-lymphocyte activation. Although CD28 stimulation alone is non-mitogenic and does not stimulate T-cells, inhibition or loss of CD28 function in the presence of antigenic stimulation results in blunting of T-cell activation and ultimately can lead to anergy (13Harding F.A. McArthur J.G. Gross J.A. Raulet D.H. Allison J.P. Nature. 1992; 356: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). A large part of these receptor-mediated responses are governed at the level of transcription and, consequently, are mediated by multiple transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes encoding various cytokines responsible for propagating the immune activated state. One such cytokine is the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) (14Smith K.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). An enhancer within the interleukin-2 promoter that confers inducibility to CD28 costimulation was first identified as a 5′-AGAAATTCCA-3′ sequence located between positions −164 and −154, relative to the start of transcription (10Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251 (and references therein): 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 15Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14179-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of factors that can bind to and transactivate this sequence has identified a prominent role for the Rel family of transcription factors, in particular c-Rel and RelA, in CD28-mediated transcriptional regulation (16Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Lai J.H. Horvath G. Subleski J. Bruder J. Ghosh P. Tan T.H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). More recently, there have been reports suggesting a role for other transcription factors in governing CD28 responsiveness, including NFAT (nuclear factor of activatedT-cells), the high mobility group I/Y proteins, and an undescribed 35-kDa protein (19Civil A. Bakker A. Rensink I. Doerre S. Aarden L.A. Verweij C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8321-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Himes S.R. Coles L.S. Reeves R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These newer findings clearly imply that the precise mechanisms through which CD28 responsiveness is mediated at the interleukin-2 promoter have yet to be elucidated. This investigation was initiated with the hypothesis that the CD28RE may act physiologically as a composite element functionally linked to a non-consensus 3′-TPA response element (TRE; 5′-AGAGTCA-3′) located at positions −155 to −146. This non-consensus TPA response element (IL-2-TRE or NF-IL-2B) has been previously recognized as a site that is important for induction of AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity at the IL-2 promoter (22Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Sinskey A.J. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J.

Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This site, like other TREs, can bind in vitro to members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) class of transcriptional regulators, including the dimeric Fos/Jun AP-1 family (25Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 26Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and the related ATF/CREB family of proteins (27Papavassiliou A.G. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 1801-1805PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). The close juxtaposition of these CD28RE and TRE sites led to the speculation that, together, they may mediate CD28 responsiveness through their ability to coordinate a simultaneous occupancy by Rel-related and bZIP transcription factor complexes. Henceforth, this composite element will be referred to as the CD28RE-TRE enhancer. We propose that the CD28RE-TRE sequence, which spans positions −174 to −146 in the interleukin-2 promoter, can act individually as a single enhancer element to promote the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene. Evidence provided shows that a single copy of the CD28RE-TRE, when linked to a minimal basal promoter, can mediate a dramatically increased mitogen- and CD28-dependent transcriptional activation, which parallels the physiological regulation of interleukin-2 production. A DNA affinity-purified multicomponent complex containing c-Rel, ATF-1, and CREB2 was isolated from nuclear extracts of mitogen/anti-CD28 mAb-activated Jurkat T-cells and binds cooperatively to the CD28RE-TRE. Exogenous expression of c-Rel in combination with ATF-1, CREB2, or ATF-1/CREB2 leads to synergistic transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE in unstimulated quiescent T-cells. Furthermore, anti-CD28 mAb inducibility of the CD28RE-TRE requires phase-dependent alignment of the CD28RE and TRE sequences within the enhancer. CREB dominant-negative expression vectors inhibit endogenous mitogen/anti-CD28 mAb inducibility. Finally, we show that a near 100-fold superinduction of the CD28RE-TRE by enforced expression of the CREB-binding coactivator p300 is CREB-dependent. These findings establish that the CD28RE-TRE enhancer functions as a composite element in response to CD28 costimulation and provide compelling evidence for a prominent and direct role for the CREB family of proteins and p300/CREB-binding protein in the transcriptional activation of interleukin-2.

Jurkat T-cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells (1–2 × 107) were resuspended in 250 μl of ice-cold phosphate buffer with 2.5–8 μg of reporter plasmid and 1–8 μg of the indicated expression vectors, followed by electroporation (200 V, 1180 microfarads). The cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C. Following transfection and resuspension, the cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with either 1 μm ionomycin and 50 ng/ml PMA or 1 μm ionomycin and 50 ng/ml PMA plus a 1:1000 dilution of mAb 9.3 ascites. All transfections studies were performed in duplicate (or more) in all cases and are representative of at least two independent experiments. CAT activity in cell extracts was determined as described (40Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Quantitation of CAT activity was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. A CD28RE-TRE DNA affinity column was generated by coupling 4 mg of 5′-amino-modified duplex oligonucleotide encoding the CD28RE-TRE sequence (see above) to 4 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin using a previously described procedure (41Gardner K. Moore T.C. Davis-Smyth T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32963-32971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat T-cells were grown to a final density of 8 × 105/ml in 8 liters of RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in a final volume of 2 liters of RPMI 1640 medium. The resuspended cells were stimulated, for 8 h, by the addition of 1 μm ionomycin, 50 ng/ml PMA, and a 1:1000 dilution of affinity-purified anti-CD28 mAb 9.3 (courtesy of Carl June, Naval Medical Research Institute). Following stimulation, nuclei were isolated, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (42Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30089-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4 °C. The nuclear extract (final volume of 40 ml) was dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 175 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.05% Tween 20, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5 (buffer A). Following dialysis, the extract was passed over an 8-ml DNA-cellulose column at 10 ml/h. The eluate was collected and then loaded onto a 4-ml CD28RE-TRE oligonucleotide DNA affinity column at 3 ml/h. The column was then washed successively with 20 ml of buffer A containing 175 mm NaCl, 250 mm NaCl, and 600 mm NaCl. A protein peak was eluted from the column with buffer A containing 1.2 m NaCl. This peak was assayed for CD28RE-TRE DNA binding activity and then stored at −80 °C. Under these conditions, the affinity-purified CD28RC was stable for at least 24 months with no loss in the quantity or quality of the DNA binding activity. Antibodies against c-Rel, CREB2, ATF-4 (CREB2), and ATF-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz. The anti-CD28 mAb 9.3 ascites was obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Seattle, WA). EMSA analysis and antibody supershift analysis were performed on 4 and 8% polyacrylamide gels at 24 °C as described previously (42Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30089-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Competition analysis with duplex DNA oligonucleotides was carried out with oligonucleotides that had been normalized for concentration by absorbance at 260 nm, followed by a final adjustment by densitometric scanning of the duplex oligonucleotides analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained gels. Interleukin-2 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent analysis using the Quantikine immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As has been shown previously, ionomycin/PMA-induced activation of interleukin-2 production and IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T-cells is further up-regulated by costimulation with anti-CD28 mAb (Fig.1 A) (10Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251 (and references therein): 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). This inducibility is similar to the transcriptional activation of the intact IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene reporter plasmid (IL-2-CAT) in transiently transfected Jurkat T-cells (Fig.1 B, left panel). The activity of the transfected interleukin-2 promoter is closely paralleled by the ionomycin/PMA and anti-CD28 mAb inducibility of a reporter plasmid containing a single copy of the CD28RE-TRE linked to a basal promoter (Fig. 1 B). Interleukin-2 production, IL-2 promoter activity, and activation of the CD28RE-TRE enhancer were not induced by pretreatment of quiescent cells with anti-CD28 mAb alone (data not shown; see Refs. 5Thompson C.B.

An examination of the CD28RE-TRE sequence demonstrates potential binding sites for numerous transcription factors (TableI). 2Data in Table I were compiled from previous studies (17Lai J.H. Horvath G. Subleski J. Bruder J. Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Himes S.R. Coles L.S. Reeves R. Shannon M.F.

In an attempt to assess the possible role of specific transcription factors as modulators of CD28-responsive sequences, many earlier studies have relied heavily on experimental designs in which the candidate proteins were overexpressed at excessive levels in vivo or bound to DNA at excessive concentrations in vitro to approximate their potential physiological role in the intact cell. Although a useful approach to assess the gross biochemical feasibility of the involvement of specific factors at targetedcis-regulatory elements, this approach suffers from several limitations. The excessive levels of expressed protein in such experiments limit their interpretation due their extreme deviations from normal physiological conditions and their severe suprastoichiometric levels when compared with other potential endogenous partners, coactivators, or regulators. Moreover, the inherent redundancy of DNA binding sequence specificity within and between different transcription factor families obscures the identification of those factors that may truly be involved in transcriptional regulation at a specific site. These limitations also extend conceptually to those transfection studies that commonly use reporter plasmid vectors containing multimerized copies of the particular cis-elements under investigation. Even though this approach has and will continue to be a useful approach for the investigation of transcriptional activation, the superficial synergy engendered by the presence of tandem copies of test sequences in minimal promoters invariably results in reduced sensitivity to important aspects of regulation and protein specificity.Table IPotential transcription factor recognition sites within the CD28RE-TRECD28REGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAGCD28RE consensusGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(8/10) κBGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(9/10) c-RelGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(8/10) RelAGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(6/10) p50GGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(7/10) RelAGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(6/10) p50GGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(5/5) HMG1-aHMG, high mobility group.I/YGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(4/5) Elf-1GGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(4/7) NFATGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG(6/7) AP-1/CREBGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAG1-a HMG, high mobility group. Open table in a new tab We have attempted to address these technical and conceptual limitations in transfection studies by using reporter plasmid constructs containing only a single copy of the target CD28RE-TRE sequences. To more accurately identify the possible candidates that may regulate the CD28RE-TRE under physiological conditions, we chose to biochemically analyze the components of a CD28RE-TRE-binding protein complex affinity-isolated from nuclear extracts of mitogen- and anti-CD28 mAb-costimulated Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 2). The natural derivation of this complex, from large-scale preparations of activated T-cell nuclear extracts, offers a more reasonable emulation of the native stoichiometries and levels of the individual components in the cell. Although disrupted by the extraction procedure, such extracts offer the closest biochemically accessible approximation of the in vivo state. A DNA-binding protein complex was isolated from ionomycin/PMA/anti-CD28 mAb-stimulated Jurkat T-cells by DNA affinity chromatography (Fig. 2). EMSA analysis of the affinity-purified CD28RC reveals the presence of three major complexes of varying mobility, designated A, B, and C (in order of decreasing electrophoretic mobility). A dose-response analysis of increasing the concentration of the CD28RC shows a cooperative increase in the formation of the B and C complexes, whereas the A complex increases linearly (Fig. 2, right panel). Although the appearance of the C complex is variable and could represent aggregation, the differential increase in the formation of these complexes suggests that the B and C complexes may be assembled from more than one component. Competition analysis of the CD28RE-TRE DNA binding activity of the affinity-isolated material was carried out with unlabeled wild-type CD28RE-TRE duplex oligonucleotides or mutant CD28RE-TRE sequences containing 8- and 9-base transversions in the CD28RE (mCD28RE-TRE) and TRE (CD28RE-mTRE) regions of the composite enhancer (Fig.3 A). Sequence mutations in either the CD28RE or TRE region impair specific competition of the A and B complexes (Fig. 3 B). Direct comparison of the ability of the A and B complexes to form on wild-type versus mutant CD28RE-TRE sequences shows that the formation of the A complex has a strong dependence on the integrity of both the CD28RE and TRE regions of the enhancer (Fig. 3 C). The formation of the B complex is completely abolished by a mutation in the TRE region of the enhancer sequence; however, a complex that comigrates with the wild-type B complex is still capable of forming on the enhancer sequence with a mutation in the CD28RE region. Thus, both the CD28RE and TRE regions of the CD28RE-TRE composite enhancer are important for sequence-specific DNA binding and formation of DNA-protein complexes formed on the CD28RE-TRE. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3 E, results from a screen of inhibiting/supershifting antibodies showed that antibodies to c-Rel, ATF-1, and CREB2 caused significant inhibition of the B complex and a coincident for"
https://openalex.org/W2315783157,"We have investigated the relationship between the development of tumor resistance towards the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and p53 function, using the TNF-sensitive MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and two TNF-resistant sublines, MCF7/R-A1 and MCF7/Adr. Use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing shows that MCF7 has a wild-type p53 gene, whereas both TNF-resistant sublines exhibit mutant p53. This includes a point mutation R280K in MCF7/R-A1 cells, and a point mutation at the splicing acceptor site on the upstream border of exon 5 resulting in a 21 pb deletion in MCF7/Adr cells. These mutations result in loss of p53 capacity to transactivate FASAY (functional assay in yeast). In contrast to what is observed for parental MCF7 cells, treatment of resistant sublines with TNF or γ-irradiation fails neither to induce the expression of the p53-regulated gene products p21waf1/CIP1 and MDM2, nor to arrest the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Disruption of p53 wild-type function in MCF7 cells by transfection with human papillomavirus type-16 E6 gene, leads to abrogation of the cytotoxic, but not the cytostatic activity of TNF. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that wild-type p53 is involved in cytotoxic action of TNF, and point out that loss of p53 function contributes to resistance of tumor cell to TNF-induced killing."

https://openalex.org/W2146280395,"Circadian clocks function to govern a wide range of rhythmic activities in organisms. An integral part of rhythmicity is the daily control of target genes by the clock. Here we describe the sequence and analysis of a novel clock-controlled gene,ccg-7, showing similarity to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a glycolytic enzyme widely used as a constitutive control in a variety of systems. That ccg-7encodes GAPDH was confirmed by demonstrating that in vitrosynthesized CCG-7 possesses GAPDH activity. Rhythms in bothccg-7 mRNA accumulation and CCG-7 (GAPDH) activity are observed in a clock wild-type strain where the peak in GAPDH activity lags several hours behind the peak in ccg-7 mRNA accumulation in the late night. Together with our previous observation that ccg-7 mRNA is not developmentally regulated, we show that ccg-7 is not induced by environmental stresses such as glucose or nitrogen deprivation (which also trigger development), heat shock, or osmotic stress. Thus, the finding that GAPDH is clock-regulated points to a specific role for the circadian clock in controlling aspects of general metabolism and provides evidence for circadian regulation of a gene found in most living organisms.

Thus, the finding that GAPDH is clock-regulated points to a specific role for the circadian clock in controlling aspects of general metabolism and provides evidence for circadian regulation of a gene found in most living organisms. Circadian rhythms are daily rhythms that are generated and controlled by endogenous, self-sustaining, temperature-compensated biological clocks that can be reset by environmental cues (reviewed in Ref. 1Edmunds L.N. Am. J. Anat. 1983; 168: 389-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These rhythms are observed in a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals and are coordinated with exogenous environmental cycles to limit activities at particular times of the day. One important aspect of rhythmicity involves control of specific target genes within an output pathway on a daily basis by the circadian clock. The Neurospora circadian clock controls the timing of asexual spore (conidium) development, where conidiation is initiated once every 22 h in wild-type strains grown under constant environmental conditions. The oscillator regulating this timed behavior is a negative autoregulatory feedback loop that directs rhythmic expression of the essential clock gene, frq(frequency) (2Aronson B.D. Johnson K.A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, frqmRNA and FRQ protein have been shown to be responsive to environmental signals, providing a molecular explanation for how the clock can be reset (3Crosthwaite S.K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1003-1012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Garceau N.Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This general understanding of theNeurospora crassa clock system provides an ideal background for the analysis of clock output pathways. Analysis of clock output pathways in many organisms has focused on three general questions: what is the extent of clock regulation of gene expression, what functions do the ccg(clock-controlled gene) genes have in the cell, and how are the ccg genes regulated? To begin to address these questions in Neurospora, two clock-regulated genes were isolated using subtractive hybridization (5Loros J.J. Denome S.A. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1989; 243: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,6Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and six more genes were later identified using differential screening (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because the levels of all previously isolated N. crassa ccg genes peak in the late night to early morning corresponding to the time of day at which conidiation takes place (5Loros J.J. Denome S.A. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1989; 243: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Mol. Cell.

A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it has been widely assumed that the ccg genes are directly and uniquely associated with this asexual developmental pathway. This clock-regulated developmental association was viewed to be distinct from that imagined for “housekeeping genes” whose expression was expected to be relatively time-invariant; this expectation of time-invariant expression underlies the use of genes such as GAPDH 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CT, circadian time; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase. 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CT, circadian time; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase. as loading or normalization controls. Given this, it was of particular interest in the analyses of a recent set of novel ccg genes (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to find three ccg genes that are neither light- nor developmentally regulated. This suggested that the circadian clock could be regulating cellular metabolism at a much more basic level than had been anticipated. Here we show this to be the case. One of the clock-controlled genes,ccg-7, encodes N. crassa GAPDH, the first energy-harvesting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway and the homolog of an mRNA often used as a “constitutively expressed control” in different tissues and cell types. Although we find circadian regulation to be apparent at the level of both mRNA and enzyme activities,ccg-7 mRNA levels are refractory to changes in many common environmental stimuli, reinforcing the unique importance of this circadian influence. Through GAPDH regulation, the circadian clock may be controlling the glycolytic pathway and thereby influencing the organism's fundamental metabolic activities. ccg-7 is a clock-regulated gene encoding a product participating in basic metabolism, a function found in most living organisms. The regulation and identity of ccg-7 suggest that circadian influences may be more pervasive at the cellular level than previously anticipated. All experiments described in this report were carried out using strain bd; A (30-7, laboratory stock). Growth conditions and media ofNeurospora cultures were as described (8Davis R.L. deSerres D. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 27: 79-143Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCCG7 includes ccg-7 cDNA in pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) and was isolated from differential screening of morningversus evening λZapII cDNA libraries (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A 4.5-kilobase PstI fragment and a 3.0-kilobaseBamHI-XhoI fragment from ccg-7 genomic DNA were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+), resulting in plasmids pMLS701 and pMLS702, respectively. The plasmid pKL119 (9.Lindgren, K. M.

Mycelial samples were grown in constant light for 4 h and then transferred to constant darkness to synchronize the clock and to initiate rhythmicity (CT 12) (2Aronson B.D. Johnson K.A. Loros J.J.

(Circadian time (CT) represents a normalization of biological time to 24 circadian hours/cycle in strains or organisms with different period lengths. By convention, CT 0 represents subjective dawn and CT 12 represents subjective dusk.) Standard growth medium includes 1 × Vogel's medium (8Davis R.L. deSerres D. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 27: 79-143Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar) plus 2% glucose. Analyses of the changes in RNA levels resulting from environmental changes were carried out by challenging mycelia, grown in standard growth medium, with a modified medium to apply environmental stress. These manipulations were performed in the dark, and then all samples were harvested at the same developmental age and at the same circadian time. For heat-shock analyses, mycelia were incubated in growth medium preheated to 47 °C as described previously (16Kapoor M. Curle C.A. Runham C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 212-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic stress was accomplished by transferring mycelia for the indicated times into growth medium containing 4% NaCl. To examine the effects of glucose and nitrogen deprivation, cultures were transferred to 1 × Vogel's medium minus 2% glucose or 1 × modified Vogel's medium (Vogel's salts lacking NH4NO3) containing 2% glucose, respectively. Prior to transfer to the nutrient-deficient media, the mycelial pads were washed four times in nitrogen- or glucose-deficient media. A ccg-7 genomic clone, G5:7H, was isolated from the Orbach/Sachs genomic cosmid library (pMOcosX, Fungal Genetics Stock Center) by colony hybridization (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a ccg-7cDNA probe radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol; DuPont). Two subclones, pMLS701 and pMLS702, were constructed from the cosmid clone. Automated sequencing of both strands ofccg-7 cDNA and genomic DNA was accomplished using the Applied Biosystems Prism Dye deoxy sequencing kit using nested oligodeoxynucleotide primers. DNA and putative amino acid sequences were compared with other known genes and peptides using the BLAST search from the GenBank™/EMBL non-redundant data base. 3This can be accessed through the NCBI Web Server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST). The program CLUSTALW (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) was used to align amino acid sequences. Quantitation of Northern and Western blots was performed on scanned images (Silverscanner III, LaCie) by densitometry using the NIH Image 1.60 program (19.Raband, W. (1996) 1.60 Ed., National Institutes of Health.Google Scholar), and linearity of density was confirmed by loading different amounts. mRNA extraction was carried out as described previously (2Aronson B.D. Johnson K.A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis was carried out according to the method described by Ehrenman et al. (20Ehrenman K. Pedersen-Lane J. West D. Herman R. Maley M. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5875-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using an end-labeled primer, 7-NR4 (TGACCTTCTTGCCGTTGAC, corresponding to nucleotides 886–904 downstream from the transcription initiation site; see Fig. 1). Protein extraction and detection of FRQ by Western blot analysis were accomplished as described (15Garceau N.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The ccg-7 gene (from pCCG7) and the cmt (ccg-12; coppermetallothionein (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)) gene (from pCCG12) were expressed in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TNT™ coupled reticulocyte lysate systems, Promega) as recommended by the supplier. GAPDH and alkaline phosphatase enzymatic assays were carried out using total Neurospora protein extracts used for the FRQ Western analysis. GAPDH activity was measured as described by Hochberg and Sargent (21Hochberg M.L. Sargent M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed using the Sigma diagnostics alkaline phosphatase reagent as recommended by the supplier. One unit of GAPDH and alkaline phosphatase activities was calculated by determining the increase of NADH concentration in a reaction mixture at 340 nm (22Amelunxen R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and of p-nitrophenol concentration at 405 nm, respectively. UDG activity was assayed as described by Meyer-Siegler et al. (23Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurzer J. deRiel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Lysates containingin vitro synthesized CCG-7 or CCG-12 protein were used directly in the UDG reaction mixture as described by Slupphaug et al. (24Slupphaug G. Olsen L. Helland D. Aasland R. Krokan H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5131-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amounts of [3H]dUTP released from a tritiated DNA substrate were measured as UDG activity. ccg-7 was sequenced, and its conceptual amino acid sequence was found to have a high degree of similarity to GAPDH peptides from diverse organisms (Figs. 1 and2. Based on RNA hybridization, cDNA size, and primer extension analysis, ccg-7 encodes a single processed transcript of 1226 nucleotides (excluding the poly(A) tail) that contains a short 5′-untranslated region (43 nucleotides) followed by a single open reading frame of 338 codons. Two introns of 567 and 76 nucleotides are processed out of the primary transcript, the former being unusually large for N. crassa genes (25Edelmann S.E. Staben C. Exp. Mycol. 1994; 18: 70-81Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The presence and position of the shorter intron within the coding region are conserved among GAPDH genes from some filamentous ascomycetes (26Riddler R. Osiewacz H.D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Jungehulsing U. Arntz C. Smit R. Tudzynski P. Curr.

(While this paper was in revision, the same sequence appeared in a clone identified during work in the Neurospora am gene and was identified as encoding GAPDH (32Sahni M. Kinsey J.A. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1997; 44: 47Google Scholar).) However, the longer intron within the 5′-untranslated region was not found in previously identified GAPDH genes from other fungal species. The 3′-untranslated region contains a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAT, nucleotides +1828 to +1833) followed by a poly(A) tail positioned after the last nucleotide at +1866 (Fig. 1). The conceptual CCG-7 sequence possesses the universally conserved GAPDH motif located at positions 155–162 (ASCTTNCL; underlined in Fig. 2), containing the catalytic site Cys-157. Other important residues for GAPDH enzyme activity, such as catalytic residues His-184, Thr-187, and Lys-191 and NAD+-binding residues Asp-37 and Phe-106 (30Templeton M.D. Rikkerink E.H. Solon S.L. Crowhurst R.N. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), are also perfectly conserved in CCG-7. Codon usage inccg-7 is biased, as previously reported for other genes fromN. crassa (25Edelmann S.E. Staben C. Exp. Mycol. 1994; 18: 70-81Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), where C is most preferred at the third position. Altogether, the data are wholly consistent withccg-7 encoding the N. crassa GAPDH gene. When analyzed under constant environmental conditions in the dark, ccg-7 mRNA levels showed a rhythm peaking in the late night (CT 18–0) (Fig.3, A and B). The period length of the ccg-7 mRNA abundance rhythm changed appropriately with the strain examined, 22 h in the clock wild-type frq + strain and 29 h in the long-period clock mutant frq 7 (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). The characteristics of stable rhythmicity with a period length reflecting the genotype of the strain (frq + versus frq 7 ) and of the constant phase (peak always in the subjective night) indicate that rhythmic expression of the ccg-7 gene is indeed controlled by the circadian oscillator. Amplitude of mRNA levels was often observed to be varied among different clock phenotypes. Although rhythmicity in ccg-7 transcript abundance is apparent, if CCG-7 protein had a long half-life under these conditions, rhythms in enzyme activity might not be evident. We first attempted to detect CCG-7 using antibodies directed against rabbit muscle GAPDH and againstTrypanosoma glyoxosomal GAPDH, but CCG-7 was not detected by either. Therefore, to test the metabolic significance of the rhythm inccg-7 mRNA, rhythmicity of GAPDH activity was assayed as a function of time (Fig. 3 C). An ∼1.5-fold rhythm in GAPDH activity was observed, with peak activity occurring in the early morning (CT 4–6) under conditions of constant darkness in liquid culture and in the absence of observable development. In control experiments using the same protein extracts, the clock component protein FRQ showed the characteristic rhythms in abundance and time-of-day-specific phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A) (15Garceau N.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), confirming a robust and functional clock in these cultures. On the other hand, alkaline phosphatase activity stayed constant (Fig.3 C), as previously suggested (21Hochberg M.L. Sargent M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As protein extracts were obtained from replicate samples from the same cultures used to isolate RNA samples, these data indicate that a 4–8-h time lag occurs between the peaks of ccg-7 mRNA and GAPDH enzyme activity levels. The data indicate a stable and consistent time-of-day-specific regulation of GAPDH activity that persists in the absence of environmental changes or overt developmental progression. Circadian clocks are generally understood as being evolutionarily adaptive by virtue of the eligibility they confer on the organism to anticipate regularly observed changes in the environment. Thus, to understand better what role the observed GAPDH rhythm might play in the life of Neurospora, we examined the response of ccg-7 to acute environmental stimuli and agents of stress (Fig. 4) found to affect the expression of some other ccg genes (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All samples were harvested at the same circadian time corresponding to approximately halfway between trough and peak of ccg-7 mRNA levels. Although positive control genes (hsp30 and ccg-1) respond in a typically robust manner to these stimuli (13Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 9295: 5032-5036Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar),2 ccg-7 mRNA levels clearly showed no increase under heat shock or osmotic stress, and occasionally, heat shock resulted in a small but real decrease in expression levels (Fig. 4,A and B). Next, since it is known that developmental induction of conidia occurs in a relatively synchronous fashion, beginning late each night and extending through the morning, we examined the response ofccg-7 to nitrogen and carbon starvation, agents known to trigger development (11Sokolovsky V.Y. Lauter F. Muller-Rober B. Ricci M. Schmidhauser T.J. Russo V.E.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2045-2049Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Ricci M. Krappmann D. Russo V.E.A. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1991; 38: 87-88Google Scholar). Nitrogen deprivation increased the mRNA levels of the control gene eas (ccg-2) (11Sokolovsky V.Y. Lauter F. Muller-Rober B. Ricci M. Schmidhauser T.J. Russo V.E.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2045-2049Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but not those of ccg-7 (Fig. 4 C). In response to glucose starvation, we consistently observed a slight decrease in ccg-7 mRNA levels during the first 5 h and a substantial drop at 6 h following glucose deprivation (Fig.4 D). It is possible that poor availability of the GAPDH substrate, due to low glucose, may cause a decrease in ccg-7mRNA levels. In this experiment, the control glucose-derepressible gene ccg-1 responded as expected (10McNally M.T. Free S.J. Curr. Genet. 1989; 14: 545-551Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Two other agents known to trigger development, light and desiccation, have also been analyzed recently (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and shown not to affect ccg-7 mRNA levels. Thus, ccg-7 does not respond to these classic developmental stimuli. GAPDH activities were compared among in vitro expression reaction mixtures containing the protein products of either ccg-7 or, as controls, cmt(ccg-12) or lysate only. The translation mixture to which ccg-7 was added had significant GAPDH activity compared with controls (Fig.5 A), confirming thatccg-7 encodes N. crassa GAPDH. Another possible role for the ccg-7 rhythm is suggested by the finding that a human GAPDH peptide, UDG/GAPDH, can function in DNA repair as UDG (23Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurzer J. deRiel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by the striking similarity between CCG-7 and human UDG/GAPDH (65.0%) (Fig. 2). Therefore, the same translation mixture was examined for UDG activity; however, reactions containing CCG-7 released amounts of [3H]dUTP equivalent to the negative controls (either lysate without expressed protein or lysate with CCG-12) (Fig. 5 B). If the Neurospora GAPDH possessed UDG activity and the same ratio of GAPDH to UDG applied as in the human enzyme, then based on the amount of GAPDH activity seen in the translation mixture, we would have expected to observe UDG activity corresponding to a signal ∼32-fold above background levels. Instead, our results indicate that CCG-7 has no significant UDG activity; this suggests that the ccg-7 gene functions exclusively or predominantly as the Neurospora GAPDH, as distinct from human UDG/GAPDH. Both sequence and functional analyses show that the clock-controlled gene ccg-7 encodes GAPDH, a key enzyme in glycolysis. Although numerous ccg genes have been linked to organism-specific behaviors such as photosynthesis (34Kay S.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), aspects of development (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Bell-Pedersen D. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), or animal reproduction (35Foulkes N.S. Duval G. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 381: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Bernard M. Klein D.C. Zatz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), this study provides an example of a clock-regulated gene that participates in an aspect of fundamental metabolism that is common to most living organisms. Circadian rhythmicity is observed both for ccg-7mRNA levels (peaking around the night, CT 18–0) and for GAPDH activity levels (peaking around the early morning, CT 4–6) under constant conditions in the dark. This time-of-day-specific variation in GAPDH enzyme expression is made more interesting by the fact that GAPDH mRNA and proteins are often used as “constitutive” controls in a variety of studies. Our data indicate a 4–8-fold amplitude in theccg-7 mRNA rhythm and a low amplitude rhythm in GAPDH activity, consistent with the presence of additional post-transcriptional and/or post-translational factors affecting expression of enzyme activity. A rhythm in GAPDH activity (albeit with a different peak time) was suggested by one previous study (21Hochberg M.L. Sargent M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in cultures grown on solid media, where circadian development (conidiation) occurs. Although the presence of clock-controlled development in the study made it appear likely that the rhythm was reflecting the rhythm in development and mass accumulation, our data show that levels of GAPDH mRNA and enzyme activity are influenced by a circadian clock. Thus, ccg-7 appears not to be regulated by development (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); and the gene is also not induced by environmental factors such as heat shock, osmotic stress, or carbon/nitrogen starvation. Indeed, we found ccg-7 mRNA levels in general to be refractory to change except for the observed modulation by the biological clock. Clock regulation of GAPDH is particularly interesting in view of the emerging numbers of reports regarding non-glycolytic roles for the GAPDH polypeptides. These include DNA repair (23Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurzer J. deRiel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 259: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar); translational control (43Sugahara T. Shirahata S. Sasaki T. Murakami H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); protein kinase activity (44Kawamoto R.M. Caswell A.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); interactions with microtubules (45Huitotel P. Pantaloni D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); and interactions with cell membranes (46Allen R.W. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 649-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While these activities were reported mainly in mammalian GAPDH, such roles for the GAPDH protein in lower eukaryotes cannot be ruled out a priori considering the high degree of sequence conservation of GAPDH among these organisms. Of these, we examined this possibility only with UDG activity, which was not detected in CCG-7. However, it may be that the Neurosporaenzyme also shows one or more of the other activities and that this is the primary reason for its rhythmic activity. Our rhythmic ccg-7 mRNA data, together with other data on GAPDH expression, may raise questions about the use of GAPDH as a normalization control. For example, GAPDH mRNA of another filamentous fungus, Aspergillus, is osmotically induced, 4N. K. Singh, personal communication. although this is not the case with ccg-7. In other systems, mRNA levels of GAPDH genes are responsive to pathogenic or cytotoxic agents; for instance, in potato, GAPDH mRNA levels are known to be induced byPhytophthora infection (causing potato blight) (47Laxalt A.M. Cassia R.O. Sanllorenti P.M. Madrid E.A. Andreu A.B. Daleo G.R. Conde R.D. Lamattina L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In cultured human keratinocytes, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, known to elicit pleiotropic toxic actions, induces mRNA levels of GAPDH (48McNulty S.E. Toscano W.A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other reports on mammalian GAPDHs also suggest that they are not constitutively expressed (49Quail E.A. Yeoh G.C.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Alexander M.C. Lomanto M. Nasrin N. Ramaika C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pendleton L.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since GAPDH plays an important role in glycolysis and a number of non-glycolytic roles in some cases as described above, changes in GAPDH activity could influence many other cellular activities and thereby facilitate adaptation to different challenges or growth conditions. Finally, another recent report of clock-regulated GAPDH from the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra suggests that our observation here is not an isolated phenomenon and that there might be some significance in clock-regulated GAPDH. Interestingly, as distinct from ccg-7, levels of Gonyaulax GAPDH mRNA do not show rhythmicity, but protein levels do (53.Fagan, T. F., Hastings, J. W., Society for Research on Biological Rhythms, 1996, 75, Jacksonsville, FL.Google Scholar), indicating post-transcriptional clock regulation. It may be possible that clocks influence the very core of glycolysis to regulate some aspects of general metabolism in a circadian fashion, although the exact role for the rhythm of GAPDH is still uncertain. If GAPDH oscillations exist to influence cellular activities, it may be that other enzymes in fundamental metabolic pathways are also clock-regulated in a manner coordinated with this GAPDH rhythmicity so as to enhance time-of-day-specific modulation of metabolism. A number of clock-regulated genes and proteins have been identified (5Loros J.J. Denome S.A. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1989; 243: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, there has been a great deal of diversity seen among clock output systems reflecting different organism-specific requirements, so that no clock-controlled gene identified to date, except ccg-7, had the potential to be ubiquitous. The high degree of GAPDH sequence conservation indicates that all modern GAPDH variants arose from a single ancestral enzyme (54Martinez P. Martin W. Cerff R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Perhaps in addition to sharing a common ancestor, modern GAPDHs share the common aspect of regulation by an internal timekeeper.

Present in this enhancer are an A/T-rich box that binds MEF-2 protein(s) and a G-rich box (AGTGGGGGAGGGGGCTGCG) that interacts with ubiquitously expressed factors. Both elements are required for tissue-specific expression of the gene in skeletal muscle cells. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a Kruppel-like zinc finger protein, termed β enolase repressor factor 1, that binds in a sequence-specific manner to the G-rich box and functions as a repressor of the β enolase gene transcription in transient transfection assays. Using fusion polypeptides of β enolase repressor factor 1 and the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain, we have identified an amino-terminal region responsible for the transcriptional repression activity, whereas a carboxyl-terminal region was shown to contain a potential transcriptional activation domain. The expression of this protein decreases in developing skeletal muscles, correlating with lack of binding activity in nuclear extract from adult skeletal tissue, in which novel binding activities have been detected. These results suggest that in addition to the identified factor, which functionally acts as a negative regulator and is enriched in embryonic muscle, the G-rich box binds other factors, presumably exerting a positive control on transcription. The interplay between factors that repress or activate transcription may constitute a developmentally regulated mechanism that modulates β enolase gene expression in skeletal muscle.

The interplay between factors that repress or activate transcription may constitute a developmentally regulated mechanism that modulates β enolase gene expression in skeletal muscle. The muscle-specific or β isoform of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) is encoded by a member of the enolase gene family, the expression of which is regulated in a tissue-specific and development-specific manner (1Feo S. Oliva D. Barbieri G. Xu W. Fried M. Giallongo A. Genomics. 1990; 6: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Giallongo A. Oliva D. Calı̀ L. Barba G. Barbieri G. Feo S. Eur. J.

The gene is primarily expressed in the cardiac and skeletal muscles, where, during embryonic development, the β isoform progressively replaces the nearly ubiquitous α isoform (5Fletcher L. Rider C.C. Adamson E.D. Luke B.M. Greaham C.F. Dev. Biol. 1978; 65: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, the message for the β enolase is first detectable in the cardiac tube and in the myotome (11Keller A. Ott O.M. Lamandé N. Lucas M. Gros F. Buckingham M. Lazar M. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); expression remains extremely low in skeletal primary fibers, whereas a striking increase occurs in the second generation of fibers at the fetal stage of development (6Barbieri G. De Angelis L. Feo S. Cossu G. Giallongo A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Keller A. Ott O.M. Lamandé N. Lucas M. Gros F. Buckingham M. Lazar M. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and a further increase is observed after birth. In the adult, β enolase is expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscles, with higher levels of expression detected in fast-twitch fibers than in slow-twitch fibers (11Keller A. Ott O.M. Lamandé N. Lucas M. Gros F. Buckingham M. Lazar M. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In vitro studies on myogenic cell lines and primary myoblasts have shown that the level of β enolase expression increases with terminal differentiation but, at variance with the majority of the muscle-specific genes, expression already occurs in proliferating myoblasts (6Barbieri G. De Angelis L. Feo S. Cossu G. Giallongo A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Lamandé N. Mazo A.M. Lucas M. Montarras D. Pinset C. Gros F.

Biol. 1992; 151: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β enolase, like desmin (9Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), belongs to a relatively small group of muscle-specific genes expressed in proliferating myoblasts, as well as in differentiated myotubes, and it has been suggested that it might be a marker of adult satellite cells in humans (8Peterson C.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2535-2540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). From these data, it can be presumed that regulation of the β enolase gene expression may take place at multiple levels and involve complex molecular mechanisms, making the gene a suitable model to investigate various aspects of muscle-gene transcriptional control. In the last few years, a great number of transcription factors and DNA regulatory elements have been identified as contributors to the activation of the muscle differentiation program. In skeletal muscle, the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins (MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF4), the ectopic expression of which can activate skeletal muscle gene expression in a wide range of non-muscle cell types, plays a pivotal role during development (12Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The MEF-2 family of MADS-box transcription factors, which bind an A/T-rich element found in the promoters and enhancer of the majority of skeletal and cardiac muscle genes, is involved both in a direct and indirect mechanism of transcriptional activation (13Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 14Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Recently, the scenario has become more complex, because several reports have outlined the importance of ubiquitously expressed factors in association with tissue-restricted factors to maintain tissue-specific expression. Functional cooperation between elements that bind ubiquitous factors and tissue-restricted factors has been demonstrated for the regulatory regions of both cardiac and skeletal muscle genes, and in almost all cases, these sequences are located in relatively close proximity (less than 60 bp), suggesting that protein-protein interactions might be involved in the cooperation (reviewed in Ref.15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that an apparently ubiquitous binding activity consists itself of a complex composed of a ubiquitous factor and a tissue-restricted cofactor, thus expanding the number of potential regulatory combinations required for the control of tissue-specific transcription during myogenesis (16Zou Y. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we identified several distinct regulatory regions in the human β enolase gene and characterized a muscle-specific enhancer present in the first intron of the gene (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element interacts through an A/T-rich box with members of the MEF-2 family of transcription factors and through a G-rich box, AGTGGGGGAGGGGGCTGCG, with a ubiquitous factor(s). Mutation of either the G-rich box, termed β enolase element 1 (BEE-1), 1The abbreviations used are: BEE-1, β enolase element 1; BERF-1, β-enolase repressor factor 1; dpc, day(s) postcoitum; kb, kilobase; bp, base pair; GAPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TK, thymidine kinase; ORF, open reading frame. or the A/T-rich box resulted in a significant reduced activity of the enhancer in transient-transfection assays, indicating that MEF-2 and BEE-1 binding factors are each necessary for tissue-specific expression of the β enolase gene in skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, sequences homologous to the BEE-1 site in association to a MEF-2 binding site are present in the transcriptional regulatory regions of several skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific genes (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a widespread pathway of muscle-gene transcriptional control. This article reports the isolation and characterization of a protein that binds in a sequence-specific manner to the BEE-1 element. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of four C2H2 zinc finger domains, which identify the protein as belonging to the family of transcription factors resembling the Kruppel segmentation gene product of Drosophila (17Rosenberg U.B. Schroder C. Preiss A. Kienlin A. Cote S. Riede I. Jackle H. Nature. 1986; 319: 336-339Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and high similarity with a human zinc finger protein, which has been shown to bind the promoter of the gene for the Vβ8.1 chain of the T-cell receptor (18Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of both transcripts and proteins expression in myogenic cells and tissues, coexpression of the protein with several β enolase reporter constructs, and the identification of a transferable repression domain indicated that the zinc finger factor acts as a repressor of β enolase gene transcription. Furthermore, the data reported indicate that in addition to the identified zinc finger protein that we have designated β enolase repressor factor 1 (BERF-1) and the expression of which is enriched in embryonic muscle, other factors bind to the BEE-1 element in adult muscle. These results support the hypothesis of regulatory pathway involving positive and negative regulators that bind to the same site or overlapping binding sites within the muscle-specific enhancer of the β enolase gene. A λ Zap II expression cDNA library was prepared with mRNA from limbs of 12-day mouse embryos using a cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The amplified expression library was screened by the method of Vinson et al. (19Vinson C.R. La Marco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landshulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) using as a probe double-stranded BEE-1 oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-AGCTGTTCTGAGTGGGGGAGGGGGCTGCGCCTGC-3′) that had been end-labeled and ligated into concatamers. One positive clone out of 2.0 × 106 plaques survived three rounds of plaque purification. The pBluescript phagemid was excised from the λ Zap expression vector by helper phage coinfection (R408 strain) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene). The isolation of additional cDNAs was carried out by standard methods using the cDNA identified by Southwestern screening as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clones were determined on both the sense and antisense strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase; United States Biochemicals). In vitrotranscription of the isolated clones was carried out with 2 μg of linearized pBluescript plasmid using an mRNA capping kit (Stratagene). In vitro translation was performed with a commercially available rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega), and when needed, [35S]methionine was added to the translation mixture. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and from limbs and hearts of adult mice or embryos isolated at 12, 14, and 16 days postcoitum (dpc) by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (20Chomczynski P.

Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis on denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridyzed as described previously (6Barbieri G. De Angelis L. Feo S. Cossu G. Giallongo A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 2.3-kb (kilobase) BamHI fragment containing the almost entire coding region was isolated from the A22 cDNA and used as a probe. As a control of the amount of RNA loaded per lane and to check differentiation of myogenic cells in cultures, filters were rehybridized with a chicken β actin cDNA (6Barbieri G. De Angelis L. Feo S. Cossu G. Giallongo A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and/or with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) cDNA (ATCC 5701) DNA fragments encoding different portions of the ZF22 protein were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). A 344-bp BstXI-AccI fragment and a 884-bp ClaI-BamHI fragment were isolated from the A22 cDNA, whereas a 2-kb EcoRV-BamHI fragment was excised from the A21 cDNA encoding the truncated ZF21 polypeptide. The three glutathione S-transferase-ZF22 fusion proteins, which consisted of the amino-terminal region from amino acid 26 to amino acid 111, the zinc finger region from amino acid 76 to amino acid 319 and the carboxyl-terminal region from amino acid 430 to amino acid 740, respectively, were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified by binding to glutathione-linked Sepharose beads (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-ZF22 polyclonal antisera were raised against the purified fusion proteins, and antibodies were immunopurified on columns containing the respective glutathioneS-transferase-fusion protein used as immunogen according to established procedures (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-137Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, nuclear proteins (5 μg), prepared as described in the following section, or total cell lysates (30 μg) obtained by extraction in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, were resolved by electrophoresis on an SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Corp.). The membrane was incubated with affinity purified anti-ZF22 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) and then with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pel-Freez) (1:5000).The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells and embryonic muscle tissue (limbs isolated from 12-dpc mouse embryos), as described previously (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of nuclear extracts from skeletal muscle tissue isolated from adult mice was according to Zahradadka et al. (23Zahradadka P. Larson D.E. Sells B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes and competitors in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs): BEE-1w (5′-AGCTGTTCTGAGTGGGGGAGGGGGCTGCGCCTGC-3′), wild-type consensus (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); BEE-1m (5′-AGCTGTTCTGAGTGGGACTCTAGGCTGCGCCTGC-3′), mutated consensus (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Sp1 site (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′), canonical Sp1 binding site (24Letvosky J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 17: 2639-2653Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar); E-boxL (5′-TTTAACCCAGACATGTGGCTGCCCC-3′), left E-box from muscle creatine kinase enhancer (25Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed by incubating end-labeled probes (0.1 ng, about 40,000 cpm) with nuclear extracts (4–8 μg) or in vitro-translated proteins (3 μl) as described previously (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the E-boxL was used as a probe, incubation was carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol as described by Ferrari et al. (26Ferrari S. Molinari S. Melchionna R. Cusella-De Angelis M.G. Battini R. De Angelis L. Kelly R. Cossu G. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 23-34PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm TBE (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 20 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) and visualized by autoradiography. For antibody interference, EMSAs were performed under the conditions described above except for the addition to the reaction mixture of 1 μl of antiserum. Anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were kindly provided by Dr. H. Schoeler (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany), and anti-MNF serum (27Bassel-Duby R. Hernandez M.D. Yang Q. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4596-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. R. Bassel-Duby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Nuclear extract from cells transfected with constructs expressing various GAL4-ZF22 fusion proteins were prepared according to Hoppe-Seyler et al. (28Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Rittmuller C. Doeberitz K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and DNA binding activity of the fusions was examined by EMSA using a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing one GAL4 binding site (5′-CTAGAGGTCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGACT-3′) as a probe (29Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Details about the construction of the β enolase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) expression vectors used in this study have been published (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter constructs containing multiple copies of the BEE-1 binding site or a mutated consensus site upstream of the β enolase promoter, termed pB3-BEE-1w4X and pB3-BEE-1m4X, were obtained by blunt-end ligation into the HindIII site of the pB3-CAT of BEE-1w or BEE-1m double-stranded oligonucleotides (four copies), respectively. Orientation and proper insertion of the four BEE-1 consensus sites was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses with appropriate primers and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A NarI-BamHI fragment containing the four wild-type or mutated consensus sites and the β enolase promoter was isolated from the above described constructs and used to replace the homologous fragment present in the pB3SV-CAT plasmid to generate pB3SV-BEE-1w4X and pB3SV-BEE-1m4X, respectively. For cotransfection experiments, ZF21/22 expression vectors encoding the short or the long form of the factor, were generated by inserting a 2.3-kbBamHI fragment, isolated from the A21 cDNA, and a 2.5-kbNciI fragment, isolated from the A22 cDNA, into theBamHI and EcoRV sites, respectively, of the cytomegalovirus promoter-directed expression vector pCDNAI (Invitrogen). The resulting constructs are indicated as pCDNAI-ZF21 and pCDNAI-ZF22. Plasmids expressing fusion polypeptides of ZF22 and the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain were obtained by inserting into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pSG424 (30Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) DNA fragments encoding different portions of ZF22. Briefly, anEcoRI site with the same reading frame as theEcoRI site in pSG424 was introduced at the 5′ end of the ZF22 coding region, using the following pair of oligonucleotide primers: forward, 5′ -CCGGAATTCAACATTGACGACAAACTGGA-3′ (oligomer A); reverse, 5′- ATCATGGGATATCATATCCTG-3′ (oligomer B). The 221-bp EcoRI-EcoRV DNA fragment obtained by PCR was used to replace the EcoRI-EcoRV fragment of the A22 cDNA, which contains the 5′-untranslated sequence, and the full-length coding sequence was then isolated by restriction withEcoRI and XhoI (the latter is the 3′-cloning site) and used to generate GAL4-ZF22 (2–794) (see Fig. 9). Constructs c, d, f, and g (shown in Fig. 9 B), which encode carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, were generated from the plasmid containing the full-length coding region by excision of DNA fragments up to the SacI, EcoRI, AccI, and EcoRV sites, respectively. Construct e, GAl4-ZF22 (2–184), was obtained by PCR using oligomer A as forward primer and as reverse primer, oligomer C (5′-CCGGAATTCATAGTTCGTTCTAAAGGCAG-3′), which contains an EcoRI cloning site. Similarly, construct k, Gal4-ZF22 (136–184), was obtained by PCR using oligomers D (5′-CCGGAATTCGAGCCAGTAGACTTACAGAA-3′) and C as forward and reverse primers, respectively. To generate construct j, GAL4-ZF22 (444–794), which encodes the carboxyl-half portion of the protein, theClaI-XhoI DNA fragment was first subcloned into pBluescript/ET-3a (Novagen) to add supplementary cloning sites in frame with the pSG424 polylinker. Finally, constructs h and i were obtained from construct j by excision of DNA fragments up to theEcoRI and SacI sites, respectively (see Fig.1 A for a partial restriction map). Nucleotide sequence of ZF22 DNA fragments generated by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing, whereas proper expression and stability of the GAL4-ZF22 fusion proteins was tested by immunoblot analysis on extracts of transiently transfected COS 7 cells, using a rabbit antiserum against the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (data not shown). In the case of cotransfection experiments with the various GAL4-ZF22 mutants, the reporter construct used was pG5TKCAT. This construct was obtained by inserting a HindIII-XbaI fragment, excised from the pG5E1bTATACAT plasmid and containing five GAL4-binding sites (31Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), upstream of the thymidine kinase gene (TK) promoter in plasmid pBL2CAT (32Luckow B. Schutz G.

Differentiation into myotubes was induced by exposure of subconfluent cultures to a medium containing 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg/ml of insulin (Sigma) for 48–72 h. Embryonic and fetal myoblasts were cultured from limbs of mouse embryos (11 dpc) and fetuses (16 dpc) as described previously (6Barbieri G. De Angelis L. Feo S. Cossu G. Giallongo A. Differentiation. 1990; 45: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,34Cossu G. Ranaldi G. Molinaro M. Vivarelli E. Development. 1988; 102: 65-69PubMed Google Scholar). PAF human fibroblasts, CV1 and COS7 monkey kidney cells, and C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts from laboratory stocks were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (35Graham F.L. Vander Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) as described previously (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of recombinant CAT plasmid, 2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pON1 (36Spaete R.R. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (used to monitor transfection efficiency), and 0.5–5 μg of BERF-1 expression vectors (either pCDNAI-ZF22/21 or GAL4-ZF22 constructs) were used to transfect 3–4 × 105 cells in a 5.8-cm-diameter culture dish. Cells were harvested 48 h later and subjected to β-galactosidase and CAT assays as described previously (15Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Calı̀ L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All transfections were performed on multiple sets of cultures with at least two different DNA preparations for each plasmid. The BEE-1 binding site is a G-rich element required to support muscle-specific expression of the β enolase gene together with an adjacent MEF-2 site. For isolation of BEE-1 binding factors, an embryonic muscle cDNA expression library was screened by the Southwestern method using a concatenated BEE-1 probe. One single clone (A21) that displayed sequence-specific binding to the BEE-1 probe was isolated (Fig.1 A). The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert revealed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 960 bp, potentially encoding a polypeptide of 320 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 35 kDa (Fig. 1 B, ZF21). Additional clones were isolated by screening the cDNA library with 5′ and 3′ fragments of the cDNA originally identified by Southwestern screening. One cDNA (A22) was sequenced and appeared to be identical to the one encoding ZF21 except for the presence of a longer 5′-untranslated region and a one-nucleotide deletion. This deletion would result in a frameshift (Fig.1 A) and the creation of an ORF of 2382 bp encoding a 794-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 89 kDa (Fig. 1 B, ZF22). The same deletion was found in six independent clones, suggesting that the originally isolated cDNA encoding ZF21 might be representative of a rare message or be the result of a reverse-transcriptase error that occurred during the preparation of the library. A search in the GenBankTM data base revealed a high similarity (79% at the nu"
https://openalex.org/W2012563603,"The molecular chaperone ClpX of Escherichia coli plays two distinct functions for bacteriophage Mu DNA replication by transposition. As specificity component of a chaperone-linked protease, it recognizes the Mu immunity repressor for degradation by the peptidase component ClpP, thus derepressing Mu transposition functions. After strand exchange has been promoted by MuA transposase, ClpX alone can alter the conformation of the transpososome (the complex of MuA with Mu ends), and the remodeled MuA promotes transition to replisome assembly. Although ClpXP can degrade MuA, the presence of both ClpP and ClpX in the reconstituted transposition system did not destroy MuA essential for initiation of DNA replication by specific host replication enzymes. Levels of ClpXP needed to overcome inhibition by the repressor did not prevent MuA from promoting strand transfer, and ClpP stimulated alteration of the transpososome by ClpX. Apparently intact MuA was still present in the resulting transpososome, promoting initiation of Mu DNA replication by specific replication enzymes. The results indicate that ClpXP can discriminate repressor and MuA in the transpososome as substrates of the protease or the molecular chaperone alone, degrading repressor while remodeling MuA for its next critical function.

Chaperone-linked proteases employ the action of a protease component and a regulatory subunit with ATPase activity. InEscherichia coli, ClpA and ClpX proteins serve as regulatory subunits for the protease subunit ClpP (1Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crécy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

These regulatory subunits can by themselves act as molecular chaperones, breaking up aggregates or changing quaternary interactions of specific protein substrates (4Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D.

Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The substrates of the molecular chaperone can become the targets of the chaperone-linked protease when the corresponding protease subunit is present (6Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular chaperones endow the protease with substrate specificity, most likely recognizing the substrate and presenting it to the protease subunit. ClpP is synthesized as a protein of 207 amino acids (7Gottesman S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7886-7893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of which 14 amino acids at the N terminus are autocatalytically removed to yield the mature enzyme (8Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Katayama Y. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Bowers B. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12536-12545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active protein consists of a tetradecamer, composed of two stacked heptameric rings (9Flanagan J.M. Wall J.S. Capel M.S. Schneider D.K. Shanklin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10910-10917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The structure of ClpP is analogous to the 20 S proteasomes of eukaryotes and Archaebacteria, with multiple active sites residing in the interior of the multimeric rings (10Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Presumably, the molecular chaperones unfold the substrate and feed it into the proteolytic chamber of the ClpP tetradecamer, leading to the apparently processive degradation of the substrate (11Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpX is known to be involved in two distinct stages of the Mu life cycle. As part of the ClpXP protease, it can promote entry of a lysogen into lytic development by degrading the Mu immunity repressor (12Geuskens V. Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Desmet L. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which serves to shut down Mu transposition functions for the establishment and maintenance of lysogeny. ClpX also promotes initiation of Mu DNA replication, a process that does not require ClpP (14Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Pato M. Gama M.-J. Toussaint A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It activates MuA's function of promoting transition to DNA synthesis after MuA's role in recombination has been completed (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). During transposition, the MuA transposase binds to the Mu ends (16Kuo C.-F. Zou A. Jayaram M. Getzoff E. Harshey R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and assembles into a tetramer (17Lavoie B.D. Chan B.S. Allison R.G. Chaconas G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which catalyzes transfer of each Mu end to target DNA (18Craigie R. Mizuuchi K.

Replication of Mu DNA by specific host enzymes completes transposition to form the cointegrate product (21Toussaint A. Faelen M. Mol. Gen.

Upon completing Mu strand transfer, MuA remains very tightly bound to the Mu ends, still holding the Mu ends together in a nucleoprotein complex known as the type II transpososome (or the strand transfer complex 1, STC1) 1The abbreviations used are: STC, strand transfer complex; STP, strand transfer product; RFI, closed circular duplex DNA; MRF, Mu replication factor; pol, polymerase; Rep, Muc+repressor protein; Vir, Mucvir3060 repressor protein; h-ClpP, histidine-tagged ClpP protein; pre-ClpP, ClpP protein with precursor peptide intact; SSB, single-strand binding protein; Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC,N-succinyl-leucine-tyrosine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; TLCK,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which permits initiation of DNA replication only by specific replication proteins including the DNA polymerase (pol) III holoenzyme and constituents of the multiprotein priming apparatus known as the φX174-type primosome (27Jones J.M. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6886-6895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MuA is also a substrate for the ClpXP protease (28Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) just as other known substrates of ClpX and ClpA as molecular chaperones are substrates of the corresponding chaperone-linked protease (reviewed in Gottesman et al. (29Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar)). Therefore, can ClpX in the presence of ClpP remodel MuA in STC1 without degrading it? Whether a protein substrate is degraded or remodeled may simply be determined by the availability of ClpP when the substrate is bound by the molecular chaperone. Such a model raises the question of how ClpX could perform the two distinct functions for Mu lytic development, first promoting degradation of repressor by ClpP and then remodeling MuA in STC1 for transition to replisome assembly. The first function requires ClpP but the second function could potentially be disrupted by the engagement of the ClpP proteolytic activity. ClpX would not be expected to act in isolation from ClpP in vivo to perform the second function, raising the question of what effect ClpP has on the DNA replication phase of Mu transposition. Here we report that ClpP does not interfere with MuA-mediated transition to DNA synthesis even when present in saturating amounts and in fact stimulates ClpX-promoted conversion of STC1 to STC2. E. coli BL21(DE3) (30Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) and plasmid pET-19b were purchased from Novagen. Plasmid pWPC9 (8Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Katayama Y. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Bowers B. Gottesman S. J. Biol.

Plasmid pGG215 (19Surette M.G. Buch S.J. Chaconas G. Cell. 1987; 49: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) bearing a mini-Mu element was used for Mu transposition in vitro. Phage f1 RFI DNA and φX174 RFI DNA were used as target substrates. Purified preparations of MuA, MuB, Muc+ (Rep), Mucvir3060 (Vir), and host proteins required for Mu transposition and replication have been described (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,31Nakai H. Kruklitis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19591-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA pol III* was purified from MGC1020 (W3110malE::Tn10, lexA3, uvrD::kan) obtained from Dr. Charles McHenry (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) as described previously (32Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of ClpP is described below. Restriction enzymes, DNA pol I, DNA pol I large fragment (Klenow), and E. coli DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs. Plasmid pCPX01 expressing ClpP with a polyhistidine tag fused to the N terminus (h-ClpP) was constructed by cloning anNdeI-BamHI fragment of pWPC9 (8Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Katayama Y. Rudikoff S.

The site at which ClpP is autocatalytically processed was retained on this expression vector. SYBR® Green I was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. HEPES and polyethylene glycol 8000 were purchased from Fisher. Trizma base, phosphocreatine, creatine kinase, polyethylenimine,N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC), 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC),N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and ribonucleoside triphosphates were from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin was from Worthington. Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) agarose was from Qiagen. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Glutaraldehyde was from Electron Microscopy Sciences. Nitrocellulose (BA83, 0.2-μm pore size) was from Schleicher & Schuell. Rabbit antibody against MuA protein was prepared by Biocon, Inc. The enhanced chemiluminescence system from Amersham was used for all immunoblots. Composition of buffers was for buffer A, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol; buffer B, 20 mmNaPO4 (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl; buffer C, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% w/v glycerol; cracking buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol; TAE electrophoresis buffer, 40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetic acid, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.1); and alkaline electrophoresis buffer, 30 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA. The protease activity of ClpP alone was measured by its ability to cleave the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC (33Woo K.M. Chung W.J. Ha D.B. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2088-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC (5 mm) was incubated with ClpP in buffer A (25 μl total volume) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 475 μl of ice-cold 0.6 m imidazole (pH 7.8) and transferred to a quartz cuvette suitable for analysis in an AMINCO Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer. To determine the amount of AMC generated, the sample was irradiated at 380 nm, and emission at 460 nm was measured and compared with a standard curve for AMC fluorescence. One unit of ClpP activity was defined as 10 pmol of AMC generated under the conditions described here. Strain BL21(DE3) transformed with plasmid pCPX01 was grown in 10 liters of modified terrific broth (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in a 14-liter New Brunswick fermenter (37 °C, A 595 = 2.0), and ClpP overproduction was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. After 30 min, cells were harvested into chilled bottles and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C (74 g of wet cells). Cells were resuspended in buffer B to an A 595 of 315 and transferred to Ti45 centrifuge tubes. All steps for protein fractionation were conducted at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. To the cell suspension, lysozyme was added to 300 μg/ml, and cells were placed on ice for 30 min. They were then subjected to three rounds of rapid freeze-thaw using liquid N2 and three bursts of sonication (10 s each). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor (35,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected (Fraction I; 140 ml; 10 g of protein). To remove nucleic acids, polyethylenimine was added dropwise to 0.16% with constant stirring over 10 min. Nucleic acids were removed by centrifugation in an SS34 rotor (9,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Protein was precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation and collected by centrifugation in an SS34 rotor (9,000 rpm, 30 min). Protein was resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer B and dialyzed twice (45 min each) against 1 liter of buffer B (Fraction II; 64 ml; 2.6 g). Fraction II was loaded at 1 column volume/h onto a Ni-NTA column (60-ml bed volume) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed extensively with buffer B and then with buffer B containing 25 mmimidazole. The column was then eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient from 25 to 600 mm imidazole in buffer B. Protein fractions containing ClpP (h-ClpP and processed ClpP) were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled (Fraction III; 225 ml; 76 mg). ClpP was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of acetone and collected by centrifugation in an SS34 rotor (9,000 rpm, 30 min). The protein was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B for 60 min. The sample was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to promote further autocatalytic processing of h-ClpP to the mature form (Fraction IV; 40 ml; 26 mg). Although acetone precipitation was employed in the preparation of Fraction IV to obtain high protein concentrations and to maximize purity, this step could be omitted to maximize yield of ClpP without significant loss of purity. Fraction IV was loaded at 1 column volume/h onto a Ni-NTA column (12-ml bed volume) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 24 ml of buffer B and then with buffer B containing 50 mm imidazole until no more protein eluted from the column. The majority of mature ClpP eluted during these washes and were pooled. The purified ClpP was dialyzed for 1 h against 1 liter of buffer C (Fraction V; 35 ml; 15 mg) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. STC1 was prepared as described previously using pGG215 donor substrate and f1 RFI DNA or φX174 RFI target DNA substrates (31Nakai H. Kruklitis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19591-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Where indicated, STC1 was deproteinized as described previously to form deproteinized STP (34Nakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23997-24004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures for Mu replication (50 μl) included STC1 or the deproteinized STP (equivalent of 0.25 μg of donor substrate) and the 8-protein system composed of DNA gyrase (335 ng), DnaB/DnaC complex (65 ng), DnaG (42 ng), DNA pol III holoenzyme (58 ng), SSB protein (45 ng), DNA pol I (0.01 unit), and DNA ligase (0.2 unit) or the 6-protein system, which lacks DNA pol I and ligase. Where indicated, reactions included 12 units of MRFα (Fraction III) prepared as described previously (31Nakai H. Kruklitis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19591-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) from E. coli strain AT3327 PriA1::Kan (27Jones J.M. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6886-6895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 0.04 unit each of PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT (see Marians (35Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for unit definition). Incubation was at 37 °C for 2–30 min. Reaction conditions and determination of total deoxynucleotide incorporation were as described previously (31Nakai H. Kruklitis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19591-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Replication products were extracted and linearized withEcoRI (f1 RFI target) or BamHI (φX174 RFI target), resolved on a 0.6% agarose gel (alkaline electrophoresis buffer) and stained with SYBR® Green I for detection by the Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 system. Gels were then dried for autoradiography or phosphorimagery. Phosphorimagery data was analyzed using ImageQuant software. All images of replication products in figures are from autoradiographs. Conversion of STC1 to STC2 was measured by detecting disruption of the synaptic complex of Mu ends by agarose gel electrophoresis. The synaptic complex is unstable in STC2 and is disassembled during electrophoresis (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing STC1 (equivalent of 0.25 μg of donor substrate, predigested with PstI (300 units/ml at 37 °C for 30 min)), ClpX, and ClpP (concentrations indicated in individual experiments) were incubated at 37 °C for 2–30 min under previously described reaction conditions (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped with EDTA (20 mm) and heparin (2 mg/ml), and products were resolved on a 0.6% agarose gel (TAE electrophoresis buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml EtBr). DNA was stained with SYBR® Green I for detection by the Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 system, and bands corresponding to STC1 and the disrupted complex (STC2) were quantitated using ImageQuant software. Glutaraldehyde fixation of nucleoprotein complexes, Western blot analysis, and isolation of nucleoprotein complexes by gel filtration were performed as described previously (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of Western blots detected by enhanced chemiluminescence was performed using Scan AnalysisTMsoftware from Biosoft. ClpP protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of purified ClpP protein was performed by Dr. A. Fowler (UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility). In plasmid pCPX01 the clpP and clpX genes are under the control of the phage T7 φ10 promoter (Fig. 1 A). ClpP protein is expressed with a polyhistidine tag fused to the N terminus (h-ClpP) for rapid purification on Ni-NTA agarose columns (see “Experimental Procedures” and TableI). Induction of BL21(DE3) harboring pCPX01 resulted in the overproduction of proteins of molecular mass of 45, 23, and 21 kDa, apparently corresponding to ClpX, h-ClpP, and the mature form of ClpP (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The overproduction of mature ClpP suggested that h-ClpP could be processed to the mature form just as the wild-type precursor ClpP (pre-ClpP) is autocatalytically processed by cleavage of 14 amino acids at the N terminus (8Maurizi M.R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12536-12545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IClpP purificationFractionPurification stepProteinSpecific activityTotal activitymgunits/mgunitsIExtract10,000IIAmmonium sulfate2600IIINi-NTA 1762.8 × 1052.1 × 107IV37 °C incubation265.7 × 1051.5 × 107VNi-NTA 2157.3 × 1051.1 × 107 Open table in a new tab Both h-ClpP and mature ClpP were retained on the Ni-NTA column (Fig.1 C, lane 1). The removal of the precursor peptide is not required for ClpP oligomerization (37Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Kim S.-H. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus mature ClpP associated with h-ClpP should also be retained on Ni-NTA. A third polypeptide retained by the column corresponded to the molecular weight of pre-ClpP. The bound protein fraction from the Ni-NTA column was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to promote further processing of the his-ClpP and then passed through the column a second time. Most of the protein passed through the column or was eluted at low (50 mm) imidazole concentrations. These protein fractions were pooled and were found to be greater than 95% homogeneous for the 21-kDa form; the presence of the 23-kDa form was undetectable (Fig.1 C, lane 2). The N-terminal sequence of the purified 21-kDa form was determined to be identical to that of mature wild-type ClpP. The Mu immunity repressor inhibits Mu transposition in vitro by competing for MuA binding sites in the operator that enhances transpososome assembly (38Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1989; 58: 399-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,39Leung P.C. Teplow D.B. Harshey R.M. Nature. 1989; 338: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ClpXP protease can degrade the Mu immunity repressor (13Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and it potentially plays an important role in inducing Mu DNA replication in lysogens. We determined whether the presence of ClpXP protease allows the reconstituted Mu transposition system to overcome inhibition by the repressor. Although the wild-type repressor (Rep) is a substrate for the ClpXP protease, it is degraded with a relatively high K m and assumes a ClpXP-resistant state in the presence of DNA (13Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A mutant form of the repressor (Vir, repressor encoded by the virulent strain Muvir3060), which has an alteration at the C terminus and is rapidly degraded in vivo by the ClpXP protease (12Geuskens V. Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Desmet L. Toussaint A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,14Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Pato M. Gama M.-J. Toussaint A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), is degraded by ClpXP with a 20-fold lower K m and is locked into the high affinity state even when bound to DNA (13Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both Rep and Vir are known to bind operator DNA with nearly equal affinity, Vir having a slightly higher dissociation constant (40Vogel J.L. Geuskens V. Desmet L. Higgins N.P. Toussaint A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 661-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They both inhibited Mu strand transfer in the reconstituted system (Fig.2, cf. lanes 6 and 10 with lane 2), but only inhibition by Vir could be eliminated by ClpXP (cf. lane 13 with 9). And even though MuA is a ClpXP substrate (28Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), amounts of ClpXP sufficient to remove Vir inhibition did not destroy MuA needed to catalyze strand transfer (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 13). MuA is degraded slowly compared with Vir (13Welty D.J. Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), permitting MuA to carry out its transposition function at levels of ClpXP that effectively eliminate the repressor. One method for examining the conversion of STC1 to STC2 is to examine disassembly of the transpososome by agarose gel electrophoresis (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Treatment of STC1 with ClpX destabilizes tight binding of MuA to the DNA such that it readily disassembles during challenge with heparin and resolution by electrophoresis, and disruption of the synaptic complex of Mu ends results in a change in mobility of the strand transfer product. We used this disassembly assay to compare the kinetics with which ClpX acts on STC1 in the presence or absence of ClpP. The presence of ClpP increased by 2–3-fold the amount of STC1 disassembled at 30 min by limiting concentrations of ClpX (Fig.3 A). The level of ClpP used was saturating; the presence of 2-fold higher levels of ClpP did not result in any additional stimulation (data not shown). Time course experiments (Fig. 3, B and C) revealed that the extent of STC1 disassembly was approximately proportional to the amount of added ClpX and that ClpP increased the extent of STC1 disassembly at each ClpX concentration. Even in the presence of ClpP, however, an excess of ClpX monomers over STC1 was required for 100% disassembly, with at least 2.5 pmol of ClpX being required to disassemble 0.05 pmol of STC1 (formed from 250 ng of donor substrate in a reaction mixture containing 55 ng of MuA). If sufficient ClpX was present, ClpP was not essential for complete disassembly of STC1 (e.g. see Fig. 5,lane 7) as shown previously (15Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref Pub"

We examined here the physical and functional relationship between the Rab3-rabphilin3 and Rab5-rabaptin5 systems. Rabphilin3 interacted with rabaptin5 at the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–280), which GTP-Rab3A interacted with. The interaction of rabphilin3 with rabaptin5 was inhibited by guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-Rab3A. Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 (amino acids 1–280) inhibited the receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, and this inhibition was overcome by co-transfection with a dominant active mutant of Rab3A or rabaptin5 in PC12 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that rabphilin3, free of GTP-Rab3A, regulates endocytosis through interaction with rabaptin5 after rabphilin3 complexed with GTP-Rab3A regulates exocytosis.

These results suggest that rabphilin3, free of GTP-Rab3A, regulates endocytosis through interaction with rabaptin5 after rabphilin3 complexed with GTP-Rab3A regulates exocytosis. Endocytosis is often coupled with exocytosis, particularly at nerve terminals (for reviews, see Refs. 1Schweizer F.E. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 689-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and 2De Camilli P. Takei K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of exocytosis and endocytosis have extensively been investigated, but the coupling mechanism between these two events is unknown. The Rab family small G proteins are implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking, such as exocytosis and endocytosis (for reviews, see Refs.3Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 4Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev.

The Rab3 subfamily consists of four members, Rab3A, -B, -C, and -D, and Rab3A and -C are implicated in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly in neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals (for a review, see Ref.6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A current model for the mode of action of Rab3A and -C in neurotransmitter release is as follows: GDP-Rab3 complexed with Rab GDI 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; GEP, GDP/GTP exchange protein; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acid; SD, synthetic dextrose; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. stays in the presynaptic cytosol and is converted to GTP-Rab3 by the action of Rab3 GEP. GTP-Rab3 interacts with rabphilin3 associated with synaptic vesicles. This interaction causes the docking of the vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane by an unknown mechanism. Ca2+influx into the cytosol causes the fusion of the vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane, finally resulting in neurotransmitter release. In one of these processes, GTP-Rab3 is converted to GDP-Rab3 by the action of Rab3 GAP. GDP-Rab3 is complexed with Rab GDI and returns to the cytosol. In this Rab3 system, we have isolated and characterized Rab3A, -B, -C, Rab GDI, rabphilin3, Rab3 GEP, and Rab3 GAP (7Kikuchi A. Yamashita T. Kawata M. Yamamoto K. Ikeda K. Tanimoto T. Takai Y. J.

A model for the mode of action of Rab5 in endocytosis is as follows: GDP-Rab5 complexed with Rab GDI stays in the cytosol and is converted to GTP-Rab5 by the action of Rab5 GEP after its association with early endosomes. GTP-Rab5 interacts with rabaptin5 and recruits it to early endosomes. This interaction causes both the fusion of the plasma membrane-derived endocytotic vesicles with early endosomes and the lateral fusion of early endosomes. In one of these processes, GTP-Rab5 is converted to GDP-Rab5 by the action of Rab5 GAP. GDP-Rab5 is complexed with Rab GDI and returns to the cytosol. In this Rab5 system, Rab5, rabaptin5, and Rab5 GAP have been isolated and characterized (15Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M.

In the Rab3-regulated exocytosis, it still remains unknown how the interaction of Rab3 with rabphilin3 causes the docking of the vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. To clarify this mechanism, we have attempted to isolate molecules interacting with rabphilin3. Rabphilin3 consists of at least two functionally different domains: the N-terminal C1-like domain responsible for interaction with GTP-Rab3, and the C-terminal two C2-like domains responsible for interaction with Ca2+ and phospholipid (20Yamaguchi T.

Here, we have found that rabphilin3 interacts with rabaptin5 at the N-terminal region and that this interaction is inhibited by GTP-Rab3A. We have furthermore shown that rabphilin3 is involved in endocytosis. Bovine Rab3A and rabphilin3 were purified from the membrane fraction of Spodoptera frugiperdacells (Sf9 cells) overexpressing each protein (28Kikuchi A. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Shirataki H. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).

Truncated rat rabaptin5, which corresponds to an amino acid position from 385 to 753 of human rabaptin5 (GenBank® accession number X91141), was expressed as a GST-fusion protein and purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli. Anti-HA and anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibodies and an anti-rabphilin3 rabbit polyclonal antibody were prepared as described (31Mizoguchi A. Yano Y. Hamaguchi H. Yanagida H. Ide C. Zahraoui A.

Mammalian expression plasmids, pEFBOS-HA and pEFBOS-myc, were generated to express fusion proteins with the N-terminal HA and myc epitopes, respectively (33Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Another mammalian expression plasmid, pGEM-HA, was generated to express a fusion protein with the N-terminal HA epitope, using the T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus (LO-T7) (35Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments encoding full-length rabphilin3 and its N-terminal fragment (1–280 aa) were inserted into pGEM-HA and pEFBOS-HA, respectively. The cDNA fragment encoding truncated rabaptin5 was inserted into pGEM-HA and pEFBOS-myc. The cDNA fragments encoding human transferrin receptor and a dominant active mutant of Rab3A (Rab3AQ81L) were inserted into pEFBOS-myc. Yeast strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was grown on YPDAU medium that contained 2% glucose, 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), 1% Bacto-yeast extract (Difco), 0.04% adenine sulfate, and 0.02% uracil. Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate methods (36Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SD medium that contained 2% glucose and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and amino acids (Difco) were supplemented to SD medium when required. Standard yeast genetic manipulations were performed as described (37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). An E. coli strain DH5α was used for construction and propagation of plasmids. A strain L40 was transformed with a derivative of pBTM116 bearing the N-terminal fragment (1–280 aa) of rabphilin3 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain: pBTM116-rabphilin3-N. A strain L40 carrying pBTM116-rabphilin3-N was transformed with the library DNA (MATCHMAKER rat brain oligo(dT)-primed library in pGAD10,CLONTECH). Approximately 1.1 × 106 transformants were screened for the growth on SD plate media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, but containing 0.5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, which is a specific inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product. His+ colonies were then placed on the nitrocellulose filter and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for β-galactosidase activity as described (38Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). From the 50 His+ and lacZ+ positive clones obtained with this screening, library plasmids were recovered through E. coli transformation. The recovered plasmids were transformed again into L40 containing pBTM116-rabphilin3-N, and it was found that 14 clones conferred the His+ and lacZ+ phenotypes on L40 containing pBTM116-rabphilin3-N. The nucleotide sequences of the insert DNA of these 14 clones were determined. PC12 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm dish and then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells were infected with T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus (LO-T7) for 30 min and then transfected with 2 μg of pGEM-HA-rabaptin5, 2 μg of pGEM-HA-rabphilin3, or both the plasmids, by use of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (35Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 h after the transfection. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml per dish of a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5% Nonidet P-40, 91 μm CaCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. The cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 10 pmol of the anti-rabphilin3 antibody bound to 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Comparable amounts of the pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with the anti-HA antibody. Full-length rabphilin3 (50 pmol) was incubated with GST or GST-rabaptin5 (100 pmol) bound to glutathione-Sepharose in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm NaCl for 90 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 0.4 μm GDP-Rab3A or GTPγS-Rab3A. After the beads were washed four times with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by addition of 100 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmNaCl, and 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. PC12 or HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the indicated proteins by use of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml FITC-transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The HA and myc epitopes were detected with the anti-HA and anti-myc antibodies as the first antibodies, respectively, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse donkey antibody (Chemicon International) as the second antibody. To examine the co-expression of the HA- and myc-tagged proteins, rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-myc antibodies were used. The cells were analyzed with a LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To examine whether the expression level of the indicated protein was affected by co-expression of the other proteins, transfected HeLa cells were lysed, and the expression levels of the HA-tagged and myc-tagged proteins were examined by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates using the anti-HA and anti-myc antibodies, respectively. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Rabphilin3 and rabaptin5 transferred to nitrocellulose sheets were detected using the ECL immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). We first attempted to isolate rabphilin3-interacting proteins by use of the yeast two-hybrid system with the N-terminal fragment or the C-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 as a bait from a rat brain cDNA library. We did not isolate any clones with the C-terminal fragment as a bait. But with the N-terminal fragment as a bait, we isolated several clones and selected one clone (N22) encoding a protein, which corresponds to an amino acid position from 385 to 753 of human rabaptin5, because rabaptin5 is known to be the downstream target molecule of the Rab5 subfamily implicated in endocytosis (3Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M.

The isolated clone indeed interacted with the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 by the yeast two-hybrid method, and this interaction was comparable to the interaction of Rab3A with rabphilin3 (Fig. 1 A). This clone also interacted with full-length rabphilin3 but not with its C-terminal fragment (Fig. 1 B). The rabphilin3-rabaptin5 interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged full-length rabphilin3 and HA-tagged truncated rabaptin5 from cultured PC12 cells. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding HA-tagged rabphilin3 or HA-tagged rabaptin5, or with both the plasmids. The cells were lysed in the lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were incubated with the anti-rabphilin3 antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. Rabphilin3 was immunoprecipitated by the anti-rabphilin3 antibody in both the cells expressing HA-tagged rabphilin3 alone and the cells expressing HA-tagged rabphilin3 and HA-tagged rabaptin5 (Fig.2, lanes 2 and 3). Rabaptin5 was not co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-rabphilin3 antibody in the cells expressing HA-tagged rabaptin5 alone or the cells expressing HA-tagged rabphilin3 alone (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) but co-immunoprecipitated with rabphilin3 in the cells expressing both HA-tagged rabphilin3 and HA-tagged rabaptin5 (Fig. 2,lane 3). The rabphilin3-rabaptin5 interactions were further confirmed by use of the recombinant proteins. GST-rabaptin5 was prebound to glutathione-Sepharose, and the binding of rabphilin3 to this prebound protein was analyzed. Rabaptin5 indeed interacted with rabphilin3 (Fig. 3, lanes 1and 2). Because rabaptin5 interacted with the N-terminal region of rabphilin3, with which GTP-Rab3A interacts (20Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H. Kishida S. Miyazaki M. Nishikawa J. Wada K. Numata S. Kaibuchi K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the effect of GTPγS-Rab3A on the rabphilin3-rabaptin5 interactions was examined next. Rabphilin3 was incubated with rabaptin5 in the presence of GTPγS-Rab3A or GDP-Rab3A, and the interaction of rabphilin3 with rabaptin5 was analyzed. Only a small amount of rabphilin3 interacted with rabaptin5 in the presence of GTPγS-Rab3A, indicating that GTP-Rab3A inhibited the interaction of rabphilin3 with rabaptin5 (Fig.3, lanes 2 and 4). Because GDP-Rab3A weakly bound to rabphilin3 (11Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Horiuchi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10946-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rabphilin3-rabaptin5 interactions were slightly inhibited by GDP-Rab3A (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). Finally, effect of rabphilin3 on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin was examined. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding myc-tagged human transferrin receptor alone or co-transfected with the plasmid encoding the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 and then incubated with FITC-transferrin. The expressed myc-tagged human transferrin receptor and HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 were detected by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-myc and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. The FITC-transferrin incorporated into the cells by endocytosis was examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In the cells expressing myc-tagged human transferrin receptor alone, FITC-transferrin was markedly incorporated into the cells (Fig. 4 A, 1and 2). However, in the cells co-expressing both myc-tagged human transferrin receptor and the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3, the incorporation of FITC-transferrin into the cells was not detected (Fig. 4 A, 3 and 4). This inhibitory action of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 was overcome by co-expression with a dominant active mutant of Rab3A (Rab3AQ81L) (Fig. 4 A, 5 and 6) or rabaptin5 (Fig.4 A, 7 and 8). These data were obtained in about 90% of the cells expressing the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3. The co-expression of the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 and myc-tagged human transferrin receptor was confirmed by the anti-HA and anti-myc antibodies, respectively (Fig.4 A, 9 and 10). The expression of the Rab3A mutant and rabaptin5 was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-myc antibody (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells. Because this cell line expresses endogenous human transferrin receptor, FITC-transferrin was incorporated into the cells by this endogenous receptor. In the cells expressing the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3, the incorporation of FITC-transferrin into the cells was not detected, whereas FITC-transferrin was incorporated into the non-expressing cells (Fig. 4 B, 1 and 2). This inhibitory action was overcome by co-expression with a dominant active mutant of Rab3A (Rab3AQ81L) (Fig. 4 B, 3 and 4) or rabaptin5 (Fig. 4 B, 5 and 6). The expression level of the HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 was not impaired by co-expression of the Rab3A mutant or rabaptin5 (Fig.4 C). Overexpression of the HA-tagged C-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 alone did not inhibit the incorporation of FITC-transferrin into the cells (Fig. 4 B, 7 and 8). We have shown here by use of three different methods, the yeast two-hybrid, affinity column chromatography, and immunoprecipitation, that rabphilin3 directly interacts with rabaptin5. Rabaptin5 interacts with the N-terminal region of rabphilin3, and this interaction is inhibited by GTP-Rab3A. The precise mode of action of the Rab3-rabphilin3 system in Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release has not been clarified, but GTP-Rab3 is converted to GDP-Rab3 by the action of Rab3 GAP before, during, or after the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane (6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that rabphilin3 interacts with rabaptin5 after GTP-Rab3 is converted to GDP-Rab3 and released from rabphilin3. Moreover, we have shown here that overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 in PC12 and HeLa cells inhibits the receptor-mediated endocytosis as estimated by the incorporation of FITC-transferrin and that this inhibition is overcome by co-expression with the dominant active mutant of Rab3A or rabaptin5. These results suggest that the N-terminal fragment interacts with endogenous rabaptin5 and inhibits its function in the endocytotic processes. The dominant active mutant of Rab3A or rabaptin5 may overcome the inhibitory action of the N-terminal fragment of rabphilin3 by inhibiting the interaction of the N-terminal fragment with endogenous rabaptin5. These results are consistent with the fact that rabphilin3 free of GTP-Rab3A, not that complexed with GTP-Rab3A, interacts with rabaptin5. Endocytosis is often coupled with exocytosis, especially at nerve terminals (1Schweizer F.E. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 689-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2De Camilli P. Takei K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this type of endocytosis remains a matter of debate, but several lines of evidence implicate that endocytosis of synaptic vesicles appears to resemble receptor-mediated endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles in non-neuronal cells (for a review, see Ref. 41Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). However, since endocytosis of synaptic vesicles is faster than receptor-mediated endocytosis in non-neuronal cells and is not inhibited by decrease in the pH or the K+concentration which disrupt receptor-mediated endocytosis (42Thomas P. Lee A.K. Wong J.G. Almers W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), endocytosis of synaptic vesicles is considered a specialization of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, our present results used here indicate that the Rab3-rabphilin3 system is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis, but it is not known whether rabphilin3 is implicated in endocytosis coupled with Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from nerve terminals. Further study is necessary for the precise role of rabphilin3 in endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2041262032,"Stromelysin-3 (STR-3) is a recently characterized matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) with a unique pattern of expression and substrate specificity. Unlike other MMPs, STR-3 is consistently and dramatically overexpressed by multiple epithelial malignancies, including carcinomas of the breast, lung, colon, head and neck, and skin. Recent studies suggest that STR-3 promotes the local establishment of epithelial malignancies, contributing to tumor cell survival and implantation in host tissues; however, STR-3's mechanism of action remains undefined. STR-3 is a stromal cell product, prompting speculation that infiltrating stromal cells secrete STR-3 in response to tumor-derived factors. To explore this possibility, we developed a tumor/“stroma” coculture assay in which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines were grown on confluent monolayers of normal pulmonary fibroblasts. In these tumor/stroma cocultures, NSCLCs stimulate normal pulmonary fibroblasts to secrete STR-3 and release extracellular basic fibroblast growth factor. Thereafter, STR-3 is processed at a unique internal sequence via a basic fibroblast growth factor- and MMP-dependent mechanism to a previously unidentified 35-kDa protein that lacks enzymatic activity. 35-kDa STR-3 is the most abundant STR-3 protein in tumor/stroma cocultures and is only detected when normal pulmonary fibroblasts are cultured with malignant bronchial epithelial cells. Therefore, the tumor-specific processing of STR-3 to the 35-kDa protein is likely to be an important regulatory mechanism.

Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Currently recognized families of MMPs include collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type MMPs, and additional single enzymes such as matrilysin and metalloelastase; these enzymes differ in substrate specificity, regulation, tissue-specific expression, and potential interactions with additional MMP family members (2Birkedal-Hansen H.

Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Stromelysin-3 (STR-3) (MMP-11) is a recently characterized MMP with a unique pattern of expression and substrate specificity (7Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was originally isolated on the basis of its overexpression in primary breast cancers and identified as a MMP family member because of its predicted amino acid (aa) sequence (7Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Like other MMPs, STR-3 has a highly conserved “pro” domain which is cleaved when the enzyme is converted to its active form. STR-3 also contains a characteristic catalytic domain with a zinc-binding consensus sequence and a “hemopexin” domain with sequence similarity to the heme-binding proteins. However, STR-3 differs from other previously characterized MMPs that are secreted as inactive zymogens. The STR-3 pro domain contains an additional recognition site for the Golgi-associated pro-protein convertase, furin (9Pei D.P. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Consequently, the ∼60-kDa STR-3 proenzyme is processed within the constitutive secretory pathway and released as a ∼45-kDa active enzyme (9Pei D.P. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 10Santavicca M. Noel A. Angliker H. Stoll I. Segain J. Anglard P. Chretien M. Seidah N. Basset P. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 45-kDa STR-3 protein is currently thought to be the major active form of the enzyme (9Pei D.P. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). However, significant questions remain regarding the biological activity of 45-kDa STR-3. Although STR-3 has the characteristic structure of a MMP, its substrate specifically differs markedly from that of other MMP family members (11Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment of recombinant murine STR-3 which lacks the C-terminal hemopexin domain displays the properties of a weak metalloproteinase (11Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the human 45-kDa STR-3 does not degrade classic MMP substrates such as gelatin, casein, and elastin (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the human STR-3 protein contains an amino acid substitution in the highly conserved MMP “met turn” which may alter the activity of the enzyme (12Noel A.C. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M.-C. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To date, the only known substrates for STR-3 are the serine protease inhibitors (serpins), α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI, α1-antitrypsin), and α2-antiplasmin (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because α1-PI is the major circulating inhibitor of elastase, the degradation of α1-PI by STR-3 may increase elastase-mediated tissue damage. However, additional MMPs including MMP-1 (tissue collagenase) and MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) also hydrolyze α1-PI (13Mast A. Enghild J. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Pizzo S. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15810-15816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because STR-3 also degrades α2-antiplasmin, the enzyme could also indirectly increase local plasmin levels and promote plasmin-mediated conversion of additional pro-MMPs to their active forms (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the unique aspects of STR-3 regulation, structure, and function (8Pei D.

STR-3 is expressed during normal embryogenesis and the remodeling of certain adult tissues. In human embryos, STR-3 is expressed in developing digits (15Basset P. Wolf C. Rouyer N. Bellocq J.-P. Rio M.-C. Chambon P. Cancer. 1994; 74: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); in murine embryos, the enzyme is found during limb, tail, and snout morphogenesis (16Lefebvre O. Regnier C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Chambon P. Basset P. Rio M.-C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is expressed by stromal elements in contact with epithelial cells in normal embryonic and adult tissues. In certain settings, STR-3-positive stromal elements are in contact with epithelial cells undergoing regional apoptosis and selected cell survival. For example, during frog morphogenesis, STR-3 is specifically expressed in small intestine mesenchyme during a time in which primary intestinal epithelial cells undergo apoptosis and replacement by secondary epithelial cells (17Patterton D. Par Hayes W. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In humans and rodents, STR-3 is expressed in tissues that undergo extensive remodeling such as placenta, uterus, and post-lactation mammary glands (18Lefebvre O. Wolf C. Limacher J.-M. Hutin P. Wendling C. LeMeur M. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Giudice L.C. Dsupin B. Cannon P. Svitek C. Gorstein F. Osteen K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). For example, female mice who have completed weaning express STR-3 in involuting mammary glands (18Lefebvre O. Wolf C. Limacher J.-M. Hutin P. Wendling C. LeMeur M. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that specific changes in the viability of normal epithelial cells affect the expression of STR-3 in adjacent stroma. The settings in which STR-3 is normally expressed provide insights regarding the role of the enzyme in primary tumors. Unlike other MMP family members, STR-3 is consistently and dramatically overexpressed by a variety of primary epithelial malignancies, including carcinomas of the breast, lung, colon, head and neck, and skin (20Rouyer N.

In our own recent studies, virtually all newly diagnosed primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) expressed significantly higher levels of STR-3 than adjacent normal lung specimens (22Anderson I.C. Sugarbaker D.J. Ganju R.K. Tsarwhas D.G. Richards W.G. Sunday M. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4120-4126PubMed Google Scholar). Although STR-3 is overexpressed in primary and metastatic carcinomas, the enzyme is synthesized by interdigitating stromal cells (20Rouyer N. Wolf C. Chenard M.-P. Rio M.-C. Chambon P. Bellocq J.-P.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). In primary and metastatic tumors, STR-3 levels decline as a consequence of the distance between malignant epithelial and normal stromal cells with the highest levels of the enzyme at the tumor/stroma interface (7Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). STR-3 has also been identified in stromal elements of in situ carcinomas and precursor lesions and linked with the grade and local invasiveness of early stage tumors (21Wolf C. Rouyer N. Lutz Y. Adida C. Loriot M. Bellocq J.-P. Chambon P. Basset P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1843-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 25Muller D. Wolf C. Abecassis J. Millon R. Engelmann A. Bronner G. Rouyer N. Rio M.-C. Eber M. Methlin G. Chambon P. Basset P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). In a series of precancerous lesions of the respiratory tract, STR-3 was absent in hyperplastic and metaplastic lesions; in contrast, the enzyme was frequently expressed in preinvasive (dysplastic and in situ) lesions and uniformly identified in invasive carcinomas (26Bolon I. Brambilla E. Vandenbunder B. Robert C. Lantuejoul S. Brambilla C. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that STR-3 is uniformly expressed by early stage tumors suggests that the enzyme may participate in the initial development of these malignancies. Consistent with this hypothesis, STR-3 was recently shown to promote the establishment of local tumors in nude mice by contributing to tumor cell implantation and survival in host tissues (27Noel A.C. Levebre O. Maquoi E. Vanhoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although these recent studies (27Noel A.C. Levebre O. Maquoi E. Vanhoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) provide the first evidence that STR-3 promotes local tumor development, the molecular mechanism by which STR-3 exerts its effects is not yet known. STR-3 appears to be expressed as a consequence of a specific interaction between malignant epithelial cells and surrounding stromal elements, suggesting that the enzyme may participate in the earliest stages of local tumor development in which malignant epithelial cells traverse the basement membrane, invade the surrounding stroma, and directly contact normal stromal elements. To explore these possibilities in a controlled and easily accessible system, we developed a tumor/“stroma” coculture assay in which NSCLC cells are grown on confluent monolayers of normal pulmonary fibroblasts. In these tumor/stroma cocultures, NSCLC cells stimulate pulmonary fibroblasts to secrete STR-3 and release bFGF. Following the release of STR-3 and bFGF, the active 45-kDa STR-3 enzyme is processed at a unique internal sequence via a bFGF- and MMP-dependent mechanism to a major 35-kDa protein that lacks enzymatic activity. Because 35-kDa STR-3 is the most abundant STR-3 protein in tumor/stroma cocultures and is only detected when normal pulmonary fibroblasts are cultured with malignant bronchial epithelial cells, these findings provide additional insights into the regulation and role of STR-3 in epithelial carcinomas. The A549 and SL-6 human NSCLC cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, and RPMI, 10% FCS as described previously (28Ganju R.K. Sunday M. Tsarwhas D.G. Card A. Shipp M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SV40-transformed non-tumorigenic human fetal tracheal epithelial cell line, 56 FHTE, was cultured on fibronectin (1 mg/100 ml, Life Technologies, Inc.)-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS (28Ganju R.K. Sunday M. Tsarwhas D.G. Card A. Shipp M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human pulmonary fibroblasts derived from fetal (ATCC CCL-153) and adult donors (ATCC CCL-210) were maintained in MEM, 10% FCS (22Anderson I.C. Sugarbaker D.J. Ganju R.K. Tsarwhas D.G. Richards W.G. Sunday M. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4120-4126PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 2 × 105 tumor cells (A549) or SV40-transformed non-tumorigenic tracheal epithelial cells (56 FHTE) were added to confluent monolayers of fetal (CCL-153) or adult (CCL-210) pulmonary fibroblasts in 6-well Falcon plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The cocultures were initially incubated for 18 h in MEM, 10% FCS; thereafter, cocultures were washed twice and incubated in serum-free MEM. In selected experiments, the serum-free MEM contained PMA (10 μg/ml) (Sigma), a neutralizing anti-human PDGF-AB polyclonal antibody (25 μg/ml) (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), anti-human bFGF mAb (5 μg/ml) (clone FB-8, Sigma), anti-human EGF-R mAb (5 μg/ml) (C225, gift from J.

Tschesche H. Fritz H. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 375Google Scholar) (10 μg/ml) (Sigma). After 24–72 h, conditioned media from the cocultures were harvested, centrifuged for 10 min at 1200 × g, concentrated ∼15 × by ultrafiltration (Centricon 10, Amicon, Beverly, MA), and assayed for protein content (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). In selected experiments, cells from the tumor/stroma cocultures were washed twice in PBS and lysed at 4 °C in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were subsequently incubated for 30 min on a 4 °C rocking platform, centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble material, and assayed for protein content. Confluent monolayers of pulmonary fibroblasts were plated in the lower chambers and NSCLC cells in the upper chambers of transwell apparatuses (0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA). After an initial 18-h incubation in MEM, 10% FCS, the transwell tumor/stroma cocultures were washed, and serum-free media were added as described previously. At designated 24–72-h intervals, conditioned media were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared as indicated. Samples of conditioned media and cell lysates were size-fractionated on 10–12.5% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were preincubated for 2 h in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% dry milk) and subsequently incubated for 18 h with selected STR-3 (5ST4A9 or 5ST4C10) (34Santavicca M. Noel A. Chenard M.-P. Lutz Y. Stoll I. Segain J.-P. Rouyer N. Rio M.-C. Wolf C. Bellocq J.-P. Basset P. Int. J.

After three washes, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Selected autoradiograms were subjected to densitometric analysis (G700 Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad). After A549 NSCLC cells and CCL-153 fibroblasts were directly cocultured as described above, the fibroblasts and tumor cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation (J.E-5.0 elutriation system, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Cells from the cocultures were trypsinized and washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% FCS, 10 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm EDTA, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were loaded into the elutriation chamber at a pump speed of 8 ml/min (rotor speed 2000 rpm/min) in the same medium. The pump speed was increased slowly to 15 ml/min to achieve an equal distribution of cells in the chamber. After equilibrium was achieved, the pump speed was increased from 20 to 120 ml/min in 5 ml/min increments and 20 sequential 100-ml cell fractions were collected. Collection was completed at a pump speed of 120 ml/min. To assess the percentage of tumor cells and fibroblasts in each cell fraction, an aliquot of each fraction was added to an individual well of a multichamber glass slide (Lab-Tek chamber slides, Nunc, Naperville, IL); slides were air-dried and immunostained for keratin expression as described previously (22Anderson I.C. Sugarbaker D.J. Ganju R.K. Tsarwhas D.G. Richards W.G. Sunday M. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4120-4126PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, the 20 individual 100-ml cell fractions were separately centrifuged and lysed for RNA extraction. Total RNAs from specific cell fractions were prepared and analyzed as described previously (35Mari B. Imbert V. Belhacene N. Far D.F. Peyron J.-F. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Rossi B. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8517-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, total RNAs were isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform extraction (RNA STAT-60 kit, Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX), size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel under denaturing conditions, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Corp.). The blot was then hybridized with a 32P-labeled STR-3 cDNA probe as described previously (22Anderson I.C. Sugarbaker D.J. Ganju R.K. Tsarwhas D.G. Richards W.G. Sunday M. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4120-4126PubMed Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin entrapment was performed as described previously (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots of STR-3-containing conditioned media were incubated with 10 μg of purified human α2-macroglobulin (Sigma) for 18 h at room temperature in the absence or presence of 5 μm of the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB-94. Thereafter, samples were size-fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under non-reducing conditions, blotted, and probed with the anti-STR-3 mAb 5ST4A9 as described above. Antisera directed against the STR-3 C terminus (RAST Ig) was generated by immunizing two New Zealand rabbits with an ovalbumin-coupled peptide containing the 25 C-terminal STR-3 aa (aa 464–488) (7Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified RAST Ig was used to immunoprecipitate STR-3 from the conditioned media of NSCLC (A549)/pulmonary fibroblast (CCL-153) cocultures. In brief, 100 μl of 15 × conditioned media was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with or without 2 μg of affinity-purified RAST Ig; protein A-Sepharose (25 μg/ml) was added for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min and corresponding immunoprecipitates and immunodepleted conditioned media samples were collected. Immunoprecipitates and aliquots of immunodepleted conditioned media were size-fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, blotted, and analyzed with the 5ST4A9 STR-3 mAb as described above. Four liters of SL-6-conditioned serum-free media were collected and loaded on a 250-ml dextran sulfate (Sigma) column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Triton X-100. After extensive washing in the equilibration buffer, the column was eluted with ∼400 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Thereafter, the STR-3-enriched eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100 and loaded on an anion exchange column (DEAE-BioGel A, Bio-Rad). After extensive washing in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, the column was sequentially eluted with the following: 1) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2; and 2) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. 35-kDa STR-3 was primarily eluted with the 100 mm NaCl buffer (fraction 1), whereas 45-kDa STR-3 was mainly eluted with the 300 mm NaCl buffer (fraction 2). The 35-kDa STR-3-enriched fraction (fraction 1) was subsequently loaded on an immunoabsorbent column made by covalently coupling 1 mg of immunoaffinity purified RAST IgG to 1 ml of wet protein A beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After extensive washing in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, the RAST-Ig column was eluted with 0.1 mglycine HCl, pH 2.5. Eluted fractions were immediately adjusted to pH 7.4 and assayed for 35-kDa STR-3 by immunoblotting. 35-kDa STR-3-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated 20 × by ultrafiltration (Centricon-10, Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrated 35-kDa STR-3 sample was size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon P membrane, and stained with Amido Black (Sigma). Thereafter, the ∼35-kDa STR-3 band was excised and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis (ABI model 492A, Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research, Shrewsbury, MA). An STR-3 cDNA (F98-STR-3) encoding the 45-kDa active enzyme (aa 98–489) was obtained from PMA-treated CCL-153 fibroblasts by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers 1 (sense) and 2 (antisense) (primer 1 (sense), 5′ AGAATTCTTCGTGCTTTCTGGCGGG 3′ and primer 2 (antisense), 5′ CGAATTCTCAGAGGAAAGTGTTGGC 3′), digested withEcoRI, cloned into the PGEX-4T-1 vector (Pharmacia), and sequenced. An STR-3 cDNA (Gly189-STR-3) encoding the 35-kDa STR-3 protein (aa 189–489) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the first construct (Phe98-STR-3) using primers 3 (sense) and 2 (antisense) (primer 3 (sense) 5′ CGGGATCCGGGGATGTCCACTTCGAC 3′ and primer 2 (antisense) as noted above), digested with BamHI and Ec"
https://openalex.org/W1983689429,"Choriocarcinoma developed from a complete hydatidiform mole has an unique genetic feature that involves monoallelic contribution from the paternal genome. To determine the chromosome carrying putative tumor suppressor gene(s), microcell-hybrids were isolated following fusion of choriocarcinoma cells with microcells from mouse A9 cells containing a single human chromosome (1, 2, 6, 7, 9 or 11). Microcell-hybrids with the introduction of chromosome 7 were suppressed or modulated for tumorigenicity and exhibited altered in vitro growth properties. Introduction of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 9 or 11 had no effect. Tumorigenic revertants isolated from microcell-hybrids with the introduced chromosome 7 contains reduced numbers of chromosome 7. These findings suggest that chromosome 7 contains a putative tumor suppressor gene(s) for choriocarcinoma. Alterations in tumorigenic phenotypes seen in microcell-hybrids were not associated with the presence of either ERV3 or H-plk locus located on the introduced chromosome 7, indicating the putative tumor suppressor gene(s) is outside of ERV3 and H-plk gene loci. Furthermore, we obtained evidence to define a critical region on chromosome 7 (7p12-7q11.23) that was frequently lost in surgically removed choriocarcinoma tissues and cell lines. Using a panel of microsatellite markers, biallelic deletions were observed, which strongly suggests the presence of a tumor suppressor gene(s) within this critical region."
https://openalex.org/W2065022495,"Zfp-36, the gene encoding the putative zinc finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP), is rapidly induced in fibroblasts by a variety of growth factors. Recent gene knockout experiments have shown that TTP-deficient mice developed arthritis, cachexia, and autoimmunity, all apparently mediated by an excess of tumor necrosis factor α. We recently showed that full serum inducibility of Zfp-36 requires elements in the promoter; in addition, removal of the single intron strikingly inhibited serum-induced TTP expression. We show here that replacement of the intron with unrelated sequences, or removal of 95% of the intron but retention of the splice sites, each resulted in the maintenance of approximately 45 and 19%, respectively, of full serum-induced expression. In addition, deletion of intron sequences base pairs 601–655 decreased the serum-induced expression of TTP by 65%. Sequence base pairs 618–626 bound specifically to the transcription factor Sp1; mutation of this binding motif decreased TTP expression by 70%, suggesting that Sp1 binding to this motif contributes to serum induction of Zfp-36. We conclude that full serum-induced expression of Zfp-36 depends on the activation of conventional promoter elements as well as elements in the single intron, and that the presence per se of the intron in its natural location also contributes significantly to the regulated expression of this gene.

Nature. 1996; 382: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although predominantly nuclear in quiescent fibroblasts, TTP is rapidly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by serum and other mitogens (10Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 140-146PubMed Google Scholar), an event that occurs concomitantly with stimulated serine phosphorylation (11Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although TTP has no proven function, disruption of its gene, Zfp-36, in mice leads to a complex syndrome that includes erosive arthritis, conjunctivitis, myeloid hyperplasia, cachexia, and autoimmunity (12Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J.

All aspects of the syndrome were prevented by pretreating the animals with monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (12Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J.

These data suggest that a potential function of TTP is to regulate the production of TNFα by certain cell types. They also indicate the possibility that defects in Zfp-36 might be involved in the pathogenesis of certain human conditions in which TNFα excess plays a role, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The transcription of Zfp-36 is rapidly and dramatically stimulated by a variety of growth factors and mitogens, but not by agents acting solely through increases in cAMP levels (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3DuBois R.N. McLane M.W. Ryder K. Lau L.F. Nathans D. J. Biol.

Several transcription factor-binding sites have been identified in theZfp-36 promoter that are each partially responsible for activating transcription in response to serum or insulin (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that the single intron of Zfp-36 also participates in the regulation of its transcription, since deletion of the intron results in an 85% decrease in serum-stimulated expression (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have characterized the positive contribution of the intron in more detail. We found that the simple presence of the intron in its natural location is important for normal mitogen-stimulated expression; in addition, we have identified an NFκB-like binding site and two Sp1 sites within the intron sequence. The Sp1 sites are responsible for a large component of the intron-dependent, serum-induced expression. The TTP mRNA expression constructs TTP137bp and intronless TTP137bp-Int have been described (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These contain 77 bp of the mouse Zfp-36promoter linked to the mRNA coding region, including the 3′-most polyadenylation signal, in the presence or absence, respectively, of the single 677-bp intron in its natural position. TTP137bpexhibits essentially the same extent of serum-induced expression as constructs containing up to 1.7 kilobases of promoter (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For purposes of clarity, we will refer to all constructs as derivatives of the TTP gene, rather than of Zfp-36. Two unique restriction sites in the genomic sequences flanking the TTP intron were created in plasmid TTP137bp by the polymerase chain reaction primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique (14Aiyar A. Leis J. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). A SalI site was made 8 bp 5′ to the splice site at the 5′ end of the intron, and aSnaBI sequence was created 5 bp 3′ to the splice site at the 3′ end of the intron so that, when this DNA fragment was released bySalI and SnaBI digestion, the consensus donor and acceptor sites (15Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) were included. The mouse TTP intron from this construct was isolated, the ends filled with dNTPs, and then inserted at various sites in the parent plasmid TTP137bp-Int. Specific deletions in the intron sequence of the TTP137bp construct were generated by using the Site-directed in vitro Mutagenesis System (Amersham Corp., Arlington, IL). Substitution mutations in the intron NFκB-like site and intron Sp1 site (see below) were made by the polymerase chain reaction primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique and the use of a proofreading DNA polymerase pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutation primer for the NFκB-like binding site was: NFAT (131GGTCCAGATACCGTTGATCAACTTGGACGAAAAG164). Mutation primers for the two Sp1 mutants were: SPEV (607GCTTTACAACAGTCGCGAGGCGACGTCACC637) and CHGHSp1(607GCTTTACAACAAGATATCAGCGACGTCACC637), in which the numbers flanking the sequences are the bp numbers in the intron (see Fig. 3), and underlined sequences were the mutated sites. All mutant constructs were sequenced (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) to confirm that the appropriate deletions and mutations had been made. Primary chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were isolated and transient transfections were performed with plasmid DNA in calcium-phosphate precipitates, exactly as described previously (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day before the transfection each 10-cm tissue culture dish was plated with 3 × 106 CEF. To each plate was added a transfection mixture containing 15 μg of test plasmid DNA and 5 μg of pXGH5 (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Four to six h after DNA addition and incubation at 37 °C, the cells were treated for 4 min with 4 ml of 10% glycerol in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.1) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the remaining precipitate. After a further 24-h incubation in complete culture medium, the cells were incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to make them quiescent, and were then washed and used for the preparation of total cellular RNA. Plasmid pXGH5 was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Human growth hormone (HGH) released into the culture medium was measured by immunoassay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Total cellular RNA was prepared as described (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar), with modifications as described (17Xie W.Q. Rothblum L.I. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 326-327Google Scholar). Northern blots were prepared as described before (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with random primed α-32P-labeled (Stratagene) mouse TTP cDNA (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TTP mRNA accumulation was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the values were normalized to the amount of HGH secreted into the medium. This was done by comparing the HGH formed in each dish transfected with a test plasmid to cells transfected with the same amount of vector plasmid BS+. Nuclear extracts from CEF and NIH-3T3 cells were prepared as described previously (18Thompson M.J. Roe M.W. Malik R.K. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ), and 20 × 103 cpm of α-32P-labeled probe, were added to 5 μg of nuclear protein in 10 μl of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mmKCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then subjected to binding reactions and electrophoresis as described (18Thompson M.J. Roe M.W. Malik R.K. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunosupershift assays were performed in the same way except that the antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extracts at room temperature for 30 min before the radioprobe mixture was added. The following DNA fragments and double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing potential sequences for DNA binding factors were used in this study. A 116-bp fragment containing the mouse TTP intron region bp 116–220 (see Fig. 3) was excised by digestion withXhoI (at a site created by mutagenesis at bp 114–119) and NcoI; the fragment thus obtained was further digested withAluI to yield two short sequences (bp 116–164 and bp 165–220). A 132-bp fragment containing the intron region bp 326–430 was excised by digestion with HindIII (at a site created by mutagenesis at bp 325–330) and PvuI. A 110-bpDdeI fragment containing bp 563–673, and a 66-bpDdeI-AhaII fragment containing bp 563–629, were also isolated from the intron (Fig. 3). For oligonucleotide Sp1, two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) were annealed to form a doubled-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to mouse intron sequence bp 617–629 (tcgacAGGGGCGGGGCGA), where underlined bases indicate the core sequences of the consensus Sp1-binding site (19Kadonaga J. Jones K. Tjian R. Trends Biol. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide HGHSp1 (tcgacTGTGTGGGAGGAGCTTCTAG), which corresponds to the Sp1-binding site at −139 to −121 in the HGH promoter (20Lemaigre F.P. Lafontaine D.A. Courtois S.J. Durviaux S.M. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1811-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was made the same way. A 5-base single-stranded tail (SalI site) was added to both ends of the two oligonucleotides for subcloning and fill-in labeling. Double-stranded oligonucleotides WT137 containing intron sequence bp 137–157 (tcgacGATACCGGCGATCCCCTTGGAG), where underlined bases indicate the NFκB-like binding site (21Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); two NFκB binding oligonucleotides (tcgacAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAG) from the murine major histocompatibility complex class I geneH-2K b enhancer (22Baldwin A.J. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and (tcgacTCAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGG) from immunoglobulin (Ig) κ enhancer (23Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar), were made as described above. The 5′-protruded ends of the DNA fragments and oligonucleotides were filled in with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) and unlabeled dATP, dGTP, and dTTP (Life Technologies, Inc.). Unlabeled dCTP was subsequently added to the reaction. The labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated radioactivity by acrylamide gel purification. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were also prepared and used in the gel mobility shift assays: mutant Sp1 oligonucleotides (mutated nucleotides underlined) SPEV (tcgacAAGATATCAGCGAG), and CHGHSp1 (tcgacAGTCGCGAGGCGAG); mutant intron bp 137–157 oligonucleotides G137 (tcgacGATACCGGGGATCCCCTTGGAG) and AT137 (tcgacGATACCGAAGATCTTCTTGGAG); and a nonspecific competitor TIE (tcgacGAAGTGCTTTACAG). A double-stranded oligonucleotide AP2 (GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCAT, core sequence underlined) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Sp1 rabbit polyclonal antiserum (24Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Jonathan M. Horowitz (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The anti-NFκB rabbit IgG p65 (sc-109) and p50 (sc-114) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant mouse TNFα was from H&R Systems (Minneapolis, MN). We previously reported that TTP genomic constructs containing the single intron exhibited approximately 6-fold greater expression of TTP mRNA in transiently transfected, serum-stimulated CEF cells than an otherwise identical intronless construct (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This occurred with similar constructs prepared from the mouse, human, and bovine genes (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Introns in certain genes have been shown to possess enhancer activity, which is not affected by the position or orientation of the intron in the DNA construct (25Gillies S.D. Morrison S.L. Oi V.T. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1983; 33: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the intron from the TTP gene contained enhancer activity, we inserted the mouse intron into TTP137bp-Int in both orientations and in different positions, including immediately 5′ to the minimal promoter, 8 bp before the translation start site, 32 bp after the translation stop codon, and immediately 3′ of the 3′-most TTP cDNA sequence (Fig. 1 A). Of the eight constructs made, only the one (+46Int(5′)→) with the intron inserted in a 5′ to 3′ orientation 8 bp before the translation start site showed improved (2.6-fold) serum-induced expression compared with the intronless construct (Fig. 1). This expression was still only 35% of that seen with intact TTP137bp. The closeness of this insertion site to the naturally occurring intron splice site (∼30 bp) may indicate the importance of this location to the regulation of serum-induced TTP gene expression. The oppositely orientated intron inserted into this site failed to improve expression, as did the insertion of the intron into the other positions in either orientation. These data indicate that the effect of the intron on the serum-induced expression of TTP does not resemble that of a simple enhancer. However, it was possible that the intron splicing per se was important for the full expression of TTP mRNA (26Huang M.T. Gorman C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); when the intron was inserted in ectopic locations, particularly in the opposite orientation, splicing of the mRNA might not occur, despite preservation of intact donor and acceptor splice sequences. To determine whether intron splicing was important for the expression of TTP mRNA, construct TTPF52Int was created by substituting the TTP137bp intron sequence from 11 to 661 with a 505-bp BamHI fragment from the intron of the MARCKS-related protein (MRP (27Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); also known as F52 or MacMARCKS), an intron known to confer no serum-inducibility on the expression of MRP. 2W. S. Lai and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished data. Serum-induced expression of TTPF52Int in CEF cells transiently transfected with this construct was 45% of that seen with the native intron in TTP137bp (Fig. 2), or about 9-fold greater than that seen with the intronless construct TTP137bp-Int. A construct in which the intron sequence from 11 to 661 was deleted, leaving behind the splice donor and acceptor sequences and an “intron” of only 26 bp, also showed markedly improved serum-induced expression (3.8-fold increase) compared with TTP137bp-Int (Fig. 2). These data indicate that intron splicing per se plays an important role in the full serum-induced expression of TTP. They also indicate that the simple presence of an intron in the appropriate location, containing either 95% extraneous sequence or shortened to 5% of its original size, is sufficient to confer 45 and 19%, respectively, of the serum-induced expression of the wild-type gene. There are three potential Sp1 and five potential AP2-binding sites in the mouse TTP intron (Fig. 3). To investigate the possible roles of these DNA sequences in controlling the expression of TTP, seven deletion mutants were constructed by removing segments of the intron. These plasmid DNAs as well as the parent plasmid TTP137bp and the intronless construct TTP137bp-Int were transiently transfected into CEF cells, which were then stimulated with serum. TTP mRNA expression from these constructs is shown in Fig. 4. While there was no significant change in the serum-induced expression of TTP mRNA from deletion (d) constructs d(11–115), d(227–327), d(427–536), and d(535–599), expression from mutants d(116–220), d(326–430), and d(601–655) was 58, 78, and 35% of the control construct TTP137bp, respectively, indicating that these three regions in the mouse intron contained sequences that were important for the serum-induced expression of TTP. To further delineate the intron sequences that affected the serum-stimulated expression of TTP, a 116-bp fragment that includes intron region bp 116–220 was isolated and used as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, in which the probe was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from CEF treated with 10% FBS or control conditions for 10 min. Three major DNA-protein complexes were formed (Fig. 5 A). One band, the uppermost (CI), was present in extracts from control cells but was absent in extracts from FBS-treated cells. This region of the intron contains one consensus AP2 site and one Sp1 site. However, when excess double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either AP2 or Sp1 binding sequences were included in the reaction mixture, there were no changes in the intensity of any of the shifted bands, nor did any supershifting of the complexes occur upon addition of the anti-Sp1 antiserum (data not shown). These observations suggest that neither Sp1 nor AP2 is involved in the formation of these DNA-protein complexes. When this 116-bp intron fragment was further digested withAluI to produce two fragments, bp 116–164 and bp 165–220, there was no observable binding of bp 116–164 to proteins in CEF nuclear extracts prepared from control or serum-treated cells (data not shown). Binding of bp 165–220 revealed three complexes that showed no difference in binding pattern with nuclear extracts from control or serum-treated CEF (not shown). Since TNFα also activates TTP transcription in mammalian fibroblasts and macrophages,2 we used the same probes to test nuclear extracts from control, serum-, PMA-, or TNFα-treated NIH-3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, nuclear protein binding to probe bp 165–220 was not altered by any of these treatments, and the binding patterns resembled those obtained when CEF nuclear extracts were used (not shown). However, when probe bp 116–164 was used, a DNA-protein complex was formed with nuclear extracts of TNFα-treated NIH-3T3 cells that was not observed with nuclear extracts from control, serum-, or PMA-treated cells (Fig.5 B). A double-stranded oligonucleotide (WT137) containing bp 137–157 was able to compete for this TNFα-induced binding with probe bp 116–164, indicating that the protein-binding site is located within this stretch of sequence. While a single base mutation (G137) within this oligonucleotide at bp 145 (C → G) did not change the competiveness of the oligonucleotide, mutant (AT137), with mutations at bp 145 (G → T), 155 (C → T), 150 (C → A), and 151 (C → A), significantly weakened the ability of the oligonucleotide to compete with the binding of probe bp 116–164 (Fig. 5 B). Subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing bp 137–157. Both WT137 and G137 formed DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extracts from TNFα-treated NIH-3T3 cells that migrated at the same position as the complex formed with the bp 116–164 probe, while no specific binding was seen with AT137 (Fig. 5 C). Although the sequence within bp 116–164 that formed the specific complex with nuclear extracts from TNFα-treated NIH-3T3 cells contained a consensus AP2-binding site (142GGCGATCCC151), an oligonucleotide comprising an authentic AP2-binding site was not able to compete effectively for the binding with probe bp 116–164 (Fig.5 C). The appearance of this specific DNA-protein complex in this region of the intron only after stimulation of the cells with TNFα raised the possibility of the binding of NFκB, whose translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus occurs upon stimulation of cells with TNFα (28Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). An authentic NFκB binding oligonucleotide derived from the Igκ light chain enhancer (23Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar) was able to compete for the binding of bp 116–164, and the radiolabeled NFκB probe formed a complex with nuclear extracts from TNFα-treated NIH-3T3 cells that migrated to the same position as that seen with intron probe bp 116–164 (Fig. 5 C). This specific complex, like that formed with the intron probe, was not effectively competed by the authentic AP2 oligonucleotide, but was eliminated when WT137 or G137 was present in the binding reactions (Fig. 5 C). These observations suggested that the DNA-protein complex formed in this region of the intron (bp 142–151) might be due to NFκB binding induced by TNFα treatment of the cells. To investigate this possibility, immunosupershift assays were performed using a polyclonal antibody to NFκB. In the presence of the antibody, a supershifted complex was formed with both bp 116–164 and WT137 probes, which migrated to the same position as the supershifted complex formed with the authentic NFκB probe (Fig. 5 D). Probe G137, with a single C → G mutation that changes the sequence to one resembling the NFκB-binding site in the murine major histocompatibility complex class I gene (H-2K b) (22Baldwin A.J. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), formed binding and supershifted complexes as strongly as those with the Igκ NFκB probe (Fig. 5 D). We reported previously that the full expression of human and bovine TTP constructs also required the presence of the intron (13Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sequences resembling the NFκB binding motif are also found in the human and bovine TTP introns (Fig. 3 B). In quiescent fibroblasts, NFκB is transiently activated in the G0 to G1transition upon stimulation of fibroblasts with serum (29Baldwin A.J. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have not been able to demonstrate changes in DNA-protein interactions in this region of the intron (bp 116–220) using nuclear extracts from serum-treated cells; furthermore, our preliminary experiments have shown only a 15% reduction when the intron NFκB-like binding sequence in construct TTP137bp was changed from GGCGATCCCC to GTTGATCAAC (mutated bp underlined), a change that eliminated NFκB-like binding activity of mutant probe AT137 (Fig. 5 C). Future studies will attempt to elucidate the role of this intron NFκB-like binding site in the TNFα-induced expression of TTP. Deletion of intron sequence bp 601–655 led to the most significant loss (65%) of serum-induced TTP expression. To determine whether this region contained sequences that bind to proteins that modulate the level of TTP transcription, a 110-bp DdeI mouse TTP intron fragment spanning bp 563 to 672, which included the whole deleted area of mutant d(601–655), was isolated and used as a probe in gel shift assays. A 66-bp DdeI-AhaII (563–629) fragment, which included much of the deleted area of mutant d(601–655), was also used. When either probe was used in gel-shift assays, two DNA-protein complexes were formed with CEF nuclear extracts (Fig.6"

Misexpression of goosecoid on the ventral side of a Xenopus laevis gastrula embryo was shown to result in a partial duplication of the primary body axis, reminiscent of the Spemann organizer graft. Normal embryonic development thus requires tight temporal and spatial control of genes instrumental for organizer function. In the present study we investigated the transcriptional control of goosecoid gene expression. Sequence analysis of the mouse and human promoter region revealed the presence of two palindromic binding elements for homeobox genes of the prd type to which goosecoidbelongs. We show that Goosecoid protein can bind to these sitesin vitro. By using reporter gene constructs of the human and mouse promoter, we demonstrate that Goosecoid can act as a repressor of its own promoter activity in transient co-transfection experiments in mouse P19 cells and in Xenopus embryos. Autorepression depends on the presence of the homeodomain and is mediated through the prd element more proximal to the transcriptional start site.

The most acclaimed classical experiment in embryology, the organizer transplantation, was performed by Spemann and Mangold in the 1920s (1Spemann H. Mangold H. Roux' Arch. f. Entw. Mech. 1924; 100: 599-638Google Scholar). Through this experiment a crucial role for the development of the primary body axis was assigned to the dorsal lip of the early newt gastrula embryo. When it was grafted to the ventral side of a recipient newt gastrula, a twinned embryo developed, in which a complete second body axis had formed. The dorsal lip was named the organizer by Spemann and Mangold to reflect its ability to not only autonomously differentiate into notochord but to change the fate of the neighboring mesodermal cells into dorsal characteristics and to induce a neural axis in the overlying ectoderm.In an attempt to molecularly characterize the organizer phenomenon, the homeobox gene goosecoid was cloned from a dorsal lip cDNA library made from Xenopus gastrulae (2Blumberg B.

Two elements in theXenopus goosecoid promoter were identified that mediate the induction by the Activin and Xwnt-8 growth factors through their receptor-mediated signaling cascades (17Watabe T.

How gene expression is maintained in the node region and the prechordal plate and excluded from the more posteriorly located regions of the primitive streak has not been addressed as yet.In this study we have investigated autoregulation ofgoosecoid. Our experiments were spurred by our finding that two potential goosecoid binding sites were located in the promoter region of the mouse and human goosecoid genes (18Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T.

We show that in vitrotranslated full-length Goosecoid protein can bind to these sites. Our experiments in Xenopus embryos and mouse P19 teratocarcinoma cells show that Goosecoid regulates its own transcription by a negative autoregulatory feedback loop. We demonstrate that autorepression is exclusively mediated through the element proximal to the transcriptional start site and that it is dependent on the presence of the homeodomain.

The receptor protein has been located in a variety of tissues including blood platelets (7Le Breton G.C. Venton D.L. Enke S.E. Halushka P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Le Breton G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 239: H613-H619Google Scholar). In this regard, previous studies have provided evidence that the TXA2 receptor protein is coupled to at least one G-protein,i.e. Gq in platelets (14Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol.

Pathol. Pharmacol. 1995; 87: 243-251PubMed Google Scholar), and appears to modulate phospholipase C-β activity resulting in activation of the inositol triphosphate second messenger system (17Brass L.F. Shaller C.C. Belmonte E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,18Knezevic I. Dieter J.P. Le Breton G.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 947-955PubMed Google Scholar). Although highly specific agonists and antagonists have proven to be of significant value in characterizing TXA2 receptors in a number of different cell lines, little information is currently available concerning their existence or function in the central nervous system. To a large extent, this has been due to the presence of high lipid concentrations in central nervous system tissue. Thus, nonspecific binding has obscured the demonstration of receptor binding in solubilized brain, due to the lipophilic nature of TXA2receptor ligands. In addition, the heterogeneity of cell types in the central nervous system has complicated attempts at receptor localization at a cellular level. Based on these limitations, previous studies have employed cultured cell systems in an effort to investigate the presence of TXA2 receptors in the central nervous system. In these experiments, it was demonstrated that cultured rabbit astrocytes were capable of specifically binding the TXA2 ligand ONO NT-126 (20Nakahata N. Ishimoto H. Kurita M. Ohmori K. Takahashi A. Nakanishi H. Brain Res. 1992; 583: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results, therefore, provided evidence that at least one cellular component of the central nervous system possesses TXA2 receptor activity. However, since astrocytes are ubiquitously distributed in the brain, it has not been possible to ascribe a specific or unique function for TXA2 in the various brain structures. On the other hand, a separate approach has involved the use of TXA2 receptor antibodies. These experiments provided documentation that TXA2 receptors are in fact localized in discrete brain regions (21Borg C. Lim C.T. Yeomans D.C. Dieter J.P. Komiotis D. Anderson E.G. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6109-6116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, polyclonal antibodies against the complete receptor protein (TxAb), as well as against two decapeptide sequences (P1Ab and P2Ab) of the receptor, revealed a high density of TXA2 receptors in myelinated fiber tracts, notably in the striatum, spinal cord, and optic tract (Fig. 1). Given that astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells both possess TXA2receptors (10Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Arita H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 2535-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Nakahata N. Ishimoto H. Kurita M. Ohmori K. Takahashi A. Nakanishi H. Brain Res. 1992; 583: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the preferential labeling of myelinated fiber tracts indicates the existence of a highly concentrated pool of TXA2 receptors separate from either astrocytes or vascular endothelial cells. One possible source of this high density labeling pattern would be oligodendrocytes, the cell type exclusively responsible for myelin synthesis in the central nervous system. To determine whether or not oligodendrocytes possess TXA2receptors, the present experiments were undertaken using cultured neonatal rat oligodendrocytes (OLG) and human oligodendroglioma (HOG) cells (22Post G.R. Dawson G. Mol. Chem. Neuropath. 1992; 16: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry, immunoblot analysis of solubilized membrane proteins, ligand affinity chromatography of TXA2receptor protein, and radioligand binding studies provided results that demonstrate that both OLG and HOG cells possess thromboxane A2 receptor protein. The identification of this receptor in oligodendrocytes, in conjunction with its high level of expression in myelinated fiber tracts, suggests that thromboxane A2 may play an important role in modulating oligodendrocyte function. Pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Sasco (Madison, WI). Human oligodendroglioma cells were a generous gift from Dr. Glyn Dawson, Department of Biochemistry, University of Chicago. Poly-l-lysine, bovine pancreatic insulin, humanapo-transferrin, cytosine-d-arabinofuranoside, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), sodium selenite, fura-2/AM, Pluronic F-127, CHAPS, polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP), and anti-galactocerebroside (anti-GalCer) antibodies were purchased from Sigma.

(Ann Arbor, MI), and BM13.177 (24Patscheke H. Staiger C. Neugebauer G. Kaufmann B. Strein K. Endele R. Stegmeier K. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1986; 39: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. K. Stegmeier, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Triton X-100-solubilized adult ovine oligodendrocyte membranes (25Szuchet S. Stefansson K. Wollmann R.L. Dawson G. Arnason B.G. Brain Res. 1980; 200: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Sara Szuchet, Department of Neurology, University of Chicago (Chicago, IL). Oligodendrocytes were prepared from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups using a modification of the method of McCarthy and de Vellis (26McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). Protocols for animal use were approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Animal Care Committee. Briefly, animals (approximately 15 per culture procedure) were sacrificed by decapitation and the cerebral hemispheres removed in a sterile manner. Meninges and large blood vessels were removed by rolling the tissue over sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper to reduce fibroblast contamination. Pooled tissue was immersed in ice-cold, serum-free DMEM and minced prior to enzymatic dissociation with trypsin and 100 Kunitz DNase I (30 min at 37 °C). The pooled tissue was then mechanically disaggregated by gentle trituration through a narrow-bore Pasteur pipette and by filtration through 100-μm nylon mesh. The resultant mixed cell culture was distributed into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks that had been treated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine to facilitate attachment. Cells were plated at a density of approximately 2 cerebral hemispheres per flask and maintained in a medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B. Mixed glial cultures were kept at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Culture media was changed every 3rd day for the 1st week and every other day for the 2nd week. Oligodendrocytes were purified from mixed glial cultures on day 14 by mechanical dissociation involving shaking on a rotary shaker (220 rpm × 14 h at 37 °C). Once the OLG precursors had been dislodged, the cells were pooled, washed with warm DMEM/10% FBS, and dissociated into a single cell suspension by trituration through a narrow-bore Pasteur pipette. The cells were then filtered through 30-μm nylon mesh, counted, and plated in 100 × 20-mm poly-l-lysine-treated tissue culture dishes at a density of approximately 1 × 107cells per plate. Cells were incubated in DMEM/ 10% FBS for 3 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 to allow for attachment. Following this incubation, the media were changed to DMEM/3% FBS supplemented with biotin, insulin, transferrin, ARA-C, antibiotic/antimycotic solution, and sodium selenite (27Bottenstein J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocytes were typically used for experiments by the 4th day following subculture. A previously characterized line of human oligodendroglioma cells (HOG) was maintained by continuous cell culture (22Post G.R. Dawson G. Mol. Chem. Neuropath. 1992; 16: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HOG cells from a 5th generation culture were initially distributed on 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes in DMEM/10% FBS supplemented with antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. The 5th generation culture was expanded with approximately 5 × 108 cells preserved in DMEM/10% FBS with 10% Me2SO4 in liquid nitrogen until needed. The remaining cells were passaged and used accordingly. Cells were not used after the 12th passage. Solubilized oligodendrocytes (for immunoblot analysis and ligand affinity chromatography) were prepared by aspirating the culture medium and incubating the cells with serum-free DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then sequentially washed with warm serum-free DMEM (2 × 5 ml) and with ice-cold 25/5 buffer (25 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Three ml of solubilizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CHAPS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 μm EDTA, 1.0 μm leupeptin, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added to each tissue culture dish, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C with constant rocking. Unlysed cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation. Protein concentration in pooled solubilization fractions was determined according to the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). HOG cells were solubilized according to a previously described method (6Kim S.O. Lim C.T. Lam S.C. Hall S.E. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocytes or HOG cells were plated onto Nunc 4- or 8-well polystyrene chamber slides that had been pretreated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were thoroughly washed with warm, serum-free DMEM and then fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. Unreacted aldehyde groups were blocked with NH4Cl in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 30 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with 3% normal goat serum in DMEM. For the detection of intracellular epitopes, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, followed by treatment with paraformaldehyde, NH4Cl, and normal goat serum. Cells were then incubated at room temperature with the appropriate dilutions of primary antibody (TxAb, P2Ab, anti-MBP, or anti-GalCer) or a pre-immune IgG control for 30 min. After washing with TBS, cells were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:200). Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% normal goat serum in TBS. Preparations for light microscopy were stained using a metal-enhanced DAB kit (Pierce) and mounted in glycerol. FITC-stained cells were visualized using a Jenval microscope with the appropriate fluorescence optics. Preabsorbtion of P2Ab was accomplished by overnight incubation of the antibody with 0.1 mP2 peptide (HAALFEWHAV) at 4 °C. Appropriate control experiments were performed by staining cells in the absence of a primary antibody, secondary antibody, or chromagen. Solubilized OLG or HOG cell membranes or ligand affinity purified TXA2 receptors were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, under nonreduced conditions, according to the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis of TXA2receptors, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). After transfer, nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with 3% gelatin in TBS for 2 h and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, diluted in 1% gelatin/TBS, overnight at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by the Vectastain ABC kit method using a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) or goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), diluted 1:500 in 1% gelatin/TBS, as the secondary antibody. Color bands were developed using 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Silver staining of polyacrylamide gels was performed according to the method of Morrissey (31Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]SQ29,548 to intact HOG cells was evaluated using a vacuum filtration assay. Confluent layers of HOG cells were incubated for 30 min in warm, serum-free DMEM and then harvested using gentle trypsinization and mechanical dissociation with a stream of warm DMEM delivered through a Pasteur pipette. The monolayer was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration. Maintenance of cell integrity, cell counts, and extent of dissociation were monitored by light microscopy and assessment of trypan blue uptake. Cells were diluted to a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml and aliquoted into glass tubes (0.5 ml/tube). Following a 5-min incubation at room temperature with either buffer (total binding) or 20 μm unlabeled SQ29,548 (nonspecific binding), the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with various concentrations of [3H]SQ29,548. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were vacuum filtered through GF/C glass fiber filters, and the filters were rapidly washed (2 × 5 ml) with ice-cold 25/5 buffer. The receptor-bound radioligand was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between binding measured in the absence and in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled SQ29,548. Scatchard analysis of radioligand binding data was performed using the EBDA and LIGAND software packages (32McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). TXA2 receptors were purified by the method of Kimet al. (6Kim S.O. Lim C.T. Lam S.C. Hall S.E. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Specifically, CHAPS-solubilized OLG or HOG cell membranes in buffer A (20 mm Tris, 10 mm CHAPS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 550 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml asolectin) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an affinity matrix consisting of the specific TXA2 receptor ligand SQ31,491 immobilized to Affi-Gel 102 (Bio-Rad). Unbound proteins were eluted as flow-through, and the affinity column was washed with 14 ml of buffer A. TXA2 receptors were eluted with buffer A containing 50 mm BM13.177 at a flow rate of 1 ml/8 min. Following elution of the first 1-ml fraction, flow was stopped for 30 min and restarted to elute the subsequent 1-ml fractions. Receptor content was assessed by immunoblot analysis utilizing TxAb (1:500) as a probe. Cytosolic calcium levels were measured in HOG cells using the method of Lum and co-workers (33Goligorsky M.S. Menton D.N. Laszlo A. Lum H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16771-16775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HOG cells were grown on poly-l-lysine treated, 25-mm diameter glass coverslips in DMEM (phenol red-free) supplemented with 10% FBS until cells were >75% confluent. Cells were serum-starved for 2 days in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin enzyme hydrolysate and then loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min at room temperature. Pluronic F-127 (0.5% (w/v)) was employed as a dispersing agent for the AM ester. Following a 2 × wash with Hanks' buffered salt solution, coverslips were placed in a Sykes-Moore chamber (Bellco, Vineland, NJ). The chamber was placed onto the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope that was equipped with quartz optics and coupled to a Deltascan microspectrofluorometer system (PTI, Inc., Princeton, NJ). An optically isolated group of 3–4 cells was illuminated by a 75-watt xenon arc lamp at alternating excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. The emitted light was passed through an interference filter at 510 nm and collected via a photomultiplier. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 10 points/s. Background autofluorescence (in the absence of fura-2) was determined at the beginning of each experiment and was subtracted automatically during data collection. At the end of each experiment, 10 μmionomycin was added to obtain fluorescence of Ca2+-saturated fura-2, and 0.1 m EGTA was added to obtain fluorescence of free fura-2. The fluorescence ratio of excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm (R340/380) were computed using the PTI software. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Morphologically, cultured oligodendrocytes demonstrated a complex network of cytoplasmic processes, as well as numerous intra-process connections characteristic of this cell type (Fig.2, A and B). Identification of cells as differentiated oligodendrocytes was accomplished by immunohistochemical labeling of subcultured cells with anti-myelin basic protein (anti-MBP), an OLG specific marker (Fig.2 A). Solubilized oligodendrocytes from primary culture were also found to immunoreact with anti-MBP, producing an immunoreactive protein band at approximately 21.5 kDa (Fig. 2 D). The degree of purity of OLG cultures was further established by the absence of labeling with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP), an astrocyte-specific protein (Fig. 2 B). Human oligodendroglioma (HOG) cells appeared flat and epithelioid in culture, demonstrating short, narrow cytoplasmic processes. These cells, which have been shown to possess some OLG-specific proteins, were immunoreactive against an anti-GalCer antibody (Fig.2 C). To determine whether cultured OLG and/or HOG cells contained TXA2 receptors, immunohistochemical studies were undertaken using antibodies against the purified receptor (TxAb). Both cell types revealed a marked staining of TXA2 receptors in fixed, Triton X-100-permeabilized cells (Fig. 3,A and D). Unpermeabilized HOG cells demonstrated labeling that was restricted to the plasma membrane (Fig.3 C). On the other hand, no staining was observed when using pre-immune IgG in either cell type (Fig. 3, B and E). Additional evidence for the existence of TXA2 receptors in HOG cells was obtained using a different polyclonal antibody (P2Ab), raised against a decapeptide sequence from the first extracellular loop of the receptor protein (residues 89–98). As can be seen in Fig. 4, A and B, incubation of HOG cells with P2Ab resulted in a positive staining pattern that was abolished by preabsorption of the antibody with the peptide antigen (P2). Collectively, these results indicate that both OLG and HOG cells possess TXA2receptors. Expression of TXA2 receptors was further established using SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Specifically, HOG and OLG cell membrane proteins were extracted by treating washed cells with CHAPS at 4 °C. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation, and soluble proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. A human platelet solubilized membrane preparation (SMP) was immunoblotted in parallel as a positive control. It was found (Fig.5, lanes 2–4) that TxAb (diluted 1:500) not only immunoreacted with TXA2 receptor protein in platelet SMP but also revealed positive immunoreactivity against the 55-kDa receptor protein in solubilized OLG cells and HOG cell membranes. This immunoreactivity was not observed when probing either cell type with the pre-immune IgG (Fig. 5, lanes 6–9). To confirm that the positive immunoreactivity seen in solubilized OLG and HOG cells was not due to expression of the receptor in the immature or transformed phenotypes, respectively, immunoblot analysis was performed on a Triton X-100 soluble membrane fraction prepared from adult ovine oligodendrocytes (Fig. 5, lane 5). This experiment demonstrated a single immunoreactive band present at 55 kDa. To purify the TXA2 receptor present on oligodendrocytes, affinity chromatography was utilized. In this experiment, solubilized OLG proteins were incubated with an SQ31,491 ligand affinity column previously shown to purify TXA2 receptors from platelets (6Kim S.O. Lim C.T. Lam S.C. Hall S.E. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The column was then eluted with the receptor antagonist (BM13.177), and SDS-PAGE analysis of the wash and the elution fractions was performed. It can be seen (Fig.6 A) that while the final wash fraction (W4, lane 4) was essentially devoid of protein, competition with BM13.177 resulted in the elution of a major protein band at 55 kDa (lanes 5 and 6). Evidence that this 55-kDa protein represented the TXA2 receptor was obtained from immunoblot analysis which revealed positive reactivity with TxAb (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results represent the first purification of TXA2 receptors from oligodendrocytes and provide evidence that this receptor protein has a molecular mass in the range of 55 kDa. Because oligodendrocytes synthesize large quantities of lipids and proteolipids, which result in increased nonspecific binding of lipophilic TXA2 receptor ligands, the next series of experiments was undertaken to evaluate the capability of intact HOG cells to specifically bind the TXA2 antagonist [3H]SQ29,548. Using a modification of the protocol employed in detecting TXA2 binding sites in astrocytoma cells (19Nakahata N. Matsuoka I. Ono T. Nakanishi H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 162: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these experiments revealed a single class of high affinity binding sites, with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 4 ± 0.2 nm and a maximum binding of 34 ± 4 pm (Fig. 7). The calculated maximum binding (B max) of 34 pmcorresponds to approximately 3500 binding sites per HOG cell. ThisK D of 4 nm is comparable to that obtained for the TXA2 receptor in human platelets (K D = 7.3 nm) (34Hedberg A. Hall S.E. Ogletree M.L. Harris D.N. Liu E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 245: 786-792PubMed Google Scholar) and 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells (K D = 10.9 nm) (19Nakahata N. Matsuoka I. Ono T. Nakanishi H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 162: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The final series of experiments investigated the ability of a TXA2 receptor agonist to modulate intracellular calcium levels in HOG cells. Cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with fura-2/AM and exposed to various concentrations of U46619 in the presence or absence of the receptor antagonist, SQ29,548.

https://openalex.org/W2033760456,"A C-terminally truncated form of yapsin 1 (yeast aspartic protease 3), the first member of the novel sub-class of aspartic proteases with specificity for basic residues (designated the Yapsins), was overexpressed and purified to apparent homogeneity, yielding ∼1 μg of yapsin 1/g of wet yeast. N-terminal amino acid analysis of the purified protein confirmed that the propeptide was absent and that the mature enzyme began at Ala<sup>68</sup>. The mature enzyme was shown to be composed of approximately equimolar amounts of two subunits, designated α and β, that were associated to each other by a disulfide bond. C-terminally truncated proyapsin 1 was also expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell expression system and secreted as a zymogen that could be activated upon incubation at an acidic pH with an optimum at ∼4.0. When expressed without its pro-region, it was localized intracellularly and lacked activity, indicating that the pro-region was required for the correct folding of the enzyme. The activation of proyapsin 1 <i>in vitro</i> exhibited linear kinetics and generated an intermediate form of yapsin 1 or pseudo-yapsin 1."

PinA did not inhibit cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide,N-glutaryl-alanylalanylphenylalanyl-3-methoxynaphthylamide and, moreover, did not block the ability of protein substrates, such as casein, to activate cleavage of fluorogenic peptides by Lon. Thus, PinA does not block the proteolytic active site or the allosteric protein-binding site on Lon.

These data suggest that PinA does not bind at the ATPase active site of Lon and does not interfere with nucleotide binding to the enzyme. PinA inhibited cleavage of the 72-amino acid protein, CcdA, degradation of which requires ATP hydrolysis, but did not inhibit cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal 41-amino acid fragment of CcdA, degradation of which does not require ATP hydrolysis.

Each Lon monomer contains a proteolytic site and an ATP-binding site. Lon has ATPase activity that is activated by protein binding (3Menon A.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

For high molecular weight protein substrates, ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting, and the rates of proteolysis are directly proportional to the rates of ATP hydrolysis (5Goldberg A.L. Waxman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12029-12034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Protein substrates bind Lon at two sites, the proteolytic active site and an “allosteric site” that probably lies within the ATPase domain. Occupancy of this latter site by potential substrates, such as unfolded polypeptides, activates ATPase activity and enhances cleavage of low molecular weight peptides (5Goldberg A.L. Waxman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12029-12034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Science. 1986; 232: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Yeast Lon mutants lacking proteolytic activity but having an intact ATPase can promote assembly of protein complexes (9Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. Suzuki C.K. Science. 1996; 274: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), indicating that Lon can catalyze conformational changes in proteins. The allosteric protein-binding site is likely to be where specific degradation motifs in proteins are recognized and to be part of the catalytic domain for unfolding proteins. The ability to alter protein conformation may allow Lon to partially unfold proteins to give them greater access to the proteolytic active sites (10Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R.

In the preceding paper, we showed that purified PinA forms a complex with Lon protease and inhibits its casein degradation activity in vitro (13Hilliard J. Maurizi M.R. Simon L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 518-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the mechanism of Lon inhibition by PinA and suggest that PinA interferes with the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and protein degradation, possibly by preventing protein unfolding by Lon.DISCUSSIONPurified PinA inhibited casein degradation by Lon protease, and inhibition appeared to be noncompetitive with casein. The apparentK i for PinA (3–4 nm) is consistent with tight binding between the two proteins, as had been suggested by the isolation of a stoichiometric complex of PinA and Lon by gel filtration. PinA affinity for Lon is comparable to that observed for other low molecular weight protein protease inhibitors and their targets (Table IV). The very high affinity of PinA for Lon suggests a specific function for PinA in inhibiting Lon activity in vivo. Unlike most protease inhibitors, PinA apparently does not inhibit protein degradation by interfering with substrate binding or peptide bond hydrolysis at the proteolytic active site of its target protease.Table IVComparison of Ki values of protein protease inhibitorsEnzymeSubstrateInhibitorKimLonCaseinPinA3.6 × 10−9Papain4-aRef. 18.Z-Phe-Arg-NMec4-dN-Carbobenzoxy-Phe-Arg- 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin.Cystatin<1.0 × 10−11Trypsin4-bRef. 19.BAPNA4-eN-Benzoyl-dl-Arg-p-nitroanilide.Ecotin2.2 × 10−8Subtilisin4-cBinding constant was determined by direct physical measurement (20).NA4-fNot applicable.SSI4-gSSI, Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor.1.0 × 10−104-a Ref. 18Uehara Y.

Open table in a new tab The lack of inhibition of Lon peptidase activity and the noncompetitive nature of inhibition of casein degradation indicate that PinA binds outside of the proteolytic active site on Lon. Protein substrates bind to Lon and stimulate hydrolysis, suggesting that there is an allosteric binding site for protein substrates on Lon (8Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Science. 1986; 232: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PinA did not interfere with the ability of casein to stimulate peptidase activity (Table II), indicating that PinA does not block casein binding at the allosteric site, and thus PinA does not appear to bind, or at least does not completely occupy, the allosteric protein-binding site on Lon.PinA does not completely inhibit nucleotide hydrolysis, as evidenced by the 50% basal ATPase activity remaining at concentrations of PinA that block 90–95% of protein degradation (Fig. 2). However, protein-activated ATPase activity was completely blocked by PinA. Inhibition of both basal and substrate-stimulated ATP hydrolysis is independent of ATP concentration. Peptidase activity and CcdA41 degradation are stimulated by nucleotide binding and were unaffected by PinA. PinA is not competitive with ATP or ATP analogs and does not bind at the nucleotide site. Thus, PinA binds to a unique site distinct from previously described functional sites on Lon.Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis have distinct roles in Lon activity. Binding of nucleotides, such as ATP, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, or CTP, induces a conformation change which enhances peptidase activity of Lon (6Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12022-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, nucleotide binding is not sufficient to allow degradation of proteins with stable secondary or tertiary structure, which requires ATP hydrolysis (7Van Melderen L. Dao Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Since Lon peptidase activity is stimulated by nucleotides in the presence of PinA, PinA does not appear to affect the nucleotide-induced conformational change in Lon to the “activated” state.Binding of protein substrates at the allosteric site induces a conformational change in Lon that releases bound ADP (3Menon A.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14929-14934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The release of ADP allows Lon to continue the catalytic cycle of peptide bond cleavage, and failure to release ADP would “freeze” Lon in a conformationally inactive state (3Menon A.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14929-14934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PinA did not inhibit peptide or CcdA41 degradation when either ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog, AMPPNP, was used, PinA does not lock Lon in an inactive ADP-bound state.Recent data suggest that energy-dependent proteases need ATP hydrolysis to drive enzyme catalyzed conformational changes or unfolding of protein substrates. Yeast Lon protease and the ATPase domains of Clp proteases have chaperone-like activities and can remodel protein structures (9Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. Suzuki C.K. Science. 1996; 274: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 17Wickner S.

Studies with E. coli Lon have shown that the presence of stable secondary structure in a substrate is the determinant of the requirement for ATP hydrolysis (7Van Melderen L. Dao Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). With Clp proteases and the 26 S proteasome, disruption of the secondary structure of protein substrates is apparently required to allow substrates to get to the proteolytic active sites, which are located in an interior aqueous cavity accessible through relatively narrow channels. Although the structure of Lon is not known, it is likely that the active sites of Lon are similarly inaccessible to folded proteins.PinA specifically blocks the steps in protein degradation that require ATP hydrolysis. Degradation of CcdA (which requires unfolding) but not of CcdA41 (which does not require unfolding) was inhibited, suggesting that PinA inhibits the chaperone activity of Lon. We propose that PinA prevents the unfolding of protein substrates by interfering with ATP hydrolysis and the conformational changes in Lon that accompany ATP hydrolysis. These conformational changes in Lon may alter its interactions with bound proteins, which in turn result in structural changes in the protein substrate.Our previous data showed that a dimer of PinA binds to a tetramer of Lon (13Hilliard J. Maurizi M.R. Simon L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 518-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lon has four potential ATPase sites per tetramer, and inhibition of all stimulated ATPase activity by a single PinA dimer implies that Lon subunits act in a cooperative manner. Since it does not block access to the active sites for several protein substrates, PinA probably does not bind in the substrate channel to the active sites. We propose that PinA binds to a flexible region on Lon that is important in cooperative ATP-driven conformational changes that are coupled to unfolding of protein substrates. This binding site on Lon may represent a functional site that is occupied by other effectors of Lon in vivo, and its identification should give additional information about physiological regulation of Lon. Lon protease from Escherichia coli is an oligomeric enzyme composed of identical 87-kDa subunits (1Goldberg A.L. Moerschell R.P. Chung C.H. Maurizi M.R.

Binding of nucleotides, such as ATP, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, or CTP, induces a conformation change which enhances peptidase activity of Lon (6Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12022-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, nucleotide binding is not sufficient to allow degradation of proteins with stable secondary or tertiary structure, which requires ATP hydrolysis (7Van Melderen L. Dao Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Since Lon peptidase activity is stimulated by nucleotides in the presence of PinA, PinA does not appear to affect the nucleotide-induced conformational change in Lon to the “activated” state. Binding of protein substrates at the allosteric site induces a conformational change in Lon that releases bound ADP (3Menon A.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14929-14934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The release of ADP allows Lon to continue the catalytic cycle of peptide bond cleavage, and failure to release ADP would “freeze” Lon in a conformationally inactive state (3Menon A.S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14929-14934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PinA did not inhibit peptide or CcdA41 degradation when either ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog, AMPPNP, was used, PinA does not lock Lon in an inactive ADP-bound state. Recent data suggest that energy-dependent proteases need ATP hydrolysis to drive enzyme catalyzed conformational changes or unfolding of protein substrates. Yeast Lon protease and the ATPase domains of Clp proteases have chaperone-like activities and can remodel protein structures (9Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. Suzuki C.K. Science. 1996; 274: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 17Wickner S.

Studies with E. coli Lon have shown that the presence of stable secondary structure in a substrate is the determinant of the requirement for ATP hydrolysis (7Van Melderen L. Dao Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). With Clp proteases and the 26 S proteasome, disruption of the secondary structure of protein substrates is apparently required to allow substrates to get to the proteolytic active sites, which are located in an interior aqueous cavity accessible through relatively narrow channels. Although the structure of Lon is not known, it is likely that the active sites of Lon are similarly inaccessible to folded proteins. PinA specifically blocks the steps in protein degradation that require ATP hydrolysis. Degradation of CcdA (which requires unfolding) but not of CcdA41 (which does not require unfolding) was inhibited, suggesting that PinA inhibits the chaperone activity of Lon. We propose that PinA prevents the unfolding of protein substrates by interfering with ATP hydrolysis and the conformational changes in Lon that accompany ATP hydrolysis. These conformational changes in Lon may alter its interactions with bound proteins, which in turn result in structural changes in the protein substrate. Our previous data showed that a dimer of PinA binds to a tetramer of Lon (13Hilliard J. Maurizi M.R. Simon L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 518-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lon has four potential ATPase sites per tetramer, and inhibition of all stimulated ATPase activity by a single PinA dimer implies that Lon subunits act in a cooperative manner. Since it does not block access to the active sites for several protein substrates, PinA probably does not bind in the substrate channel to the active sites. We propose that PinA binds to a flexible region on Lon that is important in cooperative ATP-driven conformational changes that are coupled to unfolding of protein substrates. This binding site on Lon may represent a functional site that is occupied by other effectors of Lon in vivo, and its identification should give additional information about physiological regulation of Lon."
https://openalex.org/W2088305031,"Persistent infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the primary risk factors for human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In a human ecological study, we have shown that, in addition to HBV, animal food consumption also significantly contributes to the variance of HCC. To test the interacting effect of HBV and animal food consumption on the development of HCC, we investigated HBV expression in HBV transgenic mice fed three levels of casein diet. HBV expression in transgenic animals was substantially inhibited when dietary casein was reduced from the traditional level of 22% to the level of 6%. Northern analysis revealed that suppression of HBV was derived from both the upstream albumin promoter and the internal HBV promoter. Immunochemical staining of liver sections indicated that only a few hepatocytes around the central vein expressed viral surface antigen (HBsAg) in the 6% casein animals, whereas virtually all hepatocytes stained positively for HBsAg in the 22% dietary casein animals. Serum HBsAg concentrations at 4 months were increased by 1.6-, 2.1-, and 5.1- fold over baseline for animals fed the 6%, 14%, and 22% casein diets, respectively. Correspondingly, liver injury was much less severe in animals fed 6% casein diet than in those fed 14% and 22% casein diets. These results demonstrate that a low casein diet is a potent suppresser of HBV transgene and HBV-induced liver injury, suggesting that diet management may be a practical means to aid in the control HBV infection."

PinA is a heat-stable protein with a subunit M r of 18,800 and an isoelectric point of 4.6. Under nondenaturing conditions on a gel filtration column, PinA migrated in two peaks corresponding to a dimer and a tetramer.

Henderson G.W. Markovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4728-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is one of the major ATP-dependent proteases of Escherichia coli. In vivo, Lon is responsible for the degradation of such specific proteins as SulA (2Mizusawa S. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1124-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Lon, subunit M r 87,000, is an oligomeric protein that has been reported to exist in either tetrameric or octameric form (6Goldberg A.L. Moerschell R.P. Chung C.H. Maurizi M.R.

Sequence analysis suggests that each subunit of Lon contains a proteolytic active site and an ATPase site distinct from the proteolytic site (8Chin D.T. Goff S.A. Webster T. Smith T. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11718-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of small peptides and some small proteins requires nucleotide binding to Lon but does not require ATP hydrolysis (9Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 722-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP may provide energy to help unfold protein substrates, giving them greater access to the proteolytic active site and making them more susceptible to cleavage (13Goldberg A.L. Eur. J.

Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of CcdA degradation by Lon in vitro indicated that the absence of stable secondary structure in protein substrates decreased the requirement for ATP hydrolysis (11Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Protein substrates bind to two sites on Lon, the proteolytic active site and an allosteric site, which may serve as the site for the protein remodeling function. Occupancy of the allosteric site by substrates such as unfolded polypeptides activates the peptidase activity against small peptides and enhances proteolysis (12Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Science. 1986; 232: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). E. coli cells infected with bacteriophage T4 show reduced proteolysis of abnormal proteins and protein fragments (18Simon L.D. Tomczak K. John A.C.S. Nature. 1978; 275: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein degradation requires synthesis of T4 proteins made during the first 10 min after infection at 37 °C (18Simon L.D. Tomczak K. John A.C.S.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Simon L.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The target of PinA in vivo appears to be the ATP-dependent Lon protease, because E. coli lon + cells expressing a single copy of the T4 pinA gene are phenotypically Lon− (21Skorupski K. Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Simon L.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have purified the PinA protein and shown that purified PinA binds to Lon protease and inhibits its ATP-dependent protein degrading activity in vitro. In the accompanying paper (22Hilliard J. Simon L.D. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that PinA exerts its affect by blocking ATP hydrolysis by Lon. All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise specified. [3H]Formaldehyde was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Clp protease was purified as described previously (23Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Kroh H.E.

Bacteria used to make cell extracts were grown in glucose L broth (31Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 59-62Crossref Scopus (716) Google Scholar), which contained (per liter) 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, and 2 g of glucose. Glucose L agar contained glucose L broth with 1.5% (w/v) agar. Ampicillin was used at 50 μg/ml as needed. Lon protease was purified fromE. coli SG22030 (lon +) carrying the multicopy plasmid plon +500, which containslon under its own promoter (5Maurizi M.R. Trisler P. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1124-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purification method has been described (6Goldberg A.L. Moerschell R.P. Chung C.H. Maurizi M.R.

Lon was estimated by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMPPNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PTC, phenylisothiocyanate. to be 90–95% pure and was free of other proteases. The pinAgene product was expressed from a plasmid constructed by J. Tomaschewski 2J. Tomaschewski, unpublished data. using the expression vectors of Tabor and Richardson (26Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). The host strain wasE. coli LS101, a derivative of K38 (27Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) carrying agalE mutation to prevent production of excess capsular polysaccharide in the absence of lon function in vivo. Cells were transformed with plasmid pGP1–2, which has T7 RNA polymerase under a heat-inducible promoter (26Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar), and plasmid pT7AT/pin, which has the pinA gene under control of a T7 promoter. To induce expression of the pinA gene, cells grown at 28 °C were shifted to 42 °C for 30 min and left at 40 °C for 2 h. Harvested cells were stored at −80 °C. For purification of the PinA protein, 24 g of frozen cells were defrosted in an ice bath and suspended in 90 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (measured at 25 °C), containing 2 mmEDTA and either 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 2 mm DTT (buffer T). Purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i., and extracts were centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 1 h. Solid ammonium sulfate (30% of saturation) was added to the supernatant, and after 30 min the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 80 ml of buffer T, and the ammonium sulfate precipitation was repeated. The pellet from the second precipitation was stored at −80 °C overnight. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 80 ml of buffer T, and the solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) in aliquots of 20 ml, and aliquots were loaded onto separate MonoQ HR 10/10 columns. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.6 m KCl in buffer T at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing PinA identified by SDS-PAGE were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to 40% saturation. After centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000 × g, the pellet was suspended in 10–15 ml buffer T with 0.1 m KCl. Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was loaded in aliquots of 2.5 ml onto separate 2.3 × 60-cm TSK250 gel filtration columns equilibrated in buffer T with 0.1m KCl. Proteins were eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Purified PinA was stored at −80 °C. PinA was also purified on a smaller scale in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.0 at 4 °C, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin. Following cell lysis and centrifugation, the PinA protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described above, and the pellet was suspended in PIPES buffer and dialyzed overnight. The dialysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 ×g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was then loaded onto a MonoQ HR 16/10 anion exchange column. The column was developed stepwise with a gradient from 0.2 m to 1m NaCl in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. When the elution gradient reached 0.3 m NaCl, 0.46 m NaCl, and 1.0 m NaCl, the NaCl concentration was kept constant for 10 min. PinA-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated in a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon), and loaded onto a Superose-12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were eluted from the Superose-12 column in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA buffer, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Column fractions with PinA were pooled, concentrated, and run over the Superose-12 column again in the same buffer. The fractions containing PinA were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (buffer B), and stored at −80 °C. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels were run essentially as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), using Mini-PROTEAN II Ready Gels (Bio-Rad). Except as noted, 12% gels were used. The molecular weight of PinA under nondenaturing conditions was determined by gel filtration on a Superose-12 column by comparing the elution time of the PinA protein to the elution times of proteins of known molecular weights. The subunit molecular weight was estimated by SDS-PAGE. The isoelectric point of the PinA protein was determined using Pharmacia isoelectric focusing 3–9 Phastgels. Protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using the reagent supplied by Bio-Rad, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. PinA concentrations were measured from the absorbance using the extinction coefficient. Purified PinA was hydrolyzed in 6n HCl at 155 °C for 30 and 60 min. The hydrolysates were washed, dried, and derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate (PTC). PTC-amino acids were separated on a C18 reverse phase column (4.6 mm × 15 cm) using the solvent system described by Bidlingmeyeret al. (30Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). The cysteine content of the PinA protein was determined by performic acid oxidation (31Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 59-62Crossref Scopus (716) Google Scholar), followed by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. Aromatic amino acids were determined spectrophotometrically by second derivative UV spectroscopy in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, as described by Levine and Federici (32Levine R.L. Federici M.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using the amino acid content calculated from the DNA-derived sequence of PinA, the extinction coefficient of the protein was determined from the calculated aromatic amino acid content of the protein and the measured absorbance of a standard solution of the protein. To remove salts and buffers prior to sequencing, purified PinA was passed through a HR 10/10 Fast desalting column (Pharmacia) in deionized H2O. Sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's directions on an Applied Biosystems model 470A Protein Sequencer with a model 120A on-line PTH Amino Acid Analyzer (33Hunkapiller M. Kent S. Caruthers M. Dreyer W. Firca J. Giffin C. Horvath S. Hunkapiller T. Tempst P. Hood L. Nature. 1984; 310: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and a model 610A Data Analysis Module and the ABI model 475 Report Generator. α-Casein was radioactively labeled with [3H]formaldehyde by the method of Jentoft and Dearborn (34Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the [3H]methyl α-casein was approximately 5 μCi/mg. Assays for proteolytic activity were performed as described previously (9Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2696-2703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or as follows. A solution with 9 μg of [3H]methyl α-casein in 250 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 4 mm ATP was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5–2.0 μg of Lon. Incubation at 37 °C was continued for 15–30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 310 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 40 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Precipitated proteins were separated from trichloroacetic acid-soluble proteins by centrifugation at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 6 min. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting using 0.5 ml of the supernatant in 10 ml of Scintiverse BD (Fisher) or Aquasol (NEN Life Science Products). Assays were performed in duplicate, and the measured activity had a variance of ≤4%. PinA was added to standard assays solutions 1–5 min prior to addition of Lon to initiate the assays. Mixing PinA and Lon before adding them to the assay mixtures did not affect the results. The effect of pH on the inhibitory activity of PinA was determined by substituting the following buffers in the assay mixture: 50 mm MES, sodium salt, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 6.0 and 7.0; 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0–9.0; and 50 mm2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0–10.5. A 2.5-ml Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia) column was equilibrated at room temperature in buffer B. Lon (20 μg) was loaded onto the column, and 250-μl aliquots of buffer were added at 2 min intervals. Aliquots of 250 μl were collected from the column at each step. The same procedure was used for PinA (20 μg) and for a mixture of 20 μg of Lon and 20 μg of PinA. Nucleotide requirement was determined by equilibrating the column in buffer B containing 50 μm AMPPNP, and then chromatographing Lon and PinA. Alternatively, Lon, PinA, or the PinA-Lon complex was centrifuged through a Bio-Spin column packed with Sephacryl Superfine S-200 according the manufacturer's instructions. Lon (250 μg), PinA (250 μg), and mixtures of the two proteins were also analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose12 column equilibrated in buffer B. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in the same buffer. Protein in the fractions was detected by SDS-PAGE, and fractions were assayed for [3H]methyl α-casein degrading ability. After SDS-PAGE, the protein was stained with Coomassie Blue and quantitated by densitometry with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIc/ADF using Deskscan and Collage software or by capturing a digital image of the gel with an Eagle Eye Frame Integrator and using NIH Image software. Known amounts of Lon or PinA were used as standards. To determine if formation of the PinA-Lon complex was reversible, the complex isolated by gel filtration was diluted into assay solutions of increasing volume (100 μl to 1.6 ml) to reduce the concentrations of PinA and Lon below the apparentK d, and the increase in Lon activity was measured. PinA was purified to near homogeneity from extracts of cells in which the protein was overproduced. Previous work had shown that PinA was a component of the cytosol and was not associated with the cell membrane. 3H. J. Kim, unpublished observations. Purified PinA in fractions from the final gel filtration step is shown in Fig.1 A; PinA was estimated to be ≥95% pure in the best fractions, which were stored separately and used for the experiments described below. PinA had a maximum absorbance at 281 nm and an extinction coefficient of 1.95 (mg/ml)−1determined by analysis of the second derivative of the UV absorbance spectrum (32Levine R.L. Federici M.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The pinA gene in the plasmid used for these studies was sequenced and found to be identical to the published DNA sequence (data not shown). Purified PinA had an apparent M r of 20,800 by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) in reasonable agreement with the predicted M r of 18,000. The isoelectric point was 4.6 (data not shown), in good agreement with the predicted pI of 4.3. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein determined by Edman degradation was found to be MITVDKWFRINRADTGLCNY, which is identical to that translated from the pinA DNA sequence (35Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3632-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the protein also agreed well with that predicted from the published sequence (data not shown). In the absence of a reducing agent during purification, or after repeated freeze-thaw cycles, a second band of PinA, apparentM r ∼19,000, was detected on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). It is not known whether PinA was partially degraded by a contaminating protease or was subject to chemical cleavage or modification. No loss of inhibitory activity of PinA was observed upon prolonged storage of the protein at −90 °C. Inhibition of Lon protease activity was examined using [3H]methyl α-casein as the substrate and by following the ATP-dependent release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments. Extracts of cells in which PinA was overproduced contained an inhibitor of Lon protease, and no such inhibitory activity was seen with extracts of control cells with the plasmid vector, which did not contain PinA (data not shown). The inhibitory activity against Lon protease co-eluted with the PinA protein during purification (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 2 shows the concentration dependence of inhibition of Lon-dependent casein degradation by purified PinA. Inhibition was ≥90% in the presence of a sufficient excess of PinA. In this experiment, PinA was added to the assay solutions in increasing amounts prior to starting the reaction by addition of Lon protease. The amount of PinA required to inhibit Lon was less than 1% of the casein present in the assay solution, and, therefore, inhibition was not due to interaction of PinA with the substrate. PinA apparently binds very rapidly to Lon, since prior incubation of the two proteins together did not increase the degree of inhibition (data not shown). PinA has a very high affinity for Lon under the conditions used for these assays; half-maximal inhibition occurred at about 20 nm PinA subunit or only 10 nm PinA dimer. PinA purified by both procedures described under “Experimental Procedures” had comparable inhibitory properties. In vivo studies suggested that other ATP-dependent E. coli proteases were not affected by PinA (22Hilliard J. Simon L.D. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, PinA did not inhibit casein degradation by the ATP-dependent proteases, ClpAP or ClpYQ (HslUV). Thus, PinA appears to specifically recognize Lon protease.Table ISpecificity of PinA for Lon proteaseProteaseProtease activitya−PinA+PinAmg casein/hLon1.40.5ClpAP (excess ClpP)2123ClpAP (excess ClpA)5253ClpYQ (HslUV)8.07.8 Open table in a new tab PinA was stable when heated. TableII shows that PinA inhibited Lon to the same extent before and after heating for 10 min at ∼100 °C. Inhibition of Lon by PinA required the intact PinA protein, because digestion of PinA by trypsin or chymotrypsin inactivated PinA (data not shown). This experiment also demonstrated that Lon inhibition was not due to nonproteinaceous inhibitors contaminating the PinA.Table IIHeat stability of PinAComponents in assayRemaining casein degrading activity2-aActivity is expressed as a percent of that observed without inhibitor (∼2 mg of casein/h/mg of Lon).%Lon alone100Lon + PinA15Lon + heated PinA172-a Activity is expressed as a percent of that observed without inhibitor (∼2 mg of casein/h/mg of Lon). Open table in a new tab To determine if PinA was cleaved by Lon, PinA was incubated with Lon for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by boiling the proteins in SDS. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by densitometry after staining with Coomassie Blue. As shown in Fig. 3, no loss of PinA was detectable after incubation with Lon. Thus, PinA does not appear to be a substrate for Lon. Freshly purified PinA migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 on a Superose 12 gel filtration column in the presence of 0.1–0.2 m KCl and thus appears to be a dimer. After storage at −20 °C for more than 1 year, PinA species that appeared by gel filtration to be tetramers (see Fig. 4) and octamers (data not shown) predominated. No noticeable effect on the ability of PinA to inhibit Lon protease accompanied these changes in oligomeric state, and it is possible that the aggregated PinA dissociated to dimers and tetramers at the dilutions used for assays. High salt concentrations (≥0.3m KCl) cause PinA to dissociate into monomers and, when present in assay solutions, decrease the inhibitory effects of PinA (data not shown). These last data suggest either that the monomeric form of PinA does not inhibit Lon or that the interaction between PinA and Lon is disrupted by high ionic strength. PinA inhibition of Lon was optimal between pH 8 and 9 (data not shown). Above pH 9.5, inhibitory activity decreased considerably, but the decreased inhibition could reflect conformational changes in either protein, because both Lon and PinA appear to lose activity at higher pH. PinA was not irreversibly inactivated at pH 10.5, because PinA preincubated at pH 10.5 was able to inhibit Lon when added to the standard pH 8.0 assay buffer (data not shown). PinA binding to Lon was shown by isolation of a complex of the two proteins on a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column. Fig. 4 shows the fractions containing PinA and Lon protease when the two proteins were run over the column either separately or after mixing together. When the proteins were chromatographed separately, the elution position of PinA, which was a mixture of dimers and tetramers, was much later than that of Lon. When the proteins were run together, PinA and Lon were found together in fractions eluting slightly ahead of the elution position of Lon alone, and there was a decrease in the protein peak at the elution position of PinA alone (Fig. 4 A). There was considerable overlap in the positions of the Lon-PinA complex and Lon alone, partly due to the tendency of Lon to trail severely in these columns. The complex could be isolated in the presence or absence of nucleotide (data not shown). The proteolytic activity of Lon in fractions containing the isolated complex was assayed and compared with that present in similar fractions when Lon protease was run alone. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the casein degrading activity of the PinA-Lon complex was only 5–10% of the activity of Lon protease alone. The amount of PinA bound to Lon was determined in a separate experiment by mixing the two proteins in a ratio of five PinA dimers per subunit of Lon and isolating the complex by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column. Protein in the fractions corresponding to the complex was quantitated by comparing the intensity of the Coomassie-stained bands to known amounts of Lon or PinA that had been run and stained in parallel. Approximately 1–2 dimers of PinA were bound to 1 tetramer of Lon. Increasing the amount of PinA added to Lon did not increase the PinA found complexed to Lon (data not shown). The release of active PinA from the PinA-Lon complex was demonstrated by taking advantage of the thermal stability of PinA. Aliquots of Lon and the PinA-Lon complex from the Sephacryl spin-column eluates were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, after which the aliquots were immediately added to reaction mixtures with and without fresh Lon. TableIII shows that, after 10 min at 65 °C, Lon alone or in the complex with PinA had no proteolytic activity. Addition of the heated PinA-Lon complex to assay solutions with fresh Lon resulted in inhibition. The inhibition was not due to interference from the heated and presumably denatured Lon, since the addition of heated Lon alone to the reaction mixture had no effect on casein degradation by fresh nondenatured Lon. Thus, no irreversible change in PinA accompanies binding to and inhibition of Lon protease.Table IIIActive PinA can be recovered from the PinA-Lon complexEluate added to assayLon-dependent casein degradation3-aUntreated Lon activity was about 2 mg of casein degraded/h/mg of Lon.%A.

Open table in a new tab The PinA-Lon complex was isolated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. Eluates were collected and were assayed for ATP-dependent casein degradation in reaction solutions of different volumes. TableIV shows that Lon in the complex isolated from the column was inhibited >90% when assayed at high concentrations of the complex, but dilution of the complex resulted in a progressive increase in the Lon activity. Similar results were obtained without isolation of the complex by gel filtration. PinA and Lon were premixed in a ratio sufficient to cause >90% inhibition of Lon activity when assayed in 100-μl reaction solutions. Dilution of the same mixture into larger volumes for assay resulted in dissociation of the complex and a 40% gain in Lon activity (Table IV). In other experiments, 40–85% of Lon activity was recovered at 8–16-fold dilution of the PinA-Lon complex into assay solutions (data not shown). These results suggest that, although the PinA-Lon complex is quite stable, complex formation is reversible.Table IVReversibility of Lon inhibition by PinAAssay volumeLon activityμlUnits4-aA unit of Lon activity is 2 mg of casein degraded/h/mg of Lon).%A.

Open table in a new tab The bacteriophage T4 PinA protein has been purified from E. coli cells carrying a multicopy plasmid with the pinAgene under control of a T7 promoter. Purified PinA inhibits ATP-dependent casein degradation by Lon protease by more than 90%. PinA shares several properties with other polypeptide protease inhibitors. It is relatively small (M r20,000), heat-stable, and acidic (pI = 4.6); however, PinA does not inhibit proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, or pepsin but is degraded and inactivated by treatment with these proteases. PinA appears to target Lon protease specifically, and elsewhere (22Hilliard J. Simon L.D. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we demonstrate that PinA inhibits ATP-dependent protein degradation by Lon protease by blocking the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and peptide bond cleavage. Inhibition of [3H]methyl α-casein degradation by Lon protease occurs at very low concentrations of PinA, and an apparentK i of about 5 nm was calculated under standard assay conditions. The low K i implies that PinA binds tightly to Lon, which was confirmed by showing that it was possible to isolate a complex of Lon and PinA after gel filtration chromatography. The complex was formed in the absence of nucleotide as well as in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, indicating that tight binding of PinA to Lon does not require any of the energy-driven steps involved in protein degradation. As expected, when used at concentrations comparable to those in standard assays, the PinA-Lon complex isolated by gel filtration showed little proteolytic activity against [3H]methyl α-casein. However, dilution of the complex resulted in a small increase in proteolytic activity, suggesting that inhibition of Lon by PinA is at least partially reversible. Heating the PinA-Lon complex released PinA from denatured Lon protease. The free PinA was able to bind to Lon and inhibit proteolytic activity. SDS gel analysis of PinA after forming a complex with Lon or released from the complex by heating showed no evidence of cleavage of the PinA. The classical protease inhibitors from plants and microbial organisms are characterized by either reversible or irreversible mechanisms (37Polgar L. Mechanisms of Protease Action. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar). Reversible inhibitors have a specific peptide bond, which combines with the active site of the target protease and is then cleaved by the protease. Hydrolysis does not proceed to completion, but an equilibrium between intact and cleaved peptide bonds is established. Irreversible inhibitors combine with the protease and are cleaved at a specific peptide bond. However, the acyl intermediate between the inhibitor and the protease is not hydrolyzed and the inhibitor remains covalently bound to the protease. The latter inhibitor-enzyme complex resists dissociation by urea and SDS. The results of the thermal inactivation and dilution studies of the PinA-Lon complex suggest that PinA may differ from other reversible inhibitors in that it is not cleaved by the protease. Skorupski et al. (21Skorupski K. Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Simon L.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown thatlon + cells lysogenic for λ in which thepinA gene has been cloned behave phenotypi-cally likelon mutants. These lysogens produce mucoid colonies, filament in response to DNA damage, permit efficient plaque formation by λ Ots phage at 40 °C, and exhibit reduced levels of abnormal protein degradation, all typical of E. coli cells lacking functional Lon protease (17Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 163-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Expression of pinAhas no detectable effect on abnormal protein degradation in E. coli null lon strains (21Skorupski K. Tomaschewski J. Ruger W. Simon L.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that PinA does not inhibit ClpAP or ClpYQ activity in vitro is consistent with the idea that PinA displays specificity for Lon protease alone. ATP-dependent proteases tend to be high molecular weight, multimeric enzymes with potential binding sites for regulatory components. Several endogenous inhibitors that bind reversibly to the eukaryotic 20 S and 26 S proteasomes have been described, each of which appears to have a unique mode of action. For example, an inhibitor described by Chu-Ping et al. (39Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) apparently acts allosterically since it inhibits three distinct peptidase activities of the 20 S proteasome, whereas a ubiquitinated inhibitor from rabbit reticulocytes blocks ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by the 26 S proteasome but has only partial activity against peptidase activities (40Li X. Gu M. Etlinger J.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9709-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A multimeric factor, CF2, combines with the 20 S proteasome and appears to inhibit peptidase activity (41Driscoll J. Frydman J. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since CF2 and the 20 S proteasome are both components of the 26 S proteasome, this inhibition probably reflects changes in accessibility of the proteolytic active sites during assembly of the 26 S proteasome, which has ATP-dependent proteolytic activity and has a more stringent specificity, preferentially degrading ubiquitinated proteins. No inhibitors of the E. coli ClpAP or ClpXP proteases have yet been described. The CIII protein of λ inhibits the ATP-dependent FtsH (HflB) protease; however,in vivo data suggest that CIII simply acts as a competitive substrate for the protease, and CIII does not inhibit Lon proteasein vitro. 4M. R. Maurizi, unpublished data. A search of the GenBank and Swiss-Prot data bases (42Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) revealed no homologies to pinA at either the DNA or amino acid sequence level. PinA, therefore, appears to be a novel protease inhibitor, highly specific for Lon protease. Further characterizations of the effects of PinA on the proteolytic, peptidase and ATPase activities of Lon are described in the accompanying paper (22Hilliard J. Simon L.D. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2018004545,"RelA and RelB belong to the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB-Rel) transcription factor family. Both proteins are structurally and functionally related, but their intracellular and tissue distributions are different. In resting cells, RelB is found mostly in the nucleus, whereas RelA is sequestered in the cytosol by protein inhibitors, among which IκBα is the dominant form in lymphocytes. Upon cellular activation IκBα is proteolyzed, allowing RelA dimers to enter the nucleus and activate target genes. To study the selectivity of gene regulation by RelA and RelB, we generated T cell lines stably expressing a dominant negative mutant of IκBα. We show that selective inhibition of RelA-NF-κB decreased induction ofNFKB1, interleukin-2, and interleukin-2Rα genes but not c-myc. Transcription driven by the IκBα promoter was blocked by the transgenic IκBα; however, wild type IκBα was expressed in the transgenic cell clones but with much slower kinetics than that in control cells. Wild type IκBα expression was concomitant with RelB up-regulation, suggesting that RelB could be involved in transcription of IκBα through binding to an alternative site. These results indicate that RelB and RelA have both distinct and overlapping effects on gene expression."

Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis assays have revealed that cell cycle expression of both divergently transcribed genes is controlled by separate E2F and Sp1 promoter elements active in each orientation (7Guarguaglini G.

Both the RanBP1 and Htf9-c transcriptional units are initiated in a genomic sequence that has typical features of the CG-rich class of mammalian promoters, which are mainly, although not exclusively, associated with housekeeping genes. An intriguing feature shared by most promoters of the housekeeping class is the absence of a TATA box, whose function in transcriptional initiation is well established for all three classes of RNA polymerase (reviewed in Refs. 10Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 11Novina C.D. Roy A.L.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In most TATA-less promoters the DNA region surrounding the major transcriptional start site(s) plays a crucial role in directing initiation (see Refs. 11Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and 13Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar for reviews). Like many CG-rich promoters, the Htf9 bidirectional promoter harbors no TATA box on either DNA strand; RNA transcription is initiated at multiple sites on each strand; transcription start 1 (TS-1 in Fig. 1 B) is the most frequently used start site on both DNA strands (1Lavia P. Macleod D. Bird A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Deletion mapping analysis (7Guarguaglini G. Battistoni A. Pittoggi C. Di Matteo G. Di Fiore B. Lavia P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) restricted the promoter region required for basal transcription to a 74-bp long region active in both orientations. Within that region, genomic footprinting experiments depicted a site protected by unidentified factor(s), located 20 bp apart from a functional Sp1-binding site and flanking TS-1 (15Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to characterize theHtf9 footprinted element (HFE) adjacent to TS-1. In an initial set of experiments, we found that double-stranded HFE interacts with factors belonging to the family of retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In addition, distinct factors recognize each single HFE strand. The distinct DNA binding activities depicted with different forms of the HFE element might have indicated that the Htf9initiation region was organized either in the double-stranded or in the single-stranded conformation in different cellular conditions. Since both Htf9-associated genes are transcribed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, we sought to determine whether the interaction of factors with HFE varies in relation to proliferation and transcription. Our findings show that the double-stranded nucleoprotein complex is efficiently assembled with extracts from liver cells, in which transcription from the Htf9 locus is extremely low or absent, while single stranded DNA binding activities are abundant in cycling NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, in which bothHtf9-associated genes are actively transcribed. In addition, the region surrounding HFE acquires an S1-sensitive conformation in vivo in cycling, but not in growth-arrested, NIH/3T3 cells, where transcriptional repression occurs. Therefore, theHtf9 promoter appears to assume alternative conformations in relation to transcription. These data suggest that factors of the RXR family and the newly identified single-stranded binding proteins participate to transcriptional control of theHtf9-associated genes by interacting with alternative forms of the HFE element in different cellular conditions. Murine NIH/3T3 embryo fibroblasts (ATCC CRL 1658) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

To obtain S phase-enriched cultures, cell cycle reentry was induced after starvation by adding 15% fetal calf serum and harvesting 15 h after stimulation. Growth arrest and cell cycle progression were monitored by flow cytometry as described (9Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C. Tripodi M. Jansen-Durr P. Lavia P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1213-1224PubMed Google Scholar). Cell samples were analyzed in a FACStar Plus cytofluorimeter using the WinMDI software (10.000 events/sample). Protein extracts were prepared from both NIH/3T3 fibroblast cultures and from livers from 3–4-week-old black C57 mice after nuclei isolation as described previously (8Somma M.P. Gambino I. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All buffers and solutions contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A. For chromatographic fractionation, NIH/3T3 nuclei were isolated by centrifugation through a 0.8 m sucrose cushion overlaid by 0.3 m sucrose solution. Proteins were extracted in 0.42 m KCl buffer and sequentially precipitated; pelleted proteins from the 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation were redissolved in D buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol), dialyzed, and again precipitated using 60% ammonium sulfate. Proteins in the supernatant were loaded onto a phosphocellulose column and subjected to chromatography. Recovered fractions were extensively dialyzed against D buffer, subjected to chromatography through DEAE 52 cellulose, and finally recovered by step elution using KCl. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at Genenco Service (Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, University “La Sapienza,” Rome), except for the RXR-binding oligonucleotide (DR-1 configuration) and its mutagenized version (MDR-1), which were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oligonucleotide sequences are indicated in the text. Gel shift reactions were set up with 20–100 pg of [γ32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide, 5–7 μg of NIH/3T3 cell or liver extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl for 15 min on ice. Slighlty different conditions were used for ssG binding: 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 500 ng of nonspecific single-stranded DNA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 60 mm KCl and 0.1% Nonidet-P 40. In certain experiments, sodium deoxycholate (0.8% final concentration) was added either to the protein mixture before addition of the probe, or to the complete reaction, and incubated for 10 min on ice; incubations were terminated by adding Nonidet-P 40 (1.5% final concentration). Where required reactions were preincubated with competitor DNA for 10 min on ice before adding the probe. Supershift reactions were set up as above, except that 2 μl (2 μg) of anti-RXR or anti-retinoic acid receptors (RAR) antibody were added to the binding mixtures and further incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Anti-RXR and anti-RAR specificities are described below. Nuclear protein extracts from cycling and growth-arrested NIH/3T3 cells, as well as from liver fractions, were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted in 48 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 39 mmglycine, 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol on nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blotting using either anti-RXR or anti-RAR antibodies (1:1000 dilution). The anti-RXR (ΔN 197, Santa Cruz sc-774) reacts with all murine RXR subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ), but not with RAR factors; the anti-RAR (M-454, Santa Cruz sc-773) reacts with all RAR subtypes (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, and γ2) but not with RXR factors. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20.000 dilution), and bands were revealed following the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (ECL reagents, Amersham Corp.). The pEA-A and pEA-C constructs were generated by inserting the EarI-AluI fragment from the Htf9 promoter (X05830 sequence) in both orientations upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) sequence; the pES-A and pES-C constructs were generated by inserting the EarI-SmaI fragment from theHtf9 promoter in both orientations upstream of the CAT sequence. HFE-mutated constructs carried an oligonucleotide identical to the EarI-AluI fragment, except that HFE was mutated to 5′-GAACTCTGATCTCTGGTCTCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGAGACCAGAGATCAGAGTTC-3′ on complementary strands (C → T and G → A mutations are underlined). The fragment was cloned in both orientations upstream of the CAT sequence, yielding the pEA-mA and pEA-mC constructs respectively, or ligated to the AluI-SmaI fragment from the Htf9 promoter to yield the pES-mA and pES-mC constructs. In an independent series of constructs, the HFE oligonucleotide was ligated in multiple copies downstream or upstream of the pA10.CAT2 promoter, which carries two copies of the SV40 21-bp repeat (including Sp1 sites) and a TATA box (16Laimins L.A. Khoury G. Gorman C.M. Howard B. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6453-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 cells were routinely diluted 1:6 the day before transfection. Typical experiments were carried out using 5 × 106 cells and a mixture composed of DOTAP liposome reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 5 μg of CAT reporter DNA, and 1 μg of pCMV-lacZ plasmid. The medium was changed 6 h after lipofection, and cells were harvested 36–48 h later. In all experiments, mock-transfected cultures were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry as a control to verify that cells were actively proliferating. Promoter strengths were quantified by immunoenzymatic staining of the CAT protein (CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, Boehringer Mannheim) and normalized relative to the amount of synthesized β-galactosidase from the co-transfected plasmid (β-galactosidase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Boehringer Mannheim). pSV0 or pCAT promoterless vectors (Promega) were used as negative controls. Four to eight transfections experiments were carried out for each construct. NIH/3T3 cultures were growth-arrested or synchronized in S phase as described above. Total RNA was extracted following the guanidine-acid phenol method, electrophoresed, stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the 28 and 18 S ribosomal bands, and transferred to GeneScreen membranes as reported in detail elsewhere (9Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C. Tripodi M. Jansen-Durr P. Lavia P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1213-1224PubMed Google Scholar). Probes used for Northern hybridizations were gel-purified fragments corresponding to the Htf9-c,Htf9-a/RanBP1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coding sequences. Plasmid DNAs were prepared using Qiagen columns, which yield approximately 75% of all DNA molecules in the supercoiled form. Plasmids were subjected to S1 digestion in S1 buffer (3 mm ZnCl2, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei from growth-arrested or S phase NIH/3T3 cells were resuspended in buffer A (homogenization buffer without sucrose) and digested with increasing amounts of S1 nuclease (Amersham) in S1 buffer as above, except that 300 mm NaCl was used. Digestions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 5 h. Genomic DNA was repeatedly extracted with phenol and phenol-chloroform, precipitated, resuspended, digested with EcoRI, electrophoresed, and blotted with conventional methods. Terminal probes for indirect end-labeling experiments were purified from the pL9.2 subclone, which contains the Htf9 bidirectional promoter (X05830 sequence); probes were prepared by double digestion either withEcoRI and HindIII, yielding a 315-bp probe from the 3′ region, or with EcoRI and EcoRV, yielding a 485-bp probe from the 5′ region of the Htf9 insert, eluted from preparative gels, uniformly labeled, hybridized to the filter-bound DNA, and washed using standard procedures. In a previous characterization of theHtf9 locus (shown in Fig.1 A), we mapped the full-length bidirectional promoter to a 273-bp fragment (14Somma M.P. Pisano C. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which was subsequently found to contain both basal and cell cycle control elements in each orientation. Deletion of the elements responsible for cell cycle control of each gene yielded a 74-bp fragment, called EA to design the EarI-AluI restriction ends (see Fig.1 B), which directed basal transcription in both directions (7Guarguaglini G. Battistoni A. Pittoggi C. Di Matteo G. Di Fiore B. Lavia P. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genomic footprinting identified functional sites of protein interaction in the fragment (15Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Among those, a footprint (framed in Fig. 1 B) exactly starts at the nucleotide adjacent to the major start site of transcription (TS-1 in Fig. 1 B) used for initiation of both the Htf9-a/RanBP1 and Htf9-c mRNA transcripts. We set out to establish whether the sequence defined by the footprint, calledHtf9 footprinted element (HFE), identified a functional element. An oligonucleotide corresponding to HFE was saturated with mutations (see “Experimental Procedures”) and assayed in either orientation, both in the context of the 74-bp basal promoter (pEA series), and within a larger promoter fragment (180 bp) harboring activator binding sites (pES series); assayed constructs in transient expression experiments in NIH/3T3 cells are shown in Fig. 1 C. In the orientation of the Htf9-C gene, HFE inactivation significantly reduced the basal activity of the pEA-C promoter, whose strength decreased by 50%; a milder effect (25% reduction) was recorded in the 180-bp pES-C construct. In the RanBP1orientation, HFE mutation lowered activity of the 180-bp pES-A promoter by approximately 50%; it was difficult to determine whether the reduction was significant in the pEA-A basal promoter, which workedper se with very low efficiency. Thus, HFE contributes to promoter activity in both orientations, although the effect of mutations is sensed differently in the context of different promoter architectures. To assess whether HFE acted as an activator-binding element, the pA10.CAT2 vector was used, which contains a minimal promoter composed of two Sp1-binding sites and a TATA box (16Laimins L.A. Khoury G. Gorman C.M. Howard B. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6453-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). If HFE functioned as a classical modular promoter element, multimerized copies should activate transcription from pA10.CAT2. No difference was instead detected in the efficiency of chimeric promoter constructs bearing one to four HFE copies upstream or downstream of the TATA box compared with that of pA10.CAT2 alone (data not shown). These results suggest that HFE does not identify a strong activator-binding element, yet its integrity in the Htf9 promoter is required for full activity in both orientations in NIH/3T3 cells. As an initial step to characterize the factors conferring the protection flanking TS-1, an oligonucleotide was synthesized from the footprinted HFE window and incubated with NIH/3T3 cell extracts. A discrete nucleoprotein complex was detected by gel-shift assays (Fig.2 B, lanes 1,11, and 14). Since the HFE location near the transcription start is similar to that of certain initiators, competition assays were designed with oligonucleotides characterized for their ability to initiate transcription in TATA-less promoters, including the adenovirus Inr initiator element and binding sites for the YY1, USF, and Sp1 factors (see Weis and Reinberg (13Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and references therein). A canonical TATA box was also assayed, since transcription initiation involves direct or indirect interaction of the TBP factor with several TATA-less promoters (17Wiley S. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5814-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Zenzie-Gregory B. Khachi A. Garraway I.P. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Kaufman J. Smale S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). None of the tested sequences interfered with HFE complex assembly; the complex was also insensitive to the addition of anti-TFIID antibodies and failed to interact with purified recombinant TBP protein (data not shown). Thus, the HFE complex does neither include TBP nor characterized initiator-binding proteins. The HFE sequence (5′-GGGTCAGGGGTCAGGG-3′) harbors a tandem repeat in several combinations, GGTCAGG, GGGTCA, or TCAGGG. To define the sequence requirement for protein binding, mutated HFE versions were used as competitors (shown in Fig. 2 A). M0 was mutated throughout HFE and used in transient expression experiments (Fig.1 C); M1 and M2 were, respectively, mutagenized in the distal (leftward) or proximal (rightward) repeat relative to TS-1; M3 carried mutations in the central region of the oligonucleotide which affected both repeats. The results in Fig. 2 B show that M3, although carrying only three base substitutions, like M1 and M2, was unable to compete for protein binding to wild-type HFE. In contrast, both M1 and M2, each of which retained one repeat, partly competed with HFE. These experiments indicate that the GGGTCAGGGGTCAGGG sequence represents the optimal binding site; the low efficiency of the competition by M1 and M2 shows that their affinity for HFE-binding factor(s) was not completely abolished yet was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type site. These observations suggest that the HFE complex may be stabilized by interactions among proteins binding to adjacent repeats. Indeed, preincubation of protein extracts with sodium deoxycholate, which disrupts weak protein-protein interactions, prevented the complex assembly (Fig. 2 B, lane 12); furthermore, deoxycholate addition to the DNA/protein binding reaction disrupted the assembled complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 13). The deoxycholate effect was specific because it did not affect the interaction of Sp1, which binds as a monomer, with its DNA target site (data not shown). The repeated structure and sequence of HFE are similar to those contained in gene promoters regulated by retinoic acid, known as retinoic acid response elements, that are composed of a direct repetition of the PuGGTCA motif and are recognized by members of two large families of transcription factors, RARs and RXRs. Searching transcription factor data bases with the HFE sequence depicted the highest degree of raw homology with the H2RII element in the major histocompatibility complex class I gene promoter (Fig. 3 A), a target of the RXRβ subtype of retinoid X receptors (20Hamada K. Gleason S.L. Levi B.-Z. Hirschfeld S. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8289-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Unlabeled H2RII interfered with the HFE complex assembly (Fig. 3 A,lanes 6–9) almost as effectively as the homologous competitor (Fig. 3, A, lanes 2–5, and C). Reciprocal experiments using labeled H2RII as the probe showed that homologous competitions were highly effective (Fig.3 A, lanes 10–14), while competition by unlabeled HFE required a 50-fold excess to achieve 50% inhibition and plateaued thereafter (Fig. 3, A, lanes 15–18, and B). The finding that H2RII was an effective competitor of HFE, while HFE only partially competed for factors binding to the H2RII probe, suggests that H2RII and HFE are bound by both common and specific partners. We next used a canonical RXR-binding oligonucleotide in which PuGGTCA repeats are separated by one-nucleotide spacer (DR-1 configuration), as in HFE; extensive characterization of DR-1 had shown it to be the preferred target sequence of RXR factors (21Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Heterologous competitions for factors between DR-1 and HFE were now complete (Fig. 3 D); thus, the binding properties of HFE are indistinguishable from those of the DR-1 oligonucleotide. Together, these results implicate RXR factors in binding to HFE. Since in previous work the strongest HFE in vitro footprints were detected using mouse liver extracts (8Somma M.P. Gambino I. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the study of HFE-binding factors was further pursued using such extracts. We found that the HFE complex with liver nuclear extracts had higher abundance, and lower electrophoretic mobility, than seen using NIH/3T3 extracts (Fig.4, compare lanes 1 and 7). Addition of an anti-RXR antibody recognizing all three RXR subtypes (α, β, and γ) to the HFE reaction with liver extracts supershifted the complex in a manner comparable to that seen with DR-1 (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5). An antibody recognizing all members (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, and γ2) of the RAR family did neither affect the HFE nor the DR-1 complex (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 6). When immunoassays were carried out using the same amount of NIH/3T3 nuclear extract, no clear supershift was detected with either HFE or DR-1 probes; however, the amount of assembled complex with both probes decreased with the addition of both anti-RXR (Fig. 4, lanes 8, 9, 13, and 14) and anti-RAR (Fig. 4, lanes 10, 11, 15, and 16) antibodies, suggesting that component(s) of both the RXR and RAR families interacted with HFE and DR-1 in NIH/3T3 cells. Thus, the differences in abundance, mobility, and antibody reactivity indicate that specific complexes are formed by both probes depending on the extract source. The results in Fig. 4 suggest that the RXR supershift depicted with liver extracts reflected the higher abundance of these factors in liver, compared with NIH/3T3, nuclei. To further investigate that possibility, liver extracts were fractionated through sequential phosphocellulose and DEAE 52 chromatography (Fig.5 A). All RXR subtypes (α, β, and γ) recognized by the anti-RXR antibody were eluted with, and were abundantly expressed in, fractions that were positive for HFE binding (compare Fig. 5, B and C, upper panel). In NIH/3T3 extracts, only one subtype, whose electrophoretic mobility was compatible with that expected for RXRβ (22Nagata T. Kanno Y. Ozato K. Taketo M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was detected; the relative abundance of the reacted protein was significantly lower than that of the corresponding liver protein, and in cycling NIH/3T3 cells was less abundant than in growth-arres"
https://openalex.org/W1985955799,"In hind limb muscles, the aldolase A muscle-specific promoter is specifically expressed in glycolytic fast-twitch fibers. Here, we show that in addition, it is expressed at higher levels in trunk and limb muscles than in neck and head muscles independent of their fiber-type content. We have identified by analysis of transgenic mice a DNA element that is required for this differential expression and, to a lesser extent, for fiber-type specificity. We show that members of the nuclear receptor superfamily bind this element in skeletal muscle nuclear extracts. Interestingly, in gel mobility shift assays, different complexes were formed with this sequence in tongue nuclear extracts compared with limb or trunk muscle nuclear extracts. Therefore, binding of distinct nuclear receptors to a single regulatory sequence appears to be associated with the location-dependent expression of the aldolase A muscle-specific promoter.

Therefore, binding of distinct nuclear receptors to a single regulatory sequence appears to be associated with the location-dependent expression of the aldolase A muscle-specific promoter. One of the main characteristics of skeletal muscles is their diversity. In the adult, this diversity appears with regard to shape, anatomical position, mechanical function, energy requirement, and nerve stimulation of each individual muscle. At the cellular level, it is revealed by the existence of different types of myofibers characterized by expression of specific isoforms of structural proteins and metabolic enzymes (1Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The usual classification divides muscle fibers in four major types based on MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin heavy chain; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; LgD, longissimus dorsi; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay(s). isoform expression: type I (slow, oxidative), type IIA (fast, oxidative), type IIX (fast, oxidative and glycolytic), and type IIB (fast, glycolytic). Several genes show a fiber type-specific pattern of expression, and for some of them, their regulatory sequences have been characterized, including troponin I fast (3Hallauer P.L. Bradshaw H.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5332-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some other genes are active in a subset of muscles, with no obvious link with a particular fiber type (e.g. ryanodine receptor-3 in diaphragm (13Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or engrailed-2 in jaw muscles (14Hatta K. Schilling T.F. BreMiller R.A. Kimmel C.B. Science. 1990; 250: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). This kind of muscle diversity has also been revealed by random integration of transgenes into “special” loci (15Patapoutian A. Miner J.H. Lyons G.E. Wold B. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 61-69PubMed Google Scholar) or by deletion analysis of muscle regulatory sequences (16Spitz F. Salminen M. Demignon J. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Maire P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Shield M.A. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 171: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the most studied example being the rostro-caudal gradient of expression displayed by MLC1ftransgenes (8Rao M.V. Donoghue M.J. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Donoghue M.J. Merlie J.P. Rosenthal N. Sanes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5847-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that besides fiber-type specificity, an additional level of regulation may overlap and modulate fiber-specific gene expression. Multiple factors are thought to contribute to muscle diversity like innervation, hormonal influence, and participation of distinct myoblast lineages (20Donoghue M.J. Sanes J.R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 396-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). But so far, the molecular basis of this diversity is still poorly documented. In particular, the transcription factors that activate genes in particular fibers and/or muscles are not known. Determination of the sequences involved in the regulation of genes expressed in a restricted subset of muscles and/or in a specific type of muscle fiber is the first step toward the characterization of these factors. We have previously shown in a transgenic mouse model that the muscle-specific promoter of the human aldolase A gene (pM) is specifically expressed in hind limb muscles composed of type IIB fibers (11Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.-P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression results from the contribution of at least two distinct sets of control elements, one of which consists of an NF-1-binding site (16Spitz F. Salminen M. Demignon J. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Maire P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Salminen M. Lopez S. Maire P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this element does not activate transcription equally in all fast-twitch muscles, revealing that pM is differentially regulated in different subtypes of fast-twitch muscles. While our first observations were limited to hind limb muscles, this result prompted us to investigate the activity of pM in additional muscles, from head, neck, trunk, hind limb, and fore limb. We show here that a pM310CAT construct containing a 355-base pair pM promoter linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene is active in glycolytic fast-twitch limb and trunk muscles of adult transgenic mice. Surprisingly, in head and neck muscles, activity is at least 100-fold lower, even in muscles composed of type IIB fibers. We identify a sequence, called M1 in previous reports, whose mutation abolished the differential expression of pM in head/neck and trunk/limb muscles. This sequence shows similarity to consensus binding sites for steroid-related nuclear receptors. Indeed, we show that RXR, RAR, and ARP1 nuclear receptors are part of the complexes formed by nuclear proteins with M1. Interestingly, the composition and relative amount of these complexes are different in head and body muscles, suggesting that nuclear receptors are involved in the muscle location-dependent regulation of a fast-twitch muscle-specific promoter. The creation of transgenic mice to obtain constructs pM310CAT, mM1, M-tkCAT, ΔAT-tkCAT, and MΔB-tkCAT has been described elsewhere (11Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.-P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A.

For chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, various tissues were dissected from adult (at least 7-week-old) F1 transgenic animals, except for the few founders analyzed, for which transgene presence in each tissue was verified by Southern blotting.

We investigated pM310CAT expression in a large number of muscles: from limbs (vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius, psoas major, soleus, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, and triceps brachii), trunk (sternomastoideus, longissimus dorsi, intercostals muscles, and diaphragm), and neck and head muscles (digastricus, mylohyoideus, masseter, and tongue) (Fig.1). For the two independent lines studied, a high chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was detected in all trunk and limb muscles, with the exception of muscles devoid of type IIB fibers, soleus (types I and IIA) and diaphragm (types IIA and IIX) (7Donoghue M.J. Alvarez J.D. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Zardini D.M. Parry D.J. Muscle & Nerve. 1994; 17: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in which activity was at least 100-fold lower. This result reflects the specific expression of pM in type IIB glycolytic fast-twitch fibers. 2J.-C. Sabourin, unpublished observations. Surprisingly, in all head and neck (suprahyoid) muscles tested, activity was on the average 100-fold lower (1000-fold for the tongue) than in trunk and limb muscles. Since this difference may arise from a lack of type IIB fibers in these muscles, we determined their fiber-type composition and compared the ratio between pM activity and percentage of type IIB fibers. As shown in TableI, this ratio was close to 100 (arbitrary units) in three muscles of the limb and trunk, whereas it dropped to 2.3 and 1.4 in the masseter and digastricus, respectively, and even to <0.1 in the tongue. Therefore, in head and neck muscles, the level of activity of pM is not determined by the proportion of type IIB fibers; the weak activity of pM reflects an intrinsic difference between these muscles and those from limb and trunk, and not a different composition of fiber type (as judged by MHC expression). Below, this difference is referred to as “muscle location-dependent expression.”Table IFiber composition and pM transgene activity in various mice musclesMuscleFiber type1-aFiber type was determined by immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of mouse muscles with antibodies to specific type of MHCs.pM activity1-bValues are the means of pM310CAT transgenic line 20 and 98 CAT activities (expressed in cpm/μg of protein/min of reaction).pM/% IIBIIIAIIXIIB%G1-cG, gastrocnemius; TA, tibialis anterior; T8, intercostal muscle 8; Dig, digastricus; MS, masseter superficial; Tg, tongue.3.717.735.043.5425098TA1-dData for fiber type are from Ref. 14.1.013.319.367.5592088T81-dData for fiber type are from Ref. 14.5.133.420.142.5363085Dig026502433.61.4MS0633611432.3Tg0442543.30.061-a Fiber type was determined by immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of mouse muscles with antibodies to specific type of MHCs.1-b Values are the means of pM310CAT transgenic line 20 and 98 CAT activities (expressed in cpm/μg of protein/min of reaction).1-c G, gastrocnemius; TA, tibialis anterior; T8, intercostal muscle 8; Dig, digastricus; MS, masseter superficial; Tg, tongue.1-d Data for fiber type are from Ref. 14Hatta K.

Open table in a new tab We then examined whether the absence of expression in head/neck muscles for the pM310CAT transgenes reflects the expression of the endogenous mouse aldolase A muscle-specific promoter. A Northern blot with total RNAs from different types of muscles was hybridized with a probe specific for mouse aldolase A exon M (Fig.2); hybridization with the ribosomal probe R45 was used as a control for mRNA quantity and quality. The endogenous M transcripts were highly expressed in fast-twitch limb and back muscles, weakly in the masseter, and at a very weak level in the type IIB-rich tongue muscle, as in muscles devoid of type IIB fibers (soleus and diaphragm). No expression was detected in heart. Therefore, the pattern of expression of pM310CAT coincides with endogenous pM promoter activity. In addition to a type IIB-specific expression in trunk and limb muscles, these promoters display a kind of “location-dependent” regulation since rostral muscles (neck and head) express pM very weakly despite their high proportion of type IIB fibers. To identify the sequence(s) involved in the preferential activity of pM in trunk/limb muscles, we studied the expression pattern of transgenes harboring distinct segments of the pM regulatory region (Fig.3 A). We compared the activity of several transgenes in tongue and longissimus dorsi muscles and in several lines for each transgene (Fig. 3). On average, a 140-fold ratio of the activity in tongue and LgD muscles was observed for the construct M-tkCAT, compared with the 1000-fold ratio in pM310CAT transgenes; pM location-dependent expression is conserved without the proximal sequences (TATA box and exon M). The ratio of the activity in tongue and LgD muscles was diminished and probably reflects the fact that, usually, M-tkCAT transgenes were less active in trunk/limb muscles than pM310CAT; the M enhancer is probably more potent when linked to its innate minimal promoter. For the ΔAT-tkCAT transgenes, it should be first noticed that there was no detectable activity in muscles tested in four out of the nine transgenic lines studied. Nevertheless, in all lines with the “active” transgenes, we still observed a 220-fold ratio on average between tongue and LgD muscles. Thus, the sequences sufficient for muscle location-dependent expression are localized between base pairs −160 and −35. Further 5′-deletions of the pM regulatory sequences resulted in total loss of transgene activity (16Spitz F. Salminen M. Demignon J. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Maire P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All four transgenic MΔE-tkCAT lines (sequences from base pair −235 up to the M1 site) were active, and there was an average 70-fold differential expression between tongue and LgD muscles. This result indicates that the E box and the SP1-binding site are also dispensable for a correct pattern of expression. Thus, the sequences needed for a graded expression between head and more caudal muscles were mainly localized in the region shared by the ΔAT and MΔE fragments: namely, the MEF3-, MEF2/NF-1-, and M1-binding sites. The M1 sequence has been shown to be important for pM expression since its mutation resulted in a strong diminution of pM activity in myotubes in primary cell culture and in hind limb muscles of transgenic mice (21Salminen M. Lopez S. Maire P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Salminen M. Spitz F. Fiszman M.Y. Demignon J. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Maire P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We tested whether the muscle location-dependent expression is conserved in constructs with either a mutated M1 site (mM1) or a deletion of this site (MΔB-tkCAT) (Fig. 3). Mutation of the M1-binding site resulted in the loss of the differential activity between tongue and trunk muscles (an average of 0.4-fold). With the thymidine kinase promoter, deletion of M1 from the MΔE fragment resulted in complete absence of expression for three out of the four transgenic lines obtained (MΔB-tkCAT), indicating that in this context, M1 is critical for promoter activity. In addition, in the only line with an expressed transgene (MΔB-tk-67), the LgD/tongue activity ratio was only ∼4. Comparison of the DNA constructs with an intact M1 sequence to those with a mutation or deletion of this site revealed that M1 is required for a 20-fold (at least) difference in transgene activity in tongue and LgD muscles (p < 0.001, with χ2 test; similar results were obtained with masseter instead of tongue or vastus lateralis instead of LgD). From the data presented in Table II, it appeared that mutation of M1 caused a drop in activity in all fast-twitch muscles studied down to the level of pM310CAT transgenes in the tongue. This loss of activity is particularly dramatic in limb and trunk muscles (from 1200 to 8000-fold), but is also observed (only 70-fold) in masseter, which was the highest expressing head muscle studied. Taken together, these results suggest that M1 behaves like a muscle location-dependent cis-activator; M1 is essential for a high level of expression of pM in fast-twitch trunk and limb muscles, but it is dispensable in the tongue. Interestingly, this sequence is conserved in the human, rat, and mouse promoters (see Fig.5 A) (29Stauffer J.K. Colbert M.C. Ciejek-Baez E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11773-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IITransgene activity in some head, trunk, and limb musclesTransgenic linesTransgene CAT activityTg2-aTg, tongue; MS, masseter superficial; Tri, triceps brachii; G, gastrocnemius; Sol, soleus; D, diaphragm; ND, not determined.MSLgDTriGSolDcpm/μg/minpM310CAT-201.812868804070595023.221pM310CAT-984.815731903070256017.17.3mM1–413.16.16.670.540.120.035.85mM1–136.91.693.292.331.380.010.54mM1–160.81.30.10.850.150.020.4mM1–200.070.77100.80.660.010.14mM1–480.250.370.560.180.30.080.13MΔB-tkCAT-672.872.7410.92.196.80.60.34M-tkCAT-80.41.281121311731.14.7M-tkCAT-860.6ND840ND8706.342-a Tg, tongue; MS, masseter superficial; Tri, triceps brachii; G, gastrocnemius; Sol, soleus; D, diaphragm; ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The mutation of M1 also reduces the fiber specificity of pM transgenes. Expression in diaphragm (composed of type IIX and IIA fibers) was far less affected (only 50-fold) by M1 mutation than that in type IIB fiber-containing limb and trunk muscles (Table II). Thus, the mutation or deletion of M1 resulted in a loss of the differential activity between type IIB fiber-rich trunk and limb muscles and diaphragm (Fig.4). However, fast-twitch fiber specificity is conserved since mM1 transgenes were still expressed at a higher level in gastrocnemius muscles than in slow-twitch soleus muscles (devoid of type IIB fibers and with rare IIX fibers) (Fig. 4and Table II). It is unclear whether the ratio of the activity in fast gastrocnemius and slow soleus muscles was significantly reduced or not since there is a great variation among the different mM1 lines; nevertheless, in three lines out of five (four out of six if MΔB-tkCAT-67 was included), this ratio dropped to <10-fold, whereas for pM310CAT and M-tkCAT transgenes, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was at least 130-fold higher (average of 175-fold) in gastrocnemius than in soleus muscles, suggesting a potential involvement of M1 in fast-twitch specificity. Transgenic studies have shown that M1 is required for the muscle location-dependent activity of pM310CAT transgenes. A similar sequence is found in the same position (relative to the transcription start site) in the mouse pM promoter, which has the same pattern of expression (Fig. 2). Comparison of M1 sequences in human, mouse, and rat aldolase A genes revealed a conserved motif (a/gGGt/gCA) directly repeated with a 1-nucleotide-long spacer (DR1) (Fig.5 A); this sequence looks like a potential binding site for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (30Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar). When GMSA were performed with skeletal muscle nuclear extracts (from back muscles), two main complexes were formed specifically with M1 (Fig. 5, B and C); the formation of these two complexes (named A and B) was competed by the addition of an excess of an M1-binding site, but not by an oligonucleotide corresponding to the mutation of the M1 site introduced in transgenic mice. Complex A was more abundant in skeletal muscle nuclear extracts than in liver or spleen nuclear extracts (Fig.5 B). As an excess of a consensus DR1-binding site for nuclear receptors prevented the formation of both complexes A and B (Fig. 5 C), we assumed that the main binding activity on M1 is due to nuclear receptor complexes. Other complexes were formed with M1 (marked by asterisks), but they were poorly competed by an excess of unlabeled M1 probe and thus corresponded to nonspecific binding to M1; the upper band (marked by a diamond), whose formation was only moderately competed by an excess of the M1 oligonucleotide, probably corresponds to an SP1-like protein since it was very efficiently competed by an excess of the SP1 consensus site (data not shown). Many nuclear receptors are able to bind to DR1 sequences, including the retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR, peroxisome-activated receptors, and orphan nuclear receptors like COUP-TF/ARP1 and TR2/TR4 (30Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar). As the M1 site mediated a muscle location-dependent activity, we investigated the nature of the complexes bound to this sequence with nuclear extracts from muscles of diverse origins: tongue (head muscle) and longissimus dorsi, diaphragm, and soleus. For normalization of the nuclear extracts, binding assays were performed with an upstream stimulatory factor-binding site; in each case, upstream stimulatory factor binding activity was detected in similar amounts (Fig.6 A). For the M1 probe, body muscle nuclear extracts (from trunk or limb, fast or slow twitch) displayed the same pattern as longissimus dorsi nuclear extracts (Fig.6 B and data not shown for gastrocnemius and vastus lateralis); complexes A and B were formed at least in equal amount, with usually more of complex A than complex B (to an extent that depended on the body muscle considered). With tongue nuclear extracts, the complexes formed were different. First, complex A was only weakly detected (Figs. 6 B and7 A); in addition, no complex B was detected, whereas a third complex C appeared, migrating slightly slower than complex B observed with LgD nuclear extracts (Fig.7 A). Complexes B and C were better separated when GMSA was performed with a 6% acrylamide gel (Fig. 7 A) compared with a 5% acrylamide gel (Fig. 6 B); however, under this condition, complex A could not be easily distinguished from the additional SP1-like binding activity. In the following experiments, GMSA was performed with either 5 or 6% acrylamide gels, depending on which complex was considered.Figure 7Presence of RAR, RXR, and ARP1 nuclear receptors in the complexes formed with M1. M1-bound complexes formed with nuclear extracts from tongue (Tg), LgD, diaphragm (D), and soleus (Sol) were separated on 6% (A) and 5% (B) acrylamide gels. M1-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts of different muscles in the presence of anti-RAR antibodies (A), anti-RXR antibodies (B, lanes 1–4), or anti-COUP-TF antibodies (B, lanes 9–12). The same complexes were observed with two independent nuclear extracts, and quantification of the relative amount of supershifted complex B in LgD muscles was performed in several separate GMSA with a Shimadzu densitomer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked if known nuclear receptors participated in complexes A, B, and C by using specific antibodies. The addition of an anti-RAR antibody prevented the formation of complex C with tongue nuclear extracts, but had no effect on complex B formation in body muscles (Fig. 7 A) or on complex A. The addition of an antibody directed against RXR proteins entirely supershifted this complex C in the tongue, but only partly (∼40% according to quantification performed with a Shimadzu densitometer) supershifted complex B in LgD muscles (Fig. 7 B).

https://openalex.org/W2006539754,"Abstract The leu-500 promoter is inactivated by a mutation in the −10 region but can be activated in topA Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains. We have found that the tetA gene plays a vital role in thetopA-dependent activation of a plasmid-borneleu-500 promoter. In previous studies, theleu-500 promoter and tetA gene have been arranged divergently. In this study we have reversed the polarity of the tetA gene, thus locating the leu-500promoter at the 3′ end of tetA. Despite being formally located in the downstream region of tetA, theleu-500 promoter is equally well activated in atopA strain in this environment, even though it is 1.6 kilobase pairs away from the promoter of the reversed tetAgene. Activation of the leu-500 promoter depends on transcription and translation of tetA but is largely insensitive to the function of other transcription units on the plasmid. These results require a change in viewpoint of the role oftetA, from local to global supercoiling. We conclude that transcription of the tetA gene is the main generator of transcription-induced supercoiling that activates theleu-500 promoter. Unbalanced relaxation of this supercoiling leads to a net increase in the negative linking difference of the plasmid globally, and there is a linear correlation between the change in global plasmid topology and the activation of theleu-500 promoter. Thus the leu-500 promoter appears to respond to the negative supercoiling of the plasmid overall."
https://openalex.org/W2329688263,"We have constructed a panel of substitution mutants which affect one or more of the putative cdk target sites of the RB protein. We have examined the activity of these mutants relative to wild-type RB by both a transcriptional repression assay and by measuring growth suppression in vitro. We find that some phosphorylation site mutants of pRB can repress E2 transcription more strongly than wild-type RB. These mutants are partially resistant to phosphorylation by cdks and can arrest tumor cells in G1 in vitro. Our results indicate a functional correlation between the ability to repress E2F-dependent transcription and the ability to suppress tumor cell growth in vitro. In addition, we describe two classes of RB mutants: N-terminal truncated p56RB and a novel mutant of RB containing multiple substitutions near its nuclear localization signal. Both classes of RB mutants have greater activity than the wild-type protein. Because RB is a key regulator of cell cycle progression, expression of a more potent, phosphorylation resistant RB may have utility in both RB(-/-) and RB(+/+) tumors as well as in hyperproliferative disorders."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, causes severe infections in compromised and immunosuppressed hosts. The bacterium produces various toxic substances that contribute to the virulence of this opportunistic pathogen (1Lory S. Tai P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Some strains ofP. aeruginosa produce a cytolytic toxin, cytotoxin (CTX), which is cytotoxic to a wide range of eukaryotic cells (3Lutz F. Seeger W. Weiner R. Scharmann W.

The gene encoding the toxin (ctx) is carried by bacteriophages, and lysogenization of the phages converts CTX non-producing P. aeruginosa strains to CTX producers (5Hayashi T. Baba T. Matsumoto H.

Although morphological identification has yet to be made, we recently found that CTX forms an oligomer on the target membrane (10Ohnishi M. Hayashi T. Tomita T.

This formation correlated with the cytolytic activity; thus, CTX may form a pore by oligomerization on the membrane, as is the case for several cytolytic channel-forming toxins (11Braun V.

CTX produced by P. aeruginosa is inactive and requires proteolytic action for activation.

Kamio Y. Hishinuma F. Usami Y. Titani K. Terawaki Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cleavage occurs at the carboxyl side of Arg266 (13Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Hishinuma F. Usami Y. Titani K. Terawaki Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among the channel-forming toxins, aerolysin from Aeromonas spp. (12Parker M.W. van der Goot F. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the alpha toxin of Clostridium septicum (14Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.-L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Ballard J. Crabtree J. Roe B.A. Twenten R.K. Infect. Immunol. 1995; 63: 340-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also require proteolytic cleavages at the C-terminal regions for conversion from inactive precursors to active forms. In the case of proaerolysin, the C-terminal region was seen to mask hydrophobic patches of the toxin molecule and to inhibit oligomerization of the toxin on the membrane (12Parker M.W. van der Goot F. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Parker M. Buckley J.T. Postma J. Tucker A. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Concerning proCTX, nothing is known of the function of the C-terminal sequence or what changes occur on the CTX molecule by the C-terminal cleavage. Using a method developed for the purification of the recombinant CTX, we have now purified proCTX for the first time. Purified proCTX bound to the erythrocyte membrane but did not form the oligomer on the membrane. In circular dichroic experiments, significant changes in the secondary structure were not observed between the active CTX and proCTX. However, a striking difference was found in the oligomeric states of the proteins. We describe here a novel activation mechanism of the pore-forming toxin, involving a dimer-to-monomer conversion. Trypsin (Type XIII:l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated), bovine serum albumin, and apomyoglobin were from Sigma. The molecular size standards for SDS-PAGE were obtained from Bio-Rad and New England Biolabs. All columns used for protein purification were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech. A codon for threonine at position 267 of thectx gene was replaced with a premature stop codon by changing ACA to TAA. The mutagenesis was performed by the gapped duplex DNA method of Kramer and Frits (17Kramer W. Frits H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using a Mutan-G system (Takara). The mutagenized ctx gene was inserted into a broad host range expression plasmid, pMMB22 (18Bagdasarian M.M. Amann E. Lurz R. Buckert B. Bagdasarian M. Gene. 1983; 26: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), to construct pMMB(ΔC20), using the same strategy as described for pMMB(CTX) for the overproduction of procytotoxin (13Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Hishinuma F. Usami Y. Titani K. Terawaki Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). E. coli SM32 was transformed with pMMB(ΔC20) or pMMB(CTX) and grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When cell cultures reached anA 600 of 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 4 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with saline, and stored at −80 °C. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C, except that fast protein liquid chromatography procedures (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were carried out at room temperature. For purification of ΔC20, the cells derived from a 10-liter culture were suspended in 400 ml of Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and disrupted by ten 10-s bursts of sonication with 50 s interval between each burst at 4 °C, using a tip sonicator (Branson). The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Because overexpressed ΔC20 was aggregated in E. coli cells, more than 95% of ΔC20 was recovered in the pellet fraction. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of Buffer A containing 2 m urea while stirring for 2 h. After removing unsolubilized materials by centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min), the soluble fraction was dialyzed four times against a 20-fold volume of Buffer B (Buffer A with 0.2 m NaCl). The dialyzate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a YM10 membrane (Amicon). The concentrated preparation was applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated with Buffer B by fast protein liquid chromatography. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions with toxic activity were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C (Buffer A containing 2 m NaCl). The dialyzate was applied to a phenyl-Superose HR 10/10 column equilibrated with Buffer C. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (2.0–0 m) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The procedure used for purification of proCTX was the same as that used for ΔC20 up to the step of hydrophobic chromatography, except for two modifications: proCTX was solubilized with 3 m urea, and Buffer A containing 1 m NaCl was used for the gel filtration. After hydrophobic chromatography, fractions containing proCTX were subjected to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1.0m) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. During the purification, proCTX was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-CTX serum (4Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Terawaki Y. Microb. Pathogen. 1989; 6: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored at −20 °C in Buffer A containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. Cytotoxic activities of the toxins were determined by means of a hemolytic activity assay (10Ohnishi M. Hayashi T. Tomita T. Terawaki Y FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Oligomer formation of toxins on the rat erythrocyte membrane was detected by immunoblotting as described previously (10Ohnishi M. Hayashi T. Tomita T. Terawaki Y FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Activation of proCTX was done by incubation with trypsin at 37 °C for 60 min at 1:20 trypsin per proCTX (w/w) ratio. The reaction was quenched by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 1 mm). Rabbit anti-ΔC20 serum was prepared as described (4Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Terawaki Y. Microb. Pathogen. 1989; 6: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the specific detection for proCTX, a 9-mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of proCTX (LETRVRSAE) with a cysteine residue at the N terminus was synthesized by the Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) strategy using a peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Model 431A). The peptide (0.1 mg) was cross-linked to 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin withm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydrosuccinimide ester and used to immunize a rabbit. The antibody specific to the C terminus of proCTX was purified by affinity chromatography using 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium toluene-4-sulfonate-activated cellulofine (Seikagaku) coupled with the C-terminal peptide. The antibody obtained reacted to proCTX and not to ΔC20. The affinity purified antibody was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) in coupling buffer (0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.0). Toxins (0.5 μg) were incubated with 10 μl of the antibody-coupled gel (1.1 μg of IgG/μl gel) in 40 μl of binding buffer (coupling buffer with 0.1m NaCl) for 1 h at 37 °C. After unbound materials were separated by brief centrifugation, pellets were washed five times with the binding buffer (200 μl). Bound materials were eluted with SDS loading buffer, and the bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunostaining, rabbit anti-ΔC20 serum and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody specific to the Fc region (Promega) were used. CD spectra of toxins were measured at 25 °C in a Jasco J-600 spectrometer with a quartz cell of 0.2 mm path length. The protein concentration was 150 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Contents were calculated using the reference described by Yang et al.(19Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Estimates of the secondary structure were made using a SSE-338 program (Jasco). Fluorescence measurements were made using a Hitachi fluorometer F3000 with a quartz cuvette. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the range of emission wavelength was from 300 to 400 nm. The protein concentration was adjusted to 0.6 μm in Buffer B. Samples for spectrometry were prepared according to Nakanishi et al. (20Nakanishi T. Okamoto N. Tanaka K. Shimizu A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 23: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 33 pmol of toxins in 10 μl of Buffer A was incubated with an equal volume of anti ΔC20 serum for 3 h at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed once with 0.6 ml of 0.9% NaCl and twice with 0.6 ml distilled water and lyophilized. Pellets were dissolved in 3.3 μl of distilled water and mixed with an equal volume of saturated sinapinic acid matrix solution in 33% (v/v) acetonitrile/distilled water. Mass measurements were made on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager ELITE XL, PerSeptive Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin and apomyoglobin were used as standards. Analytical gel filtration was performed using a Superose TM12 HR 16/60 column equilibrated with Buffer B. Two hundred μl of toxin solution (150 μg/ml) was applied to the column and then eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Molecular weight standards used were ovotransferrin (76,000–78,000), ovalbumin (45,000), carbonic anhydrase (30,000), and myoglobin (17,200). Purified proteins (50 μg/ml in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5) were incubated with 2.5 mm or10 mm dimethyl suberimidate for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction was quenched by incubation with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (final concentration, 100 mm), and then SDS loading buffer was added. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with an optical scanning detector. Proteins in Buffer B at a concentration of 150 μg/ml were analyzed. Data were collected in a Beckman An-60Ti rotor with double sector charcoal-filled Epon cells and quartz windows. A sedimentation velocity run was carried out at 50,000 rpm at 25 °C. Boundaries were recorded at 280 nm. Apparent sedimentation coefficients were standardized to water at 20 °C. For sedimentation equilibrium experiment, samples were brought to equilibrium at 4 °C for 20 h at 24,000 rpm. Partial specific volumes for proCTX and ΔC20 were calculated for amino acids composition, using data for specific volumes of amino acids as described by Edsall (21Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Rheinhold, New York1943: 155-176Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified proteins were determined by Edman degradation using an automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 476A). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Immunoblotting was done as described previously (13Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Hishinuma F. Usami Y. Titani K. Terawaki Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assessed according to Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for unpurified materials and by absorbance at 280 nm for purified preparations. Absorption coefficients of ΔC20 and proCTX (2.24 and 2.32, respectively) were determined from amino acid compositions of the proteins. We earlier reported a method for purification of an active form of CTX from the crude extract of P. aeruginosa (4Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Terawaki Y. Microb. Pathogen. 1989; 6: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The procedure involved five steps, including trypsin treatment for activation of proCTX in the crude extract. Purification procedures described by other researchers were complicated and included an activation step (24Scharmann W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 93: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Lutz F. Toxicon. 1979; 17: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because these methods were not applicable to the purification of CTX or its mutants expressed in E. coli, we tried to design a simple purification method for recombinant CTX. For direct expression of an active form of CTX (ΔC20), we first introduced a premature stop codon at position of Thr267 in the ctx gene by site-directed mutagenesis. The C terminus of ΔC20 is Arg266, the same as the active toxin derived from trypsin treatment (13Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Hishinuma F. Usami Y. Titani K. Terawaki Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although ΔC20 was overproduced in E. coli SM32, a Lon protease-deficient strain, most of the protein produced was insoluble. We attempted to solubilize the aggregated toxin using different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride or urea (2, 3, 4, and 6 m). The toxin solubilized by guanidine hydrochloride at each concentration was reaggregated after dialysis against Buffer B. Here, a significant portion of the toxin solubilized by 2 m urea remained soluble after dialysis and the subsequent centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Higher concentrations of urea reduced the amounts of soluble toxin obtained. The toxin solubilized by 2 m urea was purified using HiLoad Superdex pg200 and phenyl-Superose columns. From 10 liters of cultured cells, 8.5 mg of ΔC20 was obtained (Fig.1 A). The elution profiles of ΔC20 on both columns were the same as those of PACTX. Purified ΔC20 showed a wide range of cytotoxicity with specific activity similar to that of PACTX. As shown for PACTX (10Ohnishi M. Hayashi T. Tomita T. Terawaki Y FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), ΔC20 formed an oligomer of 145 kDa on the rat erythrocyte membrane in a manner correlating with the hemolytic activity (Figs. 2 and3). The N-terminal sequence of the purified ΔC20 was identical to the sequence deduced from thectx gene (MNDID) and a mass of ΔC20 assessed by mass spectrometry was 29,341 ± 2 Da, in agreement with a calculated value of 29,367.1 Da. In addition, ΔC20 showed a marked resistance to various proteases, including trypsin, as observed for PACTX (data not shown). Thus, the purified ΔC20 had the same biological and physicochemical properties as PACTX and degradation on the toxin molecules was negligible during the purification process.Figure 2Hemolytic activities of ΔC20 and proCTX with or without trypsin treatment. Rat erythrocytes were incubated with serially diluted toxins at 37 °C for 60 min in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl. After centrifugation, hemolysis was determined by measuring hemoglobin release spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. Osmotic lysis of erythrocytes in distilled water was taken as 100% hemolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Oligomer formation on target membranes of proCTX, trypsin-treated proCTX (TTproCTX), and ΔC20.Toxins (lanes 1, 0.06; lanes 2, 0.13; lanes 3, 0.25 μm) were incubated with rat erythrocytes as for Fig. 2. Toxin-bound membranes were solubilized with SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by immunostaining with anti-ΔC20 antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We applied the method developed here to purify proCTX because this approach needed no activation process. ProCTX produced in E. coli was also insoluble and could be solubilized with urea. The optimal concentration of urea for solubilization of proCTX was 3 m. Solubilized proCTX was purified to apparent homogeneity by the procedure used for the purification of ΔC20 (Fig. 1 B), although the extra step of anion exchange chromatography was necessary. From 10 liters of culture, 5.5 mg of proCTX was obtained. Purified proCTX migrated slightly more slowly than ΔC20 on a SDS-PAGE gel, and after activation by trypsin treatment, it migrated at the same position as ΔC20 (data not shown). The N-terminal sequence was the same as that of ΔC20. The molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry was 31,644 ± 2 Da, close to 31,680.6 Da, a value calculated from the amino acid sequence (13Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Hishinuma F. Usami Y. Titani K. Terawaki Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the purified protein consisted of the full length of the polypeptide encoded by the ctx gene. After trypsin treatment, the purified proCTX exhibited hemolytic activity on rat erythrocytes comparable to the activity of PACTX, as well as that of ΔC20 (Fig. 2). Without activation, proCTX had no hemolytic activity (up to 4 μm). When erythrocytes incubated with proCTX were analyzed by immunoblotting, proCTX at the concentration of 0.06 μm bound to the erythrocytes. Binding of proCTX was in a dose-dependent manner. ProCTX, however, did not form the oligomer of 145 kDa on the erythrocyte membrane (Fig. 3). Formation of the oligomer by proCTX was not detected even at the higher concentration (up to 4 μm; data not shown). Trypsin-treated proCTX formed the oligomer as seen for ΔC20. These data suggested that the inactive nature of proCTX was due to the lack of potential to form a 145 kDa oligomer on the target membrane. In Fig. 3, in addition to the 145-kDa band of the oligomer, 60-kDa bands were seen for the active toxins. This was also the case for proCTX, albeit in a reduced amount. It appears that CTX forms a dimer on the erythrocyte membrane, even though the dimeric form of active CTX is not seen in solution, as described below. The oligomeric state of CTX may change once CTX encounters the hydrophobic environment of the membrane and the dimer could be an intermediate in the formation of the 145-kDa oligomer. However, because a 60-kDa band was also detected by immunoblotting for the heat-inactivated toxin and the toxin not incubated with cells (10Ohnishi M. Hayashi T. Tomita T. Terawaki Y FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that it was formed after solubilization with SDS. Proteolytic cleavage in the C terminus is required for activation of proCTX. It remained to be determined whether the proteolytic cleavage removes the C-terminal peptide from the toxin molecule or simply introduces a nick in the molecule. Using an antibody specific to the C-terminal peptide immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 beads, we estimated the fate of the C-terminal peptide generated by trypsin treatment. As shown in Fig.4 A, ΔC20 and the trypsin-treated proCTX were not adsorbed by the immobilized antibody and recovered in the supernatants, whereas only a small portion of proCTX remained in the supernatant fraction. Although toxins in the pellet fractions were not clearly visible by Coomassie Blue staining because of the presence of broad bands of the IgG light chain co-migrating with toxins, immunostaining revealed that proCTX was recovered in the pellet fraction, whereas trypsin-treated proCTX, as well as ΔC20, was not (Fig. 4 B). These observations suggested that the C-terminal peptide left the toxin molecule once it was generated by proteolytic cleavage. This was further support for the notion that ΔC20 could serve as a model molecule for the activated toxin. As a first step to elucidate molecular events involved in the activation process, we wanted to know whether activation of proCTX would alter the structure. For this purpose, we carried out CD spectroscopic analysis of proCTX and ΔC20. The far-UV CD spectra of both proteins, presented in Fig. 5, were similar. ProCTX was estimated to contain 14.3% α-helices, 52.7% β-sheet, 14.2% β-turn, and 18.8% random structure, and ΔC20 contained 12.5% α-helices, 54.4% β-sheet, 10.3% β-turn, and 22.9% random structure. These findings indicated that the secondary structure of proCTX was not affected by proteolytic removal of the C-terminal 20 amino acid residues and that CTX was a β-sheet predominant protein. In some cases, intrinsic fluorescence is sensitive for microenvironment transition around tryptophan residues. Because there was no tryptophan residue in the C-terminal region on proCTX, we compared fluorescence spectra of the active toxin and proCTX. As shown in Fig. 6, the maximum of the fluorescence emission spectrum of proCTX was displayed at 337.5 nm, whereas a maximum emission wavelength of ΔC20 spectrum shifted to 342 nm and the intensity was decreased. The maximum wavelengths of both proteins were not affected by shifted salt concentration in the range of 0–1.0 m NaCl (data not shown). Trypsin-treated proCTX without fractionation of the C-terminal peptide also showed a red-shifted spectrum with a maximum wavelength the same as that of ΔC20 (Fig. 6). Although there was a small difference in intensity between ΔC20 and trypsin-treated proCTX, this was attributed to slightly different concentrations of the proteins. These data suggested that an environment around the tryptophan residue(s) became hydrophilic during the activation process of proCTX. The active CTX was suggested to exist as a monomer in the solution (4Hayashi T. Kamio Y. Terawaki Y. Microb. Pathogen. 1989; 6: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the oligomeric state of proCTX remained to be characterized. We first did analytical gel filtration experiments. ProCTX was eluted much earlier than active toxins ΔC20 and PACTX, and the molecular weights of proCTX and active toxins were estimated to be 52,000 and 24,000, respectively. Furthermore, the molecular weight of proCTX was reduced to 24,000 by trypsin treatment (data not shown). These findings suggested that proCTX existed as a homodimer in the solution and was converted to monomers by proteolytic activation. To confirm the results, chemical cross-linking experiments were done. As shown in Fig. 7, a protein band migrating at the position of the dimer was detected for proCTX following incubation with dimethyl suberimidate. On the contrary, the dimer band was observed for neither ΔC20 nor trypsin-treated proCTX. Finally, the exact oligomeric states of the toxins were determined in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (TableI). Sedimentation coefficient was 5.04 S for proCTX or 2.61 S for ΔC20. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation of the toxins showed molecular weights of 63,000 for the protoxin and 29,000 for the active toxin. Each value was in good agreement with a calculated molecular mass of the dimer of proCTX or the monomer of ΔC20.Table ISedimentation coefficients and molecular weights of proCTX and ΔC20S20, ω(S)Molecular weightCalculated molecular weight1-aData are from amino acid compositions.ProCTX5.0462,866 ± 62431680.6ΔC202.6129,472 ± 23629367.11-a Data are from amino acid compositions. Open table in a new tab To purify proCTX of P. aeruginosa, we used a new method, which is simple but includes a step of solubilizing the aggregated CTX by urea. This may raise the possibility that the purified proteins lost their native structures. However, the biological and physicochemical properties of the purified recombinant active CTX, ΔC20, were indistinguishable from those of an active toxin obtained from P. aeruginosa. Purified proCTX was also active after trypsin treatment. Thus, the protein refolded correctly during dialysis after being denatured by urea. When characterizing the purified proCTX, there were four major findings: (a) proCTX binds to the erythrocytes membrane but cannot form the oligomer on the membrane; (b) proteolytic action removes the C-terminal peptide from the toxin molecule; (c) activation of proCTX by the C-terminal cleavage does not induce change in the secondary structure; and (d) by proteolytic removal of the C-terminal peptide, the homodimer of proCTX is converted to monomers. One of the crucial steps in intoxication by CTX is oligomerization on the target membrane. The oligomer formed by CTX is most likely in a pentameric form (10Ohnishi M. Hayashi T. Tomita T. Terawaki Y FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From our findings, the activation process of proCTX is proposed to be as follows: proCTX existing in a dimeric form can bind to the membrane but is cytolytically inactive because it does not oligomerize into a pentamer. Once the C-terminal peptide is removed by proteolytic action, proCTX is converted into monomers, which form a pentamer on the membrane and thus are active in cytolytic events. This is in clear contrast with the activation process described for aerolysin, another pore-forming toxin that requires the C-terminal processing for activation. Aerolysin is also produced as an inactive precursor and exists as a homodimer. After activation by C-terminal cleavage, aerolysin exists as a homodimer (26van der Goot F.G. Ausio J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18272-18279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To form a heptameric oligomer on the membrane, conversion from dimer to monomer is thought to be essential for aerolysin as well. Although such an intermediate has not been detected, the conversion may be induced by a structural change upon active dimeric toxin after binding to the target membrane (12Parker M.W. van der Goot F. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The process of oligomerization on the membrane is one point that remains to be elucidated for pore-forming toxins. The C terminus of proCTX contributes to stable dimer formation but the mechanism remains obscure. A synthesized 21-mer peptide corresponding to the C terminus of proCTX did not form the dimer. 2M. Ohnishi, unpublished data. A direct interaction between the C-terminal regions may not be an event in dimer formation, or such an interaction may be stabilized by other interactions between the two proteins. Another possibility is that the C-terminal region, which contains a stretch of 10 hydrophobic amino acids followed by a sequence potentially forming a coiled-coil helix (residues 277–286), may involve an intermolecular interaction with other parts of the toxin molecule to stabilize the dimeric form of proCTX. It also remains unclear how the change in intrinsic fluorescence of the toxin occurred by activation. The results suggest that a tryptophan residue(s) buried in the proCTX molecule was exposed to the solvent after activation; it might have been covered directly by the C-terminal peptide and appeared on the surface of the protein by removal of the peptide. Alternatively, the residue(s) might exist on the intersurface of the dimeric proCTX and be exposed to the solvent by dissociation of the toxin molecule into monomers. Identification of the tryptophan residue(s) responsible for change in intrinsic fluorescence will be informative for understanding the structural features of proCTX. Another important finding on the structure of CTX is that the toxin consists predominantly of the β-sheet. Increasing numbers of bacterial toxins that form a pore by oligomerization have been reported to have structures rich in the β-sheet. This was documented most clearly for aerolysin (16Parker M. Buckley J.T. Postma J. Tucker A. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and staphylococcal α toxin (27Song L Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). The structure of oligomerized α toxin at a resolution of 1.9 Å revealed that a transmembrane domain of the channel is a 14-stranded β-barrel. The β-sheet predominant feature may be essential for oligomerization and channel formation of CTX as well. To understand the structural roles of the β-sheet in CTX, the oligomerized toxin will have to be isolated, and then it will be possible to examine the exact number of CTX protomers constituting the oligomer.
