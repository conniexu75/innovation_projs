They have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose chains of a crystalline substrate because of their two-domain structure, i.e. cellulose-binding domain and catalytic domain, and unique active site architecture. However, the details of the action of the two domains on crystalline cellulose are still unclear. Here, we present real time observations of Trichoderma reesei (Tr) cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) molecules sliding on crystalline cellulose, obtained with a high speed atomic force microscope. The average velocity of the sliding movement on crystalline cellulose was 3.5 nm/s, and interestingly, the catalytic domain without the cellulose-binding domain moved with a velocity similar to that of the intact TrCel7A enzyme. However, no sliding of a catalytically inactive enzyme (mutant E212Q) or a variant lacking tryptophan at the entrance of the active site tunnel (mutant W40A) could be detected. This indicates that, besides the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, the loading of a cellulose chain into the active site tunnel is also essential for the enzyme movement.

Cellulose is the most abundant organic compound on Earth and is the major structural component of plant cell walls. In nature, cellulose chains, linear polymers of β-1,4-linked d-glucose units, are packed into ordered arrays to form crystalline cellulose I (1.Hon D.N.S. Cellulose. 1994; 1: 1-25Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because cellulose chains have stable β-glycosidic bonds (2.Wolfenden R. Yuan Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 7548-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and each chain is also stabilized by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal (3.Nishiyama Y. Sugiyama J. Chanzy H. Langan P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14300-14306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), cellulose I is quite resistant not only to chemical hydrolysis, but also to enzymatic degradation. To decompose cellulose I, many microorganisms produce a set of different cellulases. Cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) 2The abbreviations used are: CBHcellobiohydrolaseCBDcellulose-binding domainCDcatalytic domainAFMatomic force microscopyHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHShigh speed. are a group of cellulases that can hydrolyze glycosidic linkages at a crystalline surface (4.Teeri T.T.

Trichoderma reesei Cel7A (formally known as CBH I) is one of the best studied cellobiohydrolases, having a two-domain structure composed of a small cellulose-binding domain (CBD) belonging to carbohydrate-binding module family 1 and a glycoside hydrolase family 7 catalytic domain (CD) (Fig. 1), which are defined in the CAZy data base (6.Abuja P.M.

A similar two-domain structure is common for other glycosidases degrading insoluble carbohydrate substrates. The CD of TrCel7A has a 50-Å long, tunnel-shaped active site, which binds a single cellulose chain and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond to produce cellobiose, a β-1,4-glucose dimer, from the reducing end of the chain (12.Divne C.

Loss of the CBD causes a decrease of crystalline cellulose decomposition, but has less or no effect on the hydrolysis of soluble or amorphous cellulose (17.Ståhlberg J. Johansson G. Pettersson G. BioTechnology. 1991; 9: 286-290Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18.Srisodsuk M. Reinikainen T. Penttilä M. Teeri T.T. J. Biol.

TrCel7A is thought to hydrolyze the crystalline cellulose chain in a processive manner, making consecutive cuts without releasing the chain. This is attributed to the unique, tunnel-shaped active site architecture of CBHs (20.Kipper K. Väljamäe P. Johansson G. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). cellobiohydrolase cellulose-binding domain catalytic domain atomic force microscopy high performance liquid chromatography high speed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has a capacity to image individual biomolecules (21.Binnig G. Quate C.F. Gerber C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1986; 56: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (12639) Google Scholar) and has been used to visualize Trichoderma CBH I (Cel7A) on the surface of cellulose (22.Lee I. Evans B.R. Woodward J. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 82: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, only very slow processes can be recorded by the technique because AFMs require minutes to scan certain area, and many bioprocesses occur at a much higher rate. In the present study, therefore, we have observed TrCel7A molecules using high speed AFM (HS-AFM) and analyzed how this enzyme behaves on crystalline cellulose substrate. Cellulose from green alga, Cladophora sp., was used in this study (23.Igarashi K. Wada M. Hori R. Samejima M. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cel7A from T. reesei was purified from a commercial cellulase mixture, Celluclast® 1.5L (Novozymes; available from Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (23.Igarashi K. Wada M. Hori R. Samejima M. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and CD was prepared by the papain treatment of purified, intact TrCel7A as described earlier (6.Abuja P.M. Pilz I. Tomme P. Claeyssens M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of highly crystalline cellulose from Cladophora, phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose prepared from Avicel (Funacel; Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was performed as described previously (23.Igarashi K. Wada M. Hori R. Samejima M. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24.Igarashi K. Samejima M. Eriksson K.E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The production and purification of the TrCel7A E212Q mutant (two-domain version) have been reported earlier (25.Ståhlberg J. Divne C. Koivula A. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The TrCel7A W40A mutant (two-domain version) was produced in T. reesei ALKO3414 (Roal Ltd., Rajamäki, Finland) (cel7A− and cel7B−) and purified basically as described earlier (25.Ståhlberg J. Divne C. Koivula A. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26.von Ossowski I. Ståhlberg J. Koivula A. Piens K. Becker D. Boer H. Harle R. Harris M. Divne C. Mahdi S. Zhao Y. Driguez H. Claeyssens M. Sinnott M.L. Teeri T.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 817-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The detailed characterization of the W40A mutant will be described elsewhere. TrCel7A and the homologous endoglucanase I, Cel7B, are difficult to separate during purification. For all of the Cel7A preparations used here, the possible endoglucanase contamination was carefully checked using hydroxyethyl cellulose (Sigma) and Ostazin brilliant red H-3B hydroxyethyl cellulose (Sigma), which are good substrates for endoglucanases but are not hydrolyzed by cellobiohydrolases, basically as described earlier (25.Ståhlberg J. Divne C. Koivula A. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All enzyme samples were estimated to contain less than 0.1% endoglucanase contamination. HS-AFM observations were carried out using a NanoLiveVision (Olympus Corporation) equipped with a BL-AC10EGS-A2 small cantilever (Olympus Corporation), based on a previous report (27.Ando T. Kodera N. Takai E. Maruyama D. Saito K. Toda A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12468-12472Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Two microliters of crystalline cellulose suspension in water (0.2%) were dropped on a graphite sample disc, which was rinsed three times with 18 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, after incubation for 5 min. Crystalline cellulose on the sample disc was initially observed without enzyme in 70 μl of the same buffer, followed by the addition 5 μl of 20 μm enzyme solution. The AFM images were taken at 1–4 frames s−1. The soluble reaction mixtures after the HS-AFM experiments were collected and frozen at −20 °C, and the products were analyzed by HPLC (LC-2000 series; Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), using a CoronaTM Charged Aerosol DetectorTM (ESA Biosciences, Chelmsford, MA) as described elsewhere (28.Igarashi K. Ishida T. Hori C. Samejima M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 5628-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Soluble cellooligosaccharides with degree of polymerizations 1–6 were used as standards. Digital images were analyzed using Adobe ImageReady CS2 (version 9.0, Adobe Systems, Inc.). The rate of enzyme movement was determined by measuring the distance relative to a reference point on one of the frames in pixels, and this was converted to length using the size of the observation area. Highly crystalline cellulose prepared from Cladophora sp. was hydrophobically immobilized on graphite grid and were observed by HS-AFM after the addition of Cel7A. A schematic presentation is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Video S1, we have obtained HS-AFM images of small particles sliding on the surface of highly crystalline cellulose. These images showed that the particles slide in a single direction without becoming detached from the substrate. Analysis of the images showed that the size of the particles was 3.1 nm (Fig. 2, B and C), which is consistent with the height estimated from the crystal structure of the catalytic module of TrCel7A (Fig. 2D). Because these moving particles were not seen in the absence of the enzyme, we conclude that they are TrCel7A molecules sliding on crystalline cellulose. TrCel7A is known to hydrolyze cellulose from the reducing end of the chain (14.Barr B.K. Hsieh Y.L. Ganem B. Wilson D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16.Vršanská M. Biely P. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 227: 19-27Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the previous transmission electron microscopy studies also showed unidirectional hydrolysis, narrowing of the microcrystals at the reducing end side when highly crystalline cellulose was treated with TrCel7A (15.Imai T. Boisset C. Samejima M. Igarashi K. Sugiyama J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, cellulose crystals showed similar narrowing after incubation with the TrCel7A, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations and accompanied by cellobiose production as the only soluble product, detected by HPLC (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the TrCel7A molecules are moving in the direction from the reducing end to the nonreducing end. We have also tested several CBH II (Cel6) types of enzyme, which have been known to hydrolyze nonreducing end of crystalline cellulose (29.Chanzy H. Henrissat B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 285-288Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but we have not been able to observe any movement on the cellulose surface (data not shown), suggesting less processive action of CBH II. The adsorption of the family 1 CBD on crystalline cellulose requires three aromatic amino acids (three tyrosines on the CBDTrCel7A surface) (30.Linder M. Mattinen M.L. Kontteli M. Lindeberg G. Ståhlberg J. Drakenberg T. Reinikainen T. Pettersson G. Annila A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the binding sites involve the hydrophobic (110) planes of cellulose crystals (31.Lehtiö J. Sugiyama J. Gustavsson M. Fransson L. Linder M. Teeri T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). During the HS-AFM observations, many molecules were seen not only on crystalline cellulose, but also on the background, hydrophobic graphite surface. However, the enzyme molecules on the background only vibrated, possibly because of Brownian motion, but did not slide in any direction. The fact that the sliding movement was observed only on cellulose indicates that the enzyme movement requires the combination of the enzyme and the substrate and does not arise only as a result of simple enzyme adsorption via hydrophobic interactions. The individual TrCel7A molecules were all sliding with a similar velocity on the crystalline cellulose surface, and the average rate of movement on cellulose I for intact TrCel7A was estimated to be 3.5 ± 1.1 nm s−1 (n = 69), as shown in Fig. 3. In addition, HS-AFM observations using the TrCel7A CD, isolated after proteolytic cleavage of the intact enzyme (Fig. 4), were also performed. No particles were observed on the substrate when the isolated CD was added at a concentration similar to that of the intact wild-type enzyme (data not shown); however, a 10-fold increase in the protein concentration (to 20 μm) resulted in the appearance of sliding particles, as shown in Fig. 5 and supplemental Video S2. Interestingly, the average velocity of the sliding CD was similar to that of the intact TrCel7A. This indicates that adsorption on crystalline cellulose through the CBD is not essential for the movement of TrCel7A, and CD alone seems to be responsible for the sliding on the substrate.FIGURE 4A, SDS-PAGE of TrCel7A wild-type (WT), catalytic domain, and mutants E212Q and W40A.

As seen in Fig. 6A, the substrate-binding tunnel of TrCel7A holds seven glucose units at subsites −7 to −1 and two additional glucose units in the product-binding site +1 and +2 (13.Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Glu212, which acts as a catalytic nucleophile (25.Ståhlberg J. Divne C. Koivula A. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), is located between −1 and +1, and there is a conserved Trp40 at the entrance of the active site tunnel, where its role is apparently to fix the substrate by hydrophobic interaction at subsite −7. The mutation of Glu212 to Gln (E212Q) causes significant loss in activity, as shown in Fig. 4. In the HS-AFM images of E212Q, the mutant Cel7A appeared to be bound tightly to crystalline cellulose, and no sliding molecules could be observed under any conditions. The molecules were observed to be bound for various time periods, but always longer than 10 time frames (supplemental Video S3), indicating that they stay on the crystal surface for quite a long time without sliding movement. In addition to the inactive mutant, the mutant W40A was tested as the control of the CD and E212Q mutant. As shown in Fig. 4, this mutant has similar activity against an amorphous substrate as the wild-type, but less than 20% of the wild-type activity toward highly crystalline cellulose. This would suggest that the W40A mutant and the CD are similar in their biochemical behavior. However, in contrast to the CD, no obvious movement of W40A was observed in HS-AFM studies. Moreover, almost all of the W40A mutant molecules were observed to be bound for only a limited time period compared with the E212Q mutant (supplemental Video S4). The action of the TrCel7A W40A mutant was also examined at a much faster scan rate (four frames/s), which revealed that many molecules became attached to and detached from the crystalline cellulose surface (see supplemental Video S5). These results suggest that mutant E212Q can grasp the cellulose chain but is unable to proceed along the chain because of its inactivity, whereas mutant W40A can only rarely lift a substrate chain and undergoes repeated attachment to and detachment from the surface (see also summary in Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Summary of the motion of the TrCel7A variants. WT, wild-type. Star indicates that the particle was observed in successive images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been suggested that the driving force of the processive movement of cellobiohydrolases is provided by the energy from hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds (32.Sinnott M.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics studies have further suggested that the enzyme-substrate interactions produce the force required to pull cellulose chains from the surface and also to move the enzyme along the cellulose chain, and the CBD could penetrate between cellulose chains and serve to feed the free chain into the active site tunnel of the CD (33.Mulakala C. Reilly P.J. Proteins. 2005; 60: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on our comparison of the two mutant and wild-type enzymes, however, both the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond and the loading of substrate are essential for the sliding movement. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the average velocity of the CD and the intact Cel7A enzyme on cellulose surface is similar. This would clearly argue against suggestions of the family 1 CBD having an active role in penetration to the crystalline cellulose, lifting and feeding of the chain to the active site tunnel of Cel7A. Based on our studies, the role of CBD would be merely to increase the enzyme concentration on the crystalline substrate. Motor proteins utilize high energy phosphate bonds as the energy source for movement on their substrate. Kinecin, dynein, and certain myosins are known as processive motor proteins, which show linear motion on microtubules and actin filaments, utilizing ATP as an energy source (34.Kolomeisky A.B. Fisher M.E. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2007; 58: 675-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Our results here indicate that TrCel7A wild-type enzyme moves linearly along the crystalline cellulose similarly to many motor proteins. The major difference is, however, the driving energy, i.e. hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond of cellulose (equal to or less than −12.5 kJ/mol), which has less energy than a diphosphate bond (approximately −30 kJ/mol) (33.Mulakala C. Reilly P.J. Proteins. 2005; 60: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35.Kammermeier H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1993; 88: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36.Tewari Y.B. Goldberg R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3966-3971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This feature of TrCel7A is quite similar to exonucleases, which are categorized into molecular motors. The present study demonstrates direct observations of TrCel7A molecules sliding on crystalline celluloses. Based on CD having sliding velocity similar to that of the wild-type and immobility of the inactive mutant (E212Q), we conclude that the movement is accompanied by a catalytic activity, and CBD enhances the concentration of enzyme molecules on the substrate but does not have more active role in cellulose hydrolysis. Moreover, our results on the W40A mutant suggest importance of hydrophobic interaction with cellulose chain for the enzyme movement. TrCel7A is the first example of a molecular motor within polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, and we suspect that other processive polysaccharide hydrolases may employ similar molecular machinery to slide on their substrate."

Since miR-143 was found to be down-regulated in prostate cancer cells, we wanted to analyze its expression in human prostate cancer, and test the ability of miR-43 to arrest prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.Expression of miR-143 was analyzed in human prostate cancers by quantitative PCR, and by in situ hybridization. miR-143 was introduced in cancer cells in vivo by electroporation. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase-based assays were used to determine miR-143 targets. We show in this study that miR-143 levels are inversely correlated with advanced stages of prostate cancer. Rescue of miR-143 expression in cancer cells results in the arrest of cell proliferation and the abrogation of tumor growth in mice. Furthermore, we show that the effects of miR-143 are mediated, at least in part by the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 (ERK5) activity. We show here that ERK5 is a miR-143 target in prostate cancer.miR-143 is as a new target for prostate cancer treatment."

These data suggest that celastrol may represent a new class of Hsp90 inhibitor by modifying Hsp90 C terminus to allosterically regulate its chaperone activity and disrupt Hsp90-Cdc37 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1967467650,"The role of Lys-63 ubiquitin chains in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation is still obscure. We systematically compared proteasomal processing of Lys-63 ubiquitin chains with that of the canonical proteolytic signal, Lys-48 ubiquitin chains. Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of ubiquitin chains in HeLa cells determines that the levels of Lys-63 ubiquitin chains are insensitive to short-time proteasome inhibition. Also, the Lys-48/Lys-63 ratio in the 26 S proteasome-bound fraction is 1.7-fold more than that in the cell lysates, likely because some cellular Lys-63 ubiquitin conjugates are sequestered by Lys-63 chain-specific binding proteins. In vitro, Lys-48 and Lys-63 ubiquitin chains bind the 26 S proteasome comparably, whereas Lys-63 chains are deubiquitinated 6-fold faster than Lys-48 chains. Also, Lys-63 tetraubiquitin-conjugated UbcH10 is rapidly deubiquitinated into the monoubiquitinated form, whereas Lys-48 tetraubiquitin targets UbcH10 for degradation. Furthermore, we found that both the ubiquitin aldehyde- and 1,10-phenanthroline-sensitive deubiquitinating activities of the 26 S proteasome contribute to Lys-48- and Lys-63-linkage deubiquitination, albeit the inhibitory extents are different. Together, our findings suggest that compared with Lys-48 chains, cellular Lys-63 chains have less proteasomal accessibility, and proteasome-bound Lys-63 chains are more rapidly deubiquitinated, which could cause inefficient degradation of Lys-63 conjugates.

Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving a ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinpolyUbpolyubiquitinAmcamino-4-methylcourmarinRIPreceptor interacting proteinUbalubiquitin aldehydeHAhemagglutininNEMONF-κB essential modulator. -activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub ligase (E3) (1.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Ub is conjugated onto protein substrates by formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine residue of Ub and the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue in the substrate. Furthermore, a polyubiquitin (polyUb) chain is formed by conjugating the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine residue of Ub to the ϵ-amino group of one of the seven internal lysines in the preceding Ub. In addition, linear polyUbs are linked by amide bonds formed between the C-terminal glycine residue of Ub and the N-terminal methionine residue of a following Ub (2.Kirisako T. Kamei K. Murata S.

Thus, at least eight different polyUb linkages exist in cells. ubiquitin polyubiquitin amino-4-methylcourmarin receptor interacting protein ubiquitin aldehyde hemagglutinin NF-κB essential modulator. Protein ubiquitination plays diverse roles in regulating cellular activities. Monoubiquitination does not support degradation, but it is involved in regulating membrane trafficking, gene transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication (3.Chen Z.J. Sun L.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). As for polyubiquitination, it seems that different linkages have distinct functions; polyUbs linked through Lys-48 are the primary targeting signals for proteasomal degradation (1.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar), whereas polyUbs linked through Lys-63 recruit other binding partners and execute many functions including kinase activation (4.Deng L.

Science. 2005; 310: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The functions of other polyUbs have also been suggested such as the involvement of the Lys-6 linkage in regulating DNA repair (9.Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Ub linkage on a modified substrate can be switched in response to different functions. For instance, in tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated activation of the NFκB gene (10.Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), a Lys-63 chain on receptor interacting protein (RIP) functions as a signaling element to recruit the IκB kinase complex, which phosphorylates IκBα (an inhibitor protein of NFκB) and triggers its Ub-dependent degradation. During the stimulation, A20 deubiquitinates Lys-63-linked RIP and then assembles Lys-48 polyUbs on RIP, promoting RIP degradation (10.Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). In addition to Lys-48 polyUbs, a recent proteomic study found that Ub chains linked by Lys-6, -11, -27, -29, or -33 could also serve as proteolytic signals (11.Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D. Xie Y. Robert J. Rush J. Hochstrasser M. Finley D. Peng J. Cell. 2009; 137: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Lys-11 polyUbs were found to mediate degradation of proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, cell cycle progression, and other functions (11.Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T.

The role of Lys-63 polyUbs in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation is still unclear. Some studies suggested that Lys-63 polyUbs are competent proteolytic signals. For example, in vitro studies have shown that Lys-63 polyUbs are able to target degradation of several proteins including Sic1, cyclin B1, dihydrofolate reductase, and troponin I (14.Saeki Y. Kudo T.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, partial degradation of the transcription factor Mga2, which releases the N-terminal p90 activator domain, can be processed by overexpression of the UbLys-48R mutant that promotes the formation of Lys-63 ubiquitinated Mga2 (14.Saeki Y. Kudo T. Sone T. Kikuchi Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Also, inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 in S. cerevisiae or mammalian cells causes an increase of both the Lys-48 and Lys-63 Ub conjugates as detected by mass spectrometric analysis (14.Saeki Y. Kudo T. Sone T. Kikuchi Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, physiological substrates that exclusively depend on the Lys-63 linkage for degradation have not been identified. In contrast to the findings that suggest a role of Lys-63 polyUbs in targeting proteolysis, Xu et al. (11.Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D. Xie Y. Robert J. Rush J. Hochstrasser M. Finley D. Peng J. Cell. 2009; 137: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) proposed that the Lys-63 polyUbs are not proteolytic signals in S. cerevisiae based on quantitative proteomic studies. They also suggest that all other Ub linkages can support degradation and have partially redundant functions in proteolysis (11.Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D. Xie Y. Robert J. Rush J. Hochstrasser M. Finley D. Peng J. Cell. 2009; 137: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In this study we systematically compared proteasomal processing of Lys-63 polyUbs with that of the primary proteolytic signal of Lys-48 polyUbs in the aspects of binding/recognition, deubiquitination, and targeting for degradation. Our results suggest that cellular Lys-63 Ub chains have less proteasomal accessibility than Lys-48 chains, likely because some cellular Lys-63 ubiquitin conjugates are sequestered by Lys-63 chain-specific binding proteins, such as NEMO. In vitro Lys-63 and Lys-48 Ub chains bind the 26 S proteasome comparably, but Lys-63 chains are deubiquitinated 6-fold more rapidly than Lys-48 chains. Both the ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal)- and 1,10-phenanthroline-sensitive deubiquitinating activities of the 26 S proteasome contribute to Lys-48- and Lys-63-linkage deubiquitination, albeit their inhibitory extents are different. Moreover, we found that rapid deubiquitination of Lys-63 chains could cause inefficient degradation of their conjugates. See supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” The bovine 26 S proteasome and PA700 were purified according to methods established by DeMartino and co-workers (18.Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K.

DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation and deubiquitination were performed at 30 °C in degradation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). Reaction mixtures usually contained 13.5 nm 26 S proteasome and 100 nm polyubiquitinated UbcH10 or other substrates as specified in the legends to Figs. 2, 3, and 6. Samples were withdrawn at each designated time point and added into 5× SDS sample buffer to stop the reaction immediately. Usually samples of time 0 represented a reaction of about 15 s except in Fig. 5, C and D, and Fig. 6C where samples at time 0 were prepared by adding the substrates directly into 1× SDS sample buffer with the 26 S proteasome. For reactions containing epoxomicin (100 μm), Ubal (2.5 μm) or 1,10-phenanthroline (5 mm), the 26 S proteasome was preincubated with the corresponding inhibitors for 10 min before the supplementation of substrates.FIGURE 3Both the Ubal- and the 1,10-phenanthroline-sensitive deubiquitinating activities of the 26 S proteasome contribute to Lys-48- and Lys-63-linkage deubiquitination.

The reaction times for Lys-48 and Lys-63 Ub4 were 120 and 20 min, respectively. B, the reactions were similar to A except that 60 nm PA700 was used.

Appropriate amounts of NEMO were preincubated with 300 nm Ubn>6 for 5 min before the supplementation of 13.5 nm purified 26 S proteasome to initiate deubiquitination.

D, NEMO protects HA-Ub6 from deubiquitination in cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub6, FLAG-NEMO, FLAG-NEMO (L329P), or a combination. The whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody.

B, the degradation reaction contained 100 nm Lys-48 Ub4-UbcH10 and 13.5 nm 26 S proteasome. The lane denoted epox indicates that the 26 S proteasome was preinhibited with epoxomicin. C, Lys-63 Ub4-UbcH10 is rapidly deubiquitinated by 26 S proteasome without efficient degradation. Reactions were analogous to B. Lanes denoted with Ubal or phen indicate that the deubiquitinating activities of the 26 S proteasome were preinhibited with 2.5 μm Ubal or 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline or both. D, the 26 S (SW) proteasome degrades Lys-63 Ub4-UbcH10. The reactions were analogous to C except the 26 S (SW) proteasome was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 12.5 nm 26 S proteasome was preincubated with 2.5 μm Ubal and 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline for 10 min at 30 °C in degradation buffer. 80 nm Lys-48 Ub4 or Lys-63 Ub4 was then mixed with the preinhibited proteasome and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. 60-μl mixtures or Ub4 alone were loaded into Micro Bio-Spin P-30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) and centrifuged according to the manufacturer's instruction. The flow-through was eluted directly into a 1.5-ml micro tube with 20 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. 30-μl samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting assays. To determine the binding between the 26 S proteasome (13.5 nm) and Ub4 (Lys-48 or Lys-63)-UbcH10 (100 nm), we used homemade Sephadex G-100 spin columns (exclusion limit is 80 kDa). After centrifugation, all resulting mixtures (75 μl) were concentrated to about 30 μl by heating. Proteins are resolved in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-UbcH10 antibody. Similar assays were also used to determine the interaction between the 26 S (SW) proteasome or PA700 and Usp14. We obtained the pQCXIP viral expression plasmid that expresses S13/Rpn11-HTBH or the HTBH tag alone from Dr. L. Huang at the University of California at Irvine. The HTBH tag includes a His6 tag, tobacco etch virus protease site, in vivo biotinylation sequence, and another His6 tag. Stable HeLa cell lines that express S13-HTBH or the HTBH tag were established according to a published method by using HEK293 10A1 packaging cells (20.Wang X. Chen C.F. Baker P.R. Chen P.L. Kaiser P. Huang L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3553-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To purify the 26 S proteasome, HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At 90% confluency, three 10-cm plates of cells were treated with 30 μm MG132 or 0.3% DMSO for 45 min, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before harvest. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm 1,10-phenathroline, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resins were then washed three times with the lysis buffer followed by two additional washes with the lysis buffer without iodoacetamide. Finally, the streptavidin-bound 26 S proteasome was released by incubation with 50 ng/μl tobacco etch virus overnight at 4 °C. The whole cell lysates and the purified 26 S proteasome described above were resolved in SDS-PAGE. The gel regions containing the vast majority of ubiquitinated proteins (>70 kDa), judged by immunoblotting, were excised followed by in-gel trypsin digestion. Because trypsin cleaves ubiquitin to a small GG tag on modified lysine residues, the abundance of polyUb linkages is represented by the level of the GG peptides. Stable isotope-labeled GG peptides were chemically synthesized, quantified, and added into the samples as internal standards (21.Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 22.Xu P. Peng J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1940-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The samples were fractionated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled with a hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The instrument was operated in the mode of selective reaction monitoring to increase sensitivity. The native GG peptides and the labeled internal standards were eluted together and separated by mass spectrometry due to mass difference, enabling relative quantification. If a specific Ub linkage targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, its cellular level and the 26 S proteasome-bound fraction should elevate in response to short-time proteasome inhibition. To test this idea, we first generated stable HeLa cell lines that express S13/Rpn11-HTBH or the HTBH tag alone according to a previous report (20.Wang X. Chen C.F. Baker P.R. Chen P.L. Kaiser P. Huang L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3553-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This allowed us to rapidly purify the 26 S proteasome using affinity purification. We next examined whether treating these stable HeLa cell lines with 30 μm MG132 for 45 min would increase cellular Ub conjugates. We found that the high molecular weight Ub conjugates in the whole cell lysates significantly increased as determined with immunoblotting of Ub (Fig. 1A). Quantitative mass spectrometry (21.Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) that uses heavy isotope-labeled Ub linkage peptides as internal standards identified Lys-11-, Lys-48-, and Lys-63-linked polyUbs in both the DMSO- (control) and MG132-treated whole cell lysates. Interestingly, the relative amounts of the Lys-11 and the Lys-48 linkages increased 1.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively, upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the amount of the Lys-63 linkages did not change (Fig. 1B). The other polyUb linkages were undetectable in the whole cell lysates. Thus, the cellular level of the Lys-63 linkages does not elevate in response to short-time proteasome inhibition, whereas the Lys-11 and Lys-48 linkages promptly increase. Next, we examined the amount of 26 S proteasome-bound polyUb linkages to evaluate which Ub linkages target substrates to the 26 S proteasome. To this end we purified the 26 S proteasome from the established stable HeLa cells by utilization of the HTBH tag according to a previous report (20.Wang X. Chen C.F. Baker P.R. Chen P.L. Kaiser P. Huang L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3553-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To protect the cellular polyUbs from deubiquitination, the whole cell lysates were treated with inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (iodoacetamide and 1,10-phenanthroline). Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting confirmed that the 26 S proteasome was purified from HeLa cells expressing S13-HTBH, but not from the HTBH tag alone (Fig. 1, C and D). Immunoblotting of the purified 26 S proteasome with an anti-Ub antibody found that the purified 26 S proteasome contained significant amounts of high molecular weight Ub conjugates, with more in the MG132-treated preparation (Fig. 1E). Next, we used mass spectrometry to quantify the proteasome-bound polyUb linkages. After enriching on the proteasome, the Lys-6, -11, -27, -29, -48, and -63 linkages were detectable, and their relative amounts were quantified (Fig. 1F). MG132 treatment increased the 26 S proteasome-bound Ub conjugates of the Lys-6-, -11-, -27-, -29-, and -48-linked at a range of 1.7–2.5-fold, whereas the Lys-63-linked only had a slight increase (Fig. 1F). Thus, the Lys-63 linkage is the only detectable form in the 26 S proteasome-bound fraction that does not significantly increase in response to short-time proteasome inhibition. Moreover, the amount of Lys-48 polyUbs bound to the 26 S proteasome is 6- and 12.7-fold more than the Lys-63 polyUbs in the DMSO- and MG132-treated preparations, respectively (Fig. 1G). This could explain why immunostaining of HeLa cells with Ub linkage-specific antibodies found that Lys-48 polyUbs colocalize with the 26 S proteasome, whereas the Lys-63 polyUbs do not (23.Newton K. Matsumoto M.L. Wertz I.E. Kirkpatrick D.S. Lill J.R. Tan J. Dugger D. Gordon N. Sidhu S.S. Fellouse F.A. Komuves L. French D.M. Ferrando R.E. Lam C. Compaan D. Yu C. Bosanac I. Hymowitz S.G. Kelley R.F. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2008; 134: 668-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Lys-48/Lys-63 ratios in the 26 S proteasome-bound fraction are 1.7-fold higher than those in the whole cell lysates in both DMSO- and MG132-treated preparations (Fig. 1G). Thus, cellular Lys-48 polyUbs appear to have more proteasome accessibility than the Lys-63 polyUbs. In the DMSO-treated HeLa cells, 11 and 68% of the 26 S proteasome-bound Ub conjugates are the Lys-63- and Lys-48-linked forms, respectively (data not shown). This indicates that both Ub linkages can bind the 26 S proteasome. We, therefore, evaluated the ability of the 26 S proteasome to process both Ub linkages from the aspects of proteasomal binding, deubiquitination, and degradation of conjugates. To obtain large quantities of the 26 S proteasome for biochemical characterization, we purified the 26 S proteasome from bovine red blood cells according to our previous report (18.Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Mass spectroscopy and immunoblotting determined that the purified 26 S proteasome contained three deubiquitinating enzymes: Uch37, Usp14, and S13 (Rpn11) (supplemental Fig. 1, C–F and data not shown). Notably, purified PA700 (19.Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained both Uch37 and S13 but no Usp14 (supplemental Fig. 1C). Usp14 is a proteasome-associating protein, and its association is salt concentration-sensitive (24.Koulich E. Li X. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is likely that Usp14 dissociates from PA700 during the anion exchange purification step. To examine the ability of the mammalian 26 S proteasome to bind Lys-48 and Lys-63 polyUbs, we performed a size-exclusion spin column assay. We found that both Lys-48 and Lys-63 Ub4 had comparable binding efficiency to the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 2A). In the spin column assay, Lys-63 or Lys-48 Ub4 are trapped inside the P-30 spin column (40-kDa exclusion limit) after centrifugation (lane 2 in Fig. 2A). Coelution of Ub4 with the 26 S proteasome in the flow-through indicates a direct binding between them (lane 3 in Fig. 2A). It is noteworthy that the 26 S proteasome was incubated with both Ubal and 1,10-phenanthroline to inhibit its deubiquitinating activities in these binding assays. Given the fact that both Lys-48 and Lys-63 Ub4 efficiently bind the 26 S proteasome, the two deubiquitinating inhibitors likely have no effect on binding of polyUbs to the 26 S proteasome. We next evaluated 26 S proteasome-mediated deubiquitination of Lys-48 or Lys-63 Ub4. Surprisingly, we found that Lys-63 Ub4 was deubiquitinated about 6-fold more rapidly than Lys-48 Ub4 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 2). Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE showed that both Lys-48 and Lys-63 Ub4 were eventually deubiquitinated into monomeric Ub (supplemental Fig. 2). The more rapid deubiquitination of Lys-63 Ub4 correlated with its higher Vmax value as compared with Lys-48 Ub4, whereas both chains had similar Km values (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 3). Together, these results indicate that the 26 S proteasome binds both Lys-48 and Lys-63 polyUbs comparably, but it deubiquitinates Lys-63 polyUbs much more rapidly. We next aimed to determine which of the deubiquitinating activities of the 26 S proteasome is responsible for deubiquitination of Lys-48 or Lys-63 polyUbs. The 26 S proteasome contains two cystine-protease deubiquitinating enzymes (Uch37 and Usp14) that are sensitive to Ubal inhibition. It also contains a Zn2+-dependent metalloprotease (S13/Rpn11) that is inhibited by the metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline. Uch37 was shown to have a Ub chain trimming activity that initiates cleavage from the distal site (25.Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). S13 has a proximal deubiquitinating activity that cleaves an entire polyUb from the substrates (26.Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Ubal had a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on 26 S proteasome-catalyzed deubiquitination (supplemental Fig. 4). Accordingly, we used 2.5 μm Ubal to block the activity of Uch37/Usp14 and 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline to inhibit the activity of S13. For Lys-48 Ub4, at a reaction time point when more than 85% of Ub4 was deubiquitinated if no Ubal or 1,10-phenanthroline was added, adding Ubal exhibited nearly complete inhibition of both the 26 S proteasome- and PA700-mediated deubiquitination, whereas 1,10-phenanthroline had a more mild inhibitory effect (upper panels in Fig. 3, A and B). For Lys-63 Ub4, neither Ubal nor 1,10-phenanthroline alone completely inhibited deubiquitination, with Ubal having a stronger effect (lower panels in Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, deubiquitination of Lys-63 Ub4 was abolished by a combination of these two inhibitors (lanes 10 and 11 in Fig. 3B). Thus, both the Ubal- and 1,10-phenanthroline-sensitive deubiquitinating enzymes contribute to deubiquitination of Lys-48 and Lys-63 polyUbs, but they have different inhibitory extents. To investigate whether both of the thiol proteases (Uch37 and Usp14) of the proteasome contribute to the Ubal-sensitive deubiquitination, we prepared Usp14-depleted 26 S proteasome by taking advantage of the fact that its residence on the 26 S proteasome is salt concentration-sensitive (24.Koulich E. Li X. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008;"

Similar results were obtained in cells where glycans were enzymatically removed. In contrast, enzymatic removal of proteins from the cell surface completely ablated TAT PTD-mediated transduction. Our findings support the hypothesis that acidic glycans form a pool of charge that TAT PTD binds on the cell surface, but this binding is independent of the PTD-mediated transduction mechanism and the induction of macropinocytotic uptake by TAT PTD.

https://openalex.org/W2083557994,"The molecular events that contribute to the cellular uptake of cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are still a matter of intense research. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a 22-amino acid CPP derived from the human milk protein, lactoferrin. The peptide exhibits a conformation-dependent uptake efficiency that is correlated with efficient binding to heparan sulfate and lipid-induced conformational changes. The peptide contains a disulfide bridge formed by terminal cysteine residues. At concentrations exceeding 10 mum, this peptide undergoes the same rapid entry into the cytoplasm that was described previously for the arginine-rich CPPs nona-arginine and Tat. Cytoplasmic entry strictly depends on the presence of the disulfide bridge. To better understand this conformation dependence, NMR spectroscopy was performed for the free peptide, and CD measurements were performed for free and lipid-bound peptide. In solution, the peptides showed only slight differences in secondary structure, with a predominantly disordered structure both in the presence and absence of the disulfide bridge. In contrast, in complex with large unilamellar vesicles, the conformation of the oxidized and reduced forms of the peptide clearly differed. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance experiments showed that the oxidized form binds to heparan sulfate with a considerably higher affinity than the reduced form. Consistently, membrane binding and cellular uptake of the peptide were reduced when heparan sulfate chains were removed."
https://openalex.org/W2162859509,"The aim of this study was to characterize inhibitory mechanisms on T cell receptor signaling mediated by the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Both receptors are coupled to G(i/o) proteins, which are associated with inhibition of cyclic AMP formation. In human primary and Jurkat T lymphocytes, activation of CB1 by R(+)-methanandamide, CB2 by JWH015, and both by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol induced a short decrease in cyclic AMP lasting less than 1 h. However, this decrease was followed by a massive (up to 10-fold) and sustained (at least up to 48 h) increase in cyclic AMP. Mediated by the cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase A and C-terminal Src kinase, the cannabinoids induced a stable phosphorylation of the inhibitory Tyr-505 of the leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck). By thus arresting Lck in its inhibited form, the cannabinoids prevented the dephosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-505 in response to T cell receptor activation, which is necessary for the subsequent initiation of T cell receptor signaling. In this way the cannabinoids inhibited the T cell receptor-triggered signaling, i.e. the activation of the zeta-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa, the linker for activation of T cells, MAPK, the induction of interleukin-2, and T cell proliferation. All of the effects of the cannabinoids were blocked by the CB1 and CB2 antagonists AM281 and AM630. These findings help to better understand the immunosuppressive effects of cannabinoids and explain the beneficial effects of these drugs in the treatment of T cell-mediated autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2121715322,"Serpins are known to be necessary for the regulation of several serine protease cascades. However, the mechanisms of how serpins regulate the innate immune responses of invertebrates are not well understood due to the uncertainty of the identity of the serine proteases targeted by the serpins. We recently reported the molecular activation mechanisms of three serine protease-mediated Toll and melanin synthesis cascades in a large beetle, Tenebrio molitor. Here, we purified three novel serpins (SPN40, SPN55, and SPN48) from the hemolymph of T. molitor. These serpins made specific serpin-serine protease pairs with three Toll cascade-activating serine proteases, such as modular serine protease, Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme, and Spätzle-processing enzyme and cooperatively blocked the Toll signaling cascade and beta-1,3-glucan-mediated melanin biosynthesis. Also, the levels of SPN40 and SPN55 were dramatically increased in vivo by the injection of a Toll ligand, processed Spätzle, into Tenebrio larvae. This increase in SPN40 and SPN55 levels indicates that these serpins function as inducible negative feedback inhibitors. Unexpectedly, SPN55 and SPN48 were cleaved at Tyr and Glu residues in reactive center loops, respectively, despite being targeted by trypsin-like Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme and Spätzle-processing enzyme. These cleavage patterns are also highly similar to those of unusual mammalian serpins involved in blood coagulation and blood pressure regulation, and they may contribute to highly specific and timely inactivation of detrimental serine proteases during innate immune responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate the specific regulatory evidences of innate immune responses by three novel serpins."
https://openalex.org/W2027901343,"Background Previous work on the human auditory cortex has revealed areas specialized in spatial processing but how the neurons in these areas represent the location of a sound source remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we performed a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment with the aim of revealing the neural code of auditory space implemented by the human cortex. In a stimulus-specific adaptation paradigm, realistic spatial sound stimuli were presented in pairs of adaptor and probe locations. We found that the attenuation of the N1m response depended strongly on the spatial arrangement of the two sound sources. These location-specific effects showed that sounds originating from locations within the same hemifield activated the same neuronal population regardless of the spatial separation between the sound sources. In contrast, sounds originating from opposite hemifields activated separate groups of neurons. Conclusions/Significance These results are highly consistent with a rate code of spatial location formed by two opponent populations, one tuned to locations in the left and the other to those in the right. This indicates that the neuronal code of sound source location implemented by the human auditory cortex is similar to that previously found in other primates."
https://openalex.org/W2052229828,"Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin and retinoid signaling pathways is known to tilt cartilage matrix homeostasis toward catabolism. Here, we investigated possible interactions between these pathways. We found that all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment of mouse epiphyseal chondrocytes in culture did increase Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the absence or presence of exogenous Wnt3a, as revealed by lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor/beta-catenin reporter activity and beta-catenin nuclear accumulation. This stimulation was accompanied by increased gene expression of Wnt proteins and receptors and was inhibited by co-treatment with Dickkopf-related protein-1, an extracellular inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, suggesting that RA modulates Wnt signaling at Wnt cell surface receptor level. RA also enhanced matrix loss triggered by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, whereas treatment with a retinoid antagonist reduced it. Interestingly, overexpression of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARgamma) strongly inhibited Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in retinoid-free cultures, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous RARgamma expression strongly increased it. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of RARalpha or RARbeta had minimal effects. Co-immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid assays indicated that RARgamma interacts with beta-catenin and induces dissociation of beta-catenin from lymphoid enhancer factor in retinoid-free cultures. The N-terminal domain (AF-1) of RARgamma but not the C-terminal domain (AF-2) was required for association with beta-catenin, whereas both AF-1 and AF-2 were necessary for inhibition of beta-catenin transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data indicate that the Wnt and retinoid signaling pathways do interact in chondrocytes, and their cross-talks and cross-regulation play important roles in the regulation of cartilage matrix homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1965046765,"The catabolic pathway for branched-chain amino acids includes deamination followed by oxidative decarboxylation of the deaminated product branched-chain alpha-keto acids, catalyzed by the mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm) and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme complex (BCKDC). We found that BCATm binds to the E1 decarboxylase of BCKDC, forming a metabolon that allows channeling of branched-chain alpha-keto acids from BCATm to E1. The protein complex also contains glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH1), 4-nitrophenylphosphatase domain and non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein homolog 1, pyruvate carboxylase, and BCKDC kinase. GDH1 binds to the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) form of BCATm (PMP-BCATm) but not to the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-BCATm and other metabolon proteins. Leucine activates GDH1, and oxidative deamination of glutamate is increased further by addition of PMP-BCATm. Isoleucine and valine are not allosteric activators of GDH1, but in the presence of 5'-phosphate-BCATm, they convert BCATm to PMP-BCATm, stimulating GDH1 activity. Sensitivity to ADP activation of GDH1 was unaffected by PMP-BCATm; however, addition of a 3 or higher molar ratio of PMP-BCATm to GDH1 protected GDH1 from GTP inhibition by 50%. Kinetic results suggest that GDH1 facilitates regeneration of the form of BCATm that binds to E1 decarboxylase of the BCKDC, promotes metabolon formation, branched-chain amino acid oxidation, and cycling of nitrogen through glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W2109916636,"Activation of the innate immune system results in a rapid microbicidal response against microorganisms, which needs to be fine-tuned because uncontrolled immune responses can lead to infection and cancer, as well as conditions such as Crohn disease, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease. Here we report that excessive activity of the conserved FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 enhances susceptibility to bacterial infections in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that increased temperature activates not only DAF-16 nuclear import but also a control mechanism involved in DAF-16 nuclear export. The nuclear export of DAF-16 requires heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 and Hsp70/HSP-1. Furthermore, we show that increased expression of the water channel Aquoporin-1 is responsible for the deleterious consequences of excessive DAF-16-mediated immune response. These studies reveal a stress-inducible mechanism involved in the regulation of DAF-16 and indicate that uncontrolled DAF-16 activity and water homeostasis are a cause of the deleterious effects of excessive immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1995727086,"Activated protein C (APC) is an anticoagulant, approved as a treatment for severe sepsis, that can prevent apoptosis, inflammation, and vascular leakage. The aim of this study was to investigate whether APC protects endothelial barrier function through the angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 axis. APC significantly up-regulated gene and protein expression of Tie2 and Ang1 in a dose (0.01–10 μg/ml)- and time (0.5–24 h)-dependent manner in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Interestingly, it markedly inhibited Ang2 with an IC50 of ~0.1 μg/ml. HUVEC permeability, measured using Evans blue dye transfer, was significantly reduced in the presence of APC, and, in concordance, the tight junction associated protein zona occludens (ZO)-1 was up-regulated and localized peripherally around cells, compared with controls. Smooth muscle cell migration toward APC-stimulated HUVECs was elevated compared with unstimulated cells. Blocking antibodies and small interfering (si) RNA treatment, compared with isotype (IgG) or scrambled siRNA controls, showed that APC requires 3 receptors, the endothelial protein C receptor, protease-activated receptor 1, and Tie2 to perform all these barrier stabilization functions. In summary, this study demonstrates that APC has novel effects on the Ang/Tie2 axis, which enhance endothelial barrier function and are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effect in sepsis and other diseases associated with vascular leakage.—Minhas, N., Xue, M., Fukudome, K., Jackson, C.

Interestingly, CYP170A1 shows no stereo selection forming equal amounts of two albaflavenol epimers, each of which is oxidized in turn to albaflavenone. To explore the structural basis of the reaction mechanism, we have studied the crystal structures of both ligand-free CYP170A1 (2.6 A) and complex of endogenous substrate (epi-isozizaene) with CYP170A1 (3.3 A). The structure of the complex suggests that the proximal epi-isozizaene molecules may bind to the heme iron in two orientations. In addition, much to our surprise, we have found that albaflavenone synthase also has a second, completely distinct catalytic activity corresponding to the synthesis of farnesene isomers from farnesyl diphosphate. Within the cytochrome P450 alpha-helical domain both the primary sequence and x-ray structure indicate the presence of a novel terpene synthase active site that is moonlighting on the P450 structure. This includes signature sequences for divalent cation binding and an alpha-helical barrel. This barrel is unusual because it consists of only four helices rather than six found in all other terpene synthases. Mutagenesis establishes that this barrel is essential for the terpene synthase activity of CYP170A1 but not for the monooxygenase activity. This is the first bifunctional P450 discovered to have another active site moonlighting on it and the first time a terpene synthase active site is found moonlighting on another protein."

https://openalex.org/W2125214379,"Background Mild therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest is neuroprotective, but its effect on myocardial dysfunction that is a critical issue following resuscitation is not clear. This study sought to examine whether hypothermia and the combination of hypothermia and pharmacological postconditioning are cardioprotective in a model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation following acute myocardial ischemia. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty pigs (28–34 kg) were subjected to cardiac arrest following left anterior descending coronary artery ischemia. After 7 minutes of ventricular fibrillation and 2 minutes of basic life support, advanced cardiac life support was started according to the current AHA guidelines. After successful return of spontaneous circulation (n = 21), coronary perfusion was reestablished after 60 minutes of occlusion, and animals were randomized to either normothermia at 38°C, hypothermia at 33°C or hypothermia at 33°C combined with sevoflurane (each group n = 7) for 24 hours. The effects on cardiac damage especially on inflammation, apoptosis, and remodeling were studied using cellular and molecular approaches. Five animals were sham operated. Animals treated with hypothermia had lower troponin T levels (p<0.01), reduced infarct size (34±7 versus 57±12%; p<0.05) and improved left ventricular function compared to normothermia (p<0.05). Hypothermia was associated with a reduction in: (i) immune cell infiltration, (ii) apoptosis, (iii) IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA up-regulation, and (iv) IL-1β protein expression (p<0.05). Moreover, decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was detected in the ischemic myocardium after treatment with mild hypothermia. Sevoflurane conferred additional protective effects although statistic significance was not reached. Conclusions/Significance Hypothermia reduced myocardial damage and dysfunction after cardiopulmonary resuscitation possible via a reduced rate of apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression."
https://openalex.org/W1979087987,"cAMP is a key messenger of many hormones and neuropeptides, some of which modulate the composition of extracellular matrix. Treatment of human dermal fibroblasts with dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin antagonized the inductive effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on the expression of collagen, connective tissue growth factor, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type I, four prototypical TGF-beta-responsive genes. Increased intracellular cAMP prevented TGF-beta-induced Smad-specific gene transactivation, although TGF-beta-mediated Smad phosphorylation and nuclear translocation remained unaffected. However, increased cAMP levels abolished TGF-beta-induced interaction of Smad3 with its transcriptional co-activator cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)/p300. Overexpression of the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 rescued Smad-specific gene transcription in the presence of cAMP suggesting that sequestration of limited amounts of CBP/p300 by the activated cAMP/CREB pathway is the molecular basis of this inhibitory effect. These findings were extended by two functional assays. Increased intracellular cAMP levels suppressed the inductive activity of TGF-beta to contract mechanically unloaded collagen lattices and resulted in an attenuation of fibroblast migration of mechanically induced cell layer wounds. Of note, cAMP and TGF-beta synergistically induced hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) expression and hyaluronan secretion, presumably via putative CREB-binding sites adjacent to Smad-binding sites within the HAS2 promoter. Our findings identify the cAMP pathway as a potent but differential and promoter-specific regulator of TGF-beta-mediated effects involved in extracellular matrix homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2013643650,"Priapism is a condition of persistent penile erection in the absence of sexual excitation. Of men with sickle cell disease (SCD), 40% display priapism. The disorder is a dangerous and urgent condition, given its association with penile fibrosis and eventual erectile dysfunction. Current strategies to prevent its progression are poor because of a lack of fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms for penile fibrosis in priapism. Here we demonstrate that increased adenosine is a novel causative factor contributing to penile fibrosis in two independent animal models of priapism, adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mice and SCD transgenic mice. An important finding is that chronic reduction of adenosine by ADA enzyme therapy successfully attenuated penile fibrosis in both mouse models, indicating an essential role of increased adenosine in penile fibrosis and a novel therapeutic possibility for this serious complication. Subsequently, we identified that both mice models share a similar fibrotic gene expression profile in penile tissue (including procollagen I, TGF-beta(1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA), suggesting that they share similar signaling pathways for progression to penile fibrosis. Thus, in an effort to decipher specific cell types and underlying mechanism responsible for adenosine-mediated penile fibrosis, we purified corpus cavernosal fibroblast cells (CCFCs), the major cell type involved in this process, from wild-type mice. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the major receptor expressed in these cells is the adenosine receptor A(2B)R. Based on this fact, we further purified CCFCs from A(2B)R-deficient mice and demonstrated that A(2B)R is essential for excess adenosine-mediated penile fibrosis. Finally, we revealed that TGF-beta functions downstream of the A(2B)R to increase CCFC collagen secretion and proliferation. Overall, our studies identify an essential role of increased adenosine in the pathogenesis of penile fibrosis via A(2B)R signaling and offer a potential target for prevention and treatment of penile fibrosis, a dangerous complication seen in priapism.-Wen, J., Jiang, X., Dai, Y., Zhang, Y., Tang, Y., Sun, H., Mi, T., Phatarpekar, P.

The promoter region of GSK-3β was heavily methylated in control MSCs, but was demethylated by 5-Aza. Although overexpression of GSK-3β potently induced CM differentiation, that of GSK-3α induced markers of neuronal and chondrocyte differentiation.

These results suggest that GSK-3α and GSK-3β have distinct roles in regulating CM differentiation in BM-derived MSCs. GSK-3β in the cytosol induces CM differentiation of MSCs through down-regulation of β-catenin. In contrast, GSK-3α in the nucleus inhibits CM differentiation through down-regulation of c-Jun.

A major challenge for cardiac regeneration therapy using adult stem cells may be to enhance stem cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes.Among several important signaling mechanisms generally involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation, Wnt/β-catenin (canonical Wnt) and non-canonical Wnt signaling have been suggested to have a critical role in cardiogenesis (8.Cohen E.D.

GSK-3 phosphorylates many known intracellular targets, including β-catenin, glycogen synthase, elF2Bϵ, GATA4, myocardin, c-Jun, cyclin D1, and N-Myc, thereby regulating various cellular functions, including hypertrophy and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (16.Hirotani S.

GSK-3 has two major isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, which have 97% identical amino acids in the catalytic domain but differ substantially in the N and C termini.

For example, both GSK-3α and GSK-3β phosphorylate/degrade β-catenin in embryonic stem cells, but GSK-3α and GSK-3β play distinct roles in cardiac development in mice (18.Kerkela R. Kockeritz L.

Importantly, the isoform-specific functions of GSK-3α and GSK-3β during cardiomyocyte differentiation are not well understood in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) is a chemical analogue of cytidine that removes methyl groups from DNA, thereby inducing gene expression. 5-Aza is a potent inducer of cardiomyocyte differentiation in bone marrow-derived MSCs (20.Makino S. Fukuda K. Miyoshi S. Konishi F. Kodama H. Pan J. Sano M. Takahashi T. Hori S. Abe H. Hata J. Umezawa A. Ogawa S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). MSCs show potential for clinical application with evidence of tissue regeneration, including myocardial regeneration (21.Hare J.M. Chaparro S.V. Curr. Opin. Organ Transplant. 2008; 13: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We reasoned that by studying the function of signaling molecules modulated during cardiac differentiation, we should be able to elucidate the signaling mechanisms involved in stimulating cardiomyocyte differentiation in adult stem cells. Through initial screening of signaling molecules modulated by 5-Aza during cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs, we found that GSK-3 plays an important role in regulating this process.Thus, the goals in this study were to elucidate whether GSK-3α/β is affected during differentiation of MSCs into the cardiomyocyte lineage in response to 5-Aza treatment, and if so, to examine whether modulation of GSK-3 plays a causative role in mediating cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs. Furthermore, we evaluated whether GSK-3α and GSK-3β play distinct roles in mediating cardiomyocyte differentiation and whether regulation of β-catenin is involved in modulation of cardiomyocyte differentiation by GSK-3α/β.DISCUSSIONExpression of GSK-3 remains low when MSCs are uncommitted. However, GSK-3β is up-regulated when cardiomyocyte differentiation of MSCs is initiated by 5-Aza. Furthermore, up-regulation of GSK-3β is both necessary and sufficient for cardiomyocyte differentiation initiated by 5-Aza in MSCs. Unexpectedly, down-regulation, rather than up-regulation, of endogenous GSK-3α stimulated cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs. These results suggest that GSK-3β is an endogenous regulator of MSC differentiation and that GSK-3α and GSK-3β have opposite effects upon cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs.5-Aza is a cytosine analogue and a demethylating agent that induces changes in chromatin structure, gene expression, cellular morphology, and survival in mammalian cells. Because phosphorylation of GSK-3β is not significantly affected by 5-Aza, 5-Aza must increase the total activity of GSK-3β primarily through up-regulation of GSK-3β mRNA. The promoter region of GSK-3β contains a prominent CpG island that is methylated in unstimulated MSCs, suggesting that 5-Aza induces up-regulation of GSK-3β through epigenetic modification of the promoter. Because GSK-3β stabilizes DNA methyltransferases, 5-Aza may initiate a positive feedback loop of GSK-3β promoter demethylation (28.Sun L. Zhao H. Xu Z. Liu Q. Liang Y. Wang L. Cai X. Zhang L. Hu L. Wang G. Zha X. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At present, whether or not demethylation of the GSK-3β promoter is an endogenous mechanism for differentiation of adult stem cells into the cardiomyocyte lineage remains to be elucidated. In any event, GSK-3β may substitute for 5-Aza for induction of cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs, because clinical use of 5-Aza would be limited due to its nonspecific effects and obvious teratogenic actions.GSK-3β is a central component of the Wnt pathway and negatively regulates β-catenin through phosphorylation-dependent proteolytic degradation (29.Hardt S.E. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that stimulation and inhibition of the Wnt signaling mechanism affect cardiomyocyte differentiation (8.Cohen E.D. Tian Y. Morrisey E.E. Development. 2008; 135: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), up-regulation of GSK-3β induced cardiomyocyte markers more strongly than stimulation of either the canonical or non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways with Wnt3a and Wnt11, respectively. Because down-regulation of β-catenin alone also potently induces cardiomyocyte markers, modulating downstream components of the Wnt signaling pathway may induce cardiomyocyte differentiation more efficiently than stimulating the Wnt pathways at the receptor level.It should be noted that GSK-3β not only regulates the Wnt pathway but also modulates a wide variety of signaling pathways, including other signaling cascades known to regulate stem cell differentiation, such as the Notch (30.Foltz D.R. Santiago M.C. Berechid B.E. Nye J.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1006-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and Hedgehog (31.Jia J. Amanai K. Wang G. Tang J. Wang B. Jiang J. Nature. 2002; 416: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) pathways. Thus, up-regulation of GSK-3β may have a broader effect than selective stimulation of the Wnt pathway by the Wnt receptor ligand.Increasing lines of evidence suggest that GSK-3α and GSK-3β have distinct cellular functions, despite the fact that they share 97% identity in their kinase domains and 36% identity overall. Our results suggest that GSK-3α and GSK-3β have distinct effects upon cardiomyocyte differentiation. Up-regulation of GSK-3β has a stronger effect upon cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs than up-regulation of GSK-3α. Although overexpression of GSK-3α slightly induces expression of cardiomyocyte markers, this effect may be mediated through promiscuous phosphorylation of GSK-3β substrates due to overexpression. In fact, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GSK-3α substantially altered subcellular localization of GSK-3α in MSCs (see below). Importantly, although down-regulation of GSK-3β inhibited 5-Aza-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation, down-regulation of GSK-3α stimulated cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs. Previous studies have suggested that GSK-3α and GSK-3β could differentially affect cardiac development. Although GSK-3β knock-out mice exhibit cardiac defects consisting of malformation of the cardiac outflow tract and markedly thickened ventricular walls, contributing to their early mortality, GSK-3α knock-out mice show no significant cardiac defects (18.Kerkela R. Kockeritz L. Macaulay K. Zhou J. Doble B.W. Beahm C. Greytak S. Woulfe K. Trivedi C.M. Woodgett J.R. Epstein J.A. Force T. Huggins G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3609-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the fact that GSK-3α and GSK-3β have opposite effects upon differentiation of stem cells has not been shown previously.One possible explanation for the potential difference in their functions is that GSK-3α and GSK-3β exist in distinct subcellular localizations. For example, in adult mouse hearts, GSK-3α is localized primarily in the nucleus, whereas GSK-3β exists primarily in the cytosol (17.Matsuda T. Zhai P. Maejima Y. Hong C. Gao S. Tian B. Goto K. Takagi H. Tamamori-Adachi M. Kitajima S. Sadoshima J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20900-20905Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). GSK-3α localized in the nucleus phosphorylates and induces nuclear exit/proteolytic degradation of G1 cyclins, whereas endogenous GSK-3β localized in the cytosol does not induce nuclear exit of G1 cyclins in the mouse heart (17.Matsuda T. Zhai P. Maejima Y. Hong C. Gao S. Tian B. Goto K. Takagi H. Tamamori-Adachi M. Kitajima S. Sadoshima J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20900-20905Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of the GSK-3 isoforms suggest that GSK-3α is localized primarily in the nucleus, and GSK-3β primarily in the cytosol but also in the nucleus in MSCs. Forced expression of GSK-3β in the nucleus did not induce cardiomyocyte differentiation, whereas overexpression of GSK-3α induces cytosolic expression of GSK-3α and partially stimulates cardiomyocyte differentiation. We therefore speculate that endogenous GSK-3β more efficiently phosphorylates β-catenin in the cytosol, thereby inducing efficient proteolytic degradation, whereas endogenous GSK-3α primarily localized in the nucleus may regulate other targets, presumably transcription factors. Because GSK-3α and GSK-3β equally affect expression of β-catenin in some cell types, such as ES cells (19.Force T. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9643-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32.MacAulay K. Doble B.W. Patel S. Hansotia T. Sinclair E.M. Drucker D.J. Nagy A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we speculate that subcellular localization of GSK-3α/β may be cell type- or developmental stage-dependent.Importantly, up-regulation of GSK-3β and down-regulation of GSK-3α have additive effects upon cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs, consistent with the notion that they mediate cardiomyocyte differentiation through distinct cellular mechanisms. Our results suggest that down-regulation of β-catenin plays an important role in mediating the effect of GSK-3β upon MSC differentiation into the cardiomyocyte lineage. On the other hand, down-regulation of GSK-3α induces cardiomyocyte differentiation through up-regulation of c-Jun in MSCs. Because GSK-3 phosphorylates β-catenin and c-Jun (19.Force T. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9643-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33.Wei W. Jin J. Schlisio S. Harper J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), thereby stimulating their degradation, it is likely that GSK-3β in the cytosol may phosphorylate β-catenin, whereas GSK-3α in the nucleus may phosphorylate c-Jun, thereby regulating cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs (supplemental Fig. S7). Interventions to selectively stimulate GSK-3β or inhibit GSK-3α may be considered independently or in combination with other methods to facilitate cardiomyocyte differentiation of MSCs for cell-based therapy in vivo.We have successfully engineered MSCs that conditionally express GSK-3β through either withdrawal or application of Dox. Phasic modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling mechanism effectively stimulates differentiation of progenitor cells into the cardiomyocyte lineage (10.Ueno S. Weidinger G. Osugi T. Kohn A.D.

Thus, it would be interesting to test whether ex vivo engineered MSCs, in which the timing of expression of GSK-3β can be regulated by Dox treatment, enhance the efficacy of cell therapy in vivo.

Organ Transplant. 2008; 13: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We reasoned that by studying the function of signaling molecules modulated during cardiac differentiation, we should be able to elucidate the signaling mechanisms involved in stimulating cardiomyocyte differentiation in adult stem cells. Through initial screening of signaling molecules modulated by 5-Aza during cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs, we found that GSK-3 plays an important role in regulating this process.Thus, the goals in this study were to elucidate whether GSK-3α/β is affected during differentiation of MSCs into the cardiomyocyte lineage in response to 5-Aza treatment, and if so, to examine whether modulation of GSK-3 plays a causative role in mediating cardiomyocyte differentiation in MSCs. Furthermore, we evaluated whether GSK-3α and GSK-3β play distinct roles in mediating cardiomyocyte differentiation and whether regulation of β-catenin is involved in modulation of cardiomyocyte differentiation by GSK-3α/β."

The cytoplasmic delivery of the proteolytically active component of LeTx, lethal factor (LF), is carried out by the transporter component, protective antigen, which interacts with either of two known surface receptors known as anthrax toxin receptor (ANTXR) 1 and 2. We found that the cytoplasmic delivery of LF by ANTXR2 was mediated by cathepsin B (CTSB) and required lysosomal fusion with LeTx-containing endosomes. Also, binding of protective antigen to ANXTR1 or -2 triggered autophagy, which facilitated the cytoplasmic delivery of ANTXR2-associated LF. We found that whereas cells treated with the membrane-permeable CTSB inhibitor CA074-Me- or CTSB-deficient cells had no defect in fusion of LC3-containing autophagic vacuoles with lysosomes, autophagic flux was significantly delayed. These results suggested that the ANTXR2-mediated cytoplasmic delivery of LF was enhanced by CTSB-dependent autophagic flux.

https://openalex.org/W2030539878,"Background [FeFe] hydrogenases are metalloenzymes involved in the anaerobic metabolism of H2. These proteins are distinguished by an active site cofactor known as the H-cluster. This unique [6Fe–6S] complex contains multiple non-protein moieties and requires several maturation enzymes for its assembly. The pathways and biochemical precursors for H-cluster biosynthesis have yet to be elucidated. Principal Findings We report an in vitro maturation system in which, for the first time, chemical additives enhance [FeFe] hydrogenase activation, thus signifying in situ H-cluster biosynthesis. The maturation system is comprised of purified hydrogenase apoprotein; a dialyzed Escherichia coli cell lysate containing heterologous HydE, HydF, and HydG maturases; and exogenous small molecules. Following anaerobic incubation of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HydA1 apohydrogenase with S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), cysteine, tyrosine, iron, sulfide, and the non-purified maturases, hydrogenase activity increased 5-fold relative to incubations without the exogenous substrates. No conditions were identified in which addition of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) improved hydrogenase maturation. Significance The in vitro system allows for direct investigation of [FeFe] hydrogenase activation. This work also provides a foundation for studying the biosynthetic mechanisms of H-cluster biosynthesis using solely purified enzymes and chemical additives."
https://openalex.org/W2094922769,"Prionopathies are characterized by spongiform brain degeneration, myoclonia, dementia, and periodic electroencephalographic (EEG) disturbances. The hallmark of prioniopathies is the presence of an abnormal conformational isoform (PrP(sc)) of the natural cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) encoded by the Prnp gene. Although several roles have been attributed to PrP(c), its putative functions in neuronal excitability are unknown. Although early studies of the behavior of Prnp knockout mice described minor changes, later studies report altered behavior. To date, most functional PrP(c) studies on synaptic plasticity have been performed in vitro. To our knowledge, only one electrophysiological study has been performed in vivo in anesthetized mice, by Curtis and coworkers. They reported no significant differences in paired-pulse facilitation or LTP in the CA1 region after Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway stimulation.Here we explore the role of PrP(c) expression in neurotransmission and neural excitability using wild-type, Prnp -/- and PrP(c)-overexpressing mice (Tg20 strain). By correlating histopathology with electrophysiology in living behaving mice, we demonstrate that both Prnp -/- mice but, more relevantly Tg20 mice show increased susceptibility to KA, leading to significant cell death in the hippocampus. This finding correlates with enhanced synaptic facilitation in paired-pulse experiments and hippocampal LTP in living behaving mutant mice. Gene expression profiling using Illumina microarrays and Ingenuity pathways analysis showed that 129 genes involved in canonical pathways such as Ubiquitination or Neurotransmission were co-regulated in Prnp -/- and Tg20 mice. Lastly, RT-qPCR of neurotransmission-related genes indicated that subunits of GABA(A) and AMPA-kainate receptors are co-regulated in both Prnp -/- and Tg20 mice.Present results demonstrate that PrP(c) is necessary for the proper homeostatic functioning of hippocampal circuits, because of its relationships with GABA(A) and AMPA-Kainate neurotransmission. New PrP(c) functions have recently been described, which point to PrP(c) as a target for putative therapies in Alzheimer's disease. However, our results indicate that a ""gain of function"" strategy in Alzheimer's disease, or a ""loss of function"" in prionopathies, may impair PrP(c) function, with devastating effects. In conclusion, we believe that present data should be taken into account in the development of future therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2132578047,"The skin carries a number of appendages, including hair follicles and a range of glands, which develop under the influence of EDAR signalling. A gain of function allele of EDAR is found at high frequency in human populations of East Asia, with genetic evidence suggesting recent positive selection at this locus. The derived EDAR allele, estimated to have reached fixation more than 10,000 years ago, causes thickening of hair fibres, but the full spectrum of phenotypic changes induced by this allele is unknown. We have examined the changes in glandular structure caused by elevation of Edar signalling in a transgenic mouse model. We find that sebaceous and Meibomian glands are enlarged and that salivary and mammary glands are more elaborately branched with increased Edar activity, while the morphology of eccrine sweat and tracheal submucosal glands appears to be unaffected. Similar changes to gland sizes and structures may occur in human populations carrying the derived East Asian EDAR allele. As this allele attained high frequency in an environment that was notably cold and dry, increased glandular secretions could represent a trait that was positively selected to achieve increased lubrication and reduced evaporation from exposed facial structures and upper airways."
https://openalex.org/W1964273312,"A Phase Ia trial in European volunteers of the candidate vaccine merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3), a Plasmodium falciparum blood stage membrane, showed that it induces biologically active antibodies able to achieve parasite killing in vitro, while a phase Ib trial in semi-immune adult volunteers in Burkina Faso confirmed that the vaccine was safe. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in children aged 12-24 months living in malaria endemic area of Burkina Faso.The study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose escalation phase Ib trial, designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of three doses of either 15 or 30 microg of MSP3-LSP adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide in 45 children 12 to 24 months of age randomized into three equal groups. Each group received 3 vaccine doses (on days 0, 28 and 56) of either 15 microg of MSP3-LSP, 30 microg of MSP3-LSP or of the Engerix B hepatitis B vaccine. Children were visited at home daily for the 6 days following each vaccination to solicit symptoms which might be related to vaccination. Serious adverse events occurring during the study period (1 year) were recorded. Antibody responses to MSP3-LSP were measured on days 0, 28, 56 and 84.All 45 enrolled children received three MSP3 vaccine doses. No serious adverse events were reported. Most of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity. The only reported local symptoms with grade 3 severity were swelling and induration, with an apparently dose related response. All grade 3 adverse events resolved without any sequelae. Both MSP3 doses regimens were able to elicit high levels of anti-MSP3 specific IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies in the volunteers with very little or no increase in IgG2, IgG4 and IgM classes: i.e. vaccination induced predominantly the isotypes involved in the monocyte-dependent mechanism of P. falciparum parasite-killing.Our results support the promise of MSP3-LSP as a malaria vaccine candidate, both in terms of tolerability and of immunogenicity. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is recommended.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00452088."
https://openalex.org/W2001327213,"Background During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep synchronous neural oscillations between neural silence (down state) and neural activity (up state) occur. Sleep Slow Oscillations (SSOs) events are their EEG correlates. Each event has an origin site and propagates sweeping the scalp. While recent findings suggest a SSO key role in memory consolidation processes, the structure and the propagation of individual SSO events, as well as their modulation by sleep stages and cortical areas have not been well characterized so far. Methodology/Principal Findings We detected SSO events in EEG recordings and we defined and measured a set of features corresponding to both wave shapes and event propagations. We found that a typical SSO shape has a transition to down state, which is steeper than the following transition from down to up state. We show that during SWS SSOs are larger and more locally synchronized, but less likely to propagate across the cortex, compared to NREM stage 2. Also, the detection number of SSOs as well as their amplitudes and slopes, are greatest in the frontal regions. Although derived from a small sample, this characterization provides a preliminary reference about SSO activity in healthy subjects for 32-channel sleep recordings. Conclusions/Significance This work gives a quantitative picture of spontaneous SSO activity during NREM sleep: we unveil how SSO features are modulated by sleep stage, site of origin and detection location of the waves. Our measures on SSOs shape indicate that, as in animal models, onsets of silent states are more synchronized than those of neural firing. The differences between sleep stages could be related to the reduction of arousal system activity and to the breakdown of functional connectivity. The frontal SSO prevalence could be related to a greater homeostatic need of the heteromodal association cortices."
https://openalex.org/W3125670220,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts via 7 transmembrane region receptors on gonadotrophs to stimulate synthesis and secretion of the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. It is secreted in pulses, and its effects depend on pulse frequency, but decoding mechanisms are unknown. Here we have used (nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 (NFAT2)-emerald fluorescent protein) to monitor GnRH signaling. Increasing [Ca(2+)](i) causes calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation, a response involving proteins (calmodulins and NFATs) that decode frequency in other systems. Using live cell imaging, pulsatile GnRH caused dose- and frequency-dependent increases in nuclear NFAT2-emerald fluorescent protein, and at low frequency, translocation simply tracked GnRH exposure (albeit with slower kinetics). At high frequency (30-min intervals), failure to return to basal conditions before repeat stimulation caused integrative tracking, illustrating how the relative dynamics of up- and downstream signals can increase efficiency of GnRH action. Mathematical modeling predicted desensitization of GnRH effects on [Ca(2+)](i) and that desensitization would increase with dose, frequency, and receptor number, but no such desensitization was seen in HeLa and/or LbetaT2 cells possibly because pulsatile GnRH did not reduce receptor expression (measured by immunofluorescence). GnRH also caused dose- and frequency-dependent activation of alphaGSU, luteinizing hormone beta, and follicle-stimulating hormone beta luciferase reporters, effects that were blocked by calcineurin inhibition. Pulsatile GnRH also activated an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter, but this response was directly related to cumulative pulse duration. This together with the lack of desensitization of translocation responses suggests that NFAT may mediate GnRH action but is not a genuine decoder of GnRH pulse frequency."

Expression of the corresponding GALT-1 protein in insect cells was used to demonstrate a manganese-dependent galactosyltransferase activity. In vitro, the GALT-1 enzyme showed strong selectivity for acceptors with alpha1,6-linked N-glycan core fucosides and required Golgi- dependent modifications on the oligosaccharide antennae for optimal synthesis of the Gal-beta1,4-fucose structure.

GluR1 is also modulated in parallel by multiprotein complexes coordinated by synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) that contain A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150), protein kinase A, and protein phosphatase 2B. Here we show that SAP97 is present in CaMKII immune complexes isolated from rodent brain as well as from HEK293 cells co-expressing CaMKIIα and SAP97. CaMKIIα phosphorylated recombinant SAP97 within immune complexes in vitro and in intact cells. Four alternative mRNA splice variants of SAP97 expressing combinations of four inserts (I2, I3, I4, I5) in the U5 region between Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylyl kinase-like (GK) domains were identified in rat brain at postnatal day 21. CaMKIIα preferentially phosphorylated a full-length SAP97 and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the I3 and I5 inserts (SAP97-I3I5 and GST-SH3-I3I5-GK, respectively) and also specifically interacted with GST-SH3-I3I5-GK compared with GST proteins containing other naturally occurring insert combinations. AKAP79/150 also directly and specifically bound only to GST-SH3-I3I5-GK, but CaMKII phosphorylation of GST-SH3-I3I5-GK prevented this interaction. AKAP79-dependent down-regulation of GluR1 AMPAR currents was ablated by overexpression of SAP97-I2I5 (which does not bind AKAP79) or by infusion of active CaMKIIα. Collectively, the data suggest that CaMKIIα targets a specific SAP97 splice variant to disengage AKAP79/150 from regulating GluR1 AMPARs, providing new insight into protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation events that are required for normal regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, learning, and memory.

In general, phosphorylation of these sites by CaMKII or protein kinase C (PKC) and by protein kinase A (PKA), respectively, directly enhances AMPAR activity and is required for long term potentiation, whereas long term depression requires dephosphorylation of these sites mediated by protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) and/or protein phosphatase 1.

In contrast, CaMKII phosphorylation of Ser-232 in the first PDZ domain may modulate binding of other proteins, such as NMDA receptor subunits (23Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C.

Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1032-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the precise relationship between splicing and phosphorylation in controlling SAP97 function is unclear.Emerging studies are beginning to illustrate the importance of CaMKII assembly with specific substrates in modulating downstream signaling events (36Okamoto K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 9210-9216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we show that CaMKII associates with SAP97 in the brain and preferentially phosphorylates a specific SAP97 splice variant of the U5 region. AKAP79/150 also preferentially interacts with this splice variant, but CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation disrupts the interaction. Moreover, CaMKII disrupts AKAP79-dependent regulation of GluR1 AMPARs, which relies on Ser-845 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Our findings provide new insights into the modulation of protein-protein interactions that are required for normal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.DISCUSSIONThe present studies show that SAP97 is associated with CaMKII in the brain and define new functional relationships between CaMKII, AKAP79/150, and GluR1 that appear to be coordinated by a single mRNA splice variant of the U5 region of SAP97. Four SAP97 variants were identified in mRNA isolated from rat hippocampus at postnatal day 21, with U5 regions containing different combinations of the I2, I3, and I5 inserts along with full-length or truncated versions of the I4 insert (Fig. 5). The I4s insert appears to arise from use of alternative cryptic splice acceptor sites (see the supplemental information for a discussion). Multiple splice variants in this region of the human and mouse SAP97 mRNAs are documented in SWISS-PROT and other databases. However, only one rat mRNA splice variant is listed (I2I5I4s) even though multiple rat variants have been described in the literature (30Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S.

It is likely that additional rat splice variants can be expressed because we did not detect a variant containing only an I2 insert even though this variant has been identified in human mRNA pools (Q811DO). It should also be noted that splice variants of SAP97 in the U1 domain and at the extreme N terminus have also been identified (32McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol.

It will be interesting to investigate whether splicing is coordinated to link certain combinations of N- and C-terminal inserts. Moreover, given the functional differences (see below), it will be important to investigate the cellular specificity and relative abundance of splice variant expression in addition to potential changes during development and in disease processes.Using a combination of in vitro and heterologous cell experiments with protein fragments and full-length proteins (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 6 and supplemental Fig. S1), we found that autophosphorylated CaMKII forms a stable complex with SAP97. Activated CaMKII can directly and selectively interact with the C-terminal SH3-I3I5-GK domains in vitro, and a complex of CaMKII with the SH3-I3I5-GK domains can be co-immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293 cells. The intact N-terminal “half” of SAP97 also associates with CaMKII in HEK293 cells, presumably explaining the lack of selectivity for CaMKII co-immunoprecipitation with full-length U5 region splice variants. However, we were unable to detect substantial direct interactions of purified CaMKII with isolated domains from the N-terminal portion of SAP97 in vitro. Thus, the association of CaMKII with the N-terminal half of SAP97 may be mediated by another protein present in HEK cells. Alternatively, longer contiguous segments of the N-terminal portion of SAP97 may be required for direct interaction. Additional studies will be required to dissect the molecular basis for CaMKII interaction with N-terminal domain(s) in SAP97. Nevertheless, the selective interaction of CaMKII with C-terminal domains of the I3I5-containing variant may confer unique regulatory properties.Demonstration of a direct interaction between activated CaMKII and the SH3-I3I5-GK domains means that SAP97 can be added to the growing list of cellular proteins that can interact with CaMKII (for review, see Ref. 6Colbran R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Some proteins favor interaction with activated forms of CaMKII, whereas others prefer inactive forms. By this criterion, the C-terminal fragment of SAP97-I3I5 appears to fit in the former group, which includes the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, densin, and the β2a and β1b subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (41Strack S.

NR2B, β2a, and β1b contain a conserved CaMKII binding domain (Kd = 0.1–0.2 μm CaMKII subunit) with amino acid sequence similarity to the autoinhibitory domain of CaMKII itself (46Bayer K.U.

Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25061-25064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The U5 region of SAP97-I3I5 has no detectable amino acid sequence similarity to any previously identified CaMKII binding domain. However, the binding sites for SAP97 and NR2B in the CaMKII catalytic domain may partially overlap (supplemental Fig. S3) even though the differential effects of Ca2+/calmodulin and nucleotide on binding of nonphosphorylated kinase to GST-SH3-I3I5-GK and GST-NR2B suggest unique aspects to these interactions. Additional studies will be required to understand the structural basis for CaMKII interactions with these CaMKII-associated proteins.Previous studies defining the interaction of AKAP79/150-PKA-PP2B complexes with C-terminal domains of SAP97 did not examine the impact of alternative splicing. Our findings significantly extend these studies by demonstrating that the SAP97-I3I5 variant is specifically involved (Fig. 8). In a well established HEK293 cell model for AKAP79-dependent regulation of GluR1-AMPARs via endogenous SAP97 (8Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48796-48802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we showed that overexpression of SAP97-I2I5 functioned as a dominant negative protein to disrupt AKAP79-dependent rundown of AMPAR currents (Fig. 9A), whereas overexpression of SAP97-I3I5 had no significant effect on AMPAR rundown. These data may be explained by the apparent predominance of SAP97 variants containing the I3 insert in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S4). Notably, SAP97-I3I5 is selectively trafficked to dendritic spines in neurons, whereas variants containing I2 are typically localized to cytosolic/perinuclear/nuclear compartments (29Roberts S. Calautti E. Vanderweil S. Nguyen H.O. Foley A. Baden H.P. Viel A. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In combination, these data suggest a unique role for SAP97-I3I5 in regulation of synaptic AMPARs.In addition to CaMKII and AKAP79/150, C-terminal domains of SAP97-I3I5 selectively interact with the Band 4.1 actin-binding protein (33Lue R.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34445-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Splicing in the U5 region also modulates intramolecular SAP97 domain interactions that can interfere with the binding to other targeting proteins (30Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The apparently unique properties conferred by I3 may result from differences in the isoelectric point (pI) of the U5 region. Whereas the I3I5 insert combination has an overall pI of 6.49, the pI values of other U5 splicing inserts examined here range from 4.6 to 4.9. Thus, we hypothesize that the unique lack of acidity in the U5 region of SAP97-I3I5 contributes to the selectivity of the entire C-terminal half for binding CaMKII, AKAP79/150, and Band 4.1.Proteins that form stable complexes with CaMKII are often good substrates (46Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 47Grueter C.E. Abiria S.A. Dzhura I. Wu Y. Ham A.J. Mohler P.J. Anderson M.E.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, SAP97-I3I5 is selectively phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro in the context of full-length protein (Fig. 7A) and can be phosphorylated by co-precipitating CaMKII (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a post hoc (back) phosphorylation assay showed that relative to an internal “dephosphorylated” control, SAP97-I3I5 is ≈50% phosphorylated at CaMKII sites even in the absence of co-expressed CaMKIIα in HEK293 cells, perhaps due to the activities of endogenous CaMKII isoforms or other kinases that target the same sites. However, co-expression of CaMKIIα significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of SAP97-I3I5 in intact cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, our data suggest that CaMKII associates with and selectively phosphorylates SAP97-I3I5 in intact cells.CaMKII was shown to phosphorylate Ser-39 and Ser-232 but not C-terminal domains of SAP97 (22Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but we found that the known sites were poorly phosphorylated under our conditions in the context of both full-length SAP97-I3I5 mutants and isolated L27 and PDZ1/2 domains. GST-SH3-I3I5-GK was a substantially better in vitro substrate for CaMKII than GST fusion proteins containing the other U5 variants (Fig. 7C). CaMKII can phosphorylate at least three Ser/Thr residues in GST-SH3-I3I5-GK based on a maximal phosphorylation stoichiometry of ≈2.6 mol/mol. In fact, the U5 region of the I3I5 splice variant contains 11 serines and 4 threonines. Deletion of the I3 insert removes 5 of the Ser/Thr residues and reduces the phosphorylation stoichiometry by ≈33% (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that the I3 insert can be phosphorylated at 1 or more residues. Residual phosphorylation of the artificial GST-SH3-I5-GK variant (≈1.5 mol/mol) must occur at sites present in the C-terminal domains of the other natural SAP97 variants. Nevertheless, GST-SH3-U5-GK proteins containing other natural splice variants (I2I5, I2I5I4, or I2I5I4s) are rather poor CaMKII substrates (stoichiometries of <0.1 mol/mol). Thus, the I2 and/or I4 inserts appears to interfere with CaMKII phosphorylation of the conserved sites in the U5 domain, presumably due to changes in amino acid sequences surrounding Ser/Thr residues that are located close to splice insert junctions.CaMKII phosphorylation of SAP97-I3I5 will reduce the pI of the U5 region closer to that of the other U5 region variants, perhaps explaining why phosphorylation of GST-SH3-I3I5-GK essentially abrogated AKAP79/150 binding (Fig. 8). This suggests that CaMKII can uncouple AKAP79/150 from SAP97-I3I5 in cells. Indeed, our electrophysiological studies using an S831A-GluR1 mutant (to avoid confounding effects of CaMKII via direct phosphorylation at Ser-831) showed that infusion of constitutively active CaMKII abrogated the rundown of AMPAR currents (Fig. 9B).

Poor outcomes with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have been previously shown in Indian women compared to Caucasian women, and some evidence suggests that poor embryo quality may be a cause for the discrepancy. In our center, only patients with the highest quality cleavage stage embryos are considered eligible for extending embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. We compared live birth rates (LBR) between Indian and Caucasian women after blastocyst transfer to investigate whether differences in IVF outcomes between these ethnicities would persist in patients who transferred similar quality embryos.In this retrospective cohort analysis, we compared IVF outcome between 145 Caucasians and 80 Indians who had a blastocyst transfer between January 1, 2005 and June 31, 2007 in our university center. Indians were younger than Caucasians by 2.7 years (34.03 vs. 36.71, P = 0.03), were more likely to have an agonist down regulation protocol (68% vs. 43%, P<0.01), and were more likely to have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), although not significant, (24% vs. 14%, P = 0.06). Sixty eight percent of Indian patients had the highest quality embryos (4AB blastocyst or better) transferred compared to 71% of the Caucasians (P = 0.2). LBR was significantly lower in the Indians compared to the Caucasians (24% vs. 41%, P<0.01) with an odds ratio of 0.63, (95%CI 0.46-0.86). Controlling for age, stimulation protocol and PCOS showed persistently lower LBR with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.56, (95%CI 0.40-0.79) in the multivariate analysis.Despite younger age and similar embryo quality, Indians had a significantly lower LBR than Caucasians. In this preliminary study, poor prognosis after IVF for Indian ethnicity persisted despite limiting analysis to patients with high quality embryos transferred. Further investigation into explanations for ethnic differences in reproduction is needed."

Normal corneas of three other strains, the nu/nu, 129E, and Black Swiss mice, showed in most parameters intermediate phenotypes. FGF-2−/− mice showed significantly less preexisting lymphatics than control (P= 0.009), which suggests a role for this GF in lymphatic development. VEGF-A-induced corneal lymphangiogenic response was significantly higher in BALB/c mice (P=0.03), but it did not differ significantly in C57BL/6 mice, when compared to PBS-implanted control. FGFR-3 expression was higher in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mice, which suggests GF-receptor heterogeneity as a possible explanation for strain-dependent differences. The heterogeneity of preexisting lymphatic vessels in the limbal area significantly correlated with the extent of corneal lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-A r=0.7, P=0.01;FGF-2: r=0.96, P=10−5) in BALB/c but not in C57BL/6 mice. Removal of conjunctival lymphatics did not affect GF-induced lymphangiogenesis. This work introduces physiological expression of lymphatics without blood vessels, which indicates that angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, even though intricately related, may occur independently.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Subsequent translocation of the Impα·Impβ cargo complex through the NPC is believed to be mediated by weak hydrophobic interactions between Impβ and nucleoporins (8.Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). On the nuclear side of the NPC, RanGTP dislodges Impβ from the complex (9.Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The Impα IBB domain then competes with the NLS for the binding site, facilitating the release of the NLS cargo into the nucleus (7.Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10.Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol.

Impα cargo dissociation is further assisted by the high affinity binding of cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS) protein to NLS-free Impα. CAS is a carrier protein that drives Impα export in association with RanGTP (11.Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Both the RanGTP·Impβ and RanGTP·CAS·Impα complexes translocate back to the cytoplasm (12.Bischoff F.R. Görlich D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13.Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), where they disassemble so that transport receptors can be recycled for another round of import. The asymmetric distribution of RanGTP between nucleus and cytoplasm provides the driving force leading to unidirectional cargo transport (14.Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This complex protein import mechanism is governed by the precise tuning of interactions between the various species that ensure its characteristic efficient unidirectional rate. A thorough description of nuclear import thus requires a quantitative analysis of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects involved in these mechanisms. In particular, the NLS-Impα binding affinity is an important determinant of how efficiently cargo is transported into the nucleus. Indeed, recent models suggest that nuclear import rates are largely governed by the level of the NLS receptor Impα (15.Riddick G. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Concerning the thermodynamics of the process, a few reports based on in vitro-purified and -isolated proteins provided the binding affinity between different molecular components of the system (7.Fanara P.

High affinity interactions were shown between certain components of the nuclear import pathway (e.g. dissociation constant KD ≈ 40 nm for NLS-Impα binding (10.Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R.

On the other hand, a recently published analysis of import kinetics in living yeast cells (17.Timney B.L. Tetenbaum-Novatt J. Agate D.S. Williams R. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) showed that the import machinery carries NLS cargo molecules into the nucleus at very low rates, a result that conflicts with the nanomolar dissociation constant values between the karyopherin (analogous of the mammalian importin) and the NLS; the same authors reported 20–100 nm KD values based on in vitro assays. Moreover, no saturation of import rates was observed, despite NLS cargoes being >20-fold more abundant than their carriers. In this article, we address the intriguing discrepancy that we believe is related to the peculiar conditions of the complex environment present in living cells. We analyze both thermodynamics and kinetics of the import process in living mammalian cell lines. A few high resolution imaging techniques are exploited to quantitatively study the nuclear import process, namely fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). FRAP is used to measure cargo import kinetics and yields an estimate of the NLS-Impα equilibrium constant in living cells. Indeed, FRAP allows one to monitor dynamic processes without perturbing their biochemical steady state because the latter does not depend on the emissive properties of the monitored probe. In the supplemental equations 1–19, we illustrate the mathematical model used to describe the nucleocytoplasmic exchange in the presence of both passive and active transport through the nuclear envelope. We shall refer to this model for the analysis of FRAP data presented in this study. FLIM allows the quantitative intracellular monitoring of the binding interactions encompassing Impα and NLS-bound cargo. Both FRAP and FLIM lead to NLS-Impα affinity values in the micromolar range, different from available in vitro estimates. We argue that the micromolar range actually characterizes complex formation in the cytoplasm and regulates nuclear import rates in living cells. Our experiments also support a model of nuclear import regulation mediated by the intrasteric IBB sequence in Impα and provide the first estimate of the autoinhibition energy in a living cell. Cloning of the EGFP, EBFP-EGFP (GFP2), NLS-EGFP, and NLS-EBFP-EGFP (NLS-GFP2) constructs used in this study was described in detail in a previous report (20.Cardarelli F. Serresi M. Bizzarri R. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 1313-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector encoding for NLS-mCherry fusion protein was generated in two steps. First, the mCherry template (generous gift of Roger Y. Tsien's laboratory) was amplified by PCR. The primers used (Sigma-Genosys) were 5′-CCC AAG CTT GGG ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG-3′ and 5′-CCG GAA TTC CGG TTA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC-3′. Second, the mCherry template was inserted into HindIII-EcoRI sites of the NLS-EGFP pcDNA3 template (20.Cardarelli F. Serresi M. Bizzarri R. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 1313-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EGFP-Impα plasmid (mouse full-length mNPI2) was kindly provided by Yoshihiro Yoneda (Department of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University). Detail about the plasmid can be found in Ref. 21.Miyamoto Y. Hieda M. Harreman M.T. Fukumoto M. Saiwaki T. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5833-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. CHO-K1 were purchased from ATCC (CCL-61) and were grown in Ham's F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and in 5% CO2. HeLa cells (CCL-2, ATCC) and U2OS cells (HTB-96, ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (10 units/ml), and streptomycin (10 μg/ml), at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were carried out by using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For live imaging, 10 × 104 cells were plated 24 h before experiments onto 35-mm glass bottom dishes (WillCo-dish GWSt-3522). Cell fluorescence was measured using a Leica TCS SP2 inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany) interfaced with an Ar laser for excitation at 458, 476, 488, and 514 nm and with a helium-neon laser for excitation at 561 and 633 nm. Glass bottom Petri dishes containing transfected cells were mounted in a temperature-controlled chamber at 37 °C (Leica Microsystems) and viewed with a 40 × 1.25 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). Images were collected at low excitation power and monitoring emission by means of the Acousto-Optical beam splitter (AOBS) detection system of the confocal microscope. The following collection ranges were adopted: 500–550 nm (EGFP) and 580–650 nm (mCherry). Background signal was subtracted in all images. The global concentrations of intracellular EGFP- and mCherry-linked proteins were determined by using the synthetic adduct fluorescein-glycine (“F-Gly”). F-Gly was obtained by reaction of the succinimidyl ester derivative of fluorescein (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) and glycine (Sigma) in citrate buffer at pH 9. The fluorescence signal of known phosphate-buffered saline solutions of F-Gly was collected under the microscope using EGFP acquisition settings. Fluorescence counts were converted into absolute concentration values taking into account the difference in brightness (molar absorption times fluorescence quantum yield) between EGFP (or mCherry) and F-Gly. Each FRAP experiment started with a four-time line-averaged image (pre-bleach) of the cell followed by a single-point bleach (nonscanning) near the center of the nucleus with laser pulse at full power to photobleach most of the nuclear fluorescence. Fluorescence recovery was measured by starting a time lapse acquisition within a few milliseconds after bleaching, with the imaging settings described above. Our mathematical description of nucleocytoplasmic exchange in the presence of both passive diffusion and active transport shows that the concentration of fluorescent species in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm follow a first-order kinetics (supplemental Equations 9–10). Hence, under the assumption of fluorescence proportionality to concentration, the collected FRAP curves in both compartments were fitted to a monoexponential equation, F(t)=F∞+(F0-F∞)exp(-t/τF)(Eq. 1) where superscripts 0 and ∞ label the fluorescence intensity collected at time 0 and asymptotically after bleaching, respectively. Fluorescence values were normalized by the signal of the entire cell at the same time to correct for bleaching caused by imaging and by pre-bleach fluorescence to verify the presence of an immobile fraction of fluorescent molecules within the nucleus. The nuclear volume (V) was calculated by assuming an ellipsoid shape for the nucleus with semiaxes dx, dy, and dz: V = (4/3)·π·dx·dy·dz. The three axes were estimated from confocal images of the nucleus. FLIM measurements were performed by illuminating the sample with a 468-nm pulsed laser diode at a 50 MHz repetition rate. Fluorescence emission was detected by means of fast photon-counting heads (H7422P-40, Hamamatsu) and time-correlated single photon counting electronics (SPC-830, Becker & Hickl, Berlin, Germany) at 500–540 nm (bandpass filter 510AF23, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Measurements were performed in living cells with the confocal system previously described with a 40× oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). Laser power was adjusted to yield photon-counting rates of ∼105 counts per second. Fluorescence decay was analyzed by the SPCImage (Becker & Hickl, Berlin, Germany) software package. Time-correlated single photon counting-detection was used to generate a lifetime map by fitting the fluorescence decay curve in each pixel of the image. Fluorescence decay curves of biological samples containing only unbound (EGFP-Impα) or only bound Impα (NLS-mCherry]·EGFP-Impα) were fitted within a monoexponential decay model; the result of the fitting procedure is thus a single fluorescence lifetime, characteristic of the Impα form (τF and τB, respectively). When a mix of unbound and bound Impα molecules were present, lifetime data were fitted to a biexponential decay law, F(t)=XB•e-tτB+XF•e-tτF(Eq. 2) where τF and τB were set to their previously determined values, and the amplitude coefficients XB and XF are the fitting parameters. The fluorescent fusion proteins used in this study were separately expressed in CHO-K1 cells, and their subcellular localization was analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). As expected, fluorescent proteins (EGFP, GFP2, and mCherry) are evenly distributed in the cells (i.e. ratio between nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic fluorescence Keq ∼ 1; Fig. 1A), whereas fluorescent proteins fused to the SV40 NLS are predominantly localized in the nucleus (i.e. Keq > 1; Fig. 1B). Nuclear accumulation is more evident with increasing cargo molecular weight (see Table 1 for the range of calculated Keq values), because nucleus-to-cytoplasm passive diffusion is impaired by a larger cargo size (20.Cardarelli F. Serresi M. Bizzarri R. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 1313-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FRAP analysis of mCherry and NLS-mCherry nucleus/cytoplasm shuttling kinetics and cytoplasmic diffusivity (data not shown) yielded transport parameters in keeping with previously reported results on analogous EGFP-based constructs (22.Cardarelli F. Serresi M. Bizzarri R. Beltram F. Traffic. 2008; 9: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). EGFP-Impα is localized in both compartments (with a moderate nuclear enrichment; Fig. 1C). Data show Impα accumulation on the nuclear envelope that can be linked to its binding to NPC components, such as nucleoporins and importin β (23.Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Thibier C. Guarguaglini G. Marchetti E. Di Fiore B. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6511-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This Impα localization is consistent with existing studies in living cells (21.Miyamoto Y. Hieda M. Harreman M.T. Fukumoto M. Saiwaki T. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5833-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters derived for NLS-tagged EGFP and GFP2 cargoesKeqKD*vC→Nμmμm3/sNLS-EGFP2.2–4.616 ± 7294 ± 24NLS-GFP27.5–20.420 ± 6304 ± 26 Open table in a new tab Our FRAP analysis requires the quantitative determination of the concentration of GFP-tagged proteins in a living cell (in this case, EGFP-Impα or NLS-EGFP and NLS-mCherry). One possible way to calibrate GFP-tagged proteins makes use of GFP solutions of known concentration in the cell medium. Confocal imaging of GFPs, however, usually exhibits a gradient in the fluorescence intensity along the optical axis (z) that is usually attributed to aspecific adsorption of the protein onto the bottom of the Petri dish (Fig. 2A, right panel). A time-consuming pretreatment of the Petri dish with an adsorption blocking agent such as bovine serum albumin or chlorosilane is required whenever GFPs need be used for calibration (24.Brown C.M. Dalal R.B. Hebert B. Digman M.A. Horwitz A.R. Gratton E. J. Microsc. 2008; 229: 78-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but this treatment is not usually compatible with cell viability. Here, we overcame this problem by means of a novel method based on the stable and biocompatible F-Gly. F-Gly displays a homogeneous distribution of fluorescence intensity along the z axis when confocally imaged (Fig. 2A, left panel) and retains most spectral characteristics of EGFP. Importantly, F-Gly does not permeate into cells and can therefore be added to cell cultures and imaged at the same focal height of cells (Fig. 2B) without affecting the intracellular determination of EGFP. This prevents the effect of optical aberration on fluorescence determination at different focal heights from the coverslip. Following this procedure, we carried out the calibration of intracellular EGFP concentration by using increasing amounts of F-Gly in the cell medium. The brightness ratio between EGFP and F-Gly was easily determined by steady state fluorescent measurements in a cuvette adopting the same excitation and collection ranges of experiments conducted in living cells. The concentration of mCherry was in turn calculated by using the measured brightness ratio between EGFP and mCherry in two excitation/emission setups. We found EGFP-Impα concentration values ranging from 1–2 μm up to 20–30 μm in highly transfected cells. Transfected NLS-mCherry generally yielded a wider range of expression levels, ranging from low micromolar concentration up to 200–300 μm. FRAP analysis of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was performed on cells expressing the NLS-EGFP construct (or NLS-GFP2, see “Experimental Procedures”). The nuclear fluorescence was photobleached, and the subsequent recovery was monitored by time-lapse imaging (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence recovery in the nucleoplasm and/or the decay in the cytoplasm were well fitted by monoexponential equations (Fig. 3B), consistently with the kinetic behavior of our model of nucleocytoplasmic exchange (supplemental equations 9–10). The ratio between the asymptotic nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence, the recovery constant, the nuclear volume, and the global concentration of NLS molecules in the cytoplasm (denoted here by CNLS) were combined to calculate ΦC→N and PN, which represent the excess flux of cargo toward the nucleus solely due to active transport and nuclear envelope permeability, respectively (for definitions and more details, refer to supplemental data). Our model of nucleocytoplasmic diffusion links the latter two parameters to the concentration of cargo molecules in the cytoplasm bound to the importin complex (denoted here by [NLS·Impα]) according to ΦC→N=[NLS•Impα](VC→N-PX)(Eq. 3) where vC→N (μm3/s) is the maximum rate for active transport toward the nucleus (i.e. the rate achievable when all NLS-EGFP is bound to Impα). For each cell, ΦC→N (mol/s) was determined experimentally and plotted against CNLS. (The latter was obtained from the fluorescence emission making use of our calibration procedure; Fig. 3D.) Notably, CNLS spans a large interval of concentrations on account of the large expression variability of the NLS-EGFP cargo and so does the excess active transport flux ΦC→N. Fig. 3D shows that ΦC→N increases linearly up to CNLS ≈ 15–20 μm and indicates that, at this concentration, the endogenous Impα/β transport system is operating below maximum capacity; at higher NLS-EGFP cytoplasmic density values, import rates deviate from linearity and finally reach a saturation value, as expected for a binding isotherm. If we assume a single binding equilibrium between the NLS cargo and Impα (Scheme 1), [NLS·Impα] can be expressed as a function of CNLS, the global cytoplasmic concentration of Impα (CImpα), and the binding dissociation constant KD*. [NLS•Impα]=12(CImpα+CNLS+KD*) -12[(CImpα+CNLS+KD*)2-4CIMPαCNLS]0.5(Eq. 4) To recover the biochemically relevant parameter KD*, we fitted the ΦC→N versus CNLS curve with Equations 3 and 4, setting CImpα = 1 μm, the reported value of global Impα concentration in a living cell (25.Percipalle P. Butler P.J. Finch J.T. Jans D.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our fitting analysis yields KD* = 16 ± 7 μm and vC→N = 300 μm3/s, as reported in Table 1 (for a mean nuclear volume of 800 femtoliters, this vC→N value corresponds to ∼1.5 × 108 molecules/s). As shown in Fig. 4A, we found an analogous trend in ΦC→N versus CNLS for NLS-GFP2, yielding a similar value for the maximum rate of active transport toward the nucleus, vC→N (Table 1). We previously reported that this 2-fold increase in cargo size has a severe impact on passive diffusion kinetics in living cells (20.Cardarelli F. Serresi M. Bizzarri R. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 1313-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Conversely, we show here that the kinetics of NLS cargo nuclear import by the endogenous Impα/β machinery is not significantly affected by the same increase in cargo size. Notably, the trend of ΦC→N versus CNLS does not depend on the specific cell line chosen (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4The FRAP assay: application to NLS-GFP2 and other cell lines. A, despite its influence on the shuttling kinetics (reported in Ref. 20.Cardarelli F. Serresi M. Bizzarri R. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 1313-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), GFP2 cargo has no effect on the saturation behavior of nuclear import rates. Fitting of cumulative NLS-GFP2 data to Equation 4 (solid black line) yielded KD* = 20 ± 6 μm. B, the same FRAP analysis of nuclear import was conducted in other two cell lines: HeLa (black dots) and U2OS (red dots). Nuclear import saturability in these cell lines is consistent with that observed in CHO-K1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Available in vitro assays testing the binding equilibrium of NLS and Impα (the latter in the Impβ-activated form) indicate that the thermodynamic dissociation constant (KD) is in the nanomolar range (17.Timney B.L. Tetenbaum-Novatt J. Agate D.S. Williams R. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), in contrast with our observation of a micromolar binding range. We wish to stress, however, that KD* can indeed be very different from KD, because of the complex and heterogeneous nature of the intracellular environment. On account of this, KD* will be henceforth referred to as the “effective dissociation constant” of the NLS-Impα binding equilibrium. The origin of this difference and the relevance of the KD* value will be discussed in the following sections. We developed a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-by-FLIM method to quantitatively monitor protein-protein interactions in living cells and obtain a separate independent measurement of the affinity of NLS-Impα binding in physiological conditions. We used EGFP as the donor fluorophore (high brightness and photostability and monoexponential lifetime) fused to Impα and mCherry as the acceptor (fast maturation, large absorption, and high photostability (26.Shaner N.C.

A quantitative description of the NLS-Impα interaction was obtained by extracting from the FLIM data the molar fractions of free and bound Impα, i.e. XF and XB, respectively (Equation 2). Following the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” we first determined τF and τB, the donor lifetime values corresponding to free EGFP-Impα and to its bound form, respectively. To measure the lifetime of donor, we recorded intensity and lifetime images of cells expressing only EGFP-Impα (Fig. 5A). As the expected fluorescence decay was well fitted by a monoexponential function yielding τF = 2.57 ± 0.01 ns (mean ± S.D. for n = 12 analyzed cells, Table 2). The EGFP lifetime is quite homogeneous cell wide (Fig. 5A, color-coded image) consistently with the known insensitivity of EGFP emission to the local details of the cellular environment (see Fig. 5B for the experimental lifetime dispersion).TABLE 2Average (mean ± S.D.) lifetime values (ns) from the whole population of observed cellsmCherryNLS-mCherry (−ATP)EGFP-Impα2.57 ± 0.012.55 ± 0.032.19 ± 0.04"
https://openalex.org/W1974533386,"In auditory fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the tone in the absence of shock leads to extinction of the acquired fear responses. The glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is thought to be involved in the extinction of the conditioned fear responses, but its detailed role in initiating and consolidating or maintaining the fear extinction memory is unclear. Here we investigated this issue by using a NMDAR antagonist, MK-801.The effects of immediate (beginning at 10 min after the conditioning) and delayed (beginning at 24 h after conditioning) extinctions were first compared with the finding that delayed extinction caused a better and long-lasting (still significant on the 20(th) day after extinction) depression on the conditioned fear responses. In a second experiment, MK-801 was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected at 40 min before, 4 h or 12 h after the delayed extinction, corresponding to critical time points for initiating, consolidating or maintaining the fear extinction memory. i.p. injection of MK-801 at either 40 min before or 4 h after delayed extinction resulted in an impairment of initiating and consolidating fear extinction memory, which caused a long lasting increased freezing score that was still significant on the 7th day after extinction, compared with extinction group. However, MK-801 administered at 12 h after the delayed extinction, when robust consolidation has been occurred and stabilized, did not affect the established extinction memory. Furthermore, the changed freezing behaviors was not due to an alteration in general anxiety levels, since MK-801 treatment had no effect on the percentage of open-arm time or open-arm entries in an Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) task.Our data suggested that the activation of NMDARs plays important role in initiation and consolidation but not maintenance of fear extinction memory. Together with the fact that NMDA receptor is very important for memory, our data added experimental evidence to the concept that the extinction of conditioned fear responses is a procedure of initiating and consolidating new memory other than simply ""erasing"" the fear memory."
https://openalex.org/W2130323754,"The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei is covered with a dense layer of Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG), which protects it from lysis by host complement via the alternative pathway in the mammalian bloodstream. Blocking VSG synthesis by the induction of VSG RNAi triggers an unusually precise precytokinesis cell-cycle arrest.Here, we characterise the cells arrested after the induction of VSG RNAi. We were able to rescue the VSG221 RNAi induced cell-cycle arrest through expression of a second different VSG (VSG117 which is not recognised by the VSG221 RNAi) from the VSG221 expression site. Metabolic labeling of the arrested cells showed that blocking VSG synthesis triggered a global translation arrest, with total protein synthesis reduced to less than 1-4% normal levels within 24 hours of induction of VSG RNAi. Analysis by electron microscopy showed that the translation arrest was coupled with rapid disassociation of ribosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum. Polysome analysis showed a drastic decrease in polysomes in the arrested cells. No major changes were found in levels of transcription, total RNA transcript levels or global amino acid concentrations in the arrested cells.The cell-cycle arrest phenotype triggered by the induction of VSG221 RNAi is not caused by siRNA toxicity, as this arrest can be alleviated if a second different VSG is inserted downstream of the active VSG221 expression site promoter. Analysis of polysomes in the stalled cells showed that the translation arrest is mediated at the level of translation initiation rather than elongation. The cell-cycle arrest induced in the presence of a VSG synthesis block is reversible, suggesting that VSG synthesis and/or trafficking to the cell surface could be monitored during the cell-cycle as part of a specific cell-cycle checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W1993712354,"Acid-sensing ion channels are proton-gated Na(+) channels expressed predominantly in neurons. How channel structure translates an environmental stimulus into changes in pore permeability remains largely undefined. The pore of ASIC1 is defined by residues in the second transmembrane domain (TM2), although a segment of the outer vestibule is formed by residues of TM1. We used the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to define the role of the region preceding TM2 (pre-TM2) in activation and desensitization of mouse ASIC1a. Oocytes expressing E425C channels labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide showed a change in the emission of the fluorescent probe in response to extracellular acidification. The time course of the change in fluorescence correlated with activation but not desensitization of E425C channels. The fluorescence emission did not change following extracellular acidification in oocytes carrying an inactivating mutation (W287G/E425C), although these channels were labeled and expressed at the plasma membrane. Our data indicate that pore opening occurs in conjunction with a conformational rearrangement of the pre-TM2. We observed a change in the emission of the fluorescent probe when labeled E425C channels transition from the desensitized to the resting state. The substituted-cysteine-accessibility method was used to determine whether the pre-TM2 has different conformations in the resting and desensitized states. State-dependent changes in accessibility to 2-[(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide modification were observed in oocytes expressing K421C, K422C, Y424C, and E425C channels. Our results suggest that the pre-TM2 of ASIC1a undergoes dynamic conformational rearrangements during proton-dependent gating."
https://openalex.org/W1973760656,"Bacterial flagella contain a rotor-mounted protein complex termed the switch complex that functions in flagellar assembly, rotation, and clockwise/counterclockwise direction control. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the switch complex contains the proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN and corresponds structurally with the C-ring in the flagellar basal body. Certain features of subunit organization in the switch complex have been deduced previously, but details of subunit organization in the lower part of the C-ring and the molecular movements responsible for motor switching remain unclear. In this study, we use cross-linking, binding, and mutational experiments to examine subunit organization in the bottom of the C-ring and to probe movements that occur upon switching. The results show that FliN tetramers alternate with FliM C-terminal domains to form the bottom of the C-ring in an arrangement that closely reproduces the major features observed in electron microscopic reconstructions. When motors were switched to clockwise rotation by a repellent stimulus, cross-link yields were altered in a pattern indicating relative movement of FliN and FliM(C). These results are discussed in the framework of a structurally grounded hypothesis for the switching mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1979646226,"We have identified G protein suppressor 2 (GPS2) as a stable component of the SMRT corepressor complexes. GPS2 potently represses basal transcription, with the repression domain mapped to the N-terminal silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT)-interacting domain. Knockdown of GPS2 abrogates, whereas overexpression potentiates, SMRT-mediated repression activity. The SMRT complexes are involved in 4-hydroxyl-tamoxifen (4OHT)-mediated gene repression by estrogen receptor α (ERα). We show that 4OHT recruits SMRT and GPS2 to the promoter of pS2, an ERα target gene, in a dynamic manner. Unexpectedly, we also found that estradiol (E2) promotes promoter recruitment of the SMRT complexes. While knockdown of GPS2 compromised 4OHT-mediated repression, it enhanced E2-induced expression of a reporter gene and several endogenous ERα target genes, including pS2, cyclin D1 (CCND1), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-MYC. Finally, we show that depletion of GPS2 or SMRT by siRNA promotes cell proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

To better understand the mechanisms by which SMRT regulates transcription, we initiated yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens and identified GPS2 as a SMRT-interacting protein. We dissected the role of GPS2 in transcriptional regulation by SMRT and ERα. Our data suggest that GPS2 is required for optimal 4OHT-mediated repression of ERα target genes, while knockdown of GPS2 increases E2-induced ERα-mediated reporter activity and some natural ERα target gene expression. We also show that GPS2-containing SMRT corepressor complexes are recruited to the promoter of the pS2 gene, a well-known ERα target gene, in response to 4OHT treatment in a dynamic way. Knockdown of GPS2 dramatically changed this recruitment pattern. Unexpectedly, we also found that E2 induced recruitment of GPS2 and SMRT complexes to pS2 promoter. Together, our data suggested that GPS2 is an important component of SMRT corepressor complexes and functionally involved in agonist- or antagonist-regulated ERα-mediated transcription. Transient transfection of siRNA was performed according to a protocol adapted from the manufacturer. Briefly, cells at 60% confluency were transfected with commercial siRNA at a final concentration of 100 nm using the DharmaFect no. 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) in serum reduced OPTI-MEM. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by both RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Reporter plasmids used in this report, MH100 (Gal4-tk-luc) and ERE-tk-Luc, have been previously described (30.Xie W. Hong H. Yang N.N. Lin R.J. Simon C.M. Stallcup M.R. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For MH100 reporter assays, 70% confluent cells plated in 48-well plates were co-transfected with MH100, CMX-β-gal (internal control), and corresponding expression plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Empty CMX vector was used as supplement to assure equal amounts of total DNA were transfected. 36∼48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase assays according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). For siRNA transfection followed by luciferase assays, the cells were transfected with siRNA in 10-cm plates 24 h prior to seeding into 48-well plates for reporter gene transfection. In ERE-tk-Luc reporter assays, MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNA in normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Cells were subsequently transfected with ERE-tk-Luc reporter along with the CMX-β-gal by Fugene 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol and cultured in charcoal-stripped medium free of phenol red for 48 h. Cells were then treated with 10 nm E2 or 100 nm tamoxifen (TAM) for 24 h before luciferase assays. Unless otherwise specified, all luciferase assays were normalized to β-galactosidase activity, and results were depicted as mean ± S.E. of relative luciferase units from three independent experiments. The ChIP assay protocol was modified from the Farnham Laboratories protocol (31.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, for ChIP with endogenous proteins, MCF-7 cells were cultured in charcoal-stripped, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h until 90% confluent. The cells were treated with 2.5 mm a-amanitin (Sigma) for 2 h to preclear the promoter region (32.Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of E2 hormone or 4OHT drug for up to 180 min. After treatment, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cross-linked cells were collected in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 5 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA) plus proteinase inhibitors mixture on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and subsequently dissolved in 500 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 10 min. The chromatin was sheared to 200∼500-bp fragments by sonication (Fisher 550a) with the microtip probe installed at a power setting of 4 for 150 s total sonication time (10 s on and 50 s off on ice for 15 cycles). The sonicated samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and the sheared chromatin was collected in the supernatant. The chromatin was then diluted 10-fold with IP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and cleared by incubating with preblocked protein A slurry (blocked by incubating with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml sheared herring DNA overnight) at 4 °C for 2 h. The cleared chromatin was recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation, then aliquoted and mixed with a specific antibody for immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were pulled down with preblocked protein A slurry and washed in IP washing buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0 for polyclonal antibody or pH 8.0 for monoclonal antibody, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) 4∼6 times. The precipitated chromatin was eluted twice by incubation with 150 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 15 min at room temperature. The eluted chromatin was reverse cross-linked by incubating with 300 mm NaCl and 1 mg/ml RNase at 68 °C overnight. The chromatin was then incubated with 100 mg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 3 h, followed by extraction first in phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mix (25:24:1) and then in chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). 30 ml of 5 m NaCl and 10 mg of glycogen (Roche) were added to each sample, and the DNA was precipitated with 2.5-fold volume of pure ethanol in −20 °C overnight. The DNA was retrieved by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 20 min, dissolved in 1× TE buffer, and subjected to PCR analysis. The results were calculated from three independent real-time PCR experiments and presented as the mean ± S.E. of the relative fold enrichment as the percentage of input signal after subtraction of the signal from the no-antibody mock control as background. For ChIP assays with a transfected luciferase reporter, Gal4-DBD or Gal4-SMRT was co-transfected with MH100 reporter into HeLa cells. 72-h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to ChIP assays with α-Gal4, α-SMRT, or α-GPS2 antibodies. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (see supplemental Materials for details of other materials and methods used in this study). Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens were employed to isolate proteins interacting with repression domains III and IV (amino acids 1188–1833) of SMRT. We isolated G-protein suppressor 2 (or GPS2) as a SMRT-interacting protein. We first examined whether SMRT and GPS2 form a stable complex in cells. We carried out immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa nuclear extracts. Anti-SMRT and anti-GPS2 antibodies were employed to immunoprecipitate endogenous SMRT, HDAC3, and GPS2. As a control, normal serum was included. Fig. 1A shows that both anti-SMRT and anti-GPS2 antibodies coprecipitated GPS2, HDAC3, and SMRT. We further examined the association between GPS2 and SMRT by epitope-tagged overexpression and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. FLAG-GPS2 and HA-SMRT expression plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. As expected, FLAG-GPS2 was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibodies only in the presence of HA-SMRT (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, immunostaining studies indicated that SMRT and GPS2 co-localized in the nucleus of MCF-7 (Fig. 1C), HeLa, and CV-1 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that SMRT and GPS2 form stable complexes in mammalian cells. Y2H assays were employed to determine the GPS2 interaction domains within SMRT. A panel of pGBT9-Gal4-SMRT deletion and truncation Y2H constructs were co-transformed with pGAD-GPS2, and interactions were detected with liquid LacZ reporter assays. As summarized in Fig. 2A, in addition to the fragment flanking amino acids 1281–1831 (the RD III and RD IV region used originally as bait), we found that GPS2 also interacts with a region at the N terminus of SMRT encompassing amino acids 159–316 (RD I). This region is highly homologous to N-CoR with an overall 95% identity. As expected, we found that GPS2 also interacts with the N terminus of N-CoR (data not shown). A reciprocal experiment was conducted to map the minimal SMRT interaction domains within GPS2. We found that the first 120 amino acids of GPS2 are important for the SMRT association (Fig. 2B). To determine whether GPS2 binds to SMRT in vitro, we carried out GST pull-down assays. In vitro transcribed and translated (TnT) FLAG-GPS2 was analyzed for its ability to bind GST-SMRT fusion proteins. We found that SMRT interacts with GPS2 via two regions including amino acids 159–316 and 1281–1831 (Fig. 2C). A set of constructs (corresponding to Y2H clones, Fig. 2B) expressing HA-tagged GPS2 were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the lysates were used in GST pull-down assays with GST-SMRT fusion proteins (102–316 or 1281–1833) (Fig. 2D). Our results indicated that GPS2 interacts with SMRT through its first 120 amino acids. Taken together, our in vitro binding assays are in agreement with the Y2H data (Fig. 2B). Because SMRT associates with both class I and class II HDACs (6.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we tested whether GPS2 was able to co-precipitate with histone deacetylase activity. HA-GPS2 was expressed in HEK293 cells and anti-HA immunocomplexes were subjected to histone deacetylase activity assays. As positive controls, HA-HDAC1 and HA-HDAC5 expression plasmids were also included. Fig. 3A shows that anti-HA antibodies immunoprecipitated a significant amount of histone deacetylase activity from the GPS2-containing extracts. To test whether GPS2 associates with HDACs in mammalian cells, we co-transfected FLAG-GPS2 and HA-tagged class I or class II HDAC expression plasmids and performed immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-HA antibodies. We found that GPS2 co-precipitated with class I HDACs, HDAC1, and HDAC3 (Fig. 3B), inconsistent with the previous study that FLAG-HDAC3 pulled down endogenous GPS2 (34.Li Y. Kao G.D. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Qin J. Phelan C. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2566-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GPS2 co-precipitated with HDAC5, but not HDAC7 (Fig. 3C). In support, ectopic expression of HDAC5 in HeLa cells recruited endogenous GPS2 to HDAC5-enriched nuclear speckles (Fig. 3D). We next examined whether GPS2 functions as a transcriptional corepressor in transient transfection assays. Increasing amounts of Gal4-GPS2 expression plasmids were co-transfected with MH100 luciferase reporter and β-gal internal control for luciferase assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that full-length Gal4-GPS2 potently repressed basal transcription in both CV-1 (Fig. 4A) and HEK293 cells (data not shown) in a dose-dependent manner. To further analyze the minimal repression domain in GPS2, we generated deletion and truncation mutants of pGal4-GPS2 (Fig. 4B). Transient transfection assays were carried out to map the repression domain in GPS2. We found that the repression activity is mediated primarily by the first 120 amino acids of GPS2 (Fig. 4, C and D). To investigate the role of GPS2 in SMRT-mediated repression, we determined whether endogenous GPS2 is recruited to the promoter of the reporter construct along with transfected Gal4-SMRT by ChIP assays (Fig. 5A). Gal4 alone (Gal4-DBD) or Gal4-SMRT expression plasmids were transiently transfected into HeLa cells followed by ChIP assays using anti-Gal4, anti-SMRT, and anti-GPS2 antibodies. Fig. 5A shows that increased recruitment of GPS2 was detected when Gal4-SMRT was transfected, indicating that ectopically expressed Gal4-SMRT recruits endogenous GPS2 to the Gal4 binding sites (compare lane 2 to lane 1). We next tested the effects of overexpression or knockdown of GPS2 on SMRT repression activity by transient transfection reporter assays. We found that overexpression of GPS2 enhanced Gal4-SMRT repression activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), whereas knockdown of GPS2 compromised SMRT repression activity (Fig. 5C). These results support a model in which GPS2 is a functional component of SMRT corepressor complex and that GPS2 is important for SMRT-mediated repression. Because SMRT is implicated in TAM-mediated transcriptional repression by ERα, we next examined whether GPS2 is important for TAM-mediated repression on estrogen response element (ERE) by knocking down endogenous GPS2 protein in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5D). Our data showed that knocking down GPS2 significantly abrogated the ability of TAM to repress ERE reporter activity (Fig. 5E); however, unexpectedly knocking down GPS2 also enhanced estrogen (E2)-induced reporter activity (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that GPS2 is an integral component of the SMRT corepressor complex and suggest that GPS2 may also play a role in ERα-mediated transcription. We further determined the effects of GPS2 knockdown on the expression of ERα target genes (Fig. 6). We found that E2 activated the expression of the pS2, cyclin D1 (CCND1), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-Myc genes, while TAM and 4OHT repressed the expression of these genes (Fig. 6, siCTRL groups). Notably, knockdown of GPS2 increased E2-induced expression of the pS2, CCND1, PR, and c-Myc genes (Fig. 6, compare siGPS2 to siCTRL). This observation is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 3E where knocking down GPS2 increased E2-induced reporter gene transcription. Moreover, knockdown of GPS2 compromised the ability of TAM- and 4OHT to repress the expression of pS2, CCND1, PR, and c-Myc. These data indicated that GPS2 participates in both TAM- and E2-mediated transcriptional regulation by ERα. It has been well established that tamoxifen induces the association of the SMRT corepressor complex with the promoters of ERα target genes (35.Fleming F.J. Hill A.D. McDermott E.W. O'Higgins N.J.

Consistent with this notion, we found that in response to tamoxifen treatment, ERα, SMRT, and GPS2 were transiently recruited to the pS2 gene promoter (Fig. 7, A and B). Unexpectedly, we noticed that E2 also induced an association of SMRT and GPS2 with the pS2 promoter (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, we found that E2 treatment resulted in temporal association of ERα, SMRT, and GPS2 with the pS2 promoter (Fig. 7C). To further dissect the role of GPS2 in ERα-mediated transcription in response to antagonist treatment, we carried out ChIP assays and determined the temporal pattern of the recruitment of components of SMRT complexes on the pS2 promoter (Fig. 8) with treatment of 4OHT. 4OHT is a more potent inhibitor than TAM, and therefore the results in Figs. 7 and 8 are not directly comparable. The data in Fig. 8 demonstrate that endogenous ERα, SMRT, and HDAC3 are recruited to the pS2 promoter following 4OHT treatment with a sharp peak of occupancy at 20–30 min (Fig. 8, A, B, and D). N-CoR occupancy was also observed to peak at 30 min (Fig. 8E). By contrast, GPS2 recruitment to the pS2 promoter following 4OHT exposure had a broad pattern of recruitment with a peak at 60 min (Fig. 8C). Notably, all of the corepressors, as well as ERα dissociated from the promoter by 90 min. These data suggest that in response to 4OHT, the components of the SMRT complex are transiently recruited to the pS2 promoter and that GPS2 enters the complexes more slowly than other core components. Our data suggest that GPS2 is a functional component of SMRT corepressor complexes, and is intimately involved in both 4OHT- and E2-mediated transcription. Because ERα-mediated cell growth is critical for breast cancer growth, we further determined whether GPS2 affects cell proliferation. To do so, siRNA against luciferase or GPS2 was transiently transfected into MCF-7 cells, and cell proliferation assays were performed. The cells were cultured in charcoal-stripped, phenol red-free medium, supplemented with ethanol (vehicle control), estrogen (E2), or 4OHT. As shown in Fig. 9, knockdown of GPS2 promoted cell proliferation in all experimental conditions. We further examined whether knockdown of SMRT affected MCF-7 cell proliferation under the same conditions (Fig. 10). As observed with GPS2 knockdown, knockdown of SMRT significantly promoted cell proliferation in all experimental conditions tested. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both GPS2 and SMRT are important to maintain normal proliferation rate in MCF-7 and that knockdown of corepressor complex promotes cell growth.FIGURE 10The effects of SMRT knockdown on MCF-7 cell proliferation. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA (siCTRL) or SMRT siRNA (siSMRT), and the mRNA of SMRT was transiently knocked down for up to Day 7 (A). The cells were subjected for proliferation assays in the presence of vehicle (EtOH) (B), 100 nm E2 (C), or 1 μm 4OHT (D) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Knockdown of SMRT significantly promoted MCF-7 cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2016370143,"Eya proteins are transcription factors that play pivotal roles in organ formation during development by mediating interactions between Sine Oculis (SO) and Dachshund (DAC). Remarkably, the transcriptional activity of Eya proteins is regulated by a dephosphorylating activity within its Eya domain (ED). However, the molecular basis for the link between catalytic and transcriptional activities remains unclear. Here we report the first description of the crystal structure of the ED of human Eya2 (ED-Eya2), determined at 2.4-A resolution. In stark contrast to other members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family to which ED-Eya2 belongs, the helix-bundle motif (HBM) is elongated along the back of the catalytic site. This not only results in a structure that accommodates large protein substrates but also positions the catalytic and the SO-interacting sites on opposite faces, which suggests that SO binding is not directly affected by catalytic function. Based on the observation that the DAC-binding site is located between the catalytic core and SO binding sites within ED-Eya2, we propose that catalytic activity can be translated to SO binding through DAC, which acts as a transcriptional switch. We also captured at two stages of reaction cycles-acyl-phosphate intermediate and transition state of hydrolysis step, which provided a detailed view of reaction mechanism. The ED-Eya2 structure defined here serves as a model for other members of the Eya family and provides a framework for understanding the role of Eya phosphatase mutations in disease."

However, no specificity of transduction has been reported so far in the central nervous system. Here we have developed a novel system to achieve a neuronal subtype specific expression in either dopaminergic (DA) or GABAergic neurons. We employed a delivery strategy by which the transgene is not expressed until its activation by Cre recombinase. We successfully tested the system in vitro and then used this novel lentivector, containing loxP sites, in 2 different transgenic mouse lines expressing Cre either in DA or in GABAergic neurons. In both lines the reporter gene was detected exclusively in Cre-positive cells, demonstrating that with this experimental approach we were able to achieve completely specific expression of transgenes delivered by lentiviral vectors. This universal system can be applied to all neural subtypes making use of the growing number of specific Cre driver lines.—Tolu, S., Avale, M.

If confirmed, these results suggest either that isocitrate dehydrogenase is the primary source of cytosolic NADPH in these cells or that multiple routes for NADPH production exist but cannot fully compensate for each other.

Syst. 2001; 76: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively, were gifts of Dr. Stephen C. Ekker. The pSilencer 2.1 U6 hygromycin vectors (Ambion) containing the malic enzyme (Me1-753) or control (HygC) targeting inserts were digested with PscI and PdmI. The DNA fragment containing the shRNA cassette and the selectable marker was ligated between the NcoI site and the blunted HindIII site of the pminiTol2-MCS vector to produce the Me1-753+Tol2 and hygromycin control + Tol2 (HygC+Tol2) vectors. The Me2-654 and Me2-2124 constructs also contain the Tol2 transposable element. The Tol2 shRNA vectors were cotransfected with an equimolar amount of the transposase expression plasmid, pCMV-Tol2, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), as above. Cells were selected with hygromycin B, as above. Cells from one 75-cm2 flask were trypsinized, resuspended in tissue culture medium, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was lysed by a single freeze/thaw cycle and pipetting in 150 μl of buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH (KMSH buffer). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for assay of cytosolic enzymes to give a protein concentration of 3–6 mg/ml cytosol. Enzymes were assayed in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.6, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NADP+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For ME1 activity, 10 μl of cytosol was added to 1 ml of prewarmed buffer, and the absorbance was monitored at 340 nm on a SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The slope was determined in the presence and absence of 1 mm malate and analyzed with the kinetic protocol of the SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices). Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was measured similarly, except that 20 μl of cytosol was measured with and without 1 mm isocitrate. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was assayed similarly, using 10 μl of cytosol with or without glucose 6-phosphate at a final concentration of 2.9 mm. Activities for all enzymes were calculated in nmol of NADPH produced/min/mg of protein. Cells were harvested by trypsinization from 3–4 75-cm2 flasks, resuspended in culture medium, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of KMSH buffer (see above) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, EDTA-free (Thermo-Scientific Pierce)) and homogenized with 40 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was placed in a new tube and centrifuged a second time at 600 × g. The second supernatant fraction was carefully removed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The 10,000 × g supernatant fraction (“cytosol”) was removed, and the pellet (“mitochondria”) was washed in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer, and the 10,000 × g centrifugation was repeated. The supernatant was discarded, and the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of homogenization buffer and vortexed vigorously. The mitochondrial fraction was frozen at −20 °C prior to assay. Mitochondrial malic enzyme (ME2) activity was measured by an assay recently developed in our laboratory (29.MacDonald M.J. Longacre M.J. Kendrick M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 488: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NADP+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (background control mixture) or the same mixture with either the addition of 1 mm malate or with the addition of both 10 mm malate and 5 mm fumarate (an allosteric activator of ME2). Rates were measured simultaneously in the three mixtures at 37 °C in a 96-well plate, with 200 μl of the reaction mixture and 4 μl of mitochondrial preparation per well. Measurements were performed at ∼22-s intervals for at least 10 min with mixing prior to each measurement. The initial 5 min was considered as equilibration time, and the rate remained constant for at least 10 min after this period. The absorbance was read at 340 nm at 37 °C using the SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The background rate was subtracted from the rates in both the 1 mm malate and 10 mm malate plus 5 mm fumarate. An enzyme rate in the presence of 1 mm malate higher than the background rate could be due to NADP-dependent mitochondrial malic enzyme (ME3), to ME1 from residual cytosolic contamination of the mitochondria, and/or to partial activity of mitochondrial ME2 malic enzyme. (see “Results” and Fig. 3). ME2 activity should be maximal in the presence of 5 mm fumarate plus 10 mm malate. As a mitochondrial control, the same preparations were assayed for the mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase as described previously (30.Gardner R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy® minikit (Qiagen), with on-column deoxyribonuclease digestion (RNase-free DNase set, Qiagen). cDNA was prepared from 1.5 μg of total RNA using the RETROscript® kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems) with oligo(dT) primers. Real-time PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad MyiQTM single color real-time PCR detection system. A standard curve prepared from INS-1 832/13 cDNA was included on each run for relative quantitation. Glutamate dehydrogenase was used in some experiments as an internal control (see “Results”) after testing showed it to have the least variation of the potential control genes tested (data not shown). Primers used for real time quantification are shown in supplemental Table 2. Interferon pathway pilot studies were performed semiquantitatively, by amplification of serially diluted cDNAs for 26 cycles and examination of the products on 2% agarose gels. Oas1a and Irf7 mRNA levels were then examined by real-time PCR as above. Interferon pathway primers are shown in supplemental Table 3. 15 μg of mitochondrial protein were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was blocked with buffer containing 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% nonfat powdered dry milk. The polyclonal rabbit anti-ME2 antibody (HPA008880, Sigma) was used at 1:500, and was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Scientific), used at 1:13,000. The signal was detected using the Immobilon Western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase developer (Millipore). As a mitochondrial control, the blot was stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific) prior to reprobing with a polyclonal antiserum to the mitochondrial GPD2 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (31.Brown L.J. MacDonald M.J. Lehn D.A. Moran S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14363-14366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:10,000, with detection as above. Results are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with two-sided comparisons. In our preliminary experiments using cells transfected with OligofectamineTM and 40 nm siRNA prepared by in vitro transcription, we found induction of four genes in the interferon pathway. The mRNAs of Oas1a (2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1A) and Irf7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) were induced ∼16-fold, mRNA of Prkr (protein kinase, interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent) was induced 4–16-fold, and mRNA of Mx1 (myxovirus resistance 1) was strongly induced by siRNA but was undetectable in control cells. Three other genes tested (Irf1, Irf2, and Wars) were not induced. Induction of the interferon pathway by siRNAs transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase has been reported to be due to the presence of a 5′-triphosphate on the siRNA (32.Kim D.H. Longo M. Han Y. Lundberg P. Cantin E. Rossi J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Using these findings as a guide, we tested our cell lines expressing stable shRNA constructs for similar induction. No induction of the interferon pathway was seen in cells stably expressing shRNA constructs when tested for Prkr (seven transferent lines tested), Irf7 (15 lines), and Oas1a (17 transferent lines tested, including HygC, Me1-753, Me1-1575, Me2-654, Me2-2124, and the Tol2 versions of these constructs). In addition, total RNA quantity from transferent cell lines was similar to that of non-targeted 832/13 cells. Growth rates were similar in the parental 832/13 cell line, the control shRNA line HygC, and the Me1 and Me2 shRNA lines (data not shown). Fig. 1 shows our results using the pSilencer 2.1 U6 hygromycin plasmids. Malic enzyme mRNA levels were reduced by 80 ± 5% in the Me1-753 line and by 84 ± 2% in the Me1-1575 line when compared with the non-targeting shRNA (HygC) control (p < 0.02 for each). No difference in Me1 mRNA levels was seen between the non-targeting shRNA control and the INS-1 832/13 parental cells. No significant changes in levels of mRNAs or enzyme activities were found between the lines in levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or the cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase, the two other sources of cytosolic NADPH (Fig. 1A). Malic enzyme (ME1) activity was reduced 86 ± 8% in Me1-753, and 81 ± 9% in Me1-1575 (p < 0.02) and was not changed by the HygC control shRNA. No compensatory changes were seen in the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or the cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1B). Insulin release stimulated by glucose was lower in the line expressing the non-targeting insert (HygC) than in either the parental 832/13 line or the Me1-753 line (p < 0.05 for both comparisons), but glutamine plus BCH-stimulated insulin release did not differ significantly between either control and the two Me1-targeted lines (Fig. 1C). Total insulin content of the HygC line was found to be 74% of that of the 832/13 control (p < 0.01) and 78% of that of Me1-753 (p < 0.01). No significant differences were found among any of the cell lines when insulin release was expressed as -fold glucose- or glutamine plus BCH-stimulated insulin secretion over base-line (unstimulated) insulin secretion (Fig. 1D). Because genetic drift can occur on prolonged culture and because selection and amplification of the cells required approximately 1 month between transfection and the start of testing, we attempted to shorten the time to testing and increase the number of stable transferents through the use of the Tol2 transposase system (27.Balciunas D. Wangensteen K.J. Wilber A. Bell J. Geurts A. Sivasubbu S. Wang X. Hackett P.B. Largaespada D.A. McIvor R.S. Ekker S.C. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e169Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). By putting Tol2 transposition sites into our selectable vector, the plasmid DNA sequence that is integrated should be uniform, although the sites of integration in the genome should be essentially random (27.Balciunas D. Wangensteen K.J. Wilber A. Bell J. Geurts A. Sivasubbu S. Wang X. Hackett P.B. Largaespada D.A. McIvor R.S. Ekker S.C. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e169Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The rate of stable integration was improved, as evidenced by an estimated 20–100-fold increase in hygromycin-resistant clones and approximately one-third shortening of time to testing (from 30–34 days to ∼22 days). Fig. 2A shows that Me1 mRNA was decreased 86 ± 2% in the Me1-753+Tol2 line when compared with the HygC+Tol2 control (p < 0.002) and that ME1 enzyme activity was decreased 78 ± 2% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). No compensatory changes were seen in either the mRNA level or enzyme activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The rat NAD(P)+-Me2 and the NADP+-dependent Me3 mRNA levels were also tested in the Tol2 transferent lines. Although a small difference in Me2 mRNA was seen between the 832/13 parental line and the Me1-753+Tol2 line (1.36-fold, p < 0.05), the Me2 mRNA level of the Me1-753+Tol2 line did not differ significantly from that of the shRNA control vector HygC+Tol2. We also directly examined the internal control, glutamate dehydrogenase, for evidence of an effect of the Me1 knockdown. RNA from each of the transferent or control lines was prepared on three different dates, and 1.5 μg of total RNA from each of the nine samples were reverse transcribed on the same day. The glutamate dehydrogenase mRNA values, relative to an INS-1 832/13 standard, were as follows: 832/13, 1.05 ± .02; HygC + Tol2, 1.02 ± 0.07; Me1-753 + Tol2, 1.03 ± 0.06. This showed that the internal control was not affected by the transfection or selection. No significant difference was found in insulin release between any of the lines, whether expressed as units released per mg of protein or as -fold stimulation (Fig. 2, C and D). Fig. 3A shows that Me2 mRNA is decreased by 95% with Me2-654 shRNA and by 82% with Me2-2124 (p < 0.01 for both). The Me2-224 and Me2-269 shRNA constructs di"
https://openalex.org/W2080463451,"The wheat germ eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4F binds tightly to the mRNA internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of tobacco etch virus (TEV) to promote translation initiation. When eIF4F is limiting, TEV is preferentially translated compared with host cell mRNA. To gain insight into the dynamic process of protein synthesis initiation and the mechanism of binding, the kinetics of eIF4F binding to TEV IRES were examined. The association rate constant (k(on)) and dissociation rate constant (k(off)) for eIF4F binding to IRES were 59 +/- 2.1 micro s(-1) and 12.9 +/- 0.3 s(-1), respectively, comparable with the rates for capped RNA. Binding of eIF4E or eIF4F to the cap of mRNA is the rate-limiting step for initiation of cap-dependent protein synthesis. The concentration dependence of the reactions suggested a simple one-step association mechanism. However, the association rate was reduced more than 10-fold when KCl concentration was increased from 50 to 300 mm, whereas the dissociation rate constant was increased 2-fold. The addition of eIF4B and poly(A)-binding protein enhanced the association rate of eIF4F approximately 3-fold. These results suggest a mechanism where eIF4F initially binds electrostatically, followed by a conformational change to further stabilize binding. Poly(A)-binding protein and eIF4B mainly affect the eIF4F/TEV association rate. These results demonstrate the first direct kinetic measurements of translation initiation factor binding to an IRES."
https://openalex.org/W1983982660,"Accumulating evidence indicates that TBP (TATA-binding protein)-like protein (TLP) contributes to the regulation of stress-mediated cell cycle checkpoint and apoptotic pathways, although its physiological target genes have remained elusive. In the present study, we have demonstrated that human TAp63 is one of the direct transcriptional target genes of TLP. Enforced expression of TLP results in the transcriptional induction of the endogenous TAp63, but not of the other p53 family members such as TAp73 and p53. Consistent with these results, small interference RNA-mediated knockdown led to a significant down-regulation of the endogenous TAp63. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the genomic region located at positions -487 to -29, where +1 represents the transcriptional initiation site of TAp63, is required for TLP-dependent transcriptional activation of TAp63 and also TLP is efficiently recruited onto this region. Additionally, cells treated with anti-cancer drug etoposide underwent apoptosis in association with the transcriptional enhancement of TAp63 in a p53-independent manner, and the knockdown of the endogenous TLP reduced etoposide-induced apoptosis through repression of TAp63 expression. Taken together, our present study identifies a TLP-TAp63 pathway that is further implicated in stress-induced apoptosis."

There are studies showing that different groups of miRNAs are involved in development of different tissues. In hepatocytes there are reported particular types of miRNAs that regulate gene expression.We established a human fetal liver cDNA library by a modified cloning protocol. Then plasmid isolation from the colonies was performed. After sequencing and database searching, the miRNAs were recognized. RT-PCR and sequencing were carried out to validate the miRNAs detected. Real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of each miRNA.One novel miRNA was discovered, together with another 35 previously-known miRNAs in the fetal liver. Some of them existed in variants. The miRNAs identified were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Quantitative analysis showed that they have variable expression.Our results indicate that a special group of miRNAs may play an important role in fetal liver development in a synergistic manner."

The primary symptom of infection is the sudden onset of watery diarrhea with subsequent volume depletion causing renal insufficiency. The objective of this research is to study the level of dehydration at presentation and subsequent fluid management in patients with cholera.This study was conducted on 191 patients of Cholera admitted at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan during the period of 5 years. Medical charts were evaluated retrospectively for initial hydration status, baseline lab investigations on admission and discharge and fluid therapy given to all the patients while their stay in the hospital and the data was analyzed on SPSS 15.0.Out of the 191 patients, 83(43%) were males and 108 (57%) were females with mean age of 42.3 years (SD+/-18.34). The average duration of symptoms was 3.75 days (SD+/-2.04). Of 191 patients, 175 (92.1%) presented with dehydration, 80 (42.3%) were given Ringer's Lactate (R/L) + Normal Saline (N/S), 45 (24%) patients were given R/L + N/S + Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORS), 27 (14.3%) of the patients were kept on R/L only and remaining were given various combinations of R/L, N/S, ORS and Dextrose Saline (D/S). On admission mean Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) was 24.54 (SD+/-16.6), mean creatinine was 2.47 (SD+/-2.35) and mean BUN/Creatinine ratio was 11.63 (SD+/-5.7).Aggressive fluid rehydration remains the cornerstone of management of cholera.

https://openalex.org/W2002323562,"Altered dendritic arborization contributes to numerous physiological processes including synaptic plasticity, behavior, learning and memory, and is one of the most consistent neuropathologic conditions found in a number of mental retardation disorders, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative disease. COP9 signalosome (CSN), an evolutionarily conserved regulator of the Cullin-based ubiquitin ligases that act in the proteasome pathway, has been found associated with diverse debilitating syndromes, suggesting that CSN may be involved in regulation of dendritic arborization. However, the mechanism of this control, if it exists, is unknown. To address whether the CSN pathway plays a role in dendrites, we used a simple and genetically tractable model, Drosophila larval peripheral nervous system. Our model study identified the COP9 signalosome as the key and multilayer regulator of dendritic arborization. CSN is responsible for shaping the entire dendritic tree through both stimulating and then repressing dendritic branching. We identified that CSN exerts its dualistic function via control of different Cullins. In particular, CSN stimulates dendritic branching through Cullin1, and inhibits it via control of Cullin3 function. We also identified that Cullin1 acts in neurons with the substrate-specific F-box protein Slimb to target the Cubitus interruptus protein for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2011265040,"The nonprocessive minus-end-directed kinesin-14 Ncd is involved in the organization of the microtubule (MT) network during mitosis. Only one of the two motor domains is involved in the interaction with the MT. The other head is tethered to the bound one. Here we prepared, purified, and characterized mutated Ncd molecules carrying point mutations in one of the heads, thus producing heterodimeric motors. The mutations tested included substitutions in Switch I and II: R552A, E585A, and E585D; the decoupling mutant N600K; and a deletion in the motor domain in one of the subunits resulting in a single-headed molecule (NcN). These proteins were isolated by two sequential affinity chromatography steps, followed by measurements of their affinities to MT, enzymatic properties, and the velocity of the microtubule gliding test in vitro. A striking observation is a low affinity of the single-headed NcN for MT both without nucleotides and in the presence of 5'-adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate, implying that the tethered head has a profound effect on the structure of the Ncd-MT complex. Mutated homodimers had no MT-activated ATPase and no motility, whereas NcN had motility comparable with that of the wild type Ncd. Although the heterodimers had one fully active and one inactive head, the ATPase and motility of Ncd heterodimers varied dramatically, clearly demonstrating that interactions between motor domains exist in Ncd. We also show that the bulk property of dimeric proteins that interact with the filament with only one of its heads depends also on the distribution of the filament-interacting subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2016376973,"We examined activation of the human epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by cleavage. We focused on cleavage of αENaC using the serine protease subtilisin. Trimeric channels formed with αFM, a construct with point mutations in both furin cleavage sites (R178A/R204A), exhibited marked reduction in spontaneous cleavage and an ∼10-fold decrease in amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance as compared with αWT (2.2 <i>versus</i> 21.2 microsiemens (μS)). Both αWT and αFM were activated to similar levels by subtilisin cleavage. Channels formed with αFD, a construct that deleted the segment between the two furin sites (Δ175–204), exhibited an intermediate conductance of 13.2 μS. More importantly, αFD retained the ability to be activated by subtilisin to 108.8 ± 20.9 μS, a level not significantly different from that of subtilisin activated αWT (125.6 ± 23.9). Therefore, removal of the tract between the two furin sites is not the main mechanism of channel activation. In these experiments the levels of the cleaved 22-kDa N-terminal fragment of α was low and did not match those of the C-terminal 65-kDa fragment. This indicated that cleavage may activate ENaC by the loss of the smaller fragment and the first transmembrane domain. This was confirmed in channels formed with αLD, a construct that extended the deleted sequence of αFD by 17 amino acids (Δ175–221). Channels with αLD were uncleaved, exhibited low baseline activity (4.1 μS), and were insensitive to subtilisin. Collectively, these data support an alternative hypothesis of ENaC activation by cleavage that may involve the loss of the first transmembrane domain from the channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W1994305165,"The whole-genome duplication (WGD) may provide a basis for the emergence of the very characteristic life style of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-its fermentation-oriented physiology and its capacity of growing in anaerobiosis. Indeed, we found an over-representation of oxygen-responding genes in the ohnologs of S. cerevisiae. Many of these duplicated genes are present as aerobic/hypoxic(anaerobic) pairs and form a specialized system responding to changing oxygen availability. HYP2/ANB1 and COX5A/COX5B are such gene pairs, and their unique orthologs in the 'non-WGD' Kluyveromyces lactis genome behaved like the aerobic versions of S. cerevisiae. ROX1 encodes a major oxygen-responding regulator in S. cerevisiae. The synteny, structural features and molecular function of putative KlROX1 were shown to be different from that of ROX1. The transition from the K. lactis-type ROX1 to the S. cerevisiae-type ROX1 could link up with the development of anaerobes in the yeast evolution. Bioinformatics and stochastic analyses of the Rox1p-binding site (YYYATTGTTCTC) in the upstream sequences of the S. cerevisiae Rox1p-mediated genes and of the K. lactis orthologs also indicated that K. lactis lacks the specific gene system responding to oxygen limiting environment, which is present in the 'post-WGD' genome of S. cerevisiae. These data suggested that the oxygen-responding system was born for the specialized physiology of S. cerevisiae."

Exosite-dependent binding of prothrombin to prothrombinase facilitates active site docking by Arg320 and initial cleavage at this site. Precise positioning of the Arg320 site for cleavage is implied by essentially normal cleavage at Arg320 in recombinant prothrombin variants bearing additional Arg side chains either one or two residues away. However, mutation of Arg320 to Gln reveals that prothrombinase can cleave prothrombin following Arg side chains shifted by as many as two residues N-terminal to the 320 position at near normal rates. Further repositioning leads to a loss in cleavage at this region with an abrupt shift toward slow cleavage at Arg271. In contrast, the binding constant for the active site docking step is strongly dependent on the sequence preceding the scissile bond as well as position. Large effects on binding only yield minor changes in rate until the binding constant passes a threshold value. This behavior is expected for a substrate that can engage the enzyme through mutually exclusive active site docking reactions followed by cleavage to yield different products.

The bulk of flux toward thrombin formation arises from initial cleavage following Arg320 to produce the proteinase meizothrombin (mIIa) 3The abbreviations and trivial names used are: IIathrombinmIIameizothrombinDAPAdansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amideF12fragment 1.2FPR-CH2Cld-phenylalanyl-l-proline-l-arginine chloromethyl ketoneP2prethrombin 2pAB4-aminobenzamidineS2238H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilideMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. as an intermediate (5Krishnaswamy S.

Further processing at Arg271 yields thrombin (IIa) and the activation peptide, fragment 1.2 (F12) (Scheme 1). Cleavage in the opposite order, yielding F12 and the zymogen prethrombin 2 (P2) as intermediates (Scheme 1), contributes in an experimentally undetectable way (<5%) toward thrombin formation (7Orcutt S.J.

The kinetic basis for this phenomenon lies in the ability of prothrombinase to act on the Arg320 site with ∼30-fold higher catalytic efficiency than at Arg271 in the otherwise uncleaved zymogen (7Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Prior cleavage at Arg320 restores efficient cleavage at Arg271, thereby leading to the essentially ordered action of prothrombinase on the two sites in the substrate (7Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J.

These functional effects arise from the predominant role played by exosite interactions involving extended surfaces removed from the catalytic site and substrate structures distant from the cleavage site(s) in mediating the binding of substrate to prothrombinase (10Krishnaswamy S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Equivalent exosite interactions tether all possible substrate forms to the enzyme complex with comparable affinity and regulate the presentation of the individual cleavage sites for active site engagement and catalysis (7Orcutt S.J.

In prothrombin, exosite binding facilitates active site engagement of structures flanking the Arg320 site, whereas elements at the Arg271 site cannot efficiently dock at the active site of prothrombinase (13Hacisalihoglu A.

Because the two cleavage sites in prothrombin are expected to be ∼36 Åapart (14Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A.

Initial cleavage at Arg320, which drives the conversion of zymogen to proteinase, has been proposed to alter geometric constraints to facilitate active site engagement by the Arg271 site and its efficient proteolysis in the intermediate, meizothrombin (9Bianchini E.P.

Exosite-dependent substrate recognition and its attending consequences provide a kinetic and mechanistic framework explaining the action of prothrombinase on prothrombin. A key element of this framework lies in the central role played by substrate geometry in both facilitating and restricting presentation of the individual cleavage sites for active site docking and resultant catalysis. In addition to explaining specificity in terms of the ordered action of prothrombinase on prothrombin, this reliance on precise geometric positioning likely drives specificity in a broader sense. Exosite tethering restricts the action of prothrombinase to prothrombin and prevents cleavage at the numerous other Arg residues within prothrombin despite the established ability of the catalytic site to bind and cleave a variety of Arg-containing sequences (17Orcutt S.J.

However, such ideas are not fully consistent with findings made with the Segovia variant of prothrombin (IIRR) purified from a patient and bearing the sequence Asp318-Arg319-Arg320 in place of Asp318-Gly319-Arg320 (20Akhavan S.

Thromb Res. 1997; 85: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg320-Ile321 in prothrombin, which corresponds to cleavage at the Arg15-Ile16 sequence in chymotrypsinogen, generates a new N terminus, which inserts into the N-terminal binding cleft in a sequence-specific manner to yield a mature serine proteinase (22Khan A.R. James M.N.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Possible cleavage of IIRR at Arg319 rather than at Arg320 is implied by the reduced proteolytic activity of the cleaved product possibly reflecting the inability to generate a new N-terminal sequence beginning at Ile321. These findings cast doubt on the proposed critical role played by precise geometric positioning of the exosite-tethered substrate in determining substrate recognition and specificity. We have investigated the role played by precise positioning of the substrate in allowing prothrombinase to discriminate between the two cleavage sites in prothrombin. By the use of a series of cleavage site variants of prothrombin, we have assessed the action of prothrombinase on the equivalent of the Arg320 cleavage site incrementally shifted toward the Arg271 cleavage site. Surprisingly, our approach reveals that both preference and rate for cleavage in the Arg320 region in prothrombin are only modestly affected by shifts that produce large changes in the thermodynamics for active site engagement. These new insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms at play in regulating ordered prothrombin cleavage have broader implications for the multiple instances in biology wherein proteinases act to cleave at more than one site within their cognate substrates.

Conditioned medium collected daily (6 liters) was treated with 10 mm benzamidine, 3 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and applied at room temperature to a column (4.6 × 10 cm) of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4. Following washing with the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 0.65 m NaCl. Fractions containing factor V activity were stored frozen at −20 °C. Accumulated fractions from 5 days of media collection were pooled and further processed in two halves. Each half was diluted with 5 volumes of 12 mm Hepes, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and applied to a 1 × 10-cm Poros HQ/M column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Following washing with the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl (0.15-1.0 m, 20 ml/min, 19 min). Fractions containing V810 from both runs were pooled, treated with 6 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, dialyzed for 2.75 h against 50 volumes of 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration to ∼3 mg/ml, and stored frozen at −80 °C (yield = 60 mg). Preparative activation and purification of Va from the recombinant species were done by modifications to published procedures (32Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol.

Purified V810 (1 mg/ml, 30 ml) diluted into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, was preparatively activated with 20 nm thrombin for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was quenched with 50 μm FPR-CH2Cl and applied to a 1 × 10-cm Poros HQ/M column equilibrated in the same buffer. Following washing, bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl (0.15–0.66 m, 5 ml/min, 7 min). Fractions containing Va were pooled, treated with 15 μm FPR-CH2Cl, diluted with 3 volumes of 20 mm MES, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.8, and applied to a 1 × 5-cm Poros HS-50 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equilibrated in the same buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. Following washing, bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl (0.15–0.66 m, 10 ml/min, 12 min). Fractions containing factor Va were pooled, exchanged into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, by repeated centrifugal ultrafiltration, concentrated to ∼3.5 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C in single use aliquots (yield = 16.5 mg). Previous studies have established that Va produced from recombinant V810 by the action of thrombin possesses the same polypeptide structure as the activated product from factor V purified from plasma. Fluorescence binding measurements and measurements of prothrombin activation established that Va derived from recombinant V810 was indistinguishable from Va derived from plasma V in its ability to bind factor Xa and to function as a cofactor within prothrombinase (not shown). The two types of Va have been used interchangeably in this study.

All prothrombin variants were exchanged into Assay Buffer by centrifugal gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 before use. Reaction mixtures (800 μl) maintained at 25 °C and containing 1.4 μm IIVariant (recombinant prothrombin variants as defined in Scheme 2), 30 μm PCPS, 60 μm DAPA, and 30 nm Va in Assay Buffer were initiated by the addition of 0.2 nm Xa. Aliquots (40 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times and quenched by mixing with 16 μl of 0.2 m Tris, 6.4% (w/v) SDS, 32% (v/v) glycerol, 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8, in a 96-well PCR plate (Eppendorf). Proteolysis by thrombin in the quenched samples was further limited by the addition of 36 μm FPR-CH2Cl. Samples (40 μl) were heated at 85 °C for 5 min, subject to electrophoresis using 10% precast Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen), and protein bands were visualized using the Colloidal Blue stain (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Stained gels were imaged using a high resolution infrared fluorescence scanner (Odyssey, Li-Cor) using λEX = 685 nm and λEM = 720 nm. Control experiments established the linear dependence of the integrated signal on loaded prothrombin and fragments extending well beyond the amounts expected in these gels. Reaction mixtures containing 5 μm IIVariant, 30 μm PCPS, 60 μm DAPA, and 30 nm Va in Assay Buffer were incubated at 25 °C for 45 min following the addition of 1 nm Xa. Following quenching as described above, samples were subject to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and visualized by staining as described previously (27Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of excised bands was determined by automated Edman degradation by Dr. Jan Pohl at the Emory University Microchemical Facility or at the Biotechnology Branch of the Centers for Disease Control. Reaction mixtures (200 μl) in Assay Buffer and maintained at 25 °C contained 1.4 μm IIVariant, 30 μm PCPS, 6 μm DAPA, and 30 nm Va. Prothrombin cleavage was initiated by the addition of 0.2 nm Xa, and aliquots (10 μl) withdrawn at various times were quenched by mixing with Assay Buffer containing 50 mm EDTA in place of 5 mm Ca2+. Quenched samples were further diluted in the same buffer, and initial velocities of S2238 hydrolysis were determined following the addition of 100 μm peptidyl substrate. Concentrations of proteinase formed were determined by interpolation from the linear dependence of the rate of S2238 hydrolysis on known concentrations of thrombin determined in the presence of the same concentration of DAPA as in the quenched samples. The ability of substrate variants to engage the active site of Xa within prothrombinase in the absence of catalysis was assessed by fluorescence studies with pAB as described previously (13Hacisalihoglu A. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Camire R.M. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32974-32982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As before, each substrate titration employed three reaction mixtures to provide for appropriate controls (13Hacisalihoglu A. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Camire R.M. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (0.6 ml each) in 0.5 × 0.5-cm quartz cuvettes and prepared in Assay Buffer contained: A, no probe (1 μm XaS195A, 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS, and 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl); B, no enzyme (1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS, 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl, and 25 μm pAB); and C, experimental (1 μm XaS195A, 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS, 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl, and 25 μm pAB). Steady state fluorescence intensity was measured in a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International) using λEX = 320 nm and λEM = 374 nm with a long pass filter (LP 345, CVI Laser) in the emission beam. Intensities were obtained by integration of the signal for 30 s following incremental additions of titrant, previously exchanged into Assay Buffer. Fluorescence intensities measured for reactions B and C were corrected for scattering effects (from reaction A) and processed as described previously to derive FOBS/FP,Free representing the ratio of observed fluorescence to that observed with free pAB (13Hacisalihoglu A.

Concentrations of Va and PCPS were chosen based on published equilibrium constants and stoichiometries to ensure that all added Xa was saturably incorporated into the Xa-Va-PCPS ternary complex (36Krishnaswamy S.

Thus, the concentration of prothrombinase was considered equal to the concentration of the limiting concentration of Xa. Some figures illustrate representative findings from 2 to 5 experiments performed at an equivalent level of detail and frequently with at least one different protein preparation. All replicates were incorporated into the quantitative analyses of prothrombin consumption or fluorescence measurements wherein the data points denote means ± 1 S.D. Steady state rate expressions were verified by symbolic derivation using the applet King-Altman, publicly available through BioKin Inc., as well as by their ready reduction to the independently derived rapid equilibrium form. Quantitative densitometry was performed using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) and by volume integration of the bands in unscaled images obtained from the fluorescent scanner. The fate of prothrombin was determined by normalizing the integrated volume from this band t"
