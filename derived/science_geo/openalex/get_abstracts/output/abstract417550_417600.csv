https://openalex.org/W2167505302,"Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) repairs topoisomerase I cleavage complexes (Top1cc) by hydrolyzing their 3'-phosphotyrosyl DNA bonds and repairs bleomycin-induced DNA damage by hydrolyzing 3'-phosphoglycolates. Yeast Tdp1 has also been implicated in the repair of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes (Top2cc). To determine whether vertebrate Tdp1 is involved in the repair of various DNA end-blocking lesions, we generated Tdp1 knock-out cells in chicken DT40 cells (Tdp1-/-) and Tdp1-complemented DT40 cells with human TDP1. We found that Tdp1-/- cells were not only hypersensitive to camptothecin and bleomycin but also to etoposide, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), H(2)O(2), and ionizing radiation. We also show they were deficient in mitochondrial Tdp1 activity. In biochemical assays, recombinant human TDP1 was found to process 5'-phosphotyrosyl DNA ends when they mimic the 5'-overhangs of Top2cc. Tdp1 also processes 3'-deoxyribose phosphates generated from hydrolysis of abasic sites, which is consistent with the hypersensitivity of Tdp1-/- cells to MMS and H(2)O(2). Because recent studies established that CtIP together with BRCA1 also repairs topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage, we generated dual Tdp1-CtIP-deficient DT40 cells. Our results show that Tdp1 and CtIP act in parallel pathways for the repair of Top1cc and MMS-induced lesions but are epistatic for Top2cc. Together, our findings reveal a broad involvement of Tdp1 in DNA repair and clarify the role of human TDP1 in the repair of Top2-induced DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W1996611653,"Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modifiers such as SUMO (also known as Smt3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mediate signal transduction through post-translational modification of substrate proteins in pathways that control differentiation, apoptosis and the cell cycle, and responses to stress such as the DNA damage response. In yeast, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA (also known as Pol30) is modified by ubiquitin in response to DNA damage and by SUMO during S phase. Whereas Ub-PCNA can signal for recruitment of translesion DNA polymerases, SUMO-PCNA signals for recruitment of the anti-recombinogenic DNA helicase Srs2. It remains unclear how receptors such as Srs2 specifically recognize substrates after conjugation to Ub and Ubls. Here we show, through structural, biochemical and functional studies, that the Srs2 carboxy-terminal domain harbours tandem receptor motifs that interact independently with PCNA and SUMO and that both motifs are required to recognize SUMO-PCNA specifically. The mechanism presented is pertinent to understanding how other receptors specifically recognize Ub- and Ubl-modified substrates to facilitate signal transduction."

STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated in various cancers and drives gene expression from GAS-containing promoters to promote tumorigenesis. Recently, roles for unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) have been described in response to cytokine stimulation, in cancers, and in maintenance of heterochromatin stability. However, the mechanisms underlying U-STAT3 binding to DNA has not been fully investigated. Here, we explore STAT3-DNA interactions by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. We observed that U-STAT3 molecules bind to the GAS DNA-binding site as dimers and monomers. In addition, we observed that U-STAT3 binds to AT-rich DNA sequence sites and recognizes specific DNA structures, such as 4-way junctions and DNA nodes, within negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA. These structures are important for chromatin organization and our data suggest a role for U-STAT3 as a chromatin/genome organizer. Unexpectedly, we found that a C-terminal truncated 67.5-kDa STAT3 isoform recognizes single-stranded spacers within cruciform structures that also have a role in chromatin organization and gene expression. This isoform appears to be abundant in the nuclei of cancer cells and, therefore, may have a role in regulation of gene expression. Taken together, our data highlight novel mechanisms by which U-STAT3 binds to DNA and supports U-STAT3 function as a transcriptional activator and a chromatin/genomic organizer.

https://openalex.org/W2134845949,"The anticodon stem-loop (ASL) of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) drives decoding by interacting directly with the mRNA through codon/anticodon pairing. Chemically complex nucleoside modifications found in the ASL at positions 34 or 37 are known to be required for accurate decoding. Although over 100 distinct modifications have been structurally characterized in tRNAs, only a few are universally conserved, among them threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t(6)A), found at position 37 in the anticodon loop of a subset of tRNA. Structural studies predict an important role for t(6)A in translational fidelity, and in vivo work supports this prediction. Although pioneering work in the 1970s identified the fundamental substrates for t(6)A biosynthesis, the enzymes responsible for its biosynthesis have remained an enigma. We report here the discovery that in bacteria four proteins (YgjD, YrdC, YjeE, and YeaZ) are both necessary and sufficient for t(6)A biosynthesis in vitro. Notably, YrdC and YgjD are members of universally conserved families that were ranked among the top 10 proteins of unknown function in need of functional characterization, while YeaZ and YjeE are specific to bacteria. This latter observation, coupled with the essentiality of all four proteins in bacteria, establishes this pathway as a compelling new target for antimicrobial development."

https://openalex.org/W2091137560,"Many insects eat the green leaves of plants but excrete black feces in an as yet unknown mechanism. Insects cannot avoid ingesting pathogens with food that will be specifically detected by the midgut immune system. However, just as in mammals, many pathogens can still escape the insect midgut immune system and arrive in the hindgut, where they are excreted out with the feces. Here we show that the melanization of hindgut content induced by prophenoloxidase, a key enzyme that induces the production of melanin around invaders and at wound sites, is the last line of immune defense to clear bacteria before feces excretion. We used the silkworm Bombyx mori as a model and found that prophenoloxidase produced by hindgut cells is secreted into the hindgut contents. Several experiments were done to clearly demonstrate that the blackening of the insect feces was due to activated phenoloxidase, which served to regulate the number of bacteria in the hindgut. Our analysis of the silkworm hindgut prophenoloxidase discloses the natural secret of why the phytophagous insect feces is black and provides insight into hindgut innate immunity, which is still rather unclear in mammals.

Our analysis of the silkworm hindgut prophenoloxidase discloses the natural secret of why the phytophagous insect feces is black and provides insight into hindgut innate immunity, which is still rather unclear in mammals. There are over 1011 microbe cells per gram content in the mammalian large intestine because it lacks Peyer's patches (1Walter J. Ley R. The human gut microbiome: ecology and recent evolutionary changes.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 411-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Among those bacteria, fecal pathogens cause health problems throughout the world, particularly through water pollution (2Field K.G. Samadpour M. Fecal source tracking, the indicator paradigm, and managing water quality.Water Res. 2007; 41: 3517-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As in mammals, many pathogens can still escape insect midgut immune system and pass to the hindgut, which is an organ similar to the mammalian large intestine (3Dillon R.J. Dillon V.M. The gut bacteria of insects: nonpathogenic interactions.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2004; 49: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 4Apidianakis Y. Rahme L.G. Drosophila melanogaster as a model for human intestinal infection and pathology.Dis. Model. Mech. 2011; 4: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because of similarities with mammals, the insect midgut immune system upon aging, stress, or infection has been extensively studied (4Apidianakis Y. Rahme L.G. Drosophila melanogaster as a model for human intestinal infection and pathology.Dis. Model. Mech. 2011; 4: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5Hakim R.S. Baldwin K. Smagghe G. Regulation of midgut growth, development, and metamorphosis.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2010; 55: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, as yet, it is unclear whether there is an innate immunity system in mammalian large intestine and the insect hindgut that destroys pathogens before feces excretion. Insects make up the largest group of animals on earth, and almost 45% of insects are herbivorous (6Schoonhoven L.M. van Loon J.J.A. Dicke M. Insect-Plant Biology. Chapman & Hall, London2005Google Scholar). Most herbivorous insects live on green leaves, and typical insects such as the silkworm eat green mulberry leaves although they excrete black feces. As yet, the mechanism of how feces are blackened is still unknown. The insect gut is a digestion system that is divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Insect hindgut is generally thought to re-absorb certain salts and amino acids from the content (before excretion as feces) to maintain the osmotic pressure in the hemolymph (7Lehane M.J. Billingsley P.B. Biology of the Insect Midgut. Chapman & Hall, London1996Crossref Google Scholar). Many symbiotic bacteria including un-killed pathogens cannot avoid being excreted with feces, and those microbes may further pollute insect feed and its habitat. Little is known whether insect hindgut has an immune system to deal with microbes in feces before excretion. Prophenoloxidase (PPO) 4The abbreviations used are. PPOprophenoloxidasePOphenoloxidaseFGforegutMGmidgutHGhindgutPYpylorusPTUphenylthioureaTMB3,3′,5,5;-tetramethylbenzidine. is a very important innate immunity protein that is produced by hemocytes in invertebrates (8Ashida M.

Activated phenoloxidase (PO) induces the production of melanin (melanization) around invading microorganisms to first seal them off from circulation and then kill them. Melanization is also induced around wounds to prevent additional infections. Activated PO produces melanin in the epidermis and cuticle and is therefore also responsible for insect body color and patterns (13Wittkopp P.J. Beldade P.

Because the feces of phytophagous insects is black, we hypothesized that PPO may be responsible for melanization of feces. However, like PPO, laccase and peroxidase also oxidize some phenols (10Kanost M.R. Gorman M.J. Phenoloxidases in Insect Immunity. Academic Press & Elsevier, San Diego2008Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and thus, these enzymes may also induce melanization of feces. prophenoloxidase phenoloxidase foregut midgut hindgut pylorus phenylthiourea 3,3′,5,5;-tetramethylbenzidine. In this study, we used biochemical assays and in situ hybridization to show that cells in the hindgut of Bombyx mori produced PPO. PPO was also found in the hindgut contents. Melanization of the silkworm larvae feces was blocked, and bacterial number increased in hindgut when phenylthiourea (PTU) was introduced through feeding. Therefore, activated PO and PO-induced melanization of hindgut content helped reduce bacterial numbers, suggesting that PO is an important regulator of the bacterial flora in hindgut and feces. B. mori larvae (Nistari) were reared on mulberry leaves at 25 °C under a 12-h photoperiod. Larvae on day 3 of the fourth larval stage (IV-3), the fourth molting stage (IV-M), day 3 of the fifth larval stage (V-3), or at the wandering-stage (W) were used for experiments. To obtain samples for Western blot, immunostaining, or native gel assay, silkworms and other larval species were dissected in autoclaved 0.85% NaCl solution after bleeding. The dissected tissues were washed in fresh 0.85% NaCl solution three times to remove hemolymph. The gut was washed in 0.85% NaCl three times, and the corresponding gut parts were dried and then cut open to transfer contents to a new tube. Larvae were bled, and the hemolymph was transferred to a new tube after centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was the plasma. Dianemobius nigrofasciatus, Tribolium castaneum, Drosophila melanogaster (w1118), Coptotermes formosanus, Ostrinia furnaclis, Heliothis armigero, and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were fed as usual. PPO, laccase, and peroxidase are a group of enzymes that may oxidize dopamine to produce melanin and metabolites (10Kanost M.R. Gorman M.J. Phenoloxidases in Insect Immunity. Academic Press & Elsevier, San Diego2008Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The activities of the three enzymes were compared in hindgut content using 3 μg of laccase (38429; Sigma), 1.67 ng of peroxidase (P719; Invitrogen), and 1.25 μg of purified recombinant Drosophila prophenoloxidase 1 (DmrPPO1) (16Li X. Ma M. Liu F. Chen Y. Lu A. Ling Q.Z. Li J. Beerntsen B.T. Yu X.Q. Liu C. Ling E. Properties of Drosophila melanogaster prophenoloxidases expressed in Escherichia coli.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2012; 36: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A 200 μl aliquot of 2 mm ABTS (Sigma) for laccase and TMB solution for peroxidase was used (1:50; Invitrogen). 10 mm dopamine (Sigma) was used for DmrPPO1. DmrPPO1 needed to be activated with 30% ethanol before use (16Li X. Ma M. Liu F. Chen Y. Lu A. Ling Q.Z. Li J. Beerntsen B.T. Yu X.Q. Liu C. Ling E. Properties of Drosophila melanogaster prophenoloxidases expressed in Escherichia coli.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2012; 36: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were incubated with each enzyme for 5 min before adding the substrate. 3 mm NaN3 (final concentration) was used for inhibition of laccase and peroxidase, and saturated PTU was used for inhibition of DmrPPO1. Gut content equal to feces wet weight was suspended in 200 μl of Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) and vortexed several times. The suspension (20 μl) was mixed with 200 μl of each substrate plus the corresponding enzyme inhibitor and/or Tris buffer to make the total volume the same. Because the inhibitors were used to detect whether they could inhibit different enzymes, each substrate with inhibitor added was treated as a blank. They were added in Tris buffer containing inhibitor alone, at the same volume as the blank, to determine HG1 and HG2 content. The solutions were incubated at room temperature for 8 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 10 min using the EXPERT 96 microplate reader (Biochrom, Holliston, MA). Absorbance was read at 490, 450, and 405 nm to detect PPO, laccase, and peroxidase activities, respectively. One unit of each enzyme activity was defined as ΔAλ/min = 0.001 (λ, wavelength). The dissected gut of the silkworms was incubated in TMB, ABTS, or dopamine containing 30% ethanol or not for staining after food contents were removed. Dopamine is a PPO substrate, and ethanol can be used to activate PPO (8Ashida M. Brey P. Recent Advances on the Research of the Insect Prophenoloxidase Cascade. Chapman & Hall, London1998Google Scholar). NaN3 or PTU was added to monitor the change in melanization when dopamine (with ethanol) was used for staining. Different parts of the gut were opened, and the contents were transferred to pre-weighed tubes to measure the wet weight of the contents. Gut contents were suspended in either 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) (for PO activity assay or PPO degradation observation) or 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA (for Western blot assay). The tubes were vortexed several times, centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was incubated at room temperature for different times to determine whether PPO was degradable. To check whether there is PPO in feces, 20 feces samples excreted for 0 or 60 min (V-3 black feces and wandering-stage green feces, respectively) were suspended in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA and concentrated to ∼40 μl by ultrafiltration. 15 μl of the concentrated solution were loaded for Western blot assay. The injected fluorescent beads phagocytosed by insect hemocytes were observed under a fluorescent microscope, to monitor hemocyte movement (17Ling E. Shirai K. Kanekatsu R. Kiguchi K. Kobayashi Y.

In the same way, fluorescent beads (1.0 mm 4, Red (580/605); Molecular Probes) were injected into the silkworm larvae (on V-3) for at least 6 h (17Ling E. Shirai K. Kanekatsu R. Kiguchi K.

The dissected hindguts were fixed, sectioned, and deparaffinized as described (17Ling E. Shirai K. Kanekatsu R. Kiguchi K. Kobayashi Y. Funayama T. Watanabe H.

Comp.

V-3 silkworm larvae were injected with 5 × 106 formalin-killed Escherichia coli cells suspended in sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution or 0.85% NaCl alone for immune challenge for 12 h. Then the silkworm larvae were bled to obtain plasma. HG1 and HG2 and its contents were also sampled. These samples were used for detecting lysozyme by Western blot. Gut content (equal to the weight of feces) and feces from V-3 and wandering-stage larvae were suspended in 1 ml of LB medium, and the suspended solutions with gut content fragments (25 μl plus 75 μl of fresh LB medium) were spread on LB plates cultured at 37 °C overnight. Colonies of bacteria were counted and calculated. PTU is a strong PO inhibitor (18Ryazanova A.D. Alekseev A.A. Slepneva I.A. The phenylthiourea is a competitive inhibitor of the enzymatic oxidation of DOPA by phenoloxidase.J. Enzym. Inhib. Med. Chem. 2012; 27: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was dissolved in autoclaved water, and saturated PTU was filtered to remove bacteria. The PTU solution was spread on mulberry leaves and dried before feeding to the silkworm larvae. The change in the color of feces was observed continuously. HG1 and HG2 contents from PTU-fed larvae were removed for Western blot as described above. After feeding the PTU, the excreted green feces were collected immediately for bacterial culture, as described above. Midgut and hindgut from V-3 larvae were cultured in Grace medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The silk gland was cultured as a control. The culture medium was sampled at scheduled times for the native gel assay as described previously (19Wang Z. Lu A. Li X. Shao Q. Beerntsen B.T. Liu C. Ma Y. Huang Y. Zhu H. Ling E.

Parasitol. 2011; 127: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Different parts of the silkworm larvae gut were dissected. Tissues were homogenized and sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, and total protein concentration was determined with bovine serum albumin as the standard.

EasySee Western Marker (DM201; TransGen) was used as the protein marker. The EttanTM MDLC system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used for desalting and separating tryptic peptide mixtures. In this system, samples were desalted on reverse phase (RP) trap columns (Zorbax 300 SB C18, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and then separated on an RP column (150 μm i.d., 100 mm length, Column Technology Inc., Fremont, CA). Mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in high performance liquid chromatography grade water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) were selected. The tryptic peptide mixture (20 μg) was loaded onto the columns, and separation was performed at a flow rate of 2 μl/min using a linear gradient of 4–50% B for 120 min. A FinniganTM LTQTM linear ion trap MS (Thermo Electron Corp. Rockford, IL) equipped with an electrospray interface was connected to the LC setup to detect the eluted peptides. Data-dependent MS/MS spectra were obtained simultaneously. Each scan cycle consisted of one full MS scan in profile mode followed by five MS/MS scans in centroid mode with the following Dynamic ExclusionTM settings: repeat count 2, repeat duration 30 s, exclusion duration 90 s. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The silkworm protein sequence database used in this analysis was downloaded from the NCBI website using the keyword Bombyx mori.

Comp. Immunol. 2006; 30: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To detect PPO, a polyclonal antibody against the silkworm PPO (1:1,000) was used as the first antibody (20Asano T. Takebuchi K. Identification of the gene encoding pro-phenoloxidase A(3) in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster.Insect Mol. Biol. 2009; 18: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) was used as the second antibody. To detect melanin in the hindgut tissue, a monoclonal antibody 6D2 (IgM) (1:200) against melanin derived from Coccidioides posadasii was used as the first antibody (a gift from Dr. Garry T. Cole) (25Nosanchuk J.D. Yu J.J. Hung C.Y. Casadevall A. Cole G.T. Coccidioides posadasii produces melanin in vitro and during infection.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2007; 44: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:1000) was the second antibody. All other procedures were followed as described (26Ling E. Ao J. Yu X.Q. Nuclear translocation of immulectin-3 stimulates hemocyte proliferation.Mol Immunol. 2008; 45: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei. All pictures were taken under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) under differential interference contrast using the appropriate filter. Silkworm larvae that are fed on green mulberry leaves excreted black feces in which the leaf fragments were also black (Fig. 1, A, B-a, and B-b). However, during the wandering-stage, the last feces and mulberry leaf fragments were green (Fig. 1, B-c and B-d). After dissecting a silkworm larva on day 3 of the fifth larval stage (V-3), we found that the contents in different parts of the midgut (MG) were all green (Fig. 1C, bottom). The hindgut (HG) is divided into two parts, and in the first part of the hindgut (HG1), the content was always green. When the content passed to the second part of the hindgut (HG2), it became black (Fig. 1C). Feces excreted by larvae before the wandering-stage are always black.FIGURE 3Western blot analysis of PPO in the hindgut and hindgut content of silkworm larvae. A, PPO was detected in the hindgut (HG1 and HG2) from larvae at different developmental stages. B, PPO was present in the contents of both hindgut regions, but was a little degraded during preparation. Corresponding gut content is shown under each lane. C, quick degradation of PPO in HG2 contents from larvae on wandering-stage. HG2 contents were suspended and incubated at room temperature for different times. PPO was almost degraded within 10 min. The arrow indicates PPO. The arrowhead indicates degraded PPO bands. D, PPO detected in feces. PPO was detected in freshly excreted feces from larvae on V-3 (black feces) but not on wandering-stage (green feces) by Western blot. E, comparison of PPO in plasma (0.5 μl), HG2 tissue supernatant (HG2(T), 10 μg), and HG2 content (HG2(C), collected from five larvae, with 10% of the suspension solution loaded). Band intensities were normalized to the amount of PPO in plasma in lane 1. About 45.9 ng of purified PPO was found in 1 μl of plasma (28Ashida M. Purification and characterization of pre-phenoloxidase from hemolymph of the silkworm Bombyx mori.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 144: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There was 12.92 ng of PPO in 10 μg of HG2 tissue supernatant. The amount of PPO in H2 content was 15.7 ng (7.83 ng × 10 ÷ 5) on average. P: plasma (V-3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PPO is a key enzyme in the silkworm that induces melanization around wounds and invading foreign particles (8Ashida M. Brey P. Recent Advances on the Research of the Insect Prophenoloxidase Cascade. Chapman & Hall, London1998Google Scholar). Similar to PPO, laccase and peroxidase also oxidize some phenols (10Kanost M.R. Gorman M.J. Phenoloxidases in Insect Immunity. Academic Press & Elsevier, San Diego2008Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar); thus, it was necessary to investigate which of these redox enzymes is responsible for the melanization of feces. When diluted 3,3′,5,5;-tetraMethylBenzidine (TMB) solution (1:50), which is a peroxidase substrate, was incubated with a commercial preparation of peroxidase (1.67 ng), it resulted in very high enzyme activity (Fig. 2A1). Laccase (3 μg) also oxidized TMB, but the activity was significantly lower than 1.67 ng of peroxidase. Purified recombinant Drosophila PPO1 (DmrPPO1, 1.25 μg) did not oxidize TMB after the PPO had been activated by ethanol (16Li X. Ma M. Liu F. Chen Y. Lu A. Ling Q.Z. Li J. Beerntsen B.T. Yu X.Q. Liu C. Ling E. Properties of Drosophila melanogaster prophenoloxidases expressed in Escherichia coli.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2012; 36: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). No peroxidase activity was present in HG1 and HG2 of the hindgut (Fig. 2A1). When ABTS solution (a laccase substrate) was added to DmrPPO1 or peroxidase, neither of them could oxidize this substrate (Fig. 2B1). Significant low laccase-like enzyme activity was observed in HG1 and HG2, but when NaN3 was added, they had almost the same activity as the group that did not receive NaN3, suggesting that ABTS oxidization was not due to laccase, as NaN3 is a potent inhibitor of laccase activity (27Dittmer N.T. Kanost M.R. Insect multicopper oxidases: diversity, properties, and physiological roles.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further, a Western blot assay using M. sexta laccase antibody did not detect any positive band in the hindgut content (supplemental Fig. S1). When dopamine, a very good PPO substrate, was added to different samples, DmrPPO1 oxidized the substrate very efficiently (Fig. 2C1). However, laccase and peroxidase minimally oxidized dopamine. Larval guts were stained using the above substrates with or without addition of ethanol. When TMB (Fig. 2A2) and ABTS (Fig. 2B2) were used, neither peroxidase nor laccase activity were detected in gut tissues. No staining occurred when dopamine was used if ethanol was absent (Fig. 2, C2-a). However, the foregut and hindgut were stained black if ethanol was added (Fig. 2, C2-b). When phenylthiourea (PTU) (strong PO activity inhibitor) but not NaN3 (laccase and peroxidase inhibitor) was added, melanization of the foregut and hindgut was clearly inhibited (Fig. 2, D and E). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that hindgut content melanization is a result of PPO activity, and accordingly that PPO might be present in the hindgut. Typical insect larvae of different Orders including Diptera (Drosophila melanogaster and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus), Isoptera (Coptotermes formosanus), Orthoptera (Dianemobius nigrofasciatus), Coleoptera (Tribolium castaneum), and Lepidoptera (Ostrinia furnaclis and Heliothis armigero) were dissected and stained as shown in Fig. 2, C2-b. Both the foregut and hindgut of all different species were stained black (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that PPO is present in the guts (foregut and hindgut) of other insect species as well. The larval hindgut (HG1 and HG2) was dissected out from larvae of different stages and then used for Western blot assay to detect PPO. The PPO protein was detected in hindgut tissues, and the band was at the corresponding position as plasma PPO (Fig. 3A). In wandering-stage larvae, many bands smaller than PPO appeared (<65 kDa). When sections of the hindgut were cultured in vitro, PPO was released into the culture medium according to native gel assay (supplemental Fig. S3). No PPO was found when sections of the midgut and s"

Ascorbate is the cofactor of several enzymes and one of the major components adjusting the redox state of cells. In plant tissue, it can reach millimolar concentrations and form up to 10% of the soluble carbohydrate content. Biosynthesis of ascorbate in plants mainly takes place via the “l-galactose” also known as “Smirnoff-Wheeler” pathway (9Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. The biosynthetic pathway of vitamin C in higher plants.Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The terminal step of this pathway, the conversion of l-galactono-1,4-lactone (GL) 2The abbreviations used are: GLl-galactono-1,4-lactoneGLDHl-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenaseCAcarbonic anhydraseBNblue native. into ascorbate, is catalyzed by l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH). GLDH is localized in mitochondria. During ascorbate formation, GLDH needs oxidized cytochrome c as the electron acceptor (10Mapson L.W. Isherwood F.A. Chen Y.T.

The primary GLDH translation product has a molecular mass of about 68 kDa but is processed to a mature protein of 56–58 kDa.

Because the mature protein lacks membrane spanning segments (16Leferink N.G. van den Berg W.A. van Berkel W.J. l-Galactono-γ-lactone dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis thaliana, a flavoprotein involved in vitamin C biosynthesis.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) it most likely is peripherally attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane. If overexpressed in Escherichia coli, GLDH forms part of the soluble fraction of this bacterium (16Leferink N.G. van den Berg W.A. van Berkel W.J. l-Galactono-γ-lactone dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis thaliana, a flavoprotein involved in vitamin C biosynthesis.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). About a decade ago, it surprisingly was discovered that GLDH is attached to the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I) of the respiratory chain (22Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Mitochondrial complex I from Arabidopsis and rice. Orthologs of mammalian and fungal components coupled with plant-specific subunits.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Complex I has a molecular mass of 1000 kDa and in plants includes at least 48 different subunits, several of which represent proteins specific for this enzyme complex in plants (23Klodmann J. Sunderhaus S. Nimtz M. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. Internal architecture of mitochondrial complex I from Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Klodmann J. Braun H.P. Proteomic approach to characterize mitochondrial complex I from plants.Phytochemistry. 2011; 72: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Some of these extra subunits integrate side activities into this respiratory complex, e.g. carboanhydrase (CA) subunits, which were proposed to support CO2 transfer from mitochondria to chloroplasts in plant cells (25Braun H.P. Zabaleta E. Carbonic anhydrase subunits of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I) in plants.Physiol. Plant. 2007; 129: 114-122Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, GLDH was not found to be attached to the 1000-kDa holoenzyme, but only to a slightly smaller version of complex I, which is of comparatively low abundance (13Millar A.H. Mittova V. Kiddle G. Heazlewood J.L. Bartoli C.G. Theodoulou F.L. Foyer C.H.

De Paepe R. l-Galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase is required for the accumulation of plant respiratory complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This complex has a molecular mass of about 850 kDa and obviously lacks some of the subunits present in the main form of complex I. The identity of these subunits is not known so far. GLDH activity is inhibited in the presence of rotenone, an inhibitor of electron transfer within complex I, if pyruvate and malate are used as respiratory substrates (13Millar A.H. Mittova V. Kiddle G. Heazlewood J.L. Bartoli C.G. Theodoulou F.L. Foyer C.H. Control of ascorbate synthesis by respiration and its implications for stress responses.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It therefore was speculated that a subpopulation of complex I particles are important for GLDH regulation by monitoring the rate of NADH-driven electron flow through complex I (13Millar A.H. Mittova V. Kiddle G. Heazlewood J.L. Bartoli C.G. Theodoulou F.L. Foyer C.H. Control of ascorbate synthesis by respiration and its implications for stress responses.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Silencing of the gene encoding GLDH in tomato does not much affect ascorbate concentration, indicating that GLDH activity is not rate-limiting for ascorbate formation (27Alhagdow M. Mounet F. Gilbert L. Nunes-Nesi A. Garcia V. Just D. Petit J. Beauvoit B. Fernie A.R. Rothan C. Baldet P. Silencing of the mitochondrial ascorbate synthesizing enzyme l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase affects plant and fruit development in tomato.Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1408-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, silenced plants have a clearly retarded growth and produce smaller fruits. At the same time, the central metabolism of plant mitochondria is significantly changed. It is concluded that GLDH is important for other processes besides ascorbate formation. Recently, characterization of an Arabidopsis knock-out mutant lacking the gene encoding GLDH was found to have drastically reduced amounts of complex I (26Pineau B. Layoune O. Danon A. De Paepe R. l-Galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase is required for the accumulation of plant respiratory complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amounts of the other protein complexes of the respiratory chain were not changed. It therefore is speculated that GLDH, besides its role in ascorbate formation, represents an assembly factor for complex I. Here we present a biochemical investigation on GLDH localization within plant mitochondria. Protein complexes of the inner mitochondrial membrane were carefully solubilized by the use of nonionic detergents and resolved protein complexes were separated by blue native PAGE. Using a newly developed in gel GLDH activity assay and immunoblotting, three distinct GLDH containing protein complexes of 850, 470, and 420 kDa were discovered. The 850-kDa complex represents the known smaller version of mitochondrial complex I. GLDH is shown to be attached to the membrane arm of the 850-kDa complex I. Subunits of the novel 470 and 420 kDa complexes were identified by mass spectrometry. Like the 850-kDa complex, they also include complex I subunits. We propose that GLDH has a more extended function in complex I assembly by specifically binding to several of its assembly intermediates. A. thaliana cells (var. Columbia-0) were cultivated as previously described (28Sunderhaus S. Dudkina N.V. Jänsch L. Klodmann J. Heinemeyer J. Perales M. Zabaleta E. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P.

Chem. 2006; 281: 6482-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Isolation of mitochondria was performed according to Werhahn et al. (29Werhahn W. Niemeyer A. Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H. Purification and characterization of the preprotein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane from Arabidopsis. Identification of multiple forms of TOM20.Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One-dimensional BN-PAGE and two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE was performed as previously described (30Heinemeyer J. Lewejohann D. Braun H.P. Blue native gel electrophoresis for the characterization of protein complexes in plants.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 355: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar).

Essential problems in quantification of proteins following colloidal staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dyes in polyacrylamide gels, and their solution.Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). After separation on polyacrylamide gels proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans Blot Cell from Bio-Rad. The transfer of proteins was performed as described in Kruft et al. (34Kruft V. Eubel H. Jänsch L. Werhahn W. Braun H.P. Proteomic approach to identify novel mitochondrial proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1694-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Immunostainings were carried out using the VectaStain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The carbonic anhydrase antibody was provided by Eduardo Zabaleta (Mar del Plata University, Argentina). The GLDH antibody was purchased from Agrisera Antibodies (Vännäs, Sweden). In gel staining for NADH-ubiquinone-oxidoreductase was carried out as previously described (35Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Quantification of muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation enzymes via histochemical staining of blue native polyacrylamide gels.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In gel activity staining of GLDH was performed as follows. After half-completion of the electrophoretic run of a BN-PAGE the Coomassie-containing cathode buffer was replaced by a cathode buffer without Coomassie for dye reduction within the gel. The gel was incubated in 100 ml of GLDH staining solution (40 mm Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 2 mm l-galactono-1,4-lactone, 1 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, 200 μm phenazine methosulfate) in the dark. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.8 (HCl). GLDH activity becomes visible as purple bands or spots after 15–30 min. The activity staining was stopped by rinsing the gel with water. To improve visualization and destain the background the gel was transferred into destaining solution (40% methanol and 10% acetic acid) overnight. The resulting gels were finally scanned on a transmission scanner (PowerLook III, UMAX). Tryptic digestion of proteins and MS were performed as described previously (23Klodmann J. Sunderhaus S. Nimtz M. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. Internal architecture of mitochondrial complex I from Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protein identifications were based on the MASCOT search algorithm using the A. thaliana protein data base, release TAIR10 (www.arabidopsis.org). Immunoblotting experiments were carried out to first get information on GLDH localization in plant mitochondria. For this approach, mitochondria were isolated from a suspension cell culture of A. thaliana. Isolated organelles were solubilized by 5% digitonin and protein complexes were subsequently separated by two-dimensional blue native (BN)/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Upon Coomassie staining, subunits of the mitochondrial protein complexes are visible as reported before (36Klodmann J. Senkler M. Rode C. Braun H.P. Defining the protein complex proteome of plant mitochondria.Plant Physiol. 2011; 157: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The main form of complex I runs at about 1000 kDa. In addition, a slightly smaller version of complex I is visible in accordance with previous investigations (13Millar A.H. Mittova V. Kiddle G. Heazlewood J.L. Bartoli C.G. Theodoulou F.L. Foyer C.H. Control of ascorbate synthesis by respiration and its implications for stress responses.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A.

It also includes an additional 58-kDa subunit not present in the main form of complex I. This protein represents GLDH as shown by a parallel immunoblotting experiment. Furthermore, the 58-kDa immune signal is detectable at two further regions on the two-dimensional gels, which correspond to 470 and 420 kDa on the native gel dimension. Finally, the 58-kDa GLDH signal is visible in the <100 kDa region of the native gel dimension. This signal represents the monomeric form of GLDH, which was reported previously (36Klodmann J. Senkler M. Rode C. Braun H.P. Defining the protein complex proteome of plant mitochondria.Plant Physiol. 2011; 157: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); see the two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE GelMap of Arabidopsis mitochondria (www.gelmap.de/47, spot 116). We conclude that GLDH not only forms part of the 850-kDa complex I*, but additionally of two unknown protein complexes of 470 and 420 kDa. An in gel activity assay was developed to investigate if the 850-, 470-, and 420-kDa complexes have GLDH activity. The assay includes 2 mm l-galactono-1,4-lactone to avoid substrate inhibition, which was reported to take place at higher concentrations (16Leferink N.G. van den Berg W.A. van Berkel W.J. l-Galactono-γ-lactone dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis thaliana, a flavoprotein involved in vitamin C biosynthesis.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oxidized cytochrome c was substituted by the electron acceptor phenazine methosulfate, which increases sensitivity of the assay. The pH of the assay solution was adjusted to 8.8 in accordance with the pH optimum of GLDH reported previously (16Leferink N.G. van den Berg W.A. van Berkel W.J. l-Galactono-γ-lactone dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis thaliana, a flavoprotein involved in vitamin C biosynthesis.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, nitro blue tetrazolium was used for GLDH activity visualization. This redox dye is yellow in its oxidized form and purple upon reduction into formazan (37Eadie M.J. Tyrer J.H. Kukums J.R. Hooper W.D. Aspects of tetrazolium salt reduction relevant to quantitative histochemistry.Histochemie. 1970; 21: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reduction takes place in the presence of ascorbate. Additionally, reduced phenazine methosulfate can directly reduce nitro blue tetrazolium, which may enhance the ascorbate-mediated color reaction. Nitro blue tetrazolium itself cannot be reduced directly by the GLDH. Using this assay, GLDH activity becomes visible on native protein gels as purple bands or spots. The principle of the assay is summarized in Fig. 2A and the details are given under “Experimental Procedures.” For performing the GLDH in gel activity assay, mitochondria were solubilized by digitonin and protein complexes were subsequently separated by one-dimensional BN PAGE (Fig. 2B). The 850-, 470-, and 420-kDa complexes exhibit strong GLDH activity. No activity is detectable in the absence of GL. The activity-stained bands exactly correspond to the signals obtained by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). The bands at 850, 470, and 420 kDa are not visible on a parallel Coomassie-stained gel indicating that the in gel GLDH activity assay has very high sensitivity. For further investigation of the 470- and 420-kDa complexes, a mitochondrial protein fraction was resolved by two-dimensional BN/BN PAGE (Fig. 3). First dimension BN PAGE was carried out in the presence of digitonin, second dimension BN PAGE in the presence of Triton X-100. On the resulting two-dimensional gels, most protein complexes are positioned on a diagonal line, but resolution is increased in comparison to one-dimensional BN PAGE due to differential effects of the two detergents on the individual protein complexes. Visualization of 850-, 470-, and 420-kDa complexes was carried out by in gel GLDH activity staining (Fig. 3). Both, the 470- and 420-kDa complexes again were not visible on a parallel Coomassie-stained BN/BN gel due to their low concentration (supplemental Fig. S3). The 470-kDa complex runs close to dimeric complex III (500 kDa). Although present at extremely low concentrations, gel spots representing the 470- and 420-kDa complexes were further analyzed by mass spectrometry. As expected, both protein complexes include GLDH (Table 1). Furthermore, and as expected, MS analysis of the 470-kDa complex revealed identification of complex III subunits (supplemental Table S2). This complex is of very high abundance and migrates in very close proximity to the 470-kDa complex on the BN/BN gel. However, the GLDH activity stain clearly is not at the position of complex III (Fig. 3). Strikingly, the 470-kDa complex additionally includes the CA2, CAL2, and Grim-19 subunits, which form part of the membrane arm of complex I in plants. Similarly, MS analysis of the 420-kDa complex revealed, besides GLDH, several subunits of the membrane arm of complex I: CA2, CA3, CAL2, and NAD2 (Table 1). Further complex I subunits were not identified, probably due to the low abundance of the 470- and 420-kDa complexes and due to the fact that the membrane arm of complex I mainly includes very hydrophobic subunits, which are difficult to detect by MS. Besides, some proteins of the HSP60 and malic enzyme complexes and the F1-part of ATP synthase were identified in the spot representing the 420-kDa complex (supplemental Table S2). However, as in the case of the 470-kDa complex, identification of these subunits rather reflects spot overlappings on our BN/BN gel than physical association of these proteins with GLDH, because these complexes run in very close proximity to the 420-kDa complex and are of very high abundance.FIGURE 1Immunological detection of l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase in a mitochondrial protein fraction of A. thaliana.

In this study, we have searched for novel factors that modulate Mylip/Idol and thereby possibly increase LDLR levels in cells. We have previously, using the yeast two-hybrid system, discovered a protein named Msap (MIR-interacting Saposin-like Protein) that interacts with Mylip/Idol in cells (14Bornhauser B.C. Olsson P.A.

Msap is a type-2 transmembrane protein that has a saposin-like domain in its structure (14Bornhauser B.C. Olsson P.A. Lindholm D.

A short guided tour through functional and structural features of saposin-like proteins.Biochem.

Cnpy2/Msap was shown to counteract the activities of Mylip/Idol, as evident from an increase in neurite outgrowth and cell migration that are both reduced by Mylip/Idol (14Bornhauser B.C. Olsson P.A.

The promoter region of mouse Mylip/Idol was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector to study gene activity. Mouse macrophage, Raw 264,7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and the human hepatocyte, Huh7 cell line in MEM with Glutamax (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 2–4 μg of expression plasmids or short hairpin (sh)-RNA constructs (SABiosciences, MD) using Transfectin or Fugene reagents. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations of FGF21 (R&D systems) alone or together with 3 μm simvastatin (Sigma) for various periods of times. The synthetic LXR ligand, GW3965 was used to induce Mylip/Idol, and actinomycin D (Sigma) to inhibit gene transcription, and Mg132 (Sigma) to block proteasomes. To assay LDL uptake, 5 μg/ml DiL-LDL (Molecular Probes) was added to the medium, and cells incubated further for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed, and the amount of DiI-LDL taken up was measured by a fluorometer and the values corrected for the total amount of protein. Dynasore (Sigma) inhibiting endocytosis was used as a negative control for the assay and blocked LDL uptake. Raw 264,7 cells were also treated with native or acetylated LDL prior to stimulation with FGF21 to study foam cell formation. Native LDL was isolated from fresh human plasma by ultracentrifugation (21Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H.

For colorimetric quantification, the cells were extensively washed with PBS, and the stain was solubilized in isopropanol. A490 was determined, and the results were normalized for total cell protein. Cells were lysed, and immunoblots were made essentially as previously described (23Korhonen L. Belluardo N. Lindholm D.

Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay and an equal amount of protein per sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences, Helsinki, Finland). The filters were first incubated for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% skimmed milk and then overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: Cnpy2/Msap (1:2000, Proteintech Europe), Mylip/Idol (1:1000, Abcam), anti-LDLR (1:2000; Cayman Chemical), rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Chemicon), mouse anti-GFP (1:5000, Roche), and anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma). After washing, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Espoo, Finland), followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Helsinki, Finland). Quantification was performed using GelDoc (Bio-Rad, Espoo, Finland). To study ubiquitination, N2a neuroblastoma cells were transfected with GFP-ubiquitin and Cnpy2/Msap-dsRed, and V5-Mylip/Idol plasmids for 24 h. Half of the cells received 5 μm MG321 (Sigma) to inhibit proteasomes. Lysates from precleared cell supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotary shaker using 2 μg/ml anti-LDLR or anti-V5 antibodies (Invitrogen). Immuncomplexes were bound to Sepharose-A for 2 h at 4 °C and recovered by centrifugation. Beads were washed three times, and the samples resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-LDLR, anti-Cnpy2/Msap, anti-Mylip/Idol, or anti-GFP antibodies. Blots were quantified by densitometry. Cells in 6-well plates were transfected for 24 h with 0.5 μg of Mylip/Idol promoter luciferase reporter and using the Transfectin reagent followed by treatment with 50 ng/ml FGF21 and/or 1 μm GW3965. To control for transfection efficiency, 0.02 μg of Renilla luciferase pRL-TK was used. Cells were harvested after 48 h using Passive Lysis Buffer, and the Renilla and the firefly luciferase activities were measured using a luminometer (Promega, Biofellows, Helsinki, Finland) (25Mudò G.

DyNAmoTM HS SYBR® Green (Thermo Scientific) real-time quantitative (qt) PCR assays were performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) with 384-well block. Each 10-μl quantitative PCR reaction contained 1 μl of the cDNA product, 1 μl of 5 μm each of the forward and reverse primers. The reaction was ran for 15 min at 95 °C for initial activation of the enzyme, followed by 35 cycles of 10s at 95 °C for denaturation, 30s at 63 °C for annealing and extension. After completion of the reaction, the PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis spanning the temperature range from 65 °C to 95 °C with a ramping rate of 0.03 °C/s. The specificity of the amplification was further confirmed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and stained with SYBR safe (Invitrogen). The results show the averages of four replicate experiments normalized to GAPDH. The following primer sequences were used for qtPCR: Cnpy2/Msap, forward (Fw), F 5′-GATCCTTCCGAATCAATCCA-3′ and Reverse (rev)5′-CTCTGAGCGGGCATAAGGTA-3′; Mylip/Idol, Fw, 5′-TGTGGAGCCTCATCTCA-TCTT-3′ and Rev, 5′-AGGGACTCTTTAA-TGTGCAAGAA-3′; LDLR, Fw, 5′-GCATC-AGCTTGGACAAGGTGT-3′ and Rev, 5′- GGGAACAGCCACCATTGTTG-3′; GAPDH: Fw- 5′-GGGTTCCTATAAATACGGACTGC-3′ and Rev, 5′-CCATTTTGTCTACGGGACGA-3′. Huh7 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml FGF21 to increase LDLR levels. 30 ng/ml actinomycinD was added to control and FGF21-treated cells to inhibit gene transcription (27Lindholm D. Heumann R.

Chem. 1988; 263: 16348-16351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were the incubated for various periods of time, and the amount of LDLR was determined by immunoblotting. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way Anova followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test. The Student's t test was used in experiments with two groups with GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Values are expressed as means ± S.E., and p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Cnpy2/Msap was previously shown to bind Mylip/Idol and to counteract the effect of this protein on neurite outgrowth (14Bornhauser B.C. Olsson P.A. Lindholm D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35412-35420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Data showed that overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLR levels in the mouse macrophage Raw 264.7 cell line and in Huh7 human hepatocytes (Fig. 1A). Cnpy2/Msap decreased Mylip/Idol in these cells (Fig. 1B), while down-regulation of Cnpy2/Msap using shRNA constructs increased the levels of Mylip/Idol (Fig. 1C). In control experiments, employing scrambled shRNA, there was no decrease in Mylip/Idol (Fig. 1D). Experiments using GFP-Mylip and MSAP-dsRed constructs revealed a significant overlap of these two proteins showing that they partly reside in the similar compartment in the cell (supplemental Fig. S1A). Mylip/Idol has previously been shown to be a rather unstable protein (7Zelcer N. Hong C. Boyadjian R. Tontonoz P.

We studied this using Mylip/Idol transfected cells in the absence or presence of Cnpy2/Msap. The ubiquitination of Mylip/Idol was increased by MG132, which inhibits proteasomes (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap strongly reduced Mylip/Idol levels and the ubiquitinated Mylip/Idol species were observed only after addition of MG321 to block further degradation (Fig. 2B). FGF21 is a circulating endocrine signal known to have metabolic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism (18Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J.

Neurosci. 2009; 30: 958-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We therefore studied whether the effects of FGF21 on lipids are linked to LDLR and its regulation. Addition of FGF21 significantly increased LDLR and Cnpy2/Msap in cultured human hepatocyte and mouse macrophage cells (Fig. 3). The effect of FGF21 on LDLRs was time and dose-dependent with an about 3.5-fold increase at 24 h of incubation (Fig. 3A), and using 50 ng/ml FGF21 (Fig. 3C). A similar time course and dose-dependence was also observed with regard to the increase in Cnpy2/Msap by FGF21 (Fig. 3, B and D). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that FGF21 increased LDLR and Cnpy2/Msap mRNA levels in these cells showing an effect of FGF21 on gene expression (supplemental Fig. S1). This was also supported by data obtained using actinomycin D to block RNA synthesis that inhibited the increase in gene expression upon FGF21 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1, there is a reciprocal regulation of Cnpy2/Msap and Mylip/Idol in cells. In line with this, we observed that FGF21 decreased Mylip/Idol levels particularly at 50 ng/ml FGF21 (Fig. 4A). Qt-PCR analyses showed that FGF21 decreased the mRNA levels of Mylip/Idol in these cells (Fig. 4B). This was confirmed in experiments employing the Mylip/Idol promoter luciferase reporter construct that showed a significant reduction in gene activity by FGF21 (Fig. 4D). Stimulation of Liver X Receptor (LXR) using the synthetic ligand, GW3695 was recently shown to increase gene expression of Mylip/Idol (7Zelcer N. Hong C. Boyadjian R. Tontonoz P.

Chem. 2011; 286: 30190-30199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We observed that the GW3695-mediated increase in Mylip/Idol was counteracted by FGF21 (Fig. 4D), suggest that there is interplay between the LXR and FGF21 signaling systems in the regulation of Mylip/Idol in cells. Apart from its effects on Mylip/Idol transcription, FGF21 increased LDLR and Cnpy2/Msap mRNA levels in these cells (Fig. 4, E and F), while Cnpy2/Msap overexpression decreased Mylip/Idol expression (Fig. 4C). Collectively, thus data shows that FGF21 has a dual gene effect in these cells decreasing Mylip/Idol and increasing Cnpy2/Msap that leads to increased LDLR levels. To study whether the decrease in Mylip/Idol induced by FGF21 influences the stability of LDLR, we pretreated cells for 20 h with 50 ng/ml FGF21 followed by the addition of actinomycin D to block gene transcription. LDLR levels decreased in control cells with a half-life about 6 h (Fig. 5). However, this half-life was increased by FGF21 and LDLR levels remained stable for up to 12 h in FGF21-treated cells (Fig. 5). Increased half-life and a decrease in receptor decay indicate enhanced stability of LDLR"
https://openalex.org/W2103833483,"β-Adrenergic receptor (AR) blockers provide substantial clinical benefits, including improving overall survival and left ventricular (LV) function following myocardial infarction (MI), though the mechanisms remain incompletely defined. The transverse-tubule (T-tubule) system of ventricular myocytes is an important determinant of cardiac excitation-contraction function. T-tubule remodeling occurs early during LV failure. We hypothesized that β-AR blockers prevent T-tubule remodeling and thereby provide therapeutic benefits. A murine model of MI was utilized to examine the effect of β-AR blockers on T-tubule remodeling following LV MI. We applied the in situ imaging of T-tubule structure from Langendorff-perfused intact hearts with laser scanning confocal microscopy. We found that MI caused remarkable T-tubule remodeling near the infarction border zone and moderate LV remodeling remote from the MI. Metoprolol and carvedilol administered 6 d after MI for 4 wk each increased the T-tubule integrity at the remote and border zones. At the molecular level, both β-AR blockers restored border and remote zone expression of junctophilin-2 (JP-2), which is involved in T-tubule organization and formation of the T-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions. In contrast, β-AR blockers had no significant effects on caveolin-3 expression. In summary, our data show that β-AR antagonists can protect against T-tubule remodeling after MI, suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism of action for this drug class. Preservation of JP-2 expression may contribute to the beneficial effects of metoprolol and carvedilol on T-tubule remodeling.— Chen, B., Li, Y., Jiang, S., Xie, Y.-P., Guo, A., Kutschke, W., Zimmerman, K., Weiss, R.

https://openalex.org/W2052477055,"Methyl CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MeCP2) mutations are implicated in Rett syndrome (RTT), one of the common causes of female mental retardation. Two MeCP2 isoforms have been reported: MeCP2_e2 (splicing of all four exons) and MeCP2_e1 (alternative splicing of exons 1, 3, and 4). Their relative expression levels vary among tissues, with MeCP2_e1 being more dominant in adult brain, whereas MeCP2_e2 is expressed more abundantly in placenta, liver, and skeletal muscle. In this study, we performed specific disruption of the MeCP2_e2-defining exon 2 using the Cre-loxP system and examined the consequences of selective loss of MeCP2_e2 function in vivo. We performed behavior evaluation, gene expression analysis, using RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, and histological analysis. We demonstrate that selective deletion of MeCP2_e2 does not result in RTT-associated neurological phenotypes but confers a survival disadvantage to embryos carrying a MeCP2_e2 null allele of maternal origin. In addition, we reveal a specific requirement for MeCP2_e2 function in extraembryonic tissue, where selective loss of MeCP2_e2 results in placenta defects and up-regulation of peg-1, as determined by the parental origin of the mutant allele. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel role for MeCP2 in normal placenta development and illustrate how paternal X chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic tissues confers a survival disadvantage for carriers of a mutant maternal MeCP2_e2 allele. Moreover, our findings provide an explanation for the absence of reports on MeCP2_e2-specific exon 2 mutations in RTT.

Bird A. The major form of MeCP2 has a novel N terminus generated by alternative splicing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1818-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Mnatzakanian G.N. Lohi H.

Their relative expression levels vary among tissues, with MeCP2_e1 being more dominant in adult brain, whereas MeCP2_e2 is expressed more abundantly in placenta, liver, and skeletal muscle (10Mnatzakanian G.N. Lohi H. Munteanu I. Alfred S.E. Yamada T. MacLeod P.J. Jones J.R. Scherer S.W. Schanen N.C. Friez M.J. Vincent J.B.

The most common MeCP2 mutations in RTT occur in exons shared by both isoforms (11Bienvenu T. Chelly J. Molecular genetics of Rett syndrome. When DNA methylation goes unrecognized.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, no mutation in the MeCP2_e2-defining exon 2 has ever been reported in RTT. In this study, we performed specific disruption of the MeCP2_e2-defining exon 2 using the Cre-loxP system and examined the consequences of selective loss of MeCP2_e2 function in vivo. Rett syndrome tetracycline-responsive promoter tetracycline transactivator X chromosome inactivation phosphoglycerate kinase. The MeCP2_e2 null allele was generated by Cre recombinase-mediated excision of exon 2 in MeCP2_e2 conditional mice (Fig. 1). MeCP2 sequences were either directly derived or amplified from genomic DNA obtained from CJ7 ES cells or a BAC clone carrying the MeCP2 locus. The 5′-end of the targeting vector consisted of a 1.2-kb region possessing homology to intron 1 and was generated by high fidelity PCR. The early part of exon 2 containing the untranslated region (referred to as exon 2x) was fused to the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) gene, having a stop codon and poly(A) sequence. The latter half of exon 2 (referred to as exon 2y) beginning from the ATG start site of MeCP2_e2 was placed under the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter, TRE. A pair of loxP sites flanked this TRE-exon 2y sequence. A PGK-driven neomycin selection marker was positioned between the first loxP site and the TRE-2y region. The 3′ arm of the targeting vector consisted of a 5.9-kb EcoRI fragment derived from intron 2. A correctly targeted ES cell clone, confirmed by Southern blot analysis, was injected into 3.5-day postconception (dpc) C57BL/6J blastocysts. Approximately 10 ES cells were injected per blastocyst, and 20 blastocysts were transferred to each pseudopregnant recipient. The resulting chimeric offspring were intercrossed mice to generate F1 progeny. For deletion of MeCP2_e2, we crossed MeCP2_e2+/2loxP females with deleter mice carrying a Cre recombinase transgene under the control of the Nestin promoter. However, leaky expression from Nestin promoter-driven Cre recombinase induced a deletion in the germ line, resulting in progeny that carried the MeCP2_e2 null allele (Xe2−). This population was expanded and used in succeeding experiments. Genotypes of the resulting progeny were assessed by an initial PCR screen followed by two sets of Southern blotting. The MeCP2_e2 null allele was generated by Cre recombinase-mediated excision of exon 2 in MeCP2_e2 conditional mice (Fig. 1). A previously reported MeCP2 null mouse, B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2tm1.1Bird> (described as MeCP2−/y), generated by targeted disruption of exons 3 and 4 (12Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. A mouse Mecp2-null mutation causes neurological symptoms that mimic Rett syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), was obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and used as a control for some of the experiments. All animal studies were performed with the approval of the Animal Care Committee of the National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan. We prepared 3–8 fresh frozen brains and placentas of various genotypes at 13.5 dpc and postnatal days 0 (P0) and 28 (P28). Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissue using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. We carried out reverse transcription with the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) or TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using oligo(dT). Primer sequences and annealing conditions are as follows: for MECP2 exons 2 and 3, 5′-TTAGGGCTCAGGGAGGAAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAAATCATTAGGGTCCAAGG-3′ (reverse) with annealing temperature of 50 °C and expected PCR product size of 451 bp; for MECP2 exons 3 and 4, 5′-ATTATCCGTGACCGGGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATGCTGCTGCCTTTGGT-3′ (reverse) with annealing temperature of 55 °C and an expected PCR product size of 354 bp. For quantitative analysis, we carried out PCR amplifications using Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations in a real-time ABI PRISM 7700 platform (Applied Biosystems). Relative transcript ratios were normalized to GAPDH RNA. Primers and probes for mouse MeCP2 (common sequence of MeCP2_e2 and MeCP2_e1), MeCP2_e2, MAP2, IGFBP3, and BDNF are available from Applied Biosystems. The probes 5′-CGCCGAGCGGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGTCTTCTGACTTTTCTTCCA were designed to amplify a portion of the MeCP2_e1 transcript, and a probe of CCTCCTCGCCTCCTCC-3′ was used. Sequence Detection System 1.7 software (Applied Biosystems) was used for analysis. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Three-micrometer sections were prepared and stained with cresyl violet to visualize neurons. Purified MeCP2 antibody (provided by Dr. S. Kudo, Hokkaido Institute of Public Health, Sapporo, Japan), cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), Peg-1 antibody (Atlas Antibodies AB, Stockholm, Sweden), and CRCX4 antibody (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) were used for immunohistological experiments. TUNEL assays were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommendations. We performed tail suspension, footprinting, and open field analysis, using 4- or 5-week-old wild-type, MeCP2_e2−, MeCP2_e22loxP, and MeCP2−/y males. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ2 test. Animal crossings were performed to evaluate the effect of parent-specific transmission of the MeCP2_e2 null allele using appropriate sample sizes. Statistical significance of the expression levels was evaluated using Student's t test with a significance level of p < 0.05. We generated the MeCP2_e2 mutant allele (Xe2−) by crossing mice carrying a tetracycline-inducible MeCP2_e2 conditional allele (X2loxP) with deleter mice carrying a Nestin-driven Cre recombinase transgene (Fig. 1). We observed germ line transmission of the MeCP2_e2 null allele in some of the F3 generation (Fig. 1), probably resulting from leaky expression of Nestin-driven Cre recombinase in non-brain tissue. This subpopulation was expanded, and the F10 to F12 generations were used for the experiments in this study. We confirmed loss of MeCP2_e2 expression, whereas MeCP2_e1 transcription remained intact in these animals (Fig. 2, a and c). Brain histological analysis showed no difference between MeCP2_e2 null mouse and wild-type mice (Fig. 2b). At birth, mice carrying MeCP2_e2 mutant alleles were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. They developed into fertile adults and did not display any neurological deficits observed in murine models for RTT (12Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A.

Genet. 2001; 27: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), indicating that MeCP2_e1 is sufficient to carry on the functions of MeCP2 in the brain. Moreover, mice carrying MeCP2_e2 mutant alleles lived as long as their wild-type siblings, over 2 years (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining of brain tissue from Xe2−Y and XwtXe2− animals at 28 days of age revealed normal morphology of neuronal layers in contrast to the denser packaging of neurons in a previously reported RTT model wherein both MeCP2 isoforms have been knocked out (Fig. 2b) (14Fukuda T. Itoh M. Ichikawa T. Washiyama K. Goto Y. Delayed maturation of neuronal architecture and synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex of Mecp2-deficient mice.J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of MeCP2_e1 function is not sufficient to cause RTT-associated neurological phenotypes. To examine the implications of MeCP2_e2 deficiency on MeCP2 transcriptional silencing activity, we checked mRNA levels of two MeCP2-regulated genes, insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) (16Chang Y.S.

Greenberg M.E. Derepression of BDNF transcription involves calcium-dependent phosphorylation of MeCP2.Science. 2003; 302: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of these genes in brains of Xe2−Y mice did not significantly differ from those of age-matched wild-type males (Fig. 2d). In contrast, IGFBP3 and BDNF transcript levels increased by 1.6- and 2-fold, respectively, in the X−Y total MeCP2 knockout. These findings indicate that MeCP2_e2 is not essential for mediating transcriptional silencing of MeCP2 target genes in the brain. We next examined whether MeCP2_e2 deficiency mediated any other non-neuronal phenotype. Interestingly, we observed reduced births of progeny that carried MeCP2_e2 null allele of maternal origin. Specifically, we found a 76% reduction in Xe2−Y males and a 44% reduction in Xe2−Xwt females born to XwtXe2− female and wild-type male pairings (Table 1). Similarly, in Xe2−Xwt and Xe2−Y pairings, Xe2−Y and Xe2−Xe2− births were reduced by 50 and 60%, respectively (Table 2). In contrast, birth rates of XwtXe2− females (having a paternal Xe2−) did not deviate from the expected values (TABLE 2, TABLE 3). We exclude the possibility that these were nonspecific effects resulting from toxicity of the tTA in the targeting vector because no such decreases in births were observed in an unrelated transgenic mouse model carrying the same vector backbone. 6A. Otsuki and A. Kurimasa, unpublished results. Taken together, these results point to an association between reduced embryo viability and a maternally transmitted MeCP2_e2 null allele.TABLE 1Offspring distribution at 4 weeks of age; crossing of XwtXe2− females and XwtY males (maternal transmission of MeCP2_e2 null allele)XwtXwtXe2−XwtXwtYXe2−YTotalObserved522710112192(27%)(14%)(53%)(6%)Estimated48484848192(25%)(25%)(25%)(25%)% Change8%−44%−112%−76% Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Offspring distribution at 4 weeks of age; crossing of XwtXe2− females and Xe2−Y males (biparental transmission of MeCP2_e2 null allele)XwtXe2−Xe2−Xe2−XwtYXe2−YTotalObserved11420540(28%)(10%)(50%)(12%)Estimated1010101040(25%)(25%)(25%)(25%)% Change10%−60%100%−50% Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Offspring distribution at 4 weeks of age; crossing of XwtXwt females and Xe2−Y males (paternal transmission of MeCP2_e2 null allele)XwtXe2−XwtYTotalObserved5055105(48%)(52%)Estimated52.552.5105(50%)(50%)% Change−4%4% Open table in a new tab To further delineate the time period at which selection against embryos carrying maternal MeCP2_e2 null alleles occurred, we examined the genotype distribution at 13.5 dpc and observed similar trends (TABLE 4, TABLE 5). Moreover, we did not find any evidence of resorbed embryos at this time point (data not shown). We also performed morphological assessment of the uterus at preimplantation and postimplantation stages and found no abnormalities in preimplantation sites and the implantation process (data not shown). Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the reduced number of embryos carrying a mutant maternal MeCP2_e2 allele is due neither to a failure in implantation nor to embryo lethality at postimplantation but to reduced viability of the embryo prior to implantation or early embryonic lethality after implantation.TABLE 4Offspring distribution at 13.5 dpc; crossing of XwtXe2− females and XwtY males (maternal transmission of MeCP2_e2 null allele)XwtXwtXe2−XwtXwtYXe2−YTotalObserved36284618128(28%)(22%)(36%)(14%)Estimated32323232128(25%)(25%)(25%)(25%)% Change13%−13%44%−44% Open table in a new tab TABLE 5Offspring distribution at 13.5 dpc; crossing of XwtXwt females and Xe2−Y males (paternal transmission of MeCP2_e2 null allele)XwtXe2−XwtYTotalObserved271744(61%)(39%)Estimated222244(50%)(50%)% Change23%−23% Open table in a new tab During early development of the female mammal, one of the two X chromosomes becomes transcriptionally inactive to allow dosage compensation of X-linked genes (19Mak W.

Imprinted X inactivation and reprogramming in the preimplantation mouse embryo.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R59-R64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mouse extraembryonic lineages, such as placenta, the paternally derived X chromosome undergoes preferential inactivation, a phenomenon called imprinted paternal X chromosome inactivation (XCI) (21Takagi N. Sasaki M. Preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome in the extraembryonic membranes of the mouse.Nature. 1975; 256: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 22Harper M.I. Fosten M. Monk M. Preferential paternal X inactivation in extraembryonic tissues of early mouse embryos.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 67: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the effect of MeCP2_e2 deficiency in placenta tissue at 13.5 dpc. Interestingly, placentas of embryos carrying a maternal MeCP2_e2 null allele exhibited increased apoptosis, which was more notable in placentas of males (Fig. 3). These TUNEL-positive cells expressed peg-1 (supplemental Fig. 1), an imprinted gene known to function in placenta development (23Obata Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Koide T. Takai Y. Ueda T. Domeki I.

Burton G.J. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Imprinted genes in the placenta. A review.Placenta. 2005; 26: S10-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, very few apoptotic cells were observed in the placenta of XwtXe2− embryos carrying a paternal MeCP2_e2 null allele (Fig. 3). In addition, immunostaining revealed increased Peg-1 levels in cells expressing CXCR4, a trophoblast marker (25Wu X. Li D.J. Yuan M.M. Zhu Y. Wang M.Y. The expression of CXCR4/CXCL12 in first-trimester human trophoblast cells.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in the placenta of animals carrying a maternal MeCP2_e2 null allele (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 1). Taken together, our results indicate that MeCP2_e2 is essential for the maintenance of peg-1 silencing in trophoblast cells and that elevated expression of peg-1 in the placenta has deleterious effects on cell survival.FIGURE 4Loss of maternal MeCP2_e2 results in failure to silence peg-1 expression in trophoblast cells. CXCR4 is a trophoblast cell marker. Xwt/Y and Xe2−Xwt placenta have minimal peg-1 expression, whereas Xe2−/Y placenta show elevated peg-1 levels in trophoblast cells (arrows). Scale bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined transcript levels of peg-1 and other imprinted genes involved in placenta function, such as peg-3, igf-2, and h19 (23Obata Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Koide T. Takai Y. Ueda T. Domeki I. Shiroishi T. Ishino F. Kono T. Disruption of primary imprinting during oocyte growth leads to the modified expression of imprinted genes during embryogenesis.Development. 1998; 125: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these four genes, peg-1 exhibited elevated transcript levels in the placenta of embryos carrying a maternal mutant allele (Fig. 5a), in concordance with our immunohistological findings. The mRNA levels of the other three genes were unchanged (Fig. 5a). In placentas of animals carrying the MeCP2 two-isoform knock-out allele, peg-1 expression was also elevated (Fig. 5b). The peg-1 transcript levels were not due to deregulation of imprinting in placenta because imprinted paternal XCI was found to be intact in these animals (Fig. 5c). Rather, elevated peg-1 transcript levels directly correlate with the loss of MeCP2_e2 expression effected by imprinted paternal XCI. These findings indicate that MeCP2_e2-specific transcriptional silencing activity is essential for the regulation of peg-1 expression and possibly of other genes in placenta. The imprinted gene peg-1, located in murine chromosome 6, has been reported to play a role in angiogenesis in extraembryonic tissue (26Mayer W. Hemberger M. Frank H.G. Grümmer R. Winterhager E. Kaufmann P. Fundele R. Expression of the imprinted genes MEST/Mest in human and murine placenta suggests a role in angiogenesis.Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mutations in peg-1 have also been implicated in placenta failure (24Coan P.M. Burton G.J. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Imprinted genes in the placenta.

Genet. 1998; 20: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). One group has reported that paternally expressed transcripts are associated with premature placenta (28Looijenga L.H. Gillis A.J. Verkerk A.J. van Putten W.L. Oosterhuis J.W. Heterogeneous X inactivation in trophoblastic cells of human full-term female placentas.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1445-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, paternal transmission of a peg-1 null allele in heterozygous mice results in diminished postnatal survival rates, whereas maternal transmission does not generate any remarkable phenotype (27Lefebvre L. Viville S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Keverne E.B. Surani M.A. Abnormal maternal behavior and growth retardation associated with loss of the imprinted gene Mest.Nat.

Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 309-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear from these reports that deregulation of peg-1 expression or imprinting status has deleterious consequences on embryo viability and placenta function. Our current study demonstrates that MeCP2_e2 is an essential regulator of peg-1 expression in extraembryonic tissue. As for how increased peg-1 expression correlates with observed placenta defects in carriers of a maternal MeCP2_e2 null allele, we propose a scenario wherein perturbations in peg-1 expression results in disruption of biological pathways that involve Peg-1, leading to enhanced apoptosis in placenta. Peg-1 is a membrane-bound protein that is predicted to have lipase or acyltransferase activity based on sequence homology with the α/β-hydrolase superfamily of proteins (30Nikonova L. Koza R.A. Mendoza T. Chao P.M. Curley J.P. Kozak L.P. Mesoderm-specific transcript is associated with fat mass expansion in response to a positive energy balance.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3925-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lipid metabolism is a very important biological process and is critical for the developing embryo and placenta. We propose that loss of MeCP2_e2 results in failure to transcriptionally silence peg-1 in extraembryonic tissue, leading to increased Peg-1 enzymatic activity, aberrant regulation of Peg-1 binding partners or downstream targets, and, ultimately, apoptosis. We have earlier stated that we found the implantation process to be normal for these animals. Moreover, at 13.5 dpc, there was no evidence of resorbed embryos, and the skewed embryo genotypes resembled that from postnatal analysis. These results, taken together with the increased number of apoptotic trophoblast cells and elevated peg-1 expression in embryos carrying a maternal MeCP2_e2 null allele, suggest that the loss of MeCP2_e2 leads to trophoblast dysfunction during preimplantation through abnormal peg-1 expression. Furthermore, we view the increase in apoptotic trophoblast cells as a persisting phenotype brought about by early perturbation of placenta gene expression. In mice, placental development begins in the blastocyst at embryonic day 3.5 when the trophectoderm layer becomes distinct from the inner cell mass (32Watson E.D. Cross J.C. Development of structures and transport functions in the mouse placenta.Physiology. 2005; 20: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The trophoblast that lines the blastocyst plays an important role during attachment to the endometrium and in the formation of the placenta (31Lee K.Y. Jeong J.W. Tsai S.Y. Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Mouse models of implantation.Trends Endcrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 234-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Watson E.D. Cross J.C. Development of structures and transport functions in the mouse placenta.Physiology. 2005; 20: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). It has been reported by other groups that trophoblast dysfunction leads to disruption of placenta formation and reduction of birth number (31Lee K.Y. Jeong J.W. Tsai S.Y. Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J.

In our current study, we have shown that loss of MeCP2_e2 results in a trophoblast defect that ultimately leads to reduced embryo viability. Because some carriers of a mutant MeCP2_e2 allele are born and develop into healthy adults, we hypothesize that the placenta abnormalities in these animals may have been overcome by de novo MeCP2_e1 compensation or some other adaptation. In some types of extraembryonic cells, XCI can follow either a paternal or maternal pattern (34Migeon B.R. Wolf S.F. Axelman J. Kaslow D.C. Schmidt M.

Verkerk A.J. van Putten W.L. Oosterhuis J.W. Heterogeneous X inactivation in trophoblastic cells of human full-term female placentas.Am. J. Hum.

Martin D. Verloès A. Grandemenge A. Jonveaux P. MECP2 mutations or polymorphisms in mentally retarded boys. Diagnostic implications.Mol. Diagn. 2003; 7: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of MeCP2_e2 correlated with up-regulation of peg-1 expression, indicating a disturbance in regulation of downstream MeCP2 gene targets. Although increased apoptosis in placenta could be used to explain the decreased viability of Xe2−Y mice, this may also be interpreted as a way to eliminate functionally defective cells, thus contributing to the survival of some embryos. The deleterious effects of MeCP2 mutations have been viewed mostly in the context of somatic XCI patterns. A number of studies have addressed the contribution of XCI to the pathogenesis of MeCP2 mutations (38Shahbazian M.D. Sun Y. Zoghbi H.Y.

Our findings indicate that this is not the full picture and that paternal X chromosome inactivation in the extraembryonic lineage also contributes to the deleterious consequences of MeCP2 mutations and, most likely, other X-linked gene mutations. Recently, it has been reported that transgenic expression of either the MeCP2_e1 or MeCP2_e2 splice variant prevents the development of RTT-like neuronal phenotypic manifestations in a mouse model lacking MeCP2. This finding indicates that either MeCP2 splice variant is sufficient to fulfill MeCP2 function in the mouse brain (40Kerr B. Soto C.J. Saez M. Abrams A. Walz K. Young J.I. Transgenic complementation of MeCP2 deficiency. Phenotypic rescue of Mecp2-null mice by isoform-specific transgenes.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 20: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of MeCP2 mutations in extraembryonic tissue, wherein maternally inherited MeCP2_e2 mutations result in placenta abnormalities that ultimately lead to a survival disadvantage for carriers of this mutant allele. Our study also provides an explanation for the absence of reports on MeCP2_e2-specific exon 2 mutations in RTT. It is conceivable that MeCP2_e2 mutations in humans may result in a phenotype that evades a diagnosis of RTT. Moreover, the possible link between a novel genetic disorder characterized by reduced embryo viability and MeCP2 exon 2 mutations is a concept that merits further exploration. In summary, we have demonstrated that MeCP2_e2 is dispensable for RTT-associated neurological phenotypes. We have also discovered a novel requirement for MeCP2_e2 in placenta and embryo viability and have provided proof of existence of isoform-specific functions for two MeCP2 splicing variants.

https://openalex.org/W2009408802,"A number of recent studies have used pharmacological inhibitors to establish a role for protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) in synaptic plasticity and memory. These studies use zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) and chelerythrine as inhibitors of PKMζ to block long term potentiation and memory; staurosporine is used as a negative control to show that a nonspecific kinase inhibitor does not block long term potentiation and memory. Here, we show that neither ZIP nor chelerythrine inhibits PKMζ in cultured cells or brain slices. In contrast, staurosporine does block PKMζ activity in cells and brain slices by inhibiting its upstream phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. These studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of drugs against purified PKMζ may not be indicative of their specificity in the more complex environment of the cell and suggest that PKMζ is unlikely to be the mediator of synaptic plasticity or memory."
https://openalex.org/W2012588700,"Osteoclastogenesis is a highly regulated process governed by diverse classes of regulators. Among them, nuclear factor of activated T-cells calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1) is the primary osteoclastogenic transcription factor, and its expression is transcriptionally induced during early osteoclastogenesis by receptor activation of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), an osteoclastogenic cytokine. Here, we report the novel enzymatic function of JMJD5, which regulates NFATc1 protein stability. Among the tested Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins, decreased mRNA expression levels during osteoclastogenesis were found for JMJD5 in RAW264 cells stimulated by RANKL. To examine the functional role of JMJD5 in osteoclast differentiation, we established stable JMJD5 knockdown cells, and osteoclast formation was assessed. Down-regulated expression of JMJD5 led to accelerated osteoclast formation together with induction of several osteoclast-specific genes such as Ctsk and DC-STAMP, suggesting that JMJD5 is a negative regulator in osteoclast differentiation. Although JMJD5 was recently reported as a histone demethylase for histone H3K36me2, no histone demethylase activity was detected in JMJD5 in vitro or in living cells, even for other methylated histone residues. Instead, JMJD5 co-repressed transcriptional activity by destabilizing NFATc1 protein. Protein hydroxylase activity mediated by the JmjC domain in JMJD5 was required for the observed functions of JMJD5. JMJD5 induced the association of hydroxylated NFATc1 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), thereby presumably facilitating proteasomal degradation of NFATc1 via ubiquitination.

During cell maturation, mononuclear precursor cells fuse to generate multinucleated osteoclasts. This multinucleation process is necessarily required for osteoclastic maturation to undergo efficient bone resorption (7Vignery A.

In reorganizing genetic networks during osteoclastogenesis, diverse transcription factors play pivotal roles, and among them, nuclear factor of activated T-cells calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1) is the necessary and sufficient transcription factor (9Takayanagi H.

Moreover, ectopic expression of NFATc1 in osteoclast precursor cells efficiently induces osteoclastogenesis even in the absence of RANKL stimulation (10Hirotani H. Tuohy N.A. Woo J.T. Stern P.H.

Supporting the importance of NFATc1 in osteoclastogenesis, NFATc1 is a transcriptional inducer of several osteoclast-specific genes (required for maturation and bone resorption activity of osteoclasts), including DC-STAMP (dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein), OSCAR (osteoclast-associated receptor), Acp5 (acid phosphatase 5, tartrate-resistant), and Ctsk (cathepsin K) (9Takayanagi H.

Once the Nfatc1 gene is induced, an autoregulatory loop is established in which it binds to its own promoter region, leading to its robust induction (16Asagiri M. Sato K. Usami T. Ochi S. Nishina H. Yoshida H. Morita I. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Serfling E. Takayanagi H. Autoamplification of NFATc1 expression determines its essential role in bone homeostasis.J. Exp.

On the other hand, it was recently reported that NFATc1 protein is degraded during late stages of osteoclast differentiation by Cbl protein-mediated ubiquitination (19Kim J.H. Kim K. Jin H.M. Song I. Youn B.U. Lee S.H. Choi Y. Kim N. Negative feedback control of osteoclast formation through ubiquitin-mediated down-regulation of NFATc1.J. Biol.

Therefore, it is conceivable that NFATc1 activity is controlled by its protein stability through post-translational regulation. The importance of epigenetic modification of histone tails has emerged in studies of the regulation of cellular differentiation, and a histone methylation signature generally appears upstream in epigenetic regulation of transcription. Among various histone methylation modifiers, Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins have recently been reported to bear histone demethylase activity. Indeed, several kinds of JmjC domain-containing proteins have been identified as histone demethylases, including JHDM1 for the lysine 36 residue in histone H3 (H3K36), JHDM2 for H3K27, and so on (20Tsukada Y.

FIH1 post-translationally hydroxylates HIF1α on its asparagine residue, and hydroxylated HIF1α was shown to be a transcriptionally inactive form because of inhibition of cognate co-activator interaction (24Lando D.

Taken together, it is now believed that JmjC domain-containing proteins exert enzymatic activity as protein hydroxylases besides histone demethylases. However, the functions of JmjC domain-containing proteins during osteoclastogenesis remain to be studied. In this study, we show that one of the epigenetic regulators, a JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJD5, negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis by reducing the stability of NFATc1 protein via its hydroxylase activity. Moreover, JMJD5 was found to induce the association of NFATc1 with E3 ubiquitin ligase Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) in HEK293T cells. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the enzymatic function of a JmjC domain-containing protein acts as a post-translational co-repressor of a primary transcription factor during osteoclastogenesis. Full-length cDNA of mouse JMJD5 was obtained by RT-PCR from total RNA of mouse heart and cloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG or the pcDNA3.1-Myc mammalian expression plasmids (Invitrogen). To generate an expression plasmid of ZsGreen-tagged JMJD5, cDNA for ZsGreen protein was amplified from pZsGreen1-DR plasmid (Clontech) by PCR. Amplified cDNA was subcloned into the C terminus of the previously generated pcDNA3-FLAG-JMJD5 plasmid. The point mutant FLAG-JMJD5-K334A plasmid was generated from the wild-type plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (28Baba A. Ohtake F. Okuno Y. Yokota K. Okada M. Imai Y. Ni M. Meyer C.A. Igarashi K.

GST-fused JMJD5 and mutant JMJD5-K334A expression plasmids were generated by subcloning into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. Full-length cDNAs of mouse NFATc1α and NFATc1β were obtained by RT-PCR from mouse spleen and cloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG or the pcDNA3.1-Myc mammalian expression vector. To generate GST-fused truncated NFATc1α constructs, amino acids 1–300, 301–596, and 589–827 were partially amplified by PCR from pcDNA-FLAG-NFATc1α plasmid and then subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. A full-length cDNA of mouse FIH1 was obtained by RT-PCR from mouse testis and cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. A full-length cDNA of mouse p105 was obtained by RT-PCR from total RNA of mouse spleen and cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. For the GST-fused p105-ARD expression plasmid, amino acids 537–809 were partially amplified by PCR from a full-length plasmid and then subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. Sequences of all cDNAs were verified by automated sequencing. For the NFATc1-response element (RE) reporter plasmid, the mouse Acp5 promoter (−485 to +525) was amplified from genomic DNA of RAW264 cells and cloned into the upstream region of the luciferase gene derived from pGL4.10 (luc2) vector (Promega). Oligonucleotide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting mouse JMJD5 (shRNA 1; 5′-GGAAGGAAGTACATCCGATTG-3′) was inserted into the pSUPER-Retro vector (OligoEngine) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JHR Biosciences) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). MG132 (Calbiochem) was used at a concentration of 10 μm. Transient transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An oligonucleotide siRNA targeting human JMJD5 (siGENOME SMARTpool; 5′-AGCCAAGGGACGUCGGGUA-3′, 5′-UCAACGAGUUCAUCAGCAA-3′, 5′-GAAGUUGGUUCGAGGUACA-3′, and 5′-CCACUGAGCUCUUCUACGA-3′) and a control oligonucleotide siRNA (siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA pool 1) were purchased from Thermo Scientific. For high knockdown efficiency, siRNA was transfected twice for 4 days. RAW264 cells were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JHR Biosciences), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen), and 1% minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). For osteoclastogenesis, RAW264 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/dish or in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well and were treated with 235 ng/ml GST-RANKL (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.) for 6 days (29Youn M.Y.

The medium was changed every 2nd day. Differentiated cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and visualized with an Olympus IX70 light microscope equipped with Zeiss AxioVision 4.6. RAW264 cells were transfected with the pSUPER-mJMJD5-shRNA plasmid by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

For real time RT-PCR, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA with oligo(dT) and random hexamers using a PrimeScript RT Reagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Inc.) and the Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (Applied Biosystems). For an internal control, the Gapdh gene was used. The primers were purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA with oligo(dT) using SSIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and cDNA was amplified with the indicated primer sets. All primer sets used are indicated in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. HEK293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with the NFATc1-RE reporter plasmid (500 ng) together with each expression vector (700 ng). Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection with pGL4.75 (hRluc/CMV) (5 ng). After 36 h, a luciferase assay was performed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Decarboxylation assays of 14C-radiolabeled 2-OG were performed as reported previously (26Cockman M.E. Lancaster D.E. Stolze I.P. Hewitson K.S. McDonough M.A. Coleman M.L. Coles C.H. Yu X. Hay R.T.

Briefly, 80 μm enzyme, 80 μm substrate, 24 μm 14C-radiolabeled 2-OG, 576 μm 2-OG, 8 mm sodium ascorbate, 200 μm (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, and 2 mm DTT were mixed in a total volume of 100 μl with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). A 500-μl Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of hyamine hydroxide (Fisher Scientific) was added to each tube, and tubes were closed with a rubber septum. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by setting tubes on ice for 30 min. Then Eppendorf tubes containing the hyamine hydroxide were transferred to scintillation vials and mixed with OptiPhase Hisafe 2 Liquid Scintillation Mixture (Fisher Scientific). Total released 14C counts were quantified using an LSC-5100 scintillation counter (Aloka). Data were analyzed by two-tailed Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was accepted as significant.

Briefly, established plasmids for GST-fused proteins were transformed into Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen), which was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. GST-fused protein was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and incubation at 25 °C for 5 h. Cell pellets were resuspended with LEW-Tween 20 buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH7.4) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and sonicated with a UD-200 ultrasonic disruptor (Tomy). After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), and bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm glutathione (Wako). Ion exchange chromatography (ÄKTA Mono Q column, GE Healthcare) yielded highly pure GST-fused proteins that were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-JMJD5-ZsGreen plasmid. After 24 h of transfection, cells were plated in Lab-TekII chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International).

Leishmania chagasi) parasite in the gut, but the extent to which the parasite interacts with the immune system of the insect vector is unknown. To investigate the sand fly immune response and its interaction with the Leishmania parasite, we identified a homologue for caspar, a negative regulator of immune deficiency signaling pathway. We found that feeding antibiotics to adult female L. longipalpis resulted in an up-regulation of caspar expression relative to controls. caspar was differentially expressed when females were fed on gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. caspar expression was significantly down-regulated in females between 3 and 6 days after a blood feed containing Leishmania mexicana amastigotes. RNA interference was used to deplete caspar expression in female L. longipalpis, which were subsequently fed with Leishmania in a blood meal. Sand fly gut populations of both L. mexicana and L. infantum were significantly reduced in caspar-depleted females. The prevalence of L. infantum infection in the females fell from 85 to 45%. Our results provide the first insight into the operation of immune homeostasis in phlebotomine sand flies during the growth of bacterial and Leishmania populations in the digestive tract. We have demonstrated that the activation of the sand fly immune system, via depletion of a single gene, can lead to the abortion of Leishmania development and the disruption of transmission by the phlebotomine sand fly."
https://openalex.org/W2169320500,"The enzyme MurA has been an established antibiotic target since the discovery of fosfomycin, which specifically inhibits MurA by covalent modification of the active site residue Cys-115. Early biochemical studies established that Cys-115 also covalently reacts with substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to yield a phospholactoyl adduct, but the structural and functional consequences of this reaction remained obscure. We captured and depicted the Cys-115-PEP adduct of Enterobacter cloacae MurA in various reaction states by X-ray crystallography. The data suggest that cellular MurA predominantly exists in a tightly locked complex with UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UNAM), the product of the MurB reaction, with PEP covalently attached to Cys-115. The uniqueness and rigidity of this ""dormant"" complex was previously not recognized and presumably accounts for the failure of drug discovery efforts toward the identification of novel and effective MurA inhibitors. We demonstrate that recently published crystal structures of MurA from various organisms determined by different laboratories were indeed misinterpreted and actually contain UNAM and covalently bound PEP. The Cys-115-PEP adduct was also captured in vitro during the reaction of free MurA and substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine or isomer UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. The now available series of crystal structures allows a comprehensive view of the reaction cycle of MurA. It appears that the covalent reaction of MurA with PEP fulfills dual functions by tightening the complex with UNAM for the efficient feedback regulation of murein biosynthesis and by priming the PEP molecule for instantaneous reaction with substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine."

Because Mrp4 regulates cAMP, we compared testosterone levels in Mrp4−/− and Mrp4+/+ mice. Young Mrp4−/− mice had significantly impaired gametogenesis, reduced testicular testosterone, and disruption of Leydig cell cAMP homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2060375373,"The importance of Krüppel-like factor (KLF)-mediated transcriptional pathways in the biochemistry of neuronal differentiation has been recognized relatively recently. Elegant studies have revealed that KLF proteins are important regulators of two major molecular and cellular processes critical for neuronal cell differentiation: neurite formation and the expression of neurotransmitter-related genes. However, whether KLF proteins mediate these key processes in a separate or coordinated fashion remains unknown. Moreover, knowledge on the contribution of chromatin dynamics to the biochemical mechanisms utilized by these proteins to perform their function is absent. Here we report the characterization of two antagonistic, chromatin-mediated mechanisms by which KLF11, also known as TIEG2 (transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene 2) and MODY VII (maturity onset diabetes of the young VII), regulates transcription of the fopamine D2 receptor (Drd2) gene. First, KLF11 activates transcription by binding to a distinct Sp-KLF site within the Drd2 promoter (−98 to −94) and recruiting the p300 histone acetyltransferase. Second, Drd2 transcriptional activation is partially antagonized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), the code reader for histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. Interestingly, KLF11 regulates neurotransmitter receptor gene expression in differentiating neuronal cell populations without affecting neurite formation. Overall, these studies highlight histone methylation and acetylation as key biochemical mechanisms modulating KLF-mediated neurotransmitter gene transcription.

Studies performed during the last 3 decades have revealed that an unexpectedly large number of human gene promoters are regulated by the reversible binding of GC-binding transcription factors. Sp1, one of the first mammalian transcription factors to be characterized, has served as a well established paradigm for GC-binding transcriptional activators. In addition, because Sp1 GC-rich sites are most often located in close proximity to the transcriptional start site, studies on the regulation of these cis-regulatory sites have increased our understanding of the role that certain key subunits of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme play in transcriptional initiation (1Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. A glutamine-rich hydrophobic patch in transcription factor Sp1 contacts the dTAFII110 component of the Drosophila TFIID complex and mediates transcriptional activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Recent discoveries have revealed the existence of a large repertoire of proteins, which share similar DNA binding domains with Sp1, can bind to the GC-rich sites previously attributed exclusively to Sp1, and differentially regulate gene transcription. Several of these proteins antagonize Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation, leading to gene silencing, endowing GC-rich sites with the capability to function as “on” and “off” switches in gene regulation (3Lomberk G. Urrutia R. The family feud. Turning off Sp1 by Sp1-like KLF proteins.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Conceptually, these studies have definitively changed the paradigm for the regulation of promoters via proximal GC-rich sites from the initial notion of Sp1 as a single master regulator (activator) to a more dynamic model. The new paradigm informs us that a large variety of transcription factors target GC-rich sites to achieve different promoter states (silenced versus activated). Last, this information has excellent predictive power for designing experiments to investigate how proximal GC-rich sites serve to scaffold different transcription factors as well as chromatin-activating and -silencing complexes on a large number of genes important for the regulation of most biochemical processes. Fortunately, the discovery and investigations of the KLF 2The abbreviations used are: KLFKrüppel-like factorCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinDRGdorsal root gangliaqPCRquantitative PCREVempty vectorE13E15, and E18, embryonic day 13, 15, and 18, respectivelyHAThistone acetyltransferase. family of Sp1-like transcription factors have extended our understanding of how GC-rich sites in proximal promoters are regulated. This KLF protein family is composed of 17 members that regulate gene expression programs underlying a substantial number of biological and pathobiological processes and are conserved from organisms ranging from Drosophila melanogaster to humans (3Lomberk G. Urrutia R. The family feud. Turning off Sp1 by Sp1-like KLF proteins.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Bieker J.J. Kruppel-like factors. Three fingers in many pies.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally characterized by three Cys2/His2 zinc finger DNA binding domains at their C termini, which are remarkably similar to the corresponding region of Sp1, and variant transcriptional regulatory motifs at their N termini (5Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Sp1 and its likes. Biochemical and functional predictions for a growing family of zinc finger transcription factors.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similar to Sp1, the conserved KLF zinc fingers recognize GC-rich sequences (4Bieker J.J. Kruppel-like factors. Three fingers in many pies.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The variant N-terminal domains recruit chromatin-remodeling co-regulators that dictate the function of KLF proteins as transcriptional activators, repressors, or both (3Lomberk G. Urrutia R. The family feud. Turning off Sp1 by Sp1-like KLF proteins.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using both cell and animal models reveal that these domains can mediate sequence-specific regulation of promoters by recruiting distinct histone-modifying enzyme complexes, including p300, CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300/CBP-associated factor, C-terminal binding protein, SIN3-histone deacetylase, and histone methyltransferases, to GC-rich regions of promoters (6Fernandez-Zapico M.E. van Velkinburgh J.C.

However, the types of chromatin remodeling machines that are recruited to proximal cis-regulatory GC-rich promoter sequences by KLF proteins to regulate gene expression remain poorly understood. Moreover, whether distinct domains that mediate coupling to these chromatin pathways perform either synergistic or antagonistic functions remains to be firmly established. Thus, addressing these questions will expand our knowledge of how GC-rich regulatory sequences and distinct KLF-mediated recruitment of chromatin remodeling machines are coupled to transcriptional regulation, chromatin dynamics, and epigenetics.

These studies, together with the fact that neuronal induced pluripotent stem cells can be derived from KLF-transfected cells (16Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18861) Google Scholar), indicate that mechanistic knowledge on KLF proteins might be applicable to the field of regenerative medicine in the nervous system. In particular, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the set of genes regulated by KLF proteins in neurons and the chromatin pathways that KLF proteins engage as biochemical switches during induction or maintenance of neuronal phenotypes. Thus, by extending this information, with a focus on chromatin remodeling, our study sought to further define how KLF transcription factors mechanistically regulate prominent phenotypic features in differentiating cells. The combined cellular, biochemical, and molecular analyses performed here reveal a novel KLF-mediated mechanism for regulating the transcription of Drd2, involving functional antagonism between two distinct chromatin pathways. Because this mechanism is dissociated from those that mediate neurite formation, this outcome has implications for understanding how neurite formation and neurotransmitter-related gene expression, two processes germane to neuronal differentiation, are independently regulated. Dysregulation of Drd2 receptor expression is a defining feature of neuronal dysfunctions that contribute to the pathobiology of common and debilitating human conditions, including addiction, schizophrenia, and Parkinson disease (17Bertolino A.

Dissociated and neuronally enriched cultures were obtained by 20 μm 2,5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (Sigma) and 20 μm uridine (Sigma) treatment for 3 days using established methods (23Ta L.E. Espeset L.

Stable cultures of neurons without Schwann cells or fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 15% calf bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 7 mg/ml glucose (Sigma), and 1.2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and were treated with NGF at concentrations of 10 or 100 ng/ml. Whole DRG explants were cultured on rat tail collagen-coated 35-mm plastic dishes. Nine to twelve DRG were placed on each plate at least 10 mm apart. Cultures were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% calf bovine serum, 7 mg/ml glucose, 1.2 mm l-glutamine, and varying concentrations of NGF. For all of our studies, we used human wild type and mutant KLF11 cloned into pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) and rat wild type and mutant Drd2 promoters cloned into pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences of both the KLF11 protein and the Drd2 promoter are remarkably conserved both in structure and function across evolution. The potential GC-rich KLF11 binding sites are 95% conserved from rodents to humans. All mutants of the Drd2 promoter were made using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The p300 dominant negative (human p300DN) construct was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing at the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility. Epitope-tagged (6XHis-XpressTM) KLF11, KLF11ΔHP1 (24Lomberk G. Mathison A.J. Grzenda A. Seo S.

GST and GST fusion protein purification was performed as described previously (25Lomberk G. Bensi D. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Urrutia R. Evidence for the existence of an HP1-mediated subcode within the histone code.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Total mRNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using the cDNA as template, mRNA for Klf family members or neurotransmitter receptors was amplified by semiquantitative RT-PCR or qPCR (SA Biosciences, Frederick, MD). PCR products were examined on a 2% agarose gel and assessed relative to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA levels. ImageJ software version 1.43 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the intensity of bands. For qPCR arrays (SA Biosciences), PC12 cells were transduced with adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 200) containing the control empty vector (EV), KLF11, or KLF11ΔHP1 construct. Six hours later, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 48 h, and cells were lysed. Total mRNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed into cDNA, which was used in the qPCR gene array (Rat Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators PCR Array, SA Biosciences). The mRNA levels in KLF11- or KLF11ΔHP1-transduced cells were compared with EV-infected PC12 cells. Changes in gene expression were validated with semiquantitative RT-PCR. Primer sets were designed (2–3 pairs/gene) in the promoter region of the possible target genes. The cells were lysed on ice in cell lysis buffer with protease inhibitor. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor. The resulting nuclear extract was sonicated on wet ice and then immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies. Antibodies against His tag (for recombinant KLF11 and KLF11ΔHP1, OMNI D8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), HP1α (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and p300 (Millipore) were used. Protein G beads (Millipore) were used to collect protein-DNA complexes. Elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and proteinase K were used to elute protein-DNA complexes from the beads and then to reverse cross-link the protein-DNA complexes to free DNA. DNA samples were purified, and protein enrichment on the promoter of each target gene was tested by RT-PCR using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products were examined on a 2% agarose gel. Drd2 promoter reporter (3 μg) and other protein constructs (5 μg) were introduced into 106 PC12 cells using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then plated equally into three wells of rat tail collagen-coated 6-well plates (technical triplicate). Cells were lysed 48 h later, and the relative luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Turner 20/20 luminometer. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and S.E. values were calculated from all biological replicates. Total protein concentrations were measured and used for normalization in all experiments. Standard Western blot techniques were used to determine the levels of KLF11 and DRD2 protein. Antibodies against His tag (for recombinant KLF11 and KLF11ΔHP1, OMNI D8) and DRD2 (Millipore) were used at 1:1000 dilution. HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) and chemiluminescence were used to detect the protein levels. Immunoprecipitation was done as described previously (25Lomberk G. Bensi D. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Urrutia R. Evidence for the existence of an HP1-mediated subcode within the histone code.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). EZviewTM Red anti-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was utilized to immunoprecipitate recombinantly expressed KLF11 or KLF11ΔHP1. Subsequently, Western blot was performed to detect protein complexes with anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-HP1α (Millipore). Wild type and mutant probes spanning KLF11 potential binding sites were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Four micrograms of purified GST or GST fusion recombinant KLF11 were incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 6% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 7 min at room temperature. End-labeled probes, excess of cold probes, or antibodies were added as indicated to each reaction and incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The samples were loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, run for 3 h at 200 V, vacuum-dried, and exposed to HyBlot CLTM autoradiography film (Denville Scientific Inc., Metuchen, NJ). After appropriate NGF treatment, light microscopic images were acquired every 24 h. Random fields of view were taken from PC12 cells, and neurite outgrowth was assessed using stereology. From whole DRG explants, digital phase-contrast images were acquired every 24 h after appropriate NGF treatment. Radial neurite outgrowth was measured using ImageJ software. Neurite length was measured from the edge of the ganglion to the tip of the longest neuronal process. PC12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 7 days before being transduced with adenovirus containing EV or KLF11. Once transduced, the cells were incubated in NGF-free media to inhibit further neurite outgrowth. Light microscopic images were taken every 24 h, and neurite lengths were measured using stereology. Whole DRG explants were treated with 10 ng/ml NGF for 48 h before being transduced with adenovirus containing EV or KLF11. Once transduced, NGF concentration in the media was increased to 100 ng/ml to inhibit further neurite outgrowth, and digital phase-contrast images were taken every 24 h. Changes in radial neurite lengths were measured using ImageJ software. To investigate which KLF transcription factors participate in NGF-induced neuronal cell differentiation, we initially performed an expression-based family-wide screening of all Klf family members in the neuron-like PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell model as recently described (26Bonnefond A.

J. 2011; 435: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we utilized RNA from PC12 cells treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for periods between 0 and 48 h (Fig. 1A). This screening step defined three different expression patterns for members of this transcription factor family: (i) mRNA levels of Klf1, -6, -7, -9, and -16 remained constant, regardless of NGF treatment (NGF-insensitive KLF genes); (ii) mRNA levels of Klf2, -3, -4, -5, -10, -13, and -14 increased within 6 h of treatment and returned to basal level by 48 h (NGF-inducible KLF genes); (iii) mRNA levels of Klf11 and -15 decreased with NGF treatment (NGF-down-regulated KLF genes) (Klf8 and -17 have not been identified in rats, and Klf12 was not amplified in our hands). Notably, among all observed effects, the decrease in Klf11 mRNA level was the most robust (p < 0.01, compared with t = 0 for all time points) and long lasting. Plotting of qPCR results of KLF11 in Fig. 1B shows that Klf11 mRNA level decreased, −3.50 ± 0.67-fold at 2 h, and remained low even after 48 h of NGF treatment. To test the possibility that Klf11 is an NGF early response gene, translation was inhibited with cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) 2 h before NGF treatment, and Klf11 mRNA levels were measured over time. Fig. 1C shows that cycloheximide-induced inhibition of translation abolished the NGF-induced decrease in Klf11 mRNA. Hence, protein synthesis is required for the down-regulation of Klf11 transcription, which, together with the duration of its response, indicates that Klf11 is not an NGF early response gene but rather part of a delayed and long lasting response to NGF. Notably, genes that participate in defining the acquisition of distinct phenotypes in undifferentiated neuronal precursors often show the type of expression described above for KLF11 (28Ballas N.

Neurobiol. 2010; 30: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we utilized a primary neuronal cell culture to confirm the expression pattern of this transcription factor during NGF-induced neuronal cell differentiation. Dissociated DRG neurons from E13 mouse embryos were treated with NGF (10 or 100 ng/ml) for 48 h. For control purposes, we harvested whole DRG without NGF treatment. Similar to the effect observed in PC12 cells, NGF treatment of DRG cultures induced decrease in Klf11 mRNA levels (Fig. 1D). This effect was dose-dependent because values of gene expression changed from −1.78 ± 0.12-fold in cells treated with 10 ng/ml NGF to −2.58 ± 0.25-fold with 100 ng/ml NGF. Thus, together, the results of this screening step show that KLF family members are actively regulated by differentiating growth factors (NGF), probably to regulate the expression of important neuronal genes. This idea led us to perform subsequent mechanistic experiments using KLF11 as a model for understanding how members of this family of transcription factors mediate neuronal gene expression. We next tested the hypothesis that KLF11 functions as a pivotal switch for coupling chromatin-mediated pathways in neurons. Initially, we investigated whether this transcription factor influences two of the major processes that characterize"
https://openalex.org/W2069021263,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) interacts with specific receptors to modulate opioid functions in the central nervous system. On dissociated neurons and neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) transfected with NPFF receptors, NPFF acts as a functional antagonist of μ-opioid (MOP) receptors by attenuating the opioid-induced inhibition of calcium conductance. In the SH-SY5Y model, MOP and NPFF(2) receptors have been shown to heteromerize. To understand the molecular mechanism involved in the anti-opioid activity of NPFF, we have investigated the phosphorylation status of the MOP receptor using phospho-specific antibody and mass spectrometry. Similarly to direct opioid receptor stimulation, activation of the NPFF(2) receptor by [D-Tyr-1-(NMe)Phe-3]NPFF (1DMe), an analog of NPFF, induced the phosphorylation of Ser-377 of the human MOP receptor. This heterologous phosphorylation was unaffected by inhibition of second messenger-dependent kinases and, contrarily to homologous phosphorylation, was prevented by inactivation of G(i/o) proteins by pertussis toxin. Using siRNA knockdown we could demonstrate that 1DMe-induced Ser-377 cross-phosphorylation and MOP receptor loss of function were mediated by the G protein receptor kinase GRK2. In addition, mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the phosphorylation pattern of MOP receptors was qualitatively similar after treatment with the MOP agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly (NMe)-Phe-Gly-ol (DAMGO) or after treatment with the NPFF agonist 1DMe, but the level of multiple phosphorylation was more intense after DAMGO. Finally, NPFF(2) receptor activation was sufficient to recruit β-arrestin2 to the MOP receptor but not to induce its internalization. These data show that NPFF-induced heterologous desensitization of MOP receptor signaling is mediated by GRK2 and could involve transphosphorylation within the heteromeric receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2042515228,"Mutation of the coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing 1A (CC2D1A) gene, which encodes a C2 domain and DM14 domain-containing protein, has been linked to severe autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation. Using a mouse model that produces a truncated form of CC2D1A that lacks the C2 domain and three of the four DM14 domains, we show that CC2D1A is important for neuronal differentiation and brain development. CC2D1A mutant neurons are hypersensitive to stress and have a reduced capacity to form dendrites and synapses in culture. At the biochemical level, CC2D1A transduces signals to the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway during neuronal cell differentiation. PKA activity is compromised, and the translocation of its catalytic subunit to the nucleus is also defective in CC2D1A mutant cells. Consistently, phosphorylation of the PKA target cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, at serine 133, is nearly abolished in CC2D1A mutant cells. The defects in cAMP/PKA signaling were observed in fibroblast, macrophage, and neuronal primary cells derived from the CC2D1A KO mice. CC2D1A associates with the cAMP-PKA complex following forskolin treatment and accumulates in vesicles or on the plasma membrane in wild-type cells, suggesting that CC2D1A may recruit the PKA complex to the membrane to facilitate signal transduction. Together, our data show that CC2D1A is an important regulator of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which may be the underlying cause for impaired mental function in nonsyndromic mental retardation patients with CC2D1A mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1983905405,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmitter receptors and the postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of scaffolding proteins are integral components of post-synaptic macromolecular signaling complexes that serve to propagate glutamate responses intracellularly. Classically, NMDA receptor NR2 subunits associate with PSD-95 MAGUKs via a conserved ES(E/D)V amino acid sequence located at their C termini. We previously challenged this dogma to demonstrate a second non-ES(E/D)V PSD-95-binding site in both NMDA receptor NR2A and NR2B subunits. Here, using a combination of co-immunoprecipitations from transfected mammalian cells, yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays, we show that NR2A subunits interact directly with PSD-95 via the C-terminal ESDV motif and additionally via an Src homology 3 domain-binding motif that associates with the Src homology 3 domain of PSD-95. Peptide inhibition of co-immunoprecipitations of NR2A and PSD-95 demonstrates that both the ESDV and non-ESDV sites are required for association in native brain tissue. Furthermore, we refine the non-ESDV site within NR2B to residues 1149-1157. These findings provide a molecular basis for the differential association of NMDA receptor subtypes with PSD-95 MAGUK scaffold proteins. These selective interactions may contribute to the organization, lateral mobility, and ultimately the function of NMDA receptor subtypes at synapses. Furthermore, they provide a more general molecular mechanism by which the scaffold, PSD-95, may discriminate between potential interacting partner proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2049562870,"Oxygen is required for three enzyme reactions in chlorophyll and bilin biosynthesis pathways: coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemF), heme oxygenase (HO1), and Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester cyclase (ChlA(I)). The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has alternative enzymes, HemN, HO2, and ChlA(II), to supply chlorophyll/bilins even under low-oxygen environments. The three genes form an operon, chlA(II)-ho2-hemN, that is induced in response to low-oxygen conditions to bypass the oxygen-dependent reactions. Here we identified a transcriptional regulator for the induction of the operon in response to low-oxygen conditions. A pseudorevertant, Δho1R, was isolated from a HO1-lacking mutant Δho1 that is lethal under aerobic conditions. Δho1R grew well even under aerobic conditions. In Δho1R, HO2 that is induced only under low-oxygen conditions was anomalously expressed under aerobic conditions to complement the loss of HO1. A G-to-C transversion in sll1512 causing the amino acid change from aspartate 35 to histidine was identified as the relevant mutation by resequencing of the Δho1R genome. Sll1512 is a MarR-type transcriptional regulator. An sll1512-lacking mutant grew poorly under low-oxygen conditions with a remarked decrease in Chl content that would be caused by the suppressed induction of the chlA(II) and hemN genes in Chl biosynthesis under low-oxygen conditions. These results demonstrated that Sll1512 is an activator in response to low-oxygen environments and that the D35H variant becomes a constitutive activator. This hypothesis was supported by a gel shift assay showing that the Sll1512-D35H variant binds to the DNA fragment upstream of the operon. We propose to name sll1512 chlR."

In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, heme and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis are co-regulated by the redox and light controlled PpsR-AppA system (18Masuda S. Bauer C.E.

Under aerobic conditions, a pair of redox active Cys in PpsR undergo oxidation to stimulate binding of PpsR to target promoters to block transcription (18Masuda S. Bauer C.E. AppA is a blue light photoreceptor that antirepresses photosynthesis gene expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). PpsR is also regulated by the flavin-containing antirepressor AppA that responds to changes in both redox and light intensity. AppA inactivates PpsR by forming an inactive PpsR2-AppA complex under anaerobic dark conditions (18Masuda S. Bauer C.E. AppA is a blue light photoreceptor that antirepresses photosynthesis gene expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that AppA also binds heme as a co-factor (21Han Y. Meyer M.H. Keusgen M. Klug G.

In this study, we present evidence that PpsR is a heme-binding protein and that the redox active Cys424 present in the DNA binding domain of PpsR is critical for heme interaction. The binding of heme to PpsR was found to change its DNA binding pattern and to induce increased transcription of several PpsR-regulated genes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that excess heme can quickly change the state of photosynthetic gene expression from inhibition to activation, thus providing a mechanism for bacteria to react to the toxic unbound tetrapyrrole products. It is also worth noting that PpsR does not contain a typical HRM, suggesting that heme-sensing regulators may be more widespread than was previously understood. R. sphaeroides strain HRIF (18Masuda S. Bauer C.E. AppA is a blue light photoreceptor that antirepresses photosynthesis gene expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) was used as the parent strain. PpsR knock-out strain (PPSR1) was made by replacing the PpsR gene with a kanamycin-resistant cassette. PpsR-FLAG strain was made by adding a FLAG tag to the end of ppsR gene with a single cross-event. Strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) was used for protein overexpression in E. coli. Luria broth (LB) medium was used for agar-solidified plates and liquid cultures for E. coli and R. sphaeroides. Kanamycin was used at 50 μg/ml for agar-solidified plates and at 25 μg/ml for liquid cultures as needed. All proteins were expressed in E. coli using a modified SUMO-I (LifeSensors) overexpression system. For full-length PpsR, the coding region was cloned from pETPpsR (18Masuda S. Bauer C.E. AppA is a blue light photoreceptor that antirepresses photosynthesis gene expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) into the NdeI-SacI restriction sites of pSUMO, resulting in the recombinant plasmid pSUMO-PpsR. Plasmid pSUMO-PpsR was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (Herculase II; Stratagene) to construct stop codons to form truncated PpsR variants as well as PpsR point mutations. PpsR-FLAG strain culture was collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 20 μl/per sample of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Cells were kept on ice, disrupted by sonication of 10 s with 10 s interval, for 10 min in total. Cracked cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of EZviewTM red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The anti-FLAG gel was then spun down and washed with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). PpsR-FLAG was eluted with 300 μl of 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). SUMO-tagged PpsR was overexpressed by induction of T7 polymerase with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight in LB. Cells were disrupted by three passages through a cell cracker and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. PpsR-SUMO was purified by binding to HisTrapTM HP columns (GE Healthcare), washed with ∼10 column volumes of 50 mm imidazole, and then eluted with a 50–500 mm linear gradient of imidazole in a buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Eluted PpsR-SUMO was then cleaved from the SUMO tag with SUMO-protease-I (LifeSensors) for 1 h at room temperature. Following cleavage, tagless PpsR was then isolated by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 HP resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol. Heme stock solutions were freshly dissolved in 0.01 m NaOH. The final concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a coefficient of 58.4 mm−1 cm−1 (23Dawson R.M. Elliott D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1969: 316Google Scholar). To quantify heme binding, purified protein was incubated with a 2-fold excess of heme at room temperature for >20 min. The unbound heme was then removed by passing through MidiTrapTM G-25 column (GE Healthcare) or HiTrapTM Q HP column (GE Healthcare). Heme bound to protein was determined by using the pyridine hemochromagen assay as described previously (24Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Simultaneous determination of hemes a, b, and c from pyridine hemochrome spectra.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). All the protein-heme interactions, including the reactions used for later analysis, were carried out under oxidizing conditions unless noted otherwise. Electronic absorption UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Purified protein was incubated with various concentrations of heme at room temperature for more than 20 min before the measurements were taken. To measure the reduced spectrum of protein-heme complex, 1 m sodium dithionite stock was made freshly with the buffer of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with a final concentration of 5 mm sodium dithionite added to the sample. Carbon monoxide was added by briefly bubbling CO into the protein sample. The deoxy-PpsR-heme spectrum was obtained using the same method for reduced spectrum, except that all buffer and samples were completely degassed, and the whole procedure was done in an anaerobic hood and with flow-stop cuvette. Fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature using a LS50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 2-ml sample volume with protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol. Heme was added into the sample to final concentration of 0.1–2.5 μm. After incubation for 2 min, the sample was excited at 272 nm. Three emissions from 290 to 400 nm were then recorded and averaged. Data were processed using nonlinear curve fitting with one-to-one binding model using Origin software (OriginLab). The experiments were carried out in the PpsR-heme concentration range that exhibits linear relationship to protein fluorescence (supplemental Fig. 1). Probes for gel mobility shift assays were prepared by colony PCR amplification of the puc (262 bp) and the hemE (344 bp) promoter regions (supplemental Table 1). 10 nm DNA probes were incubated with different concentrations of purified protein for 30 min at room temperature, in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μg/ml heparin. The mixtures were then subjected to 6% PAGE at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA. After the electrophoresis, the gel was stained with SYBR Green dye (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer and scanned with a Typhoon 9210 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). When reducing condition was required, fresh dithionite of 5 μm final concentration was added into all of the buffers and the reactions. Promoter region of puc (262 bp) was amplified with a 6-FAM-labeled primer on the forward strand and 5-HEX-labeled primer on the reverse strand. A DNA binding reaction similar to that described for the gel mobility shift assays was set up in a 20- μl volume to which 5 μl of DNase I was added for 30 min at room temperature to digest DNA. DNA digestion was then stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. DNA digestion products were recovered using a Min Elute PCR purification kit (Qiagen), with sample eluted with 15 μl of elution buffer containing 0.75 μl of 500 LIZTM Size Standard (Applied Biosystems). The samples were separated and detected with a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with Peak Scanner Software v1.0 (Applied Biosystems). Different R. sphaeroides strains were grown in LB medium under aerobic conditions until the absorbance at 660 nm reached 0.2–0.3. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended with Sistrom's minimal medium, then continued growth under aerobic conditions. After 20 min of starvation, freshly made heme (in 50% ethanol, 0.05 m NaHCO3) was added into the cultures to a final concentration of 25 μm, and 1-ml samples were then extracted and stored on ice at different time points. The RNA was purified with ISOLATE RNA mini kit (Bioline) and Turbo DNA-free (Ambion). Reverse transcription and real-time PCR were performed with Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Agilent Technologies) on either Quantitative PCR Stratagene MX3000P (Agilent Technologies) or StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The transcription level of rpoZ gene (encoding the RNA polymerase omega subunit) was used to normalize the levels of all other genes. At least three biological replications were measured on each condition, and qPCR was performed for each sample at least twice. For each biological replication, a mixture of all RNA samples was used to determine the efficiency of the primers with serial dilution methods. Primer sequences for qPCR analysis are shown in supplemental Table 2. We constructed a chromosomally encoded carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged PpsR construct in R. sphaeroides at its native chromosomal location by recombination. Affinity purification of FLAG-tagged PpsR yielded a colored preparation that was judged to be >95% pure based on SDS-PAGE chromatography. An absorption spectrum of the purified FLAG-tagged PpsR showed the presence of a distinct heme peak at 372 nm as well as additional broad peaks in the 440–600-nm region (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2A). We subsequently tested the ability of tagless apo-PpsR, purified from an E. coli overexpression system, to bind to heme-agarose using a pulldown assay. The results demonstrate that tagless PpsR is indeed capable of binding to heme-agarose in vitro (supplemental Fig. 2B). We further investigated the ability of tagless PpsR to bind heme by monitoring changes in the absorption spectrum of heme upon addition of purified tagless apo-PpsR under oxidizing conditions (oxidized spectrum). The spectrum in Fig. 1B shows that upon the addition of apo-PpsR, the broad doublet Soret peak of free heme intensified and was converted to a single peak at 372 nm concomitant with peaks in the 500–700-nm region of the spectrum that is virtually indistinguishable from absorbance characteristics of FLAG-tagged PpsR that was isolated from R. sphaeroides cells (Fig. 1A). Reduction of the heme-bound iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the addition of dithionate resulted in a red shift of Soret peak from 372 nm to 426 nm as well as the appearance of α and β peaks in the 500–600-nm region (Fig. 1C, reduced spectrum). Analysis under same reducing conditions but with no oxygen present (deoxy-PpsR-heme spectrum) shows that the 426-nm Soret peak and the α and β peaks in the 500–600-nm region, all disappear (supplemental Fig. 2C). Adding carbon monoxide to reduced PpsR-heme species also resulted in a characteristic carbon monoxy heme spectrum with a Soret peak at 418 nm (supplemental Fig. 2D), typical for ferrous-heme-CO complex. Interestingly, myoglobin under low pH conditions demonstrates a UV-visible spectrum almost identical to that observed with PpsR-heme (25Sage J.T. Morikis D. Champion P.M. Spectroscopic studies of myoglobin at low pH: heme structure and ligation.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A well studied heme-binding protein, myoglobin, under low pH conditions is pentacoordinated under oxidizing conditions and hexacoordinated when reduced (25Sage J.T. Morikis D. Champion P.M. Spectroscopic studies of myoglobin at low pH: heme structure and ligation.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The similarity of the UV-visible spectrum suggests that PpsR-heme binding could utilize the same mechanism. The stoichiometry of heme binding to PpsR was addressed by reconstituting PpsR with heme in vitro and then removing the PpsR-heme complex from free heme either by size exclusion chromatography or by ion exchange chromatography. With these approaches, we could obtain PpsR-heme complex with a molar ratio of 0.85 ± 0.08 PpsR to 1 heme. To confirm spectrally the chromatography results we titrated heme into PpsR and measured the absorbance change that occurs at 370 nm upon binding. The plot of the absorbance change versus the PpsR:heme concentration ratio indicates that a PpsR-heme complex is formed with a stoichiometry of 0.84 ± 0.05 [PpsR]:[heme] (Fig. 1D). Tryptophan quenching data of heme titrated into PpsR can also be fitted with a one-to-one binding model with a Kd for heme binding of 1.9 μm (Fig. 1E). This micromolar binding affinity is similar to a dissociation constant that has been reported for heme binding by R-transferase (9Hu R.G. Wang H. Xia Z. Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway is a sensor of heme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prior inspection of the PpsR sequence indicates the presence of two PAS domains followed by a carboxyl-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding domain (Fig. 2A) (26Nickens D.G. Bauer C.E. Analysis of the puc operon promoter from Rhodobacter capsulatus.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4270-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that several PAS domains use heme as a co-factor to sense environmental signals (11Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Heme-based sensors, exemplified by the kinase FixL, are a new class of heme protein with distinctive ligand binding and autooxidation.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Dos, a heme-binding PAS protein from Escherichia coli, is a direct oxygen sensor.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), so several deletion constructs were made to test their involvement. Unlike full-length PpsR, spectral analysis of truncated constructs PpsR256 and PpsR376 did not show the formation of a single Soret peak upon addition of heme under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2B). This type of spectrum change, the loss of the single 370-nm Soret peak and the appearance of two overlapping peaks, has been observed for regulatory proteins that have a HRM and assigned to the lost Cys-heme coordination (17Zhang L. Guarente L. Heme binds to a short sequence that serves a regulatory function in diverse proteins.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions the larger construct that contained both PAS domains but no HTH domain (PpsR376 in Fig. 2A) showed spectroscopic changes similar to those shown by wild-type PpsR with the exception that the intensity was not as increased (Fig. 2C). Thus, both the carboxyl terminus HTH domain and the second PAS domain appear to be involved in the interaction with heme. The spectrum of the PpsR-heme complex is similar to that of several heme sensors that characteristically have a single Soret peak at ∼370 nm under oxidizing conditions that also red shifts to ∼420 nm under reducing conditions (2Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Heme is an effector molecule for iron-dependent degradation of the bacterial iron response regulator (Irr) protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, the heme-sensing protein Irr has a Soret peak at 377 nm under oxidizing conditions that red shifts to 413 nm under reduced conditions (2Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Heme is an effector molecule for iron-dependent degradation of the bacterial iron response regulator (Irr) protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The appearance of single Soret peak has been attributed to the coordination between axial residue and the iron in heme (17Zhang L. Guarente L. Heme binds to a short sequence that serves a regulatory function in diverse proteins.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the case of Irr, His and Cys are utilized as axial ligands to iron of heme which are two of the most common axial residues found in heme-binding proteins (2Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R.

Inspection of the second PAS domain and carboxyl-terminus region indicates that there is only one His present at position 275 (His275), and only one Cys (Cys424) located within the HTH DNA binding domain. Consequently, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert His275 and Cys424 to Ala (H275A and C424A, respectively) and then assayed what effect these mutations had on heme interaction. When PpsRH275A was assayed under oxidizing conditions the spectrum was similar to that observed with oxidized wild-type PpsR (Fig. 2, D and B, respectively). This was contrasted by spectrally assaying heme binding by PpsRH275A under reducing conditions where ferrous heme did not show a sharp and distinguish Soret peak at 426 nm and also exhibited a reduced β peak at 530 nm (Fig. 2D). Analysis of heme binding with PpsRC424A under reducing conditions shows a similar spectrum as reduced PpsRH275A (Fig. 2E). However, under oxidizing conditions, the single Soret peak of heme observed with wild-type PpsR is converted to a double peak with PpsRC424A (Fig. 2E), very similar to the spectrum observed with PpsR376 (Fig. 2B). In addition, the reconstitution of PpsRC424A with heme only achieved a molar ratio of ∼0.38 ([heme]:[PpsRC424A]), which is considerably less than that observed with wild-type PpsR, further confirming that Cys424 is critical for PpsR-heme interaction. These observations, combined with the results presented earlier, can be explained with a model in which Cys424 forms an axial ligand under oxidizing conditions where heme is pentacoordinated, whereas both Cys424 and His275 form axial ligands under reducing conditions where heme is hexacoordinated. Previous mutational and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the redox state of Cys424 affects the DNA binding activity of PpsR (18Masuda S. Bauer C.E.

https://openalex.org/W2106561343,"The establishment of endometrial receptivity is a prerequisite for successful pregnancy, which is controlled by a complex mechanism. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have emerged as important regulators of gene expression. However, the contribution of miRNAs in endometrial receptivity is still unknown. Here we used rhesus monkey as an animal model and compared the endometrial miRNA expression profiles during early-secretory (pre-receptive) phase and mid-secretory (receptive) phase by deep sequencing. A set of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, 8 of which were selected and validated using quantitative RT-PCR. To facilitate the prediction of their target genes, the 3'-UTRome was also determined using tag sequencing of mRNA 3'-termini. Surprisingly, about 50% of the 10,677 genes expressed in the rhesus monkey endometrium exhibited alternative 3'-UTRs. Of special interest, the progesterone receptor (PGR) gene, which is necessary for endometrial receptivity, processes an ultra long 3'-UTR (~10 kb) along with a short variant (~2.5 kb). Evolutionary analysis showed that the 3'-UTR sequences of PGR are poorly conserved between primates and rodents, suggesting a species-biased miRNA binding pattern. We further demonstrated that PGR is a valid target of miR-96 in rhesus monkey and human but not in rodents, whereas the regulation of PGR by miR-375 is rhesus monkey-specific. Additionally, we found that miR-219-5p regulates PGR expression through a primate-specific long non-coding RNA immediately downstream of the PGR locus. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial receptivity and presents intriguing species-specific regulatory roles of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2042248104,"Complexes of phi29 DNA polymerase and DNA fluctuate on the millisecond time scale between two ionic current amplitude states when captured atop the α-hemolysin nanopore in an applied field. The lower amplitude state is stabilized by complementary dNTP and thus corresponds to complexes in the post-translocation state. We have demonstrated that in the upper amplitude state, the DNA is displaced by a distance of one nucleotide from the post-translocation state. We propose that the upper amplitude state corresponds to complexes in the pre-translocation state. Force exerted on the template strand biases the complexes toward the pre-translocation state. Based on the results of voltage and dNTP titrations, we concluded through mathematical modeling that complementary dNTP binds only to the post-translocation state, and we estimated the binding affinity. The equilibrium between the two states is influenced by active site-proximal DNA sequences. Consistent with the assignment of the upper amplitude state as the pre-translocation state, a DNA substrate that favors the pre-translocation state in complexes on the nanopore is a superior substrate in bulk phase for pyrophosphorolysis. There is also a correlation between DNA sequences that bias complexes toward the pre-translocation state and the rate of exonucleolysis in bulk phase, suggesting that during DNA synthesis the pathway for transfer of the primer strand from the polymerase to exonuclease active site initiates in the pre-translocation state."

We have shown previously that the Rho family GTPase inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB) induces apoptosis in primary rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) principally via inhibition of Rac GTPase function. In the present study, incubation with ToxB activated a proapoptotic Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and a pan-JAK inhibitor protected CGNs from Rac inhibition. STAT1 expression was induced by ToxB; however, CGNs from STAT1 knock-out mice succumbed to ToxB-induced apoptosis as readily as wild-type CGNs. STAT3 displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with ToxB, and a reputed inhibitor of STAT3, cucurbitacin (JSI-124), reduced CGN apoptosis. Unexpectedly, JSI-124 failed to block STAT3 phosphorylation, and CGNs were not protected from ToxB by other known STAT3 inhibitors. In contrast, STAT5A tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ToxB was suppressed by JSI-124. In addition, roscovitine similarly inhibited STAT5A phosphorylation and protected CGNs from ToxB-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these results, adenoviral infection with a dominant negative STAT5 mutant, but not wild-type STAT5, significantly decreased ToxB-induced apoptosis of CGNs. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation with a STAT5 antibody revealed increased STAT5 binding to the promoter region of prosurvival Bcl-xL. STAT5 was recruited to the Bcl-xL promoter region in a ToxB-dependent manner, and this DNA binding preceded Bcl-xL down-regulation, suggesting transcriptional repression. These data indicate that a novel JAK/STAT5 proapoptotic pathway significantly contributes to neuronal apoptosis induced by the inhibition of Rac GTPase. In several neuronal cell types, the small GTPase Rac is essential for survival. We have shown previously that the Rho family GTPase inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB) induces apoptosis in primary rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) principally via inhibition of Rac GTPase function. In the present study, incubation with ToxB activated a proapoptotic Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and a pan-JAK inhibitor protected CGNs from Rac inhibition. STAT1 expression was induced by ToxB; however, CGNs from STAT1 knock-out mice succumbed to ToxB-induced apoptosis as readily as wild-type CGNs. STAT3 displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with ToxB, and a reputed inhibitor of STAT3, cucurbitacin (JSI-124), reduced CGN apoptosis. Unexpectedly, JSI-124 failed to block STAT3 phosphorylation, and CGNs were not protected from ToxB by other known STAT3 inhibitors. In contrast, STAT5A tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ToxB was suppressed by JSI-124. In addition, roscovitine similarly inhibited STAT5A phosphorylation and protected CGNs from ToxB-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these results, adenoviral infection with a dominant negative STAT5 mutant, but not wild-type STAT5, significantly decreased ToxB-induced apoptosis of CGNs. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation with a STAT5 antibody revealed increased STAT5 binding to the promoter region of prosurvival Bcl-xL. STAT5 was recruited to the Bcl-xL promoter region in a ToxB-dependent manner, and this DNA binding preceded Bcl-xL down-regulation, suggesting transcriptional repression. These data indicate that a novel JAK/STAT5 proapoptotic pathway significantly contributes to neuronal apoptosis induced by the inhibition of Rac GTPase. Rho family GTPases are important mediators of cellular development, survival, and death. The most well characterized members of the family are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Although best known for regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics, Rho GTPases also play important roles in cell cycle progression (1.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.

In recent years, the role of Rho GTPases in neuronal survival has begun to be investigated. For example, inhibitors of 3-HMG-CoA reductase (statins) decrease the localization of Rho GTPases to the plasma membrane and induce apoptosis in rat cortical neurons (5.Tanaka T. Tatsuno I. Uchida D. Moroo I. Morio H. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Saito Y. Hirai A. Geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, an isoprenoid of mevalonate cascade, is a critical compound for rat primary cultured cortical neurons to protect the cell death induced by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2852-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the function of Rac is essential for the survival of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) 3The abbreviations used are: CGNcerebellar granule neuronToxBC. difficile toxin Bpan-JIpan-JAK inhibitorpSTATphosphorylated STATCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseAdadenoviralSOCSsuppressors of cytokine signalingGRglucocorticoid receptorDNdominant negative. as the inhibition of Rac with either large clostridial cytotoxins or overexpression of a dominant negative Rac mutant induces mitochondrially dependent apoptosis of these cells (6.Linseman D.A. Laessig T. Meintzer M.K. McClure M. Barth H. Aktories K. Heidenreich K.A. An essential role for Rac/Cdc42 GTPases in cerebellar granule neuron survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39123-39131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, use of either dominant negative Rac or siRNA against the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor alsin (ALS2) results in apoptosis of primary cultured spinal motor neurons (7.Jacquier A. Buhler E. Schäfer M.K. Bohl D. Blanchard S. Beclin C. Haase G. Alsin/Rac1 signaling controls survival and growth of spinal motoneurons.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The critical role of Rac in neuronal survival is further evidenced by the finding that ALS2 is mutated in juvenile onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although changes in Rac activity in patients harboring disease-causing ALS2 mutations have not been directly evaluated, disruption of Rac function as a possible underlying cause of neurodegenerative disease is suggested by the fact that alsin mediates Rac-dependent prosurvival signaling in primary motor neurons (7.Jacquier A. Buhler E. Schäfer M.K. Bohl D. Blanchard S. Beclin C. Haase G. Alsin/Rac1 signaling controls survival and growth of spinal motoneurons.Ann.

We have reported previously that inhibition of Rho GTPases with Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB) and in particular inhibition of Rac lead to the derepression of an as yet undefined proapoptotic JAK/STAT pathway (8.Loucks F.A. Le S.S. Zimmermann A.K. Ryan K.R. Barth H. Aktories K. Linseman D.A. Rho family GTPase inhibition reveals opposing effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling cascades on neuronal survival.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The JAK/STAT pathway has been shown to play a critical role in cytokine signaling, and JAK activation can turn on an array of downstream effects including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (9.Igaz P. Tóth S. Falus A. Biological and clinical significance of the JAK-STAT pathway; lessons from knockout mice.Inflamm. Res. 2001; 50: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An important feature of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade is that it can exert either a prosurvival or proapoptotic effect depending upon the stimulus and cell type. For example, cytoprotective signals are transmitted from the gp130 receptor to a prosurvival JAK/STAT3 pathway in cardiac myocytes (10.Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Cytokines and their receptors in cardiovascular diseases—role of gp130 signalling pathway in cardiac myocyte growth and maintenance.Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, data implicate constitutive activation of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins in breast cancer cells (11.Watson C.J. Miller W.R. Elevated levels of members of the STAT family of transcription factors in breast carcinoma nuclear extracts.Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Conversely, more recent data have emerged to suggest that the JAK/STAT pathway may also induce apoptosis under certain cellular conditions. For instance, STAT1 has been shown to mediate IFN-γ-induced apoptosis in liver cells treated with the hepatotoxic compound galactosamine (12.Kim W.H. Hong F. Radaeva S. Jaruga B. Fan S. Gao B. STAT1 plays an essential role in LPS/D-galactosamine-induced liver apoptosis and injury.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 285: G761-G768Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed in thymocytes suggest that glucocorticoids induce apoptosis through repression of prosurvival Bcl-xL in a STAT5-dependent manner (13.Rocha-Viegas L. Vicent G.P. Barañao J.L. Beato M. Pecci A. Glucocorticoids repress bcl-X expression in lymphoid cells by recruiting STAT5B to the P4 promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33959-33970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that JAK/STAT activation can induce apoptosis in diverse non-neuronal cell types, the significant involvement of this signaling pathway in neuronal apoptosis has only recently been recognized. In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of Rac induces CGN apoptosis by inactivating a prosurvival p21-activated kinase PAK/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Although we have demonstrated that disruption of this pathway results in the derepression of a proapoptotic JAK/STAT pathway, we have yet to identify which particular STAT family members mediate neuronal apoptosis in response to ToxB (8.Loucks F.A. Le S.S. Zimmermann A.K. Ryan K.R. Barth H. Aktories K. Linseman D.A. Rho family GTPase inhibition reveals opposing effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling cascades on neuronal survival.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the current study focuses on identifying the STAT family members involved and the consequences of STAT activation downstream of Rac inhibition in CGNs. These primary neuronal cultures are extremely homogeneous and have been used extensively to examine molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis (6.Linseman D.A. Laessig T. Meintzer M.K.

Although we show that Rac inhibition leads to the up-regulation of STAT1 expression and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, we report that these transcription factors are not responsible for inducing apoptosis in ToxB-treated CGNs. Instead, we demonstrate that STAT5 is activated and subsequently translocates into the nucleus to transcriptionally repress prosurvival Bcl-xL in Rac-inhibited CGNs. To our knowledge, these results are the first to identify a proapoptotic function for STAT5 in primary neurons. C. difficile toxin B was isolated or prepared as a recombinant protein as described previously (17.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K.

The polyclonal antibodies used for immunoblotting STAT1, STAT3, and phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence detection were from Amersham Biosciences. The polyclonal antibody used to detect active caspase-3 by immunocytochemistry was from Promega (Madison, WI). For Western blotting, active caspase-3 was detected with a polyclonal antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Hoechst dye 33258, and a monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin were from Sigma. Anti-rat and anti-mouse Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The monoclonal antibody against LAP-2 and the polyclonal total STAT1 and total STAT5 antibodies used for Western blotting were from BD Biosciences. Purvalanol A, JSI-124, roscovitine, mifepristone, JAK3 inhibitor, and the small molecule JAK inhibitor I (2-(1,1-dimethyl)9-fluro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz[h]imidaz[4,5,-f]isoquinolin-7-one; pan-JAK inhibitor (pan-JI)) were from Calbiochem. The specific JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was purchased from ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN), and the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib was from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Rat CGNs were isolated and cultured from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups of both sexes (15–19 g) as described previously (6.Linseman D.A. Laessig T. Meintzer M.K. McClure M. Barth H. Aktories K. Heidenreich K.A. An essential role for Rac/Cdc42 GTPases in cerebellar granule neuron survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39123-39131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, CGNs were plated on 35-mm-diameter plastic dishes coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 2.0 × 106cells/ml in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating to limit the growth of non-neuronal cells. With this protocol, cultures were ∼95% pure for granule neurons. In general, experiments were performed after 6–7 days in culture. STAT1 KO mice and their wild-type littermates were obtained commercially from Taconic (Hudson, NY). CGNs from these mice were isolated and cultured essentially as described above. After treatment as described under “Results,” CGN whole cell lysates or immune complexes of STAT5A or STAT5B were prepared for Western blotting essentially as described previously (8.Loucks F.A. Le S.S. Zimmermann A.K. Ryan K.R. Barth H. Aktories K. Linseman D.A. Rho family GTPase inhibition reveals opposing effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling cascades on neuronal survival.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a commercially available protein assay kit (BCA, Thermo Scientific), and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using equal amounts of protein followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.01% sodium azide for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C). Membranes were incubated for 1 h in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes with PBS-T five times over 25 min. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-T. Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing the membranes with PBS-T five times over 25 min. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Blots shown are representative of a minimum of three independent experiments. After induction of apoptosis, CGNs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye (8 μg/ml final concentration) for 30 min. CGNs containing condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. Typically, ∼800 cells were quantified from each 35-mm well by randomly counting five 40× fields. Final counts represent data obtained from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. CGNs were plated at a density of 2.0 × 106cells/ml in 35-mm wells. After ToxB treatment, CGNs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed once in PBS, and then permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and cells were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently washed five times in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with DAPI and either Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were washed five additional times with PBS before the addition of an antiquench solution composed of 0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS. Fluorescent images were captured using a 40× water oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a Cooke Sensicam deep cooled charge-coupled device camera and a Slidebook software analysis program for digital deconvolution (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO). Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described by Li et al. (18.Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. Myocyte enhancer factor 2A and 2D undergo phosphorylation and caspase-mediated degradation during apoptosis of rat cerebellar granule neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CGNs were detached from culture dishes by a cell scraper and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed and homogenized with 15 strokes of a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer to release nuclei. Next, the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 s to pellet the nuclei. The supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were removed, the pellets were resuspended in a HEPES/glycerol buffer, and nuclear proteins were extracted at 4 °C for 45 min. Insoluble nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were dialyzed against a Tris/glycerol buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. Wild-type STAT5 and dominant negative STAT5 adenoviral constructs were prepared as described previously (19.Ahonen T.J. Xie J. LeBaron M.J. Zhu J. Nurmi M. Alanen K. Rui H. Nevalainen M.T. Inhibition of transcription factor Stat5 induces cell death of human prostate cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27287-27292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CGNs were infected in vitro on day 6 with adenovirus carrying GFP, wild-type STAT5, or dominant negative STAT5 at a multiplicity of infection of 100. At 48 h of infection, cells were treated with 40 ng/ml ToxB. At 72 h of infection, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot analysis, or cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry as described above. ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the ChIP assay kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). CGNs were treated with 40 ng/ml ToxB for 0 and 8 h. Next, DNA-associated proteins were cross-linked with formaldehyde. Cross-linked chromatin was extracted, sheared enzymatically, and incubated with a ChIP grade STAT5 antibody overnight at 4 °C and protein G-agarose beads. After washing, immune complexes were eluted from the beads, heated to reverse the cross-links, and treated with proteinase K and RNase A to remove proteins and any contaminating RNA. DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers provided by SABiosciences that generate a 114-bp product that corresponds to the promoter region of the rat Bcl-xL gene: forward primer, 5′-GAAGCTGACACCAGTGAGTGTCCGAACGGTAAATGCCTACGAAGCTGACACCAGTGAGTG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-GTAGGCATTTACCGTTCGGA-3′. These primers were selected because they amplify a sequence of DNA that is near two predicted STAT5 binding sites on the promoter region of Bcl-xL variant 1 and variant 2. As a negative control, ChIP reactions were performed as described in the absence of STAT5 antibody followed by PCR. PCR was performed using the following conditions: one cycle of 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Results represent the mean ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey's test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Images and immunoblots are representative of at least three independent experiments. For the cycle threshold values reported in Fig. 10A, results represent the mean for four independent experiments, and statistical differences were evaluated by a Student's t test. To evaluate the involvement of Rac in CGN survival, cultures were incubated with C. difficile toxin B. This cytotoxin monoglucosylates a key threonine residue in the switch 1 region of Rho GTPases, thus preventing any interactions with downstream effectors (17.Just I. Selzer J.

Aktories K. Structure and mode of action of clostridial glucosylating toxins: the ABCD model.Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that inhibition of the Rho family member Rac with ToxB elicits the derepression of a proapoptotic JAK/STAT pathway in CGNs (8.Loucks F.A. Le S.S. Zimmermann A.K. Ryan K.R.

Neurochem. 2006; 97: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the specific STAT family protein involved in this pathway has not yet been elucidated. As STAT1 is the most extensively described family member in studies of apoptosis (21.Sahni M. Raz R. Coffin J.D. Levy D. Basilico C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4066-4074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we examined its expression following Rac inhibition. CGNs incubated with ToxB for 24 h exhibited a marked increase in the expression of STAT1 (Fig. 1A). Moreover, co-incubation with a small molecule pan-JI (structure shown in Fig. 1B) was sufficient to prevent the induction of STAT1 by ToxB, confirming that the increase in STAT1 is dependent on JAK activation (Fig. 1A). In addition to provoking apoptosis in a variety of diverse cell types (24.Thomas M. Finnegan C.E. Rogers K.M. Purcell J.W. Trimble A. Johnston P.G. Boland M.P.

Harada J. Chiarugi A. Moskowitz M.A. STAT1 is activated in neurons after ischemia and contributes to ischemic brain injury.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether derepression of a JAK/STAT1 pathway exerts a similar proapoptotic effect in Rac-inhibited neurons, we examined the neuroprotective effects of pan-JI in ToxB-treated CGNs. Examination of nuclei by Hoechst staining revealed increased apoptotic cell death in ToxB-treated CGNs as evidenced by nuclear fragmentation and/or condensation. The effect of ToxB on the morphology of CGN nuclei was significantly attenuated by co-treatment with the pan-JI (Fig. 1D, lower panels). As an additional means of identifying apoptotic cells, we examined caspase-3 activation as cleavage to its active proteolytic fragments is a hallmark of apoptosis and signifies commitment to cell death (28.Porter A.G. Jänicke R.U. Emerging roles of caspase-3 in apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar). CGNs treated with ToxB alone exhibited increased activation of caspase-3, and this effect was blocked by pan-JI (Fig. 1D, upper panels). Quantification of apoptosis in CGNs co-incubated with ToxB and pan-JI revealed that the pan-JI conferred significant neuroprotection and effectively reduced apoptosis to control levels (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of Rac with ToxB results in the activation of a proapoptotic JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway in CGNs. To elucidate the specific JAK family member(s) that induces STAT activation downstream of Rac inhibition in CGNs, we evaluated the protective effects of more targeted JAK inhibitors against ToxB. We found that two specific JAK3 inhibitors (JAK3 inhibitor and tofacitinib) did not confer significant neuroprotection in ToxB-treated CGNs (Fig. 1E). However, we found that the JAK1/2 inhibitor (ruxolitinib) modestly protected CGNs from ToxB-mediated apoptosis, although this effect did not quite reach statistical significance. Based on the marked protective effects of the pan-JI (which inhibits JAK1–3 and Tyk2 with similar potency) and our results showing that more targeted inhibition of specific JAK family members (JAK1–3) is not overtly protective, these data suggest a possible contribution of Tyk2 in mediating the apoptosis downstream of ToxB-mediated Rac inhibition in primary CGNs. Next, we examined the phosphorylation status and localization of STAT1 in CGNs exposed to ToxB. To translocate into the nucleus and influence gene expression, members of the STAT family must be activated via tyrosine phosphorylation (29.Rawlings J.S. Rosler K.M. Harrison D.A. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1281-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Whereas total STAT1 expression increased in CGNs treated for 24 h with ToxB, time course experiments performed for up to 24 h did not show significant activation of STAT1 as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, using immunostaining to examine STAT1 localization, we found that STAT1 remained cytosolic and perinuclear in CGNs following ToxB treatment (Fig. 2B). These observations are striking in that they suggest that the observed up-regulation of STAT1 expression may not be directly involved in apoptosis following ToxB-mediated inhibition of Rac. To definitively establish whether the up-regulation of total STAT1 expression in the absence of enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation is involved in ToxB-mediated apoptosis, we measured the effects of ToxB on primary cultures of CGNs isola"
https://openalex.org/W1993840914,"The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and the main target of endogenous opioid neuropeptides and morphine. Upon activation by ligands, MORs are rapidly internalized via clathrin-coated pits in heterologous cells and dissociated striatal neurons. After initial endocytosis, resensitized receptors recycle back to the cell surface by vesicular delivery for subsequent cycles of activation. MOR trafficking has been linked to opioid tolerance after acute exposure to agonist, but it is also involved in the resensitization process. Several studies describe the regulation and mechanism of MOR endocytosis, but little is known about the recycling of resensitized receptors to the cell surface. To study this process, we induced internalization of MOR with [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) and morphine and imaged in real time single vesicles recycling receptors to the cell surface. We determined single vesicle recycling kinetics and the number of receptors contained in them. Then we demonstrated that rapid vesicular delivery of recycling MORs to the cell surface was mediated by the actin-microtubule cytoskeleton. Recycling was also dependent on Rab4, Rab11, and the Ca(2+)-sensitive motor protein myosin Vb. Finally, we showed that recycling is acutely modulated by the presence of agonists and the levels of cAMP. Our work identifies a novel trafficking mechanism that increases the number of cell surface MORs during acute agonist exposure, effectively reducing the development of opioid tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2044194617,"The aim of the present experiments was to clarify the subunit stoichiometry of P2X2/3 and P2X2/6 receptors, where the same subunit (P2X2) forms a receptor with two different partners (P2X3 or P2X6). For this purpose, four non-functional Ala mutants of the P2X2, P2X3, and P2X6 subunits were generated by replacing single, homologous amino acids particularly important for agonist binding. Co-expression of these mutants in HEK293 cells to yield the P2X2 WT/P2X3 mutant or P2X2 mutant/P2X3 WT receptors resulted in a selective blockade of agonist responses in the former combination only. In contrast, of the P2X2 WT/P2X6 mutant and P2X2 mutant/P2X6 WT receptors, only the latter combination failed to respond to agonists. The effects of α,β-methylene-ATP and 2-methylthio-ATP were determined by measuring transmembrane currents by the patch clamp technique and intracellular Ca(2+) transients by the Ca(2+)-imaging method. Protein labeling, purification, and PAGE confirmed the assembly and surface trafficking of the investigated WT and WT/mutant combinations in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In conclusion, both electrophysiological and biochemical investigations uniformly indicate that one subunit of P2X2 and two subunits of P2X3 form P2X2/3 heteromeric receptors, whereas two subunits of P2X2 and one subunit of P2X6 constitute P2X2/6 receptors. Further, it was shown that already two binding sites of the three possible ones are sufficient to allow these receptors to react with their agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2048505432,"The period of four oscillation of the S state intermediates of the water oxidizing complex in Photosystem II (PSII) is commonly analyzed by the Kok parameters. The important miss factor determines the efficiency for each S transition. Commonly, an equal miss factor has been used in the analysis. We have used EPR signals which probe all S states in the same sample during S cycle advancement. This allows, for the first time, to measure directly the miss parameter for each S state transition. Experiments were performed in PSII membrane preparations from spinach in the presence of electron acceptor at 1 °C and 20 °C. The data show that the miss parameter is different in different transitions and shows different temperature dependence. We found no misses at 1 °C and 10% misses at 20 °C during the S(1)→S(2) transition. The highest miss factor was found in the S(2)→S(3) transition which decreased from 23% to 16% with increasing temperature. For the S(3)→S(0) transition the miss parameter was found to be 7% at 1 °C and decreased to 3% at 20 °C. For the S(0)→S(1) transition the miss parameter was found to be approximately 10% at both temperatures. The contribution from the acceptor side in the form of recombination reactions as well as from the donor side of PSII to the uneven misses is discussed. It is suggested that the different transition efficiency in each S transition partly reflects the chemistry at the CaMn(4)O(5) cluster. That consequently contributes to the uneven misses during S cycle turnover in PSII."

Analysis of human postmortem brain lysates by SDS-PAGE and Western blot reveals htt as full-length and fragmented. Here we used Blue Native PAGE (BNP) and Western blots to study native htt in human postmortem brain. Antisera against htt detected a single band broadly migrating at 575-850 kDa in control brain and at 650-885 kDa in heterozygous and Venezuelan homozygous HD brains. Anti-polyglutamine antisera detected full-length mutant htt in HD brain. There was little htt cleavage even if lysates were pretreated with trypsin, indicating a property of native htt to resist protease cleavage. A soluble mutant htt fragment of about 180 kDa was detected with anti-htt antibody Ab1 (htt-(1-17)) and increased when lysates were treated with denaturants (SDS, 8 M urea, DTT, or trypsin) before BNP. Wild-type htt was more resistant to denaturants. Based on migration of in vitro translated htt fragments, the 180-kDa segment terminated ≈htt 670-880 amino acids. If second dimension SDS-PAGE followed BNP, the 180-kDa mutant htt was absent, and 43-50 kDa htt fragments appeared. Brain lysates from two HD mouse models expressed native full-length htt; a mutant fragment formed if lysates were pretreated with 8 M urea + DTT. Native full-length mutant htt in embryonic HD(140Q/140Q) mouse primary neurons was intact during cell death and when cell lysates were exposed to denaturants before BNP. Thus, native mutant htt occurs in brain and primary neurons as a soluble full-length monomer."
https://openalex.org/W2075024467,"Ongoing debate in the ribosome field has focused on the role of bound E-site tRNA and the Shine-Dalgarno-anti-Shine-Dalgarno (SD-aSD) interaction on A-site tRNA interactions and the fidelity of tRNA selection. Here we use an in vitro reconstituted Escherichia coli translation system to explore the reported effects of E-site-bound tRNA and SD-aSD interactions on tRNA selection events and find no evidence for allosteric coupling. A large set of experiments exploring the role of the E-site tRNA in miscoding failed to recapitulate the observations of earlier studies (Di Giacco, V., Márquez, V., Qin, Y., Pech, M., Triana-Alonso, F. J., Wilson, D. N., and Nierhaus, K. H. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 10715-10720 and Geigenmüller, U., and Nierhaus, K. H. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 4527-4533); the frequency of miscoding was unaffected by the presence of E-site-bound cognate tRNA. Moreover, our data provide clear evidence that the reported effects of the SD-aSD interaction on fidelity can be attributed to the binding of ribosomes to an unanticipated site on the mRNA (in the absence of the SD sequence) that provides a cognate pairing codon leading naturally to incorporation of the purported ""noncognate"" amino acid."

Our results are the first demonstration of the strong protective power of small quantities of antivenom used in the context of severe envenomation with crude venom. Scorpion envenomation is widespread in several countries, where it still constitutes a significant public health problem. Of the 1500 species described worldwide, 30 scorpions are considered to be potentially dangerous to human beings, and each year more than 1.2 million scorpion stings are reported and known to cause more than 3250 deaths (1Chippaux J.P. Goyffon M. Epidemiology of scorpionism. A global appraisal.Acta Trop. 2008; 107: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Prendini L. Wheeler W.C. Scorpion higher phylogeny and classification, taxonomic anarchy, and standards for peer review in on-line publishing.Cladistics. 2005; 21: 446-494Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The epidemiological pattern is fairly similar in many countries, but the incidence and severity of envenomation are closely correlated to the geographical area under consideration. Among the general population, the incidence varies from five scorpion stings per 100,000 inhabitants in the South of France, producing mild symptoms, to more than 1000 per 100,000 in Algeria, Tunisia, Mexico, and Israel (3Chowell G. Díaz-Dueñas P. Bustos-Saldaña R. Mireles A.A. Fet V. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of scorpionism in Colima, Mexico (2000–2001).Toxicon. 2006; 47: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in these severely affected countries the mortality is often under-reported, because in many cases death does not occur in a hospital, and epidemiological data are scarce because of under-reporting and the small number of studies related to scorpion envenomation that have been reported. Like Leiurus quinquestratus and Androctonus mauretanicus, Androctonus australis hector is considered to be one of the most dangerous scorpions, responsible for serious and fatal events in humans (4Bouaziz M. Bahloul M. Kallel H. Samet M. Ksibi H. Dammak H. Ahmed M.N. Chtara K. Chelly H. Hamida C.B. Rekik N.

Multivariate analysis of 951 cases.Toxicon. 2008; 52: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to Adi-Bessalem et al. (5Adi-Bessalem S. Hammoudi-Triki D. Laraba-Djebari F. Pathophysiological effects of Androctonus australis hector scorpion venom. Tissue damages and inflammatory response.Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 2008; 60: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the pathophysiological effects of A. australis hector venom lead to tissue damage and an inflammatory response. A. australis is mainly involved in envenomations in North Africa, especially in Tunisia and Algeria, where the annual incidence of scorpion stings is of 420 per 100,000 inhabitants and 120 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively (6Benguedda A.C.

Pasteur Tunis. 2001; 78: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar). The active substances in scorpion venom are neurotoxic peptides. Although these peptides are only present in small amounts (<5% of venom dry weight), they are responsible for almost all fatal cases in mammals. The toxicity of A. australis hector venom is mainly due to three basic low molecular weight (∼7 kDa) neurotoxins that act on the voltage-gated sodium channels of excitable cells. These toxins belong to two distinct structural and immunological groups as follows: (i) group I contains AahI 2The abbreviations used are: AahIA. australis hector group IAahIIA. australis hector group II. and AahIII, which display up to 80% sequence identity; and (ii) group II contains AahII, which shares only 44–45% sequence identity with AahI and AahIII (9el Ayeb M.

No cross-antigenicity has been reported between these two groups of toxins (11Delori P. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Scorpion venoms and neurotoxins. An immunological study.Toxicon. 1981; 19: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These toxins have been relatively well characterized for many years; their concentrations have been determined, and the variations observed reflect the polymorphism of scorpion toxins at an individual level. This is important because this functional and antigenic polymorphism is a problem in preparing an effective antivenom (11Delori P. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Scorpion venoms and neurotoxins. An immunological study.Toxicon. 1981; 19: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The proportions of the three toxins differ in different venoms. The AahII toxin is the most abundant, followed by AahI, and then AahIII (12Devaux C. Jouirou B. Naceur Krifi M. Clot-Faybesse O. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Quantitative variability in the biodistribution and in toxinokinetic studies of the three main α toxins from the Androctonus australis hector scorpion venom.Toxicon. 2004; 43: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AahII seems to be responsible for 70% of the toxicity and produces the greatest toxic effect, regardless of the route of injection (intracerebroventricular or subcutaneous (s.c.)) in mice. The LD50 of an s.c. injection in mice weighing 20 g is 180 ng for AahII versus 380 and 420 ng for AahI and AahIII, respectively (13Martin M.F. Rochat H. Large scale purification of toxins from the venom of the scorpion Androctonus australis Hector.Toxicon. 1986; 24: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A. australis hector group I A. australis hector group II. At present, the only treatment for scorpion envenomations used worldwide is passive immunotherapy, which is based on the administration of antibodies produced by a hyperimmunized animal against the venom. However, the use of plasma antivenom serum therapy remains controversial (14Abroug F. ElAtrous S. Nouira S. Haguiga H. Touzi N. Bouchoucha S. Serotherapy in scorpion envenomation. A randomized controlled trial.Lancet. 1999; 354: 906-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Plasma antivenom serum always has some disadvantages, such as serious undesirable side effects, including anaphylactic shock and serum sickness. Moreover, previous pharmacokinetic studies of venom components have shown that toxins diffuse rapidly from the bloodstream into the tissues, and various factors, such as the antibody form used and the route or the timing of administration of current anti-venom therapy, can limit the clinical efficacy of this treatment (15Krifi M.N.

In recent years, antibodies have been engineered, and many studies have focused on novel anti-scorpion toxin antibody formats with improved pharmacokinetic properties (greater stability and faster tissue penetration), higher binding affinity, and neutralizing effects. In particular, the use of smaller recombinant antibody fragments, such as scFv or Fab and more recently VHH, has made it possible to achieve more efficient neutralization of scorpion venom toxins. Indeed, each of them has been shown to protect mice experimentally challenged with a single toxin (19Hmila I. Abdallah R B.A. Saerens D. Benlasfar Z. Conrath K. Ayeb M.E. Muyldermans S.

However, because of the absence of cross-antigenicity between the different toxins (AahII, AahI, and/or AahIII), the main drawback of these antibody fragments remains their failure to protect mice challenged with the whole venom. In 2007, using the monoclonal antibodies 9C2 and 4C1, which neutralize the AahI and AahII toxins, respectively, we designed for the first time a bispecific tandem-scFv (T94H6), which is able to not only neutralize the most potent toxins in A. australis venom but also to protect experimentally envenomed mice against the overall toxicity of the venom (27Juste M. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Devaux C. Billiald P. Aubrey N. Using a recombinant bispecific antibody to block Na+-channel toxins protects against experimental scorpion envenoming.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other groups have subsequently confirmed the usefulness of this new generation of bispecific antivenoms with a bispecific nanobody (28Hmila I. Saerens D. Ben Abderrazek R. Vincke C. Abidi N. Benlasfar Z. Govaert J. El Ayeb M. Bouhaouala-Zahar B. Muyldermans S. A bispecific nanobody to provide full protection against lethal scorpion envenoming.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3479-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite the greatly increased protection they provide, we believe that bispecific fragments are not a completely appropriate response to provide effective protection against the whole venom. Indeed, in this context, one bispecific fragment is theoretically capable of neutralizing a single toxin in each group in a one to one ratio without taking into account the following: (i) the affinity of the scFvs against the toxin, (ii) the distinctive concentrations of toxins, or (iii) the degree of toxicity of each toxin. To remedy this limitation of the current bispecific recombinants, we propose to develop a new strategy based on the use of a mixture of the following two diabodies: Db9C2 (29Aubrey N. Devaux C. Sizaret P.Y. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. Design and evaluation of a diabody to improve protection against a potent scorpion neurotoxin.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) directed against group I, and a new antibody fragment, Db4C1op, directed against group II, which includes the most poisonous scorpion venom toxins AahII. This approach allows us to adjust the quantities of the different antibodies, with a molar ratio in which Db4C1op dominates. To design Db4C1op, we optimized the scFv4C1 described by Mousli et al. (24Mousli M. Devaux C. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. A recombinant single-chain antibody fragment that neutralizes toxin II from the venom of the scorpion Androctonus australis hector.FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); this allowed us to optimize its production and, especially, for the first time to purify it. Db4C1op was then characterized structurally and functionally before being used in a mixture with Db9C2 to protect mice challenged with whole venom under conditions that mimic natural envenomation. By this method, we obtained better protection of mice against whole A. australis venom than is provided by other strategies previously described in the literature. Female C57BL/six mice (20 ± 2 g body weight) were obtained from Janvier (France). Animals were cared for in accordance with European Guidelines on animal welfare (2010/63/UE). The mice were housed in the conventional animal facilities of our laboratory and received water and food ad libitum before being used for the study. A. australis hector venom was collected in the Chellala area of Algeria before being water-extracted, freeze-dried, and stored at −20 °C until use (30Miranda F. Kupeyan C. Rochat H. Rochat C.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). Recombinant anti-AahI antibody fragment derived from hybridoma 9C2 ((scFv59C2)2 (also known as diabody Db9C2)) was produced and purified as described previously (29Aubrey N. Devaux C. Sizaret P.Y. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. Design and evaluation of a diabody to improve protection against a potent scorpion neurotoxin.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized (Eurogentec), and their sequences are shown below. The restriction sites of interest (BamHI (GGATCC) and XhoI (CTCGAG)) are underlined: Link5R4C1, 5′-AGT GTC GGA TCC GAT GTT CAG ATG ACC CAG; VLF4C1, 5′- CTG TAG CTC GAG TTA TTT GAT TTC CAG TTT GGT GCC. The optimized synthetic gene scFv4C1op (anti-AahII antibody) fused to the mrc-ox74 epitope tag was assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR products. The fragment was cloned into pMA (AmpR) using the SacI and KpnI cloning sites (Invitrogen). The synthetic gene was then subcloned in-frame with the leader sequence pelB into the expression vector pSW1 using PstI and XhoI restriction enzymes, as described previously (29Aubrey N. Devaux C. Sizaret P.Y. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. Design and evaluation of a diabody to improve protection against a potent scorpion neurotoxin.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, the plasmid pSW1-4C1op was used as a template to create the diabody-4C1op gene (Db4C1op) in a PCR to modify the flanking regions of the gene encoding the 4C1op VL domain with the primers VLF4C1, to delete the MRC-OX74 sequence, and Link5R4C1, to generate subsequently a short rigid (Gly4-Ser) intramolecular linker. These primers carry unique restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI suitable for cloning in pSW1–4C1op. Escherichia coli strain TG1 was used for all the cloning steps. The sequences for all newly constructed genes and plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Cogenics Online). All basic molecular biology procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook and Russel (32Sambrook J. R. D. W. Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Taq polymerase, restriction enzymes, calf intestinal phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega. All chemicals were of standard grade from Sigma or equivalent. For expression of functional recombinant antibody fragments in the bacterial periplasm, the plasmids pSW1-Db4C1op and pSW1-Db9C2 were first cloned into E. coli strain HB2151 (K12, ara, D(lac-pro), thi/F′ proA+B+, laclq lacZDM15). Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C to A600 nm = 1.2 in 2× YT medium (Sigma) containing 0.05 g/liter ampicillin (Euromedex). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Euromedex) was then added to yield a final concentration of 0.1 and 0.84 mm for pSW1-Db4C1op and pSW1-Db9C2, respectively, and growth was then continued at 16 °C for 18 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifuging at 4 °C (5000 × g, 20 min), and periplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (29Aubrey N. Devaux C. Sizaret P.Y. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. Design and evaluation of a diabody to improve protection against a potent scorpion neurotoxin.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All the soluble periplasmic proteins were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and finally centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The recombinant diabodies (Db4C1op and Db9C2) were purified by loading the periplasmic preparations extracted onto a protein l-agarose column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After washing the gel with PBS, the adsorbed protein was eluted in different fractions with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.9. The elution fractions containing the functional recombinant protein were pooled and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.9, for buffer exchange, before being centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and then stored at −20 °C. The purification process was also checked using SDS-PAGE on homogeneous reduced 12% gel, Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and direct ELISA using either AahII toxin, as reported previously by Devaux et al. (23Devaux C. Moreau E. Goyffon M. Rochat H. Billiald P. Construction and functional evaluation of a single-chain antibody fragment that neutralizes toxin AahI from the venom of the scorpion Androctonus australis hector.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics software (ProtParam tool) was used to determine the theoretical molecular weight of the recombinant diabodies and their extinction coefficients (33Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. A new generation of information retrieval tools for biologists. The example of the ExPASy WWW server.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein content of the solution was measured by UV spectrophotometry at A280 nm = 1.783 liter g−1 cm−1 for the Db4C1op (51705.4 Da) and A280 nm = 2.111 liter g−1cm−1 for Db9C2 (49858.8 Da). The purified diabody preparations were resolved by size-exclusion FPLC on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (molecular mass range 3000–70,000) (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with standards from Roche Applied Science. The column was loaded with 20 μg of the sample to be analyzed. Proteins were eluted with PBS at a rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected with a UV detector at 280 nm. To form immunocomplexes, 9.03 μg (193 pmol) of the Db4C1op was incubated with 0–2.53 μg (0–387 pmol) of toxin AahII in 125 μl of PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by FPLC gel filtration using the Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Female C57BL/six mice weighing ± 20 g were used for in vivo protection assays. First, the whole A. australis hector venom was titrated to determine the LD50 in mice by subcutaneous injection. A variable quantity of the A. australis venom was then injected in a volume of 200 μl into mice by subcutaneous route. Immediately afterward or several minutes later (as indicated), each diabody singly or the mixture of diabodies (Db4C1op and Db9C2) was intraperitoneally injected into mice in a volume of 200 μl. Eight animals were used for each test condition; the clinical signs and survival ratio were recorded for 24 h after injection. In control experiments, the mixture of diabodies was replaced by 0.1% BSA. To increase the scFv4C1op yield and to obtain a purified product, the following changes were made (Fig. 1A). First, the scFv4C1op amino acid sequence was engineered to produce the following changes. The VH (EVHLVE) and VL (DVLMTQSPLSLPVSLGDQASIS) regions of scFv4C1 were replaced by the N-terminal regions of Db9C2 (QVQLQQ and DVQMTQSPASLSVSGQTVTIT, respectively), plus the E17Q substitution in the VL framework 1 allowing the promotion of PpL binding activity (34Muzard J. Adi-Bessalem S. Juste M. Laraba-Djebari F. Aubrey N. Billiald P. Grafting of protein L binding activity onto recombinant antibody fragments.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 388: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Second, from the previous amino acid sequence, a synthetic gene was performed according to GeneArt. This gene was optimized for the prokaryotic expression system before being inserted into the bacterial expression vector pSW1 consisting of the pelB signal sequence, which was expected to direct the nascent recombinant protein to the periplasm of the bacteria. To generate Db4C1op, the pSW1-Db4C1op expression vector was designed after constructing a coding sequence and then cloned into pSW1–4C1op as a BamHI/XhoI insert. The genetic construction consisted of a PCR amplification of a cassette encoding part of the (Gly4-Ser) linker and the entire light-chain variable region of antibody 4C1 with primers VLF4C1 and Link5R4C1. Following restriction with BamHI and XhoI, this gene was inserted into the pSW1–4C1op vector restricted in the same way. The vector constructed was designated pSW1-Db4C1op. The recombinant clones carrying the plasmid containing the insert fused in-frame with the PelB sequence were selected by PCR screening, and DNA sequencing was performed to verify that no mutation appeared (Fig. 1A). pSW1-Db4C1op encodes diabody 4C1op, free of tag, in which the VH C-terminal Ser-128 is joined to the VL N-terminal D1 according to IMGT® by the short rigid (Gly4-Ser) intramolecular linker. This linker creates a steric constraint that is predicted for the association between two molecules of Db4C1op. Because the structural properties of Db9C2 have already been extensively characterized as described in Aubrey et al. (29Aubrey N. Devaux C. Sizaret P.Y. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. Design and evaluation of a diabody to improve protection against a potent scorpion neurotoxin.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in this part of the study we focused on the new antibody fragment format, Db4C1op. The Db4C1op gene was expressed by growing the recombinant HB2151 bacteria induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The experimental conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” were selected after testing several induction conditions. As related previously, there are no standard conditions suitable for the periplasmic production of all kinds of periplasmic scFv in bacteria. Soluble proteins were extracted from the periplasm of induced bacteria by EDTA treatment combined with osmotic shock, and the purification of Db4C1op fragments was achieved by affinity chromatography on a protein l-agarose gel column, which had previously been shown to be effective for the purification of other scFv and Fab molecules. Yields of 0.3–0.85 mg/liter of bacterial culture of soluble affinity-purified Db4C1op were normally obtained. The Db4C1op preparation was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography. The electrophoresis of the Db4C1op preparation under reducing conditions led to the observation of a homogeneous and pure Db4C1op, with a single protein band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of slightly less than 31 kDa (Fig. 1B). No minor bands were detected, demonstr"

https://openalex.org/W2120232745,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are key regulators of signal transduction that specifically phosphorylate activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to terminate signaling. Biochemical and crystallographic studies have provided great insight into mammalian GRK2/3 interactions and structure. However, despite extensive in vitro characterization, little is known about the in vivo contribution of these described GRK structural domains and interactions to proper GRK function in signal regulation. We took advantage of the disrupted chemosensory behavior characteristic of Caenorhabditis elegans grk-2 mutants to discern the interactions required for proper in vivo Ce-GRK-2 function. Informed by mammalian crystallographic and biochemical data, we introduced amino acid substitutions into the Ce-grk-2 coding sequence that are predicted to selectively disrupt GPCR phosphorylation, Gα(q/11) binding, Gβγ binding, or phospholipid binding. Changing the most amino-terminal residues, which have been shown in mammalian systems to be required specifically for GPCR phosphorylation but not phosphorylation of alternative substrates or recruitment to activated GPCRs, eliminated the ability of Ce-GRK-2 to restore chemosensory signaling. Disrupting interaction between the predicted Ce-GRK-2 amino-terminal α-helix and kinase domain, posited to stabilize GRKs in their active ATP- and GPCR-bound conformation, also eliminated Ce-GRK-2 chemosensory function. Finally, although changing residues within the RH domain, predicted to disrupt interaction with Gα(q/11), did not affect Ce-GRK-2 chemosensory function, disruption of the predicted PH domain-mediated interactions with Gβγ and phospholipids revealed that both contribute to Ce-GRK-2 function in vivo. Combined, we have demonstrated functional roles for broadly conserved GRK2/3 structural domains in the in vivo regulation of organismal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2134909621,"With the use of planar substrates and collagen gels, the field of mechanotransduction has focused on the role of extracellular matrix stiffness, mechanical tension, and TGF-β1 in generating a more contractile fibroblast. However, little is known about the role of cell-cell interactions in inducing cellular contraction. We used 3-dimensional self-assembled microtissues, in which cell-cell interactions dominate, and a recently developed cell power assay (an assay for mechanotransduction) to quantify the effects of TGF-β1 vs. the heterotypic cell interface on the power exerted by pure normal human fibroblast (NHF) and pure rat hepatocyte 35 (H35) microtissues and their mixes. As a control, we found that TGF-β1 only doubled the power output of pure NHF and pure H35 microtissues, whereas the heterotypic environment resulted in a 5-fold increase in cell power (0.24±0.05 to 1.17±0.13 fJ/h). Seeding TGF-β1-treated NHFs with untreated H35 cells demonstrated that the heterotypic environment and TGF-β1 synergistically increase cell power by 22× by maximizing heterotypic cell interactions. Using a mathematical simulation of stress generation, we showed that tensile forces can be enhanced by heterotypic cell interactions. These data render a new understanding of how heterotypic cell interactions may increase cellular force generation during wound healing.—Youssef, J., Chen, P., Shenoy, V. B., Morgan, J. R.

https://openalex.org/W1975766490,"Temperate phages mediate gene transfer and can modify the properties of their host organisms through the acquisition of novel genes, a process called lysogeny. The KplE1 prophage is one of the 10 prophage regions in Escherichia coli K12 MG1655. KplE1 is defective for lysis but fully competent for site-specific recombination. The TorI recombination directionality factor is strictly required for prophage excision from the host genome. We have previously shown that DnaJ promotes KplE1 excision by increasing the affinity of TorI for its site-specific recombination DNA target. Here, we provide evidence of a direct association between TorI and DnaJ using in vitro cross-linking assays and limited proteolysis experiments that show that this interaction allows both proteins to be transiently protected from trypsin digestion. Interestingly, NMR titration experiments showed that binding of DnaJ involves specific regions of the TorI structure. These regions, mainly composed of α-helices, are located on a surface opposite the DNA-binding site. Taken together, we propose that DnaJ, without the aid of DnaK/GrpE, is capable of increasing the efficiency of KplE1 excision by causing a conformational stabilization that allows TorI to adopt a more favorable conformation for binding to its specific DNA target."
https://openalex.org/W2047416038,"The common γc subunit molecule is shared among all γc cytokines and clearly involved in T-cell function, but its role in HIV infection and immunity is not well understood. Here, we examined expression and function of γc on T cells during SIV infection in Rhesus macaques. Surface γc distribution was differentially expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ naive/memory cell populations in various lymphoid tissues of normal macaques. However, surface γc expression was rapidly and significantly down-regulated on T cells in acute infection with pathogenic SIV, compared to infection with a less virulent SHIV or controls and did not recover on CD8+ T cells in the chronic stage. Moreover, the peripheral and CD4+T cell loss was inversely correlated with γc+CD8+ T cells in individual tissues. γc+T cells were mainly functional as evidenced by higher cytokine secretion and proliferative capacity. Further in vitro experiments found that surface γc expression could be down-regulated following high level of IL-7 treatment by both internalization and shedding. Down-regulation of γc during early HIV/SIV infection may inhibit T-cell function, particularly of CD8+ T cells, and, may be linked with immune failure and loss of viral containment.—Xu, H., Wang, X., Pahar, B., Alvarez, X., Rasmussen, K.
