https://openalex.org/W2064567786,"The linear virion form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has variable numbers of direct tandem 500 bp repeats at each terminus. The terminal restriction endonuclease fragments and the fused terminal fragments in the intracellular episomal form are heterogeneous in size, and vary by increments of 500 bp. The structure of the termini of EBV in carcinomas of the nasopharynx and the parotid gland was compared with the EBV termini in monoclonal and polyclonal tissues or cell lines. A single band representing the EBV joined termini was detected in each of the carcinomas and in the monoclonal lymphoid proliferations. Polyclonal cell lines contained multiple forms of the joined termini. The detection of a homogeneous episomal population suggests that EBV-associated epithellal malignancies are clonal expansions of a single EBV-infected progenitor cell."

https://openalex.org/W2068922572,"To understand the role of proteinases in tumor invasion, the effects of inhibitors of metallo-, serine-, and cysteine-proteinases on this process were studied using 125I-iododeoxyuridine-labeled B16/BL6 cells grown on human amnion basement membrane. Cellular invasion was quantitated by measuring the radioactivity associated with the amniotic membrane after the B16/BL6 cells on the basement membrane were removed by lysis followed by scraping. The results obtained with proteinase inhibitors showed that inhibitors of collagenase and plasmin prevented invasion of the amnion. Tissue invasion was also blocked by antiurokinase antibodies. On the contrary, cysteine-proteinase inhibitors and anti-tissue plasminogen activator antiserum were ineffective. Mersalyl, a compound known to activate collagenase, stimulated invasion under conditions where plasmin formation or activity were inhibited. Evidence for the role of a plasminogen activator-plasmin-collagenase activation cascade in B16 invasion is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2028650350,"Ethanol, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 20 to 100 mM, stimulates γ-aminobutyric (GABA) receptor-mediated uptake of 36Cl-labeled chlorine into isolated brain vesicles. One drug that acts at GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513, has been found to be a potent antagonist of ethanol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into brain vesicles, but it fails to antagonize either pentobarbital- or muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. Pretreatment of rats with Ro15-4513 blocks the anticonflict activity of low doses of ethanol (but not pentobarbital) as well as the behavioral intoxication observed with higher doses of ethanol. The effects of Ro15-4513 in antagonizing ethanol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and behavior are completely blocked by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. However, other benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists fail to antagonize the actions of ethanol in vitro or in vivo, suggesting a novel interaction of Ro15-4513 with the GABA receptor-coupled chloride ion channel complex. The identification of a selective benzodiazepine antagonist of ethanol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro that blocks the anxiolytic and intoxicating actions of ethanol suggests that many of the neuropharmacologic actions of ethanol may be mediated via central GABA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2067766620,"Cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported in countries throughout the world. Initial surveillance studies in Central Africa suggest an annual incidence of AIDS of 550 to 1000 cases per million adults. The male to female ratio of cases is 1:1, with age- and sex-specific rates greater in females less than 30 years of age and greater in males over age 40. Clinically, AIDS in Africans is often characterized by a diarrhea-wasting syndrome, opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and cryptosporidiosis, or disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma. From 1 to 18% of healthy blood donors and pregnant women and as many as 27 to 88% of female prostitutes have antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The present annual incidence of infection is approximately 0.75% among the general population of Central and East Africa. The disease is transmitted predominantly by heterosexual activity, parenteral exposure to blood transfusions and unsterilized needles, and perinatally from infected mothers to their newborns, and will continue to spread rapidly where economic and cultural factors favor these modes of transmission. Prevention and control of HIV infection through educational programs and blood bank screening should be an immediate public health priority for all African countries."
https://openalex.org/W2066140926,"The 5' ends of trypanosome mRNAs consist of an identical sequence of 35 nucleotides. This mini-exon sequence is derived from the 5' end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 debranching extract. We conclude that trans splicing is the physiological process by which mature mRNA molecules are synthesized in trypanosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2074850155,"The Fe/S protein of complex III is encoded by a nuclear gene, synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor with a 32 residue amino-terminal extension, and transported to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our data suggest the following transport pathway. First, the precursor is translocated via translocation contact sites into the matrix. There, cleavage to an intermediate containing an eight residue extension occurs. The intermediate is then redirected across the inner membrane, processed to the mature subunit, and assembled into complex III. We suggest that the folding and membrane-translocation pathway in the endosymbiotic ancestor of mitochondria has been conserved during evolution of eukaryotic cells; transfer of the gene for Fe/S protein to the nucleus has led to addition of the presequence, which routes the precursor back to its “ancestral” assembly pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2078354583,"To simulate a reaction that occurs in T4-infected cells, we have developed an in vitro DNA synthesis system that requires seven highly purified proteins encoded by this bacteriophage: the DNA polymerase ""holoenzyme"" (four proteins), gene 32 protein, dda DNA helicase, and uvsX protein - an enzyme that catalyzes homologous DNA pairing and is functionally homologous to the recA protein. In the reaction observed, the 3'OH end of one single-stranded DNA molecule primes DNA synthesis using a double-stranded DNA molecule of homologous sequence as the template. The uvsX protein continuously removes the new DNA chain from its template, so that DNA is synthesized by a conservative mechanism. This type of reaction, which requires the cooperation of recombination and replication enzymes, seems likely to be a general feature of DNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1549239847,"Fluorescence changes using actin covalently labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide have been used to determine the effect of cytochalasin D on actin polymerization. A mechanism for the effect of cytochalasin D on actin polymerization is presented, which explains the experimental observation of a cytochalasin D-induced increase in the initial rate of polymerization and a decrease in the final extent of the reaction. Central to this mechanism is the Mg2+-dependent formation of cytochalasin D-induced dimers. The dimers serve as nuclei to enhance the polymerization rate. Binding of Mg2+ to a low affinity site on the dimer induces a conformational change which can be observed as a rapid fluorescence increase. A subsequent time-dependent fluorescence decrease observed prior to polymerization appears to represent ATP hydrolysis resulting in dissociation of the dimer and release of actin monomers containing ADP. We postulate that a slow rate of exchange of ATP for bound ADP relative to hydrolysis results in the accumulation of monomers containing ADP. As these monomers have a high critical concentration, the final extent of polymerization is reduced dramatically. The Mg2+ dependence of the final extent of polymerization in the presence of cytochalasin D is also explained in the context of this mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1584486859,"The single-chain form of human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is the major form of the enzyme found in cells, tissues, and extracellular fluids. The protein, called pro-uPA, has high (Kd = 0.5 nM) affinity for the specific uPA receptor of U937 human monocyte-like cells. Its conversion to two-chain uPA by plasmin does not appreciably change the binding parameters. In addition, conversion of pro-uPA to uPA occurs with receptor-bound pro-uPA and does not lead to dissociation from the membrane. These data show that secreted pro-uPA can find its way to the specific surface receptor without previous conversion to the two-chain form and that, once bound, can be activated by plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1550925534,"The time course of the extracellular reaction sequence ATP----ADP----AMP----adenosine has been examined during recirculation of substrate solutions over cultured pig aortic endothelial cells attached to polystyrene beads. This permits the study of reactions at volume to cell surface ratios approaching those of small blood vessels. When endothelial cells were presented with an initial bolus of ATP, high concentrations of the intermediates ADP and AMP developed before significant conversion of AMP to adenosine occurred. Further, the higher the initial ATP concentration, the slower the conversion of AMP to adenosine. Kinetic constants for each reaction were estimated by fitting simulated reaction curves to observed time courses. Apparent Km values estimated in this way agreed well with those reported for initial velocity measurements (ATPase = 300 microM; ADPase = 240 microM; and 5'-nucleotidase = 26 microM). The ratio of maximum velocities was ATPase:ADPase:AMPase = 6:1.5:1, with absolute values varying among cell batches. The data could only be fitted if the model incorporated inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase by ATP or ADP, and satisfactory fitting was achieved with a Ki value for ADP of 5 microM. These kinetic properties maximize the time separation of the intermediate pools. In vivo, at sites of platelet degranulation, they would create a time gap proportional to the size of the initial release between release of ADP (a proaggregatory milieu) and the appearance of adenosine (an anti-aggregatory milieu)."
https://openalex.org/W2012030561,"Studies were conducted to investigate the molecular basis for bidirectional pigment granule transport in digitonin-lysed melanophores. Pigment granule dispersion, but not aggregation, required cAMP and resulted in the phosphorylation of a 57 kd polypeptide. cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor prevented this phosphorylation as well as pigment dispersal. In contrast, both pigment aggregation and the concomitant dephosphorylation of the 57 kd polypeptide were blocked by phosphatase inhibitors. These data support a model in which pigment dispersion and aggregation require protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. Furthermore, studies using the ATP analog, ATP gamma S, suggest either that protein phosphorylation alone is sufficient for dispersion or that transport is mediated by a unique force-generating ATPase that can use ATP gamma S for hydrolyzable energy."

https://openalex.org/W1509085423,"Both high and low affinity receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF) have been described, but only the former appear to mediate NGF actions and uptake. To specifically characterize the molecular identity of the high affinity site and to compare it with the low affinity site, the water-soluble carbodiimide EDC was used to cross-link 125I-NGF to NGF receptors on: rat PC12 cells, PC12nnr5 cells (PC12 mutants that have only low affinity NGF binding), SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (which have only high affinity binding sites), and cultured rat sympathetic ganglion cells. A variety of criteria were used to distinguish the two classes of affinity-labeled receptors: competition with unlabeled NGF, dissociation rate, and selective solubilization by 0.1% Triton X-100. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that cross-linking generated only a single Mr approximately 103,000 125I-NGF affinity-labeled species which represents both the low and high affinity forms of the receptor. The 125I-NGF X receptor complexes formed with both affinity classes of the receptor were quantitatively immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal anti-NGF-receptor antibody 192-IgG and both showed identical shifts in mobility when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. These findings indicate that both high and low affinity NGF receptors possess apparently identical NGF-binding moieties. The differences between the kinetic and functional properties of the two receptor types may therefore result from their interactions with other membrane components or with cytoplasmic proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1978088045,"We show that in yeast the cell type specificity of pheromone response is determined solely by the species of receptor that a cell synthesizes. The two receptor-pheromone interactions are functionally interchangeable and involve the creation of a common intracellular signal. In particular, we find that provision of a-factor receptor or α-factor receptor in matα1 mutants, which normally do not express either receptor or any other a- or α-specific products, allows response to the appropriate pheromone. Moreover, provision of a-factor receptor in a cells lacking α-factor receptor restores mating competence to those cells. Finally, an aspect of pheromone response that is normally unique to a-factor action on α cells — increased transcription from the α-specific STE3 gene — can also be observed following α-factor treatment of pseudo-a cells (matα2 ste3 ste13), special mutants that respond to α-factor and also have an active STE3 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2041627992,"The Mauriceville (3.6 kb) and Varkud (3.8 kb) mitochondrial plasmids of Neurospora are closely related, closed circular DNAs whose nucleotide sequences and genetic organization suggest relationships to mitochondrial introns and retrotransposons. Here we isolated mutants whose growth is impaired as a result of malevolent behavior of these plasmids. All 12 mutants contain variant plasmids that are suppressive relative to mtDNA, and ten also contain defective mtDNAs. All the suppressive plasmids contain small insertions, generally including a mitochondrial tRNA sequence, at or near the major 5' RNA start site. The structure of the suppressive plasmids suggests that they were generated via an RNA intermediate and a reverse transcription step. At least three of the mutants contain defective mtDNAs into which mitochondrial plasmid sequences have integrated. Sequences at the plasmid-mtDNA junctions are also consistent with integration via an RNA intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2093309267,"While it is widely appreciated that infection with a virulent virus can produce disease in an animal, the ability of a mixture of avirulent viruses to produce disease by means of complementation or recombination in vivo has not been established. In this study, two weakly neuroinvasive herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strains were simultaneously inoculated onto the footpads of mice. Many (62%) of the animals that received a 1:1 mixture of the viruses died, whereas the animals that received a similar or 100-fold higher dose of each agent alone survived. Of fourteen viruses isolated from the brains of ten mice that died after receiving the mixture of the two weakly neuroinvasive viruses, eleven were recombinants; three of these recombinants were lethal when reapplied to the footpads of mice. These results show that two avirulent HSV-1 variants may interact in vivo to produce virulent recombinants and a lethal infection. They also suggest that different genetic lesions account for the weakly neuroinvasive character of the HSV-1 strains ANG and KOS after footpad inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W1983786102,"The mitochondrial gene (COXI) encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was isolated from two cytoplasmic genotypes of sorghum that synthesize different COI polypeptides. The Milo COI (Mr approximately 38,000) is encoded by a 530 codon structural gene sharing 98% homology with the corresponding maize gene. A variant COI observed in 9E cytoplasm (Mr approximately 42,000) is encoded by a 631 codon structural gene that diverges completely from the Milo COXI gene both 100 bp 5' to the presumed initiator methionine and within the 3' coding sequence. The 3' divergence results in a 101 C-terminal extension of the 9E COI that is not homologous to any known mitochondrial polypeptide. The novel 9E COXI, apparently arising from at least two rearrangements, affects transcription and gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1502207890,"Predominant hepatobiliary elimination from blood and subsequent enterohepatic circulation of cysteinyl leukotrienes is demonstrated in the monkey Macaca fascicularis. From intravenous [3H]leukotriene C4, about 40% were recovered as metabolites in bile and about 20% in urine within 5 h. [3H]Leukotriene E4 was a predominant metabolite of defined structure in blood plasma, bile, and urine. From intraduodenal [3H]leukotriene C4, about 5% were recovered as metabolites in bile and about 8% in urine within 8 h. Endogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes generated in vivo were measured after implantation of a subcutaneously looped biliary bypass. Tapping of the loop allowed access to bile and prevented interference by leukotrienes produced by surgical trauma (Denzlinger, C., Rapp, S., Hagmann, W., and Keppler, D. (1985) Science 230, 330-332). Endogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes were analyzed in bile, urine, and blood plasma by the sequential use of high-performance liquid chromatography and a radioimmunoassay that was optimized for leukotriene E4 as a predominant metabolite detected in the tracer studies. Biliary leukotriene E4 rose from less than 0.2 to 9 nmol/liter, when leukotriene synthesis was elicited in anesthesized monkeys by staphylococcal enterotoxin B administered intragastrically. This study provides an approach to the analysis of cysteinyl leukotrienes in primates and serves to define the role of these mediators under pathophysiological as well as physiological conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1493966034,"Although plastocyanin is not detected in Cu(II)-deficient cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, accumulation of messenger RNA for pre-apoplastocyanin is independent of the concentration of Cu(II) in the medium (Merchant, S., and Bogorad, L. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 462-469). This work shows that the synthesis, transport, and processing of pre-apoplastocyanin also appear to be unaffected in cells grown in Cu(II)-deficient medium. However, the mature protein, presumably formed after import of the precursor into the chloroplast, is rapidly degraded in Cu(II)-deficient cells. The half-life of the mature protein is estimated to be between 16 and 18 min in cells grown in Cu(II)-deficient medium. In cells grown in medium containing Cu(II), the mature protein is stable. The proteolytic activity thus appears to be specific for apoplastocyanin versus plastocyanin and thereby accounts for the absence of accumulated plastocyanin in Cu(II)-deficient cells. This process may be part of a general mechanism designed to remove chloroplast proteins which cannot be utilized."

https://openalex.org/W1664658747,"A variety of intestinal cell organelles and proteins have been proposed to mediate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3)-stimulated calcium absorption. In the present study biochemical analyses were undertaken to determine the subcellular localization of 45Ca after calcium transport in vivo in ligated duodenal loops of vitamin D-deficient chicks injected with 1.3 nmol of 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle 15 h prior to experimentation. Separation of Golgi, mitochondria, basal lateral membrane, and lysosome fractions in the epithelial homogenates was achieved by differential sedimentation followed by centrifugation in Percoll gradients and evaluation of appropriate marker enzyme activities. Both vitamin D-deficient and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated chicks had the highest levels of 45Ca-specific activity in lysosomal fractions. The lysosomes were also the only organelles to exhibit a 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated difference in calcium content, increasing to 138% of controls. Lysosomes prepared from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated chicks also contained the greatest levels of immunoreactive calbindin-D28k (calcium-binding protein). Chloroquine, a drug known to interfere with lysosomal function, was tested and found to inhibit 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated intestinal calcium absorption. Neither 1,25-(OH)2D3 nor chloroquine affected [3H]2O transport. In additional experiments, microsomal membranes (105,000 X g pellets) were subjected to gradient centrifugation. The highest levels of 45Ca-specific activity and calcium-binding protein in material from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated chicks were found in fractions denser than endoplasmic reticulum and may represent endocytic vesicles. In studies on intestinal mucosa of 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated birds fractionated after 30 min of exposure to lumenal Ca2+ or Ca2+ plus chloroquine, 45Ca was found to accumulate in lysosomes and putative endocytic vesicles, relative to controls. A mechanism involving vesicular flow is proposed for 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated intestinal calcium transport. Endocytic internalization of Ca2+, fusion of the vesicles with lysosomes, and exocytosis at the basal lateral membrane complete the transport process."

Analysis of the progeny of the interspecies mouse backcross (DBA/2 × SPE) × DBA/2 showed that the α-subunit gene cosegregates with the α-cardiac actin gene on chromosome 17, that the β-subunit gene is located on chromosome 11, and that the γ- and δ-subunit genes cosegregate and are located on chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W1492493764,"Competition binding studies have been carried out to evaluate the antagonism of TLCK-thrombin (N alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated thrombin) and PPACK-thrombin (D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone-treated thrombin) with alpha-thrombin using computer-assisted analysis of the binding isotherms (LIGAND). alpha-Thrombin bound to high, moderate, and low affinity sites as previously described (Harmon, J. T., and Jamieson, G. A. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 58-64). PPACK-thrombin bound to all three sites accessible to alpha-thrombin (K1, 7 nM; R1, 20 sites/platelet; K2, 3 nM; R2, 1800 sites/platelet; K3, 510 nM; R3, 84,000 sites/platelet) as well as to a separate fourth site (Kx, 0.4 nM; Rx, 20 sites/platelet) for PPACK-thrombin that was not accessible to alpha-thrombin. In contrast, TLCK-thrombin did not bind to the high affinity site for alpha-thrombin but bound to the moderate and low affinity sites for alpha-thrombin with similar affinity (K2, 2 nM; R2, 890 sites/platelet; K3, 900 nM; R3, 100,000 sites/platelet) and to another site (Ky, 0.03 nM; Ry, 10 sites/platelet) which was not accessible to alpha-thrombin. As predicted from these binding studies, TLCK-thrombin did not compete with alpha-thrombin for platelet activation at concentrations as high as 1000 nM (500-fold excess). In contrast a 300-fold excess of PPACK-thrombin (670 nM) totally inhibited platelet activation by 2 nM thrombin. These results demonstrate that the high affinity binding site for thrombin on human platelets is a classical receptor, occupancy of which is necessary for platelet activation by low concentrations of thrombin; that TLCK-thrombin does not occupy this high affinity site and hence cannot inhibit platelet activation by alpha-thrombin; and that PPACK-thrombin does compete with alpha-thrombin at the high affinity site and is an antagonist of alpha-thrombin induced activation."
https://openalex.org/W2007296790,"Patients with Werner's syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, undergo an accelerated aging process that leads to premature death. Fibroblasts from such patients typically grow poorly in culture. Here it is shown that fibroblasts from a patient with Werner's syndrome have a markedly attenuated mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In contrast, they have a full mitogenic response to fetal bovine serum. Both PDGF binding and receptor numbers per cell are unaltered. The Werner's syndrome cells express high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro. Although PDGF enhances collagenase expression through increased levels of hybridizable collagenase messenger RNA in normal skin fibroblasts, no induction of collagenase occurs in the Werner's syndrome fibroblasts. Moreover, the failure to respond to this agonist effect of PDGF is not restored by fetal bovine serum. The data suggest that failure of one or more PDGF-mediated pathways in Werner's syndrome cells may contribute to the phenotypic expression of the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W50116936,"In a previous study, we demonstrated that the ability of a cDNA fragment to hybrid-arrest the translation of its complementary mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate depends on the position of the mRNA/cDNA duplex within the mRNA molecule. In the present report, we further characterize the mechanisms involved in the destabilization and subsequent translation of mRNA/cDNA hybrids by mapping in detail the positional dependence of hybrid-arrested translation of the human alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs and by directly assessing the stability of mRNA/cDNA duplexes in reticulocyte lysate under a variety of translational conditions. The mapping studies in this report demonstrate that the translation of a hybridized mRNA requires exposure of the 5' nontranslated region and the AUG initiation codon, as well as those bases 3' to the AUG which are typically protected by an initiating 80 S ribosome. The translation of these mRNA/cDNA hybrids is associated with the complete removal of cDNA from the mRNA coding region; this disruption of the mRNA/cDNA duplex is blocked by inhibitors of translational initiation and elongation. cDNAs which extend into the 3' nontranslated region remain associated with the mRNA during normal translation but are completely removed from the mRNA during translation if translational termination is suppressed. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the disruption of mRNA/cDNA duplexes in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is tightly linked to the assembly and migration of 80 S ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2018271177,"Transient stimulation of target tissues by sex steroids can cause long-lasting changes that may facilitate or alter responses to subsequent hormonal treatment. How these altered characteristics are propagated during cell division in the absence of the stimulating hormone is unknown. The human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 was used as a model to examine the effects of estrogen on the synthesis of serum apolipoproteins in vitro. Treatment with low concentrations of estrogen for 24 to 48 hours resulted in long-lasting alterations in the kinetics with which the cells responded to subsequent stimulation with estrogen. Manifestation of this memory effect was correlated quantitatively with the induction and propagation of a moderate-affinity, nuclear, estrogen-binding protein with the characteristics of a type II estrogen receptor. The data indicate that transient exposure of these cells to estrogen can induce changes in their response characteristics and composition of nuclear proteins that are inherited by daughter cells grown in the absence of hormone for more than ten generations."
https://openalex.org/W1558340799,"Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed H2O2 metabolism proceeds through one of three different pathways, depending on the nature and the concentration of the second substrate as an e- donor and/or on pH conditions. In the lactoperoxidase (LPO)-H2O2 system, at low H2O2 concentrations and/or alkaline conditions the peroxidatic cycle involves ferric LPO----compound I----compound II----ferric LPO conversion, whereas high H2O2 concentrations and/or acidic conditions favor the ferric LPO----compound I----compound II----compound III----ferrous LPO----ferric LPO pathway. The compound III/ferroperoxidase states are associated with irreversible enzyme inactivation by cleavage of the heme moiety and liberation of iron. It is likely that either singlet oxygen or superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are involved in the attack on heme iron, because inactivation correlates with oxygen production and can be decreased to a certain degree by scavengers such as ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, or mannitol. In the LPO-H2O2-I- system, the enzyme may also be inactivated by I2 generated in the course of enzymatic I- oxidation (i.e. during ferric LPO----compound I----ferric LPO cycles)."
https://openalex.org/W1507019296,"Active transport of dipeptides in rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles is energized by an inward-directed H+ gradient rather than a Na+ gradient. We examined the effects of treatment of membrane vesicles with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP), a reagent specific for histidyl groups, on this H+ gradient-dependent dipeptide uptake. DEP inhibited the uptake of all three dipeptides studied, Gly-sarcosine, Gly-Gly, and Gly-Pro (Ki = 0.6-0.9 mM), and the inhibition was noncompetitive. The dipeptide transporter could be protected from DEP inhibition by the presence of dipeptide substrates during the treatment of the vesicles with the inhibitor, whereas leucine plus Na+ failed to offer the protection. Na+-dependent leucine uptake was also inhibited by DEP (Ki = 2.5 mM) and the amino acid transporter could be protected from the inhibition by leucine plus Na+, but not by dipeptides. Treatment of membrane vesicles with the thiol group-specific reagents, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole,3-bromopyruvate, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide, also inhibited the H+ gradient-dependent dipeptide uptake. The potency of their inhibition was in the order: 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol greater than p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid greater than 3-bromopyruvate greater than N-ethylmaleimide. The inhibition could be reversed in some cases by treatment of the membrane vesicles with reducing agents such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanol following incubation with the inhibitors. Dipeptide substrates could protect the dipeptide transporter from the inhibition. We conclude that histidyl and thiol groups are present at or near the substrate-binding site of the rabbit renal dipeptide transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1559783141,"Synergism of glucose and fructose in net glycogen synthesis was studied in perfused livers from 24-h fasted rats. With either glucose or fructose alone, net glycogen deposition did not occur (p greater than 0.10 for each), whereas the addition of both together resulted in significant glycogen accumulation (net glycogen accumulation was 0.21 +/- 0.03 mumol of glucose/g of liver/min at 2 mM fructose and 30 mM glucose, p less than 0.001). To better understand this synergism, intermediary substrate levels were compared at steady state with various glucose levels in the absence and in the presence of 2 mM fructose. Independent of fructose, hepatic glucose and glucose 6-phosphate increased proportionally when glucose level in the medium was raised (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). Unlike glucose 6-phosphate, UDP-glucose did not consistently increase with glucose (p greater than 0.10); in fact, there was a small decrease at a very high glucose level (30 mM), a result consistent with the well-established activation of glycogen synthase by glucose. With elevated glucose, the level of glucose 6-phosphate was strongly correlated with glycogen content (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01, slope = 32). Adding fructose increased the efficiency of glucose 6-phosphate to glycogen conversion: the effect of a given increment in glucose 6-phosphate upon glycogen accumulation was increased 2.6-fold (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01, slope = 86). A kinetic modeling approach was used to investigate the mechanisms by which fructose synergized glycogen accumulation when glucose was elevated. Based on steady-state hepatic substrate levels, net hepatic glucose output, and net glycogen synthesis rate, the model estimated the rate constants of major enzymes and individual fluxes in the glycogen metabolic pathway. Modeling analysis is consistent with the following scenario: glycogen synthase is activated by glucose, whereas glucose-6-phosphatase was inhibited. In addition, the model supports the hypothesis that fructose synergizes net glycogen accumulation due to suppression of phosphorylase. Overall, our analysis suggests that glucose enhances the metabolic flux to glycogen by inducing a build up of glucose 6-phosphate via combined effects of mass action and glucose-6-phosphatase inhibition and activating glycogen synthase and that fructose enhances glycogen accumulation by retaining glycogen via phosphorylase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2159837327,"The gene coding for CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase), kds B, was previously cloned on a 9-kilobase Pst insert of Escherichia coli DNA into pBR 322 (Goldman, R. C., and Kohlbrenner, W. E. (1985) J. Bacteriol. 163, 256-261). Using a transposon mutagenesis approach we have now located kds B on this insert, which facilitated the isolation and sequencing of a 1.3-kilobase segment of DNA containing kds B and putative RNA polymerase and ribosome binding sites. The primary structure of CMP-KDO synthetase predicted by this nucleotide sequence was verified by amino acid composition and sequence analysis of purified CMP-KDO synthetase and cleavage fragments. Our results show that kds B consists of a 744-base open reading frame coding for a 248-amino acid peptide. The molecular weight of CMP-KDO synthetase calculated from the translated sequence is 27,486, taking into account the loss of the N-terminal methionine. These data define the transcriptional unit of kds B and its translation product in molecular terms, information prerequisite to our understanding of both the mechanism of CMP-KDO formation and the regulation of the KDO metabolic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2134578455,"Vaccinia virus recombinants were generated which express the intact gp70/p15E of Friend mink cell focus inducing virus (F-MCFV) or truncated forms of the glycoprotein that lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The transport of the intact and truncated envelope glycoproteins to apical or basolateral surfaces was studied in the polarized epithelial MDCK cell line. Infection of MDCK cells with the recombinant expressing the intact F-MCFV envelope glycoprotein resulted in transport exclusively to the basolateral surfaces, whereas the recombinant expressing the truncated glycoprotein was found to be secreted from both the apical and basolateral surfaces. Thus removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the p15E protein results in a loss of directional transport to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W98083671,"The Na,K-ATPase of red cells from high K+ and low K+ dogs was studied immunologically by using antibodies raised against dog kidney enzyme. Anti-alpha subunit IgGs, which also recognized alpha (+) from brain enzyme, identified the larger subunit of erythrocyte Na,K-ATPase as a homogeneous polypeptide with Mr = 96,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. In addition, erythrocyte Na,K-ATPase, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on a monoclonal antibody-coupled column, showed the identity of its polypeptide composition to that of the renal enzyme. Furthermore, it was shown that reticulocyte lysates from high K+ and low K+ dogs substantially degraded 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent-labeled Na,K-ATPase. This degradation of the enzyme protein was significantly enhanced by the addition of ATP and Mg2+. These results indicate that dog reticulocytes possess some mechanism for protein breakdown involving an ATP-dependent proteolytic system, resulting in the dramatic breakdown of Na,K-ATPase activity during dog reticulocyte maturation into erythrocytes (Maede, Y., and Inaba, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3337-3343)."
https://openalex.org/W1608441371,"We have proposed, using styrene as a model, a new mechanism for the formation of glutathione conjugates that is independent of epoxide formation but dependent on the oxidation of glutathione to a thiyl radical by peroxidases such as prostaglandin H synthase or horseradish peroxidase. The thiyl radical reacts with styrene to yield a carbon-centered radical which subsequently reacts with molecular oxygen to give the styrene-glutathione conjugate. We have used electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques to detect the proposed free radical intermediates. A styrene carbon-centered radical was trapped using the spin traps 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and t-nitrosobutane. The position of the carbon-centered radical was confirmed to be at carbon 7 by the use of specific 2H-labeled styrenes. The addition of the spin trap DMPO inhibited both the utilization of molecular oxygen and the formation of styrene-glutathione conjugates. Under anaerobic conditions additional styrene-glutathione conjugates were formed, one of which was identified by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry as S-(2-phenyl)ethylglutathione. The glutathione thiyl radical intermediate was observed by spin trapping with DMPO. These results support the proposed free radical-mediated formation of styrene-glutathione conjugates by peroxidase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1608357281,"Calcineurin, a calmodulin-regulated phosphatase, is composed of two distinct subunits (A and B) and requires certain metal ions for activity. The binding of the two most potent activators, Ni2+ and Mn2+, to calcineurin and its subunits has been studied. Incubation of the protein with 63Ni2+ (or 54Mn2+) followed by gel filtration to separate free and protein-bound ions indicated that calcineurin could maximally bind 2 mol/mol of Ni2+ or Mn2+. While isolated A subunit also bound 2 mol/mol of Ni2+, no Mn2+ binding was demonstrated for either isolated A or B subunit. When bindings were monitored by nitrocellulose filter assay, only 1 mol/mol bound Ni2+ or Mn2+ was detected, suggesting that the two Ni2+ (or Mn2+) binding sites had different relative affinities and that only metal ions bound at the higher affinity sites were detected by the filter assay. Preincubation of calcineurin with Mn2+ (or Ni2+) decreased the filter assay-measured Ni2+ (or Mn2+) binding by only 30%. Preincubation of the protein with Zn2+ decreased the filter assay-measured Ni2+ or Mn2+ binding by 90 or 17%, respectively. The results suggest that the higher affinity sites are a Ni2+-specific site and a distinct Mn2+-specific site. Preincubation of calcineurin with Mn2+ (or Ni2+) decreased the gel filtration-determined Ni2+ (or Mn2+) binding from 2 to 1 mol/mol suggesting that calcineurin also contains a site which binds either metal ion. The time course of Ni2+ (or Mn2+) binding was correlated with that of the enzyme activation, and the extent of deactivation of the Ni2+-activated calcineurin by EDTA or by incubation with Ca2+ and calmodulin (Pallen, C. J., and Wang, J. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6134-6141) was correlated with the release of the bound ions, thus suggesting that the bound ion is directly responsible for enzyme activation."
https://openalex.org/W2077372078,"The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of Trypanosoma equiperdum is organized as a complex structure of catenated circular DNA molecules. The major component of the kDNA network is the one kilobase minicircle that is present at about 10,000 copies per network. We have developed two assays to examine the structure of kDNA networks compacted in vitro with spermidine. Our results suggest that minicircles are arranged into a regular structure with an exposed domain which is DNAase I- and restriction-sensitive and a protected domain which is resistant to restriction endonucleases and DNAase I. This regularly packaged structure is dependent upon spermidine compaction and the circularity of the kDNA, but does not require supercoiled minicircles or catenated networks."
https://openalex.org/W1503292785,"Membrane-associated phosphatidylserine synthase was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bae-Lee, M., and Carman, G. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10857-10862) and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/ phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine. Reconstitution was performed by removing detergent from an octyl glucoside/phospholipid/Triton X-100/enzyme mixed micelle by Sephadex G-50 super-fine chromatography. The average diameter of the vesicles was 90 nm, and the enzyme was reconstituted asymmetrically with the active site facing outward. The enzymological properties of reconstituted phosphatidylserine synthase were determined in the absence of detergent. The enzyme was reconstituted into vesicles with phospholipid compositions approximating those of wild type and mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. Reconstituted activity was modulated by the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine ratio in the vesicles. The modulation of activity observed in the vesicles is enough to account for some of the fluctuations in the phosphatidylserine content in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1575182002,"Comparative inhibition kinetics with natural dNTP end products (dNp3) and new synthetic bisubstrate-type analogs, dNp4A (deoxynucleoside 5'-adenosine 5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate), have been studied with their target deoxynucleoside kinases from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Analysis of inhibition specificity, inhibition patterns, and Ki(app) under various conditions has revealed the following conclusions. Both dNTP and dNp4A bind to the active site of the corresponding kinase through multiple binding determinants. The deoxynucleoside moiety of dNTP fits optimally at the deoxynucleoside binding site and provides the basis for its inhibition specificity, whereas the triphosphate group interacts with the ATP binding site, reinforcing the affinity of the molecule as a potent end product inhibitor (Ki = 0.4-3 microM). The adenosine moiety of dNp4A does not contribute to the binding of this compound, whereas the tetraphosphate portion is the second binding determinant, just as in the model developed for dNTP. dNTP and dNp4A proved to be useful tools for distinguishing the kinetic mechanisms of kinases which follow sequential pathways, i.e. the rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi for dCyd and dGuo kinases and the steady state Ordered Bi Bi mechanism for two dAdo kinases associated either with dCyd kinase or with dGuo kinase on different multifunctional proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1893467390,"Abstract Rat liver multivesicular bodies (MVB), as well as other hepatic subcellular organelles, are acidified by an electrogenic ATP-dependent proton pump that requires Cl- for maximal acidification (Van Dyke, R. W., Hornick, C. A., Belcher, J., Scharschmidt, B. F., and Havel, R.J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11021-11026), suggesting that Cl- serves as a permeable charge-compensating anion. However, we have observed that NO3- is unable to substitute for Cl-. This study was undertaken therefore to examine more closely the effects of Cl- on MVB acidification and to determine whether NO3- and other anions interact with the proton pump. ATP-dependent vesicle acidification and membrane potential (psi) were measured using the fluorescent dyes acridine orange and Oxonol V (bis(3-phenyl-5-oxoisoxasol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol), respectively. Cl- both stimulated acidification (Km = 23.2 +/- 4.2 mM) and decreased psi (IC50 = 3.4 +/- 0.6 mM) in a concentration-dependent, nonlinear fashion. In the presence of saturating Cl- (100 mM), however, NO3- (shown to be more permeable than Cl-) and the impermeant anions SO4(2-) and PO4(2-), inhibited both ATP-dependent acidification and psi in a concentration-dependent manner. Other anions, including gluconate and HCO3-, had no effect. The inhibitory effect of NO3- was reversible. Neither SO4(2-) nor PO4(2-) appeared to block Cl- movement across the vesicle membrane as assessed by the ability of Cl- to decrease an established psi. In additional experiments, the effects of anions on relaxation of a previously established pH gradient were measured. Compared to Cl- or gluconate, NO3- had no significant effect on pH gradient relaxation, even when MVB were preloaded with NO3-, indicating that rapid cycling of NO3-/HNO3 across the MVB membrane does not occur. The organic nitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, also inhibited both acidification and psi and, similar to NO3-, had no effect on pH gradient relaxation. By contrast, NO2- potently inhibited both MVB acidification and psi but also rapidly relaxed a pre-established pH gradient, suggesting that NO2- increases MVB membrane proton permeability. Finally, MVB exhibited N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity that was inhibited 23.9% by NO3- (100 mM). In conclusion, although MVB are permeable to a variety of anions (Cl-, Br-, NO3-, NO2-), only Cl- and Br- support maximal rates of acidification by the proton pump.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W343828290,"The receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) was purified from Triton X-100 extracts of sympathetic ganglia membranes by affinity chromatography on NGF-Sepharose. Elution of purified receptor was accomplished at pH 5 in the presence of 1 M NaCl. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the purified iodinated receptor showed three major bands at Mr = 126,000, Mr = 105,000, and Mr = 81,000. Affinity labeling of the purified receptor using 125I-NGF and the photoreactive agent N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-p-azidobenzoate resulted in two major cross-linked complexes corresponding to Mr = 135,000 and Mr = 110,000. This labeling pattern is similar to that observed with sympathetic ganglia membranes (Massague, J., Guillette, B. J., Czech, M. P., Morgan, C. J., and Bradshaw, R. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9419-9424) and indicates that these two forms do not arise from the cross-linking procedure. Reaction of the photoaffinity labeled NGF receptors with increasing amounts of trypsin resulted in a progressive decrease in the high molecular weight complex with a concomitant increase in the low molecular weight form. When the larger complex was isolated by electroelution from a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel and treated with trypsin, a species corresponding to Mr = 100,000 was generated. These observations are best explained by a precursor-product relationship for the two NGF receptor species of sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1557071567,"Subunit III was removed from beef heart cytochrome oxidase by incubation of the isolated enzyme at 25 degrees C for 24 h in lauryl maltoside buffer at a detergent to protein ratio of 10:1 (w:w). During the course of the incubation, the reaction of the enzyme with cyanide was followed by spectrophotometry in the Soret region. The starting material binds cyanide in a multiexponential process with 70% of the reaction occurring during the slow phase of the reaction at an observed rate of 3.85 X 10(-5) S-1 with 1 mM KCN. More of the enzyme binds cyanide during the fast phase of the reaction at an observed rate of 3.8 X 10(-3) S-1 as subunit III is removed by lauryl maltoside. After 24 h of incubation in lauryl maltoside, the enzyme reacts with cyanide completely in a rapid, single exponential process. When the protein from such an incubation is recovered by cytochrome c affinity chromatography and analyzed for its subunit content, subunit III is absent. The position of the Soret maximum of the oxidized enzyme shifts from its maximum at 418 nm in the starting material to 422 nm in the subunit III-depleted enzyme. The subunit III-depleted enzyme binds cyanide completely in a simple bimolecular reaction with a rate constant of 3.8 M-1 S-1. We discuss this result in terms of the possible structural and functional roles for subunit III in the cytochrome oxidase complex."

https://openalex.org/W1500083738,"As a first step towards understanding how the zymogen structure of prochymosin contributes to the process by which active enzyme is produced, we altered the nucleotide sequence which encodes the amino-terminal (or propeptide) region of the protein. Of the two sites for autoproteolysis of prochymosin, one where pseudochymosin is formed at a pH of 2 and the other where chymosin is formed at pH 4-5, we changed the former by removing one codon and changing two other codons. This genetically modified prochymosin was proteolytically processed and activated normally at pH 4.5. However, at pH 2.0 we observed only partial activation of the zymogen and found no evidence of proteolytic processing. The properties of this engineered prochymosin suggest that zymogen activation does not require proteolysis and that the two different zymogen processing sites can function independently from one another."
https://openalex.org/W1581161978,"Inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis by an intracellular inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in glucagon-stimulated hepatocytes was potentiated by insulin. When hepatocytes isolated from fed rats were treated with 0.3 nM glucagon, which activates glycogen breakdown half-maximally, the Rp diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate [Rp-cAMPS), a cAMP antagonist, inhibited glucose production half-maximally at 3 microM. A 10-fold lower concentration of antagonist was required to half-maximally inhibit glucose production in the presence of 10 nM insulin, which alone produced only 15% inhibition. Under the same experimental conditions, the maximal effect of (Rp)-cAMPS was also potentiated. In addition, the increase in the concentration of glucagon required for half-maximal activation of phosphorylase activity and inactivation of glycogen synthase activity in the presence of minimally effective concentrations of insulin and (Rp)-cAMPS were clearly synergistic. It is postulated that the synergism observed is a consequence of action at several enzymatic sites leading to, and including, alteration of the phosphorylation state of the two rate-limiting enzymes in glycogen metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1479759835,"Fab fragments from a monoclonal antibody, OR-689.2.4, directed against the opioid receptor, selectively inhibited opioid binding to rat and guinea pig neural membranes. In a titratable manner, the Fab fragments noncompetitively inhibited the binding of the mu selective peptide [D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,Gly(OH)5][3H] enkephalin and the delta selective peptide [D-Pen2,D-Pen5] [3H]enkephalin (where Pen represents penicillamine) to neural membranes. In contrast, kappa opioid binding, as measured by the binding of [3H]bremazocine to rat neural membranes and guinea pig cerebellum in the presence of mu and delta blockers, was not significantly altered by the Fab fragments. In addition to blocking the binding of mu and delta ligands, the Fab fragments displaced bound opioids from the membranes. When mu sites were blocked with [D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,Gly(OH)5]enkephalin, the Fab fragments suppressed the binding of [D-Pen2,D-Pen5][3H]enkephalin to the same degree as when the mu binding site was not blocked. The Fab fragments also inhibited binding to the mu site regardless of whether or not the delta site was blocked with [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin. This monoclonal antibody is directed against a 35,000-dalton protein. Since the antibody is able to inhibit mu and delta binding but not kappa opioid binding, it appears that this 35,000-dalton protein is an integral component of mu and delta opioid receptors but not kappa receptors."
