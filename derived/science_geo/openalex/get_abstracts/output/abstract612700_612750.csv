https://openalex.org/W2807723428,"The escalating problem of multiple chronic conditions among older adults in China draws public health attention due to increasing proportion of the elderly population. This study sought to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with four chronic diseases in older adults in Haikou, the capital city of Hainan Province, China.In this cross-sectional study, 9432 community-dwelling elderly people aged 60 years and older living in rural or urban areas in Haikou were investigated. The interviews collected self-reported information on the presence of four major chronic diseases, as well as socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and self-reported height and weight.Overall, 31.7% (2961/9344) reported at least one of the four chronic diseases. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and stroke was 26.0% (2449/9407), 8.0% (749/9371), 1.0% (95/9360), and 1.9% (175/9382), respectively. Common correlates of the four major chronic diseases were older age, being engaged in intellectual work, currently being a smoker and obesity. Gender, locality of residence, and alcohol consumptions were also found to be associated to some of the chronic conditions.This finding indicates that multiple chronic conditions among elderly people in Haikou are prevalent and warrant special attention to reduce diseases burden and align health care services to cater the holistic elderly patients' need."
https://openalex.org/W2808399879,"Reduced expression of GM1 and other major brain gangliosides GD1a, GD1b and GT1b have been reported in Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain. Mechanisms underlying these changes are unclear but may be due to a deficit in the ganglioside biosynthetic process. The present study examined the extent to which deficits in gene expression of key biosynthetic enzymes involved in synthesis of GM1 and GD1b (B3galt4) and GD1a and GT1b (St3gal2) exist in neuromelanin-containing neurons in the PD substantia nigra (SN). In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to examine gene expression of B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 in neuromelanin-containing neurons in the SN in 8 normal controls (61–92 yrs.) and 7 PD subjects (77–95 yrs). There was a significant decrease in both B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 gene expression in residual neuromelanin-containing cells in the SN of PD patients compared to age-matched neurologically normal controls. These changes appeared to be cell-type specific as abundant B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 gene expression was observed in non-neuromelanin containing neurons located outside of the SN in the PD brain. These data show that residual neuromelanin-containing neurons in the PD SN have decreased expression of the ganglioside biosynthetic genes B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2, consistent with previous reports of decreased levels of gangliosides GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b in the PD SN. These changes may increase the vulnerability of these neurons to degeneration in response to a variety of potential stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2808533107,"DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic modifications in the regulation of gene transcription. The current gold standard to study this modification is bisulfite sequencing. Although multiple commercial bisulfite treatment kits provide good conversion efficiencies, DNA loss and especially DNA fragmentation remain troublesome. This hampers DNA methylation profiling of long DNA sequences. Here, we explored the performance of twelve commercial bisulfite kits by an in-depth comparison of DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis, qPCR and digital PCR, DNA recovery by spectroscopic measurements and digital PCR and conversion efficiency by next generation sequencing. The results show a clear performance difference between the bisulfite kits, and depending on the specific goal of the study, the most appropriate kit might differ. Moreover, we demonstrated that digital PCR is a valuable method to monitor both DNA fragmentation as well as DNA recovery after bisulfite treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2808475095,"The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is a major threat to tomato Solanum lycopersicum and ranks as one of the world's 100 most invasive pests. This is the first study of B. tabaci (Biotype B and Q) global distribution, focusing on risk levels of this invasive pest, in areas projected to be suitable for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation under climate change. This study aims to identify levels of risk of invasive B. tabaci for areas of suitability for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation for the present, 2050 and 2070 using MaxEnt and the Global Climate Model, HadGEM2_ES under RCP45. Our results show that 5% of areas optimal for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation are currently at high risk of B. tabaci. Among the optimal areas for S. lycopersicum, the projections for 2050 compared to the current time showed an extension of 180% in areas under high risk, and a shortening of 67 and 27% in areas under medium and low risk of B. tabaci, respectively, while projections for 2070 showed an extension of 164, and a shortening of 49 and 64% under high, medium and low risk, respectively. The basis of these projections is that predicted temperature increases could affect the pest, which has great adaptability to different climate conditions, but could also impose limitations on the growth of S. lycopersicum. These results may be used in designing strategies to prevent the introduction and establishment of B. tabaci for open-field tomato crops, and assist the implementation of pest management programs."
https://openalex.org/W2808202500,"This study was conducted to investigate effect of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation on Heat shock proteins (HSPs) and dissect the profile of HSP RNA methylation. The results showed that m6A methyltransferases METTL3 mRNA was decreased in responses to heat shock stress in HepG2 cells, but m6A-specific binding protein YTHDF2 mRNA was upregulated in a manner similar to HSP70 induction. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the majority of YTHDF2 was present in the cytosol, however, nearly all YTHDF2 translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus after heat shock. METTL3 knockdown significantly changed HSP70, HSP60, and HSP27 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells using siRNA, however, mRNA lifetime was not impacted. Silence of YTHDF2 using siRNA did not change expression of HSP70, but significantly increased HSP90, HSP60, and HSPB1 mRNA expression. In addition, m6A-seq revealed that HSP m6A methylation peaks are mainly enriched on exons and around stop codons, and shows a unique distribution profile in the 5'UTR and 3'UTR. Knockdown of METTL3 changed the methylation patterns of HSPs transcript. In conclusion, m6A RNA methylation regulates HSP gene expression. Differential expression of HSPs modulated by m6A may depend on the m6A site and abundance of the target gene. This finding provides insights into new regulatory mechanisms of HSPs in normal and stress situations."
https://openalex.org/W2808709281,"Background/ Purpose Despite emerging evidence suggesting harmful influences of accurate weight perception on psychological health among individuals with obesity, little is known about the association in Asian populations. The aim of this study was investigate the association between body weight perception and depressive symptoms among Korean adults, and potential differential associations across gender. Methods We used data from the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2014, comprising 3,318 female (n = 1,876) and male (n = 1,442) participants, aged 19–65 years, with no history of depression and a body-mass index (BMI)> = 18.5kg/m2. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Korean version. Weight perception patterns were categorized by comparing self-perceived and objectively measured weight status. Gender-stratified four-level multilevel linear models adjusted for age, BMI, menopause, education, income, marital status, urbanicity, chronic conditions, exercise, smoking, and alcohol use. Subgroup analyses were performed across BMI category. Results Among women with obesity, those who underperceived their weight status reported fewer depressive symptoms compared to those who accurately perceived their weight status (β = -1.25, p<0.05). Among women with normal weight, those who overperceived their weight status reported more depressive symptoms compared to those who accurately perceived their weight status (β = 1.00, p<0.05). The same associations were not found in men. Conclusion Awareness-oriented strategies for obesity prevention and weight management focused on providing information on weight status may need to consider unintended consequences of accurate weight perception on mental health among individuals with obesity, particularly among women."
https://openalex.org/W2807951080,"Objective There is an association between osteoarthritis-related pain severity and function, yet clear evidence about the sole influence of neuropathic-like symptoms on joint function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is lacking. Previous studies among knee OA patients show an association between neuropathic-like symptoms, lower functional status and lower quality of life, however analyses were unadjusted or had limited adjustment for influential covariates like pain intensity. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the influence of neuropathic-like symptoms—adjusted for multiple influential covariates—on joint-specific function and HRQoL in hip and knee OA patients. Methods In this observational study 255 patients (117 with hip OA and 138 with knee OA) completed the modified painDETECT questionnaire (mPDQ) to identify subjects with neuropathic-like symptoms (mPDQ score>12, possible neuropathic pain [NP] phenotype). The WOMAC and the RAND-36 were used to asses respectively function and HRQoL. Results were adjusted stepwise for age, sex and BMI (Model 1); back disorder, painful body regions, comorbidities and previous surgery (Model 2); and pain intensity and analgesic usage (Model 3). Results A possible NP phenotype was experienced by 37% of hip and 46% of knee OA patients. Final model 3 analysis revealed that hip OA patients with neuropathic-like symptoms scored significantly lower on pain-related aspects of HRQoL (ΔRAND-36 bodily pain: 6.8 points, p = 0.047) compared to patients with the unlikely NP phenotype. In knee OA patients, a possible NP phenotype was associated with diminished joint function (ΔWOMAC domains ranging 7.1 to 10.5 points, p<0.05) and more deficits on the physical functional aspect of HRQoL (ΔRAND-36 physical functioning: 6.8 points, p = 0.016). Conclusion Neuropathic-like symptoms deteriorate the subjective rating of pain-related quality of life in hip OA patients and significantly influence function in knee OA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2808432859,"The use of bibliometric measures in the evaluation of research has increased considerably based on expertise from the growing research field of evaluative citation analysis (ECA). However, mounting criticism of such metrics suggests that the professionalization of bibliometric expertise remains contested. This paper investigates why impact metrics, such as the journal impact factor and the h-index, proliferate even though their legitimacy as a means of professional research assessment is questioned. Our analysis is informed by two relevant sociological theories: Andrew Abbott's theory of professions and Richard Whitley's theory of scientific work. These complementary concepts are connected in order to demonstrate that ECA has failed so far to provide scientific authority for professional research assessment. This argument is based on an empirical investigation of the extent of reputational control in the relevant research area. Using three measures of reputational control that are computed from longitudinal inter-organizational networks in ECA (1972-2016), we show that peripheral and isolated actors contribute the same number of novel bibliometric indicators as central actors. In addition, the share of newcomers to the academic sector has remained high. These findings demonstrate that recent methodological debates in ECA have not been accompanied by the formation of an intellectual field in the sociological sense of a reputational organization. Therefore, we conclude that a growing gap exists between an academic sector with little capacity for collective action and increasing demand for routine performance assessment by research organizations and funding agencies. This gap has been filled by database providers. By selecting and distributing research metrics, these commercial providers have gained a powerful role in defining de-facto standards of research excellence without being challenged by expert authority."
https://openalex.org/W2808368244,"Through stimulation of root growth, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) may facilitate access of crops to sub-soil water, which could potentially prolong physiological activity in dryland environments, particularly because crops are more water use efficient under elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]). This study investigated the effect of drought in shallow soil versus sub-soil on agronomic and physiological responses of wheat to e[CO2] in a glasshouse experiment. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi) was grown in split-columns with the top (0–30 cm) and bottom (31–60 cm; ‘sub-soil’) soil layer hydraulically separated by a wax-coated, root-penetrable layer under ambient [CO2] (a[CO2], ∼400 μmol mol-1) or e[CO2] (∼700 μmol mol-1) [CO2]. Drought was imposed from stem-elongation in either the top or bottom soil layer or both by withholding 33% of the irrigation, resulting in four water treatments (WW, WD, DW, DD; D = drought, W = well-watered, letters denote water treatment in top and bottom soil layer, respectively). Leaf gas exchange was measured weekly from stem-elongation until anthesis. Above-and belowground biomass, grain yield and yield components were evaluated at three developmental stages (stem-elongation, anthesis and maturity). Compared with a[CO2], net assimilation rate was higher and stomatal conductance was lower under e[CO2], resulting in greater intrinsic water use efficiency. Elevated [CO2] stimulated both above- and belowground biomass as well as grain yield, however, this stimulation was greater under well-watered (WW) than drought (DD) throughout the whole soil profile. Imposition of drought in either or both soil layers decreased aboveground biomass and grain yield under both [CO2] compared to the well-watered treatment. However, the greatest ‘CO2 fertilisation effect’ was observed when drought was imposed in the top soil layer only (DW), and this was associated with e[CO2]-stimulation of root growth especially in the well-watered bottom layer. We suggest that stimulation of belowground biomass under e[CO2] will allow better access to sub-soil water during grain filling period, when additional water is converted into additional yield with high efficiency in Mediterranean-type dryland agro-ecosystems. If sufficient water is available in the sub-soil, e[CO2] may help mitigating the effect of drying surface soil."
https://openalex.org/W2807978200,"Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) are considered a great promise in the repair and regeneration of bone. Considerable efforts have been oriented towards uncovering the best strategy to promote stem cells osteogenic differentiation. In previous studies, hBM-MSCs exposed to physical stimuli such as pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) or directly seeded on nanostructured titanium surfaces (TiO2) were shown to improve their differentiation to osteoblasts in osteogenic condition. In the present study, the effect of a daily PEMF-exposure on osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs seeded onto nanostructured TiO2 (with clusters under 100 nm of dimension) was investigated. TiO2-seeded cells were exposed to PEMF (magnetic field intensity: 2 mT; intensity of induced electric field: 5 mV; frequency: 75 Hz) and examined in terms of cell physiology modifications and osteogenic differentiation. Results showed that PEMF exposure affected TiO2-seeded cells osteogenesis by interfering with selective calcium-related osteogenic pathways, and greatly enhanced hBM-MSCs osteogenic features such as the expression of early/late osteogenic genes and protein production (e.g., ALP, COL-I, osteocalcin and osteopontin) and ALP activity. Finally, PEMF-treated cells resulted to secrete into conditioned media higher amounts of BMP-2, DCN and COL-I than untreated cell cultures. These findings confirm once more the osteoinductive potential of PEMF, suggesting that its combination with TiO2 nanostructured surface might be a great option in bone tissue engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2807760927,"We studied in a clinical setting the age dependent T1 relaxation time as a marker of normal late brain maturation and compared it to conventional techniques, namely the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).Forty-two healthy subjects ranging from ages 1 year to 20 years were included in our study. T1 brain maps in which the intensity of each pixel corresponded to T1 relaxation times were generated based on MR imaging data acquired using a MP2RAGE sequence. During the same session, diffusion tensor imaging data was collected. T1 relaxation times and ADC in white matter and grey matter were measured in seven clinically relevant regions of interest and were correlated to subjects' age.In the basal ganglia, there was a small, yet significant, decrease in T1 relaxation time (-0.45 ≤R≤-0.59, p<10-2) and ADC (-0.60≤R≤-0.65, p<10-4) as a function of age. In the frontal and parietal white matter, there was a significant decrease in T1 relaxation time (-0.62≤R≤-0.68, p<10-4) and ADC (-0.81≤R≤-0.85, p<10-4) as a function of age. T1 relaxation time changes in the corpus callosum and internal capsule were less relevant for this age range. There was no significant difference between the correlation of T1 relaxation time and ADC with respect to age (p-value = 0.39). The correlation between T1 relaxation and ADC is strong in the white matter but only moderate in basal ganglia over this age period.T1 relaxation time is a marker of brain maturation or myelination during late brain development. Between the age of 1 and 20 years, T1 relaxation time decreases as a function of age in the white matter and basal ganglia. The greatest changes occur in frontal and parietal white matter. These regions are known to mature in the final stage of development and are mainly composed of association circuits. Age-correlation is not significantly different between T1 relaxation time and ADC. Therefore, T1 relaxation time does not appear to be a superior marker of brain maturation than ADC but may be considered as complementary owing the intrinsic differences in bio-physical sensitivity. This work may serve as normative ranges in clinical imaging routines."
https://openalex.org/W2808485725,"Focusing on sex differences is necessary to fully understand basic neurobiological processes such as the engagement of large-scale brain networks involved in attention. Prior work suggests that women show enhanced attention during tasks of reward/punishment relative to men. Yet, sex differences in the engagement of neural networks sub serving internal and external focus has been unexplored in regard to reward and punishment. Using data from a large sample (n = 190) of healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project, we investigated sex differences in default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and frontal parietal network (FPN) activation during exposure to reward and punishment. To determine if sex differences are specific to valenced stimuli, we analyzed network activation during working memory. Results indicate that, relative to men, women have increased suppression of the DMN and greater activation of the DAN during exposure to reward and punishment. Given the relative roles of these networks in internal (DMN) and external (DAN) attention, this pattern of activation suggests that women have enhanced external attention to reward and punishment. In contrast, there were no sex differences in network activation during working memory, indicating that this sex difference is specific to the processing of reward and punishment. These findings suggest a neurobiological explanation for prior work showing women have greater sensitivity to reward/punishment and are more prone to psychiatric disorders characterized by enhanced attention to such stimuli. Furthermore, given the large sample from the Human Connectome Project, the current findings provide general implications for the study of sex as a biological variable in investigation of reward processes."
https://openalex.org/W2808507782,"The liver is a highly vascularized organ receiving a dual input of oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery and portal vein. The impact of decreased blood flow on glucose metabolism and how hepatocytes could adapt to this restrictive environment are still unclear. Using the left portal vein ligation (LPVL) rat model, we found that cellular injury was delayed after the onset of liver ischemia. We hypothesized that a metabolic adaptation by hepatocytes to maintain energy homeostasis could account for this lag phase. Liver glucose metabolism was characterized by 13C- and 1H-NMR spectroscopy and analysis of high-energy metabolites. ALT levels and caspase 3 activity in LPVL animals remained normal during the first 12 h following surgery (P<0.05). Ischemia rapidly led to decreased intrahepatic tissue oxygen tension and blood flow (P<0.05) and increased expression of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha. Intrahepatic glucose uptake, ATP/ADP ratio and energy charge level remained stable for up to 12 h after ligation. Entry of glucose in the Krebs cycle was impaired with lowered incorporation of 13C from [U-13C]glucose into glutamate and succinate from 0.25 to 12 h after LPVL. However, total hepatic succinate and glutamate increased 6 and 12 h after ischemia (P<0.05). Glycolysis was initially reduced (P<0.05) but reached maximum 13C-lactate (P<0.001) and 13C-alanine (P<0.01) enrichments 12 h after LPVL. In conclusion, early liver homeostasis stems from an inherent ability of ischemic hepatocytes to metabolically adapt through increased Krebs cycle and glycolysis activity to preserve bioenergetics and cell viability. This metabolic plasticity of hepatocytes could be harnessed to develop novel metabolic strategies to prevent ischemic liver damage."
https://openalex.org/W2808152793,"The application of engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a considerable amount of registered commercial products inevitably will result in the continuous release of AgNPs into the natural aquatic environment. Therefore, native biofilms, as the prominent life form of microorganisms in almost all known ecosystems, will be subjected to AgNP exposure. Despite the exponentially growing research activities worldwide, it is still difficult to assess nanoparticle-mediated toxicity in natural environments. In order to obtain an ecotoxicologically relevant exposure scenario, we performed experiments with artificial stream mesocosm systems approaching low dose AgNP concentrations close to predicted environmental concentrations. Pregrown freshwater biofilms were exposed for 14 days to citrate-stabilized AgNPs at a concentration of 600 μg l-1 in two commonly used sizes (30 and 70 nm). Sublethal effects of AgNP treatment were assessed with regard to biofilm structure by gravimetric measurements (biofilm thickness and density) and by two biomass parameters, chlorophyll a and protein content. The composition of bacterial biofilm communities was characterized by t-RFLP fingerprinting combined with phylogenetic studies based on the 16S gene. After 14 days of treatment, the structural parameters of the biofilm such as thickness, density, and chlorophyll a and protein content were not statistically significantly changed by AgNP exposure. Furthermore, t-RFLP fingerprint analysis showed that the bacterial diversity was not diminished by AgNPs, as calculated by Shannon Wiener and evenness indices. Nevertheless, t-RFLP analysis also indicated that AgNPs led to an altered biofilm community composition as was shown by cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on the Bray Curtis index. Sequence analysis of cloned 16S rRNA genes further revealed that changes in community composition were related with the displacement of putatively AgNP-sensitive bacterial taxa Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria by taxa known for their enhanced adaptability towards metal stress, such as Acidobacteria, Sphingomonadales, and Comamonadaceae. This measurable community shift, even after low dose AgNP treatment, causes serious concerns with respect to the broad application of AgNPs and their potentially adverse impact on the ecological function of lotic biofilms, such as biodegradation or biostabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2808621467,"The inner ear represents a promising system to develop cell-based therapies from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In the developing ear, Notch signaling plays multiple roles in otic region specification and for cell fate determination. Optimizing hiPSC induction for the generation of appropriate numbers of otic progenitors and derivatives, such as hair cells, may provide an unlimited supply of cells for research and cell-based therapy. In this study, we used monolayer cultures, otic-inducing agents, Notch modulation, and marker expression to track early and otic sensory lineages during hiPSC differentiation. Otic/placodal progenitors were derived from hiPSC cultures in medium supplemented with FGF3/FGF10 for 13 days. These progenitor cells were then treated for 7 days with retinoic acid (RA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) or a Notch inhibitor. The differentiated cultures were analyzed in parallel by qPCR and immunocytochemistry. After the 13 day induction, hiPSC-derived cells displayed an upregulated expression of a panel of otic/placodal markers. Strikingly, a subset of these induced progenitor cells displayed key-otic sensory markers, the percentage of which was increased in cultures under Notch inhibition as compared to RA/EGF-treated cultures. Our results show that modulating Notch pathway during in vitro differentiation of hiPSC-derived otic/placodal progenitors is a valuable strategy to promote the expression of human otic sensory lineage genes."
https://openalex.org/W2808515901,"The ultimate goal of reading is to understand written text. To accomplish this, children must first master decoding, the ability to translate printed words into sounds. Although decoding and reading comprehension are highly interdependent, some children struggle to decode but comprehend well, whereas others with good decoding skills fail to comprehend. The neural basis underlying individual differences in this discrepancy between decoding and comprehension abilities is virtually unknown.We investigated the neural basis underlying reading discrepancy, defined as the difference between reading comprehension and decoding skills, in a three-part study: 1) The neuroanatomical basis of reading discrepancy in a cross-sectional sample of school-age children with a wide range of reading abilities (Experiment-1; n = 55); 2) Whether a discrepancy-related neural signature is present in beginning readers and predictive of future discrepancy (Experiment-2; n = 43); and 3) Whether discrepancy-related regions are part of a domain-general or a language specialized network, utilizing the 1000 Functional Connectome data and large-scale reverse inference from Neurosynth.org (Experiment-3).Results converged onto the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as related to having discrepantly higher reading comprehension relative to decoding ability. Increased gray matter volume (GMV) was associated with greater discrepancy (Experiment-1). Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses based on the left DLPFC cluster identified in Experiment-1 revealed that regional GMV within this ROI in beginning readers predicted discrepancy three years later (Experiment-2). This region was associated with the fronto-parietal network that is considered fundamental for working memory and cognitive control (Experiment-3).Processes related to the prefrontal cortex might be linked to reading discrepancy. The findings may be important for understanding cognitive resilience, which we operationalize as those individuals with greater higher-order reading skills such as reading comprehension compared to lower-order reading skills such as decoding skills. Our study provides insights into reading development, existing theories of reading, and cognitive processes that are potentially significant to a wide range of reading disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2808185485,"A multi-center imaging trial by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) ""A Multicenter, phase II assessment of tumor hypoxia in glioblastoma using 18F Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) with PET and MRI (ACRIN 6684)"", was conducted to assess hypoxia in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). The aims of this study were to support the role of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) as a prognostic marker for brain tumor patients in multi-center clinical trials. Seventeen participants from four sites had analyzable 3D MRSI datasets acquired on Philips, GE or Siemens scanners at either 1.5T or 3T. MRSI data were analyzed using LCModel to quantify metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and lactate (Lac). Receiver operating characteristic curves for NAA/Cho, Cho/Cr, lactate/Cr, and lactate/NAA were constructed for overall survival at 1-year (OS-1) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6). The OS-1 for the 17 evaluable patients was 59% (10/17). Receiver operating characteristic analyses found the NAA/Cho in tumor (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.00) and in peritumoral regions (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) were predictive for survival at 1 year. PFS-6 was 65% (11/17). Neither NAA/Cho nor Cho/Cr was effective in predicting 6-month progression free survival. Lac/Cr in tumor was a significant negative predictor of PFS-6, indicating that higher lactate/Cr levels are associated with poorer outcome. (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.54 to 1.00). In conclusion, despite the small sample size in the setting of a multi-center trial comprising different vendors, field strengths, and varying levels of expertise at data acquisition, MRS markers NAA/Cho, Lac/Cr and Lac/NAA predicted overall survival at 1 year and 6-month progression free survival. This study validates that MRSI may be useful in evaluating the prognosis in glioblastoma and should be considered for incorporating into multi-center clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2808130519,"Outline In chronic lung infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) the bacteria thrive in biofilm structures protected from the immune system of the host and from antibiotic treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that the susceptibility of the bacteria to antibiotic treatment can be significantly enhanced by hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The aim of this study is to simulate the effect of ciprofloxacin treatment in a PAO1 biofilm model with aggregates in agarose when combined with hyperbaric oxygen treatment. This is achieved in a reaction-diffusion model that describes the combined effect of ciprofloxacin diffusion, oxygen diffusion and depletion, bacterial growth and killing, and adaptation of the bacteria to ciprofloxacin. In the model, the oxygen diffusion and depletion use a set of parameters derived from experimental results presented in this work. The part of the model describing ciprofloxacin killing uses parameter values from the literature in combination with our estimates (Jacobs, et al., 2016; Grillon, et al., 2016). Micro-respirometry experiments were conducted to determine the oxygen consumption in the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. The parameters were validated against existing data from an HBOT experiment by Kolpen et al. (2017). The complete oxygen model comprises a reaction-diffusion equation describing the oxygen consumption by using a Michaelis-Menten reaction term. The oxygen model performed well in predicting oxygen concentrations in both time and depth into the biofilm. At 2.8 bar pure oxygen pressure, HBOT increases the penetration depth of oxygen into the biofilm almost by a of factor 4 in agreement with the scaling that follows from the stationary balance between the consumption term and diffusion term. Conclusion In the full reaction-diffusion model we see that hyperbaric oxygen treatment significantly increases the killing by ciprofloxacin in a PAO1 biofilm in alignment with the experimental results from Kolpen et al. (Kolpen, et al., 2017; Kolpen, et al. 2016). The enhanced killing, in turn, lowers the oxygen consumption in the outer layers of the biofilm, and leads to even deeper penetration of oxygen into the biofilm."
https://openalex.org/W2808506110,"Plants have a diverse endophytic microbiome that is functionally important for their growth, development, and health. In this study, the diversity and specificity of culturable endophytic fungal communities were explored in one of the most important biofuel crops, switchgrass plants (Panicum virgatum L.), which have been cultivated on a reclaimed coal-mining site for more than 20 years. The endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface-sterilized shoot (leaf and stem), root, and seed tissues of switchgrass plants and then cultured for identification. A total of 1339 fungal isolates were found and 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were sequence identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers and grouped into 7 orders and 4 classes. Although a diverse range of endophytic fungi associated with switchgrass were documented, the most abundant class, order, and species were Sordariomycetes, Hypocreales, and Fusarium spp. respectively. About 86% of the isolated endophytic fungi were able to enhance the heights of the shoots; 69% could increase the shoot fresh weights; and 62% could improve the shoot dry weights after being reintroduced back into the switchgrass plants, which illustrated their functional importance. Through the Shannon Diversity Index analysis, we observed a gradation of species diversity, with shoots and roots having the similar values and seeds having a lesser value. It was observed that the switchgrass plants showing better growth performance displayed higher endophytic fungal species diversity and abundance. It was also discovered that the rhizosphere soil organic matter content was positively correlated with the fungal species diversity. All these data demonstrate the functional association of these beneficial endophytic fungi with switchgrass and their great potential in improving the switchgrass growth and biomass to benefit the biofuel industry by reducing chemical inputs and burden to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2807821842,"Background The adaptor protein Linker for activation of T cell (LAT) is a key signaling hub used by the T cell antigen receptor. Mutant mice expressing loss-of-function mutations affecting LAT and including a mutation in which tyrosine 136 is replaced by a phenylalanine (LatY136F) develop lymphoproliferative disorder involving T helper type 2 effector cells capable of triggering a massive polyclonal B cell activation that leads to hypergammaglobulinemia G1 and E and to non-resolving inflammation and autoimmunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the phenotypes of LatY136F knock-in mice resemble the immunohistopathological features of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Methods LatY136F knock-in mice were sacrificed at 4–20 weeks of age, and pancreas, kidney, salivary gland and lung were obtained. All organs were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and with Azan for estimation of collagen in fibrosis, and the severity scores of inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated. Immunostainings were performed to analyze the types of infiltrating cells. In addition, the effects of corticosteroid treatment on the development of tissue lesions and serum levels of IgG1 were assessed. Results Tissue lesions characterized by inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis were detected in pancreas, kidney, and salivary gland starting from 6 weeks of age. Immunostainings showed pronounced infiltration of plasma cells, CD4-positive T cells, and macrophages. Infiltrating plasma cells predominantly expressed IgG1. The extent of inflammation in pancreas and salivary glands was markedly reduced by corticosteroid treatment. Conclusions LatY136F knock-in mice displayed increased production of Th2-type IgG1 (a homologue of human IgG4) and developed multiple organ tissue lesions reminiscent of those seen in patients with IgG4-RD. Moreover, the development of these tissue lesions was highly sensitive to corticosteroid treatment like in IgG4-RD. For these reasons we consider the LatY136F knock-in mouse strain to represent a promising model for human IgG4-RD."
https://openalex.org/W2808213780,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a flagellated Gram-negative bacterium which is the causative agent of melioidosis. The disease poses a major public health problem in tropical regions and diabetes is a major risk factor. The high mortality rate of melioidosis is associated with severe sepsis which involves the overwhelming production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Bacterial flagellar protein (flagellin) activates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-mediated innate immune signaling pathways and induces adaptive immune response. However, previous studies of TLR5 signaling in melioidosis have been performed using recombinant flagellin from Salmonella Typhimurium instead of B. pseudomallei. This study aimed to investigate human innate immune response and antibody response against a recombinant B. pseudomallei flagellin (rFliC). We prepared B. pseudomallei rFliC and used it to stimulate HEK-BlueTM-hTLR5 and THP1-DualTM cells to assess TLR5 activation. Subsequently, whole blood stimulation assays with rFliC were performed ex vivo. TLR5-flagellin interactions trigger activation of transcription factor NF-κB in HEK-BlueTM-hTLR5 cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) productions from whole blood in response to rFliC differed between fourteen healthy individuals. The levels of these cytokines changed in a dose and time-dependent manner. ELISA was used to determine rFliC-specific antibodies in serum samples from different groups of melioidosis patients and healthy subjects. IgG antibody to rFliC in melioidosis patients with diabetes were higher compared with non-diabetic patients. Our results show that B. pseudomallei flagellin is a potent immune stimulator and that the immune responses to rFliC are different among individuals. This may provide valuable insights toward the potential use of rFliC in vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2808643159,"Atherosclerosis involves activation of the IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB inflammatory cascade, which is negatively regulated by miR146a. Previous studies showed that the TT genotype of rs2431697, located near the miR-146a gene, drives lower miR-146a transcription and predicts adverse cardiovascular events in anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients. Moreover, systemic miR-146a administration protects mice from atherosclerosis. Here we evaluated the ability of miR-146a expression in the hematopoietic component to regulate atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-null mice (Ldlr-/-).Lethally-irradiated Ldlr-/- mice transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type or miR-146a-null mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 8 and 20 weeks. Irak1, Traf6 and MIR146A expression were quantified in thoracic aorta by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Aortic plaque size and composition were characterized by Oil-Red staining and immunohistochemistry and leukocyte recruitment by intravital microscopy. Blood cell counts were similar in fat-fed Ldlr-/-mice with or without hematopoietic miR-146a expression. However, plasma cholesterol decreased in fat-fed Ldlr-/-mice transplanted with bone marrow deficient for miR-146a. Finally, aortic atherosclerosis burden and recruitment of leukocytes into the vessel wall were undistinguishable between the two groups, despite higher levels of Irak1 and Traf6 mRNA and protein in the aorta of fat-fed mice lacking hematopoietic miR-146a expression.miR-146a deficiency exclusively in hematopoietic cells modulates cholesterol levels in plasma and the expression of its targets in the artery wall of fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice, but does not accelerate atherosclerosis. Atheroprotection upon systemic miR-146a administration may therefore be caused by specific effects on vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2807886396,"One of the non-communicable diseases which is on the rise is type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is largely preventable with healthy lifestyle. We therefore conducted this study to explore premorbid perception of risk, behavioural practices and the coping strategies of patients with T2D.Using descriptive phenomenology approach to qualitative enquiry, we conducted eight focus group discussions (N = 73) with diabetic patients; four among males (N = 36) and four among females (N = 37). In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with 15 patients, seven caretakers and three physicians. We adopted Colaizzi's descriptive phenomenology approach to analyse the data with the aid of NVivo 11.We found that respondents believed diabetes was a condition for the aged and rich and this served as a premorbid risk attenuator. Majority of them engaged in diabetes-related high risk behaviours such as lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating despite their foreknowledge about the role of lifestyle in diabetes pathogenesis. We also found that patients used moringa, noni, prekese, and garlic concurrently with orthodox medications. Adherence to dietary changes and exercises was a challenge with females reporting better adherence than males. The study also revealed that patients believed biomedical health facilities paid little attention to psychosocial aspects of care despite its essential role in coping with the condition.Diabetic patients had low premorbid perception of risk and engaged in diabetes-related risky behaviours. Diabetic patients had challenges adhering to lifestyle changes and use both biomedical and local remedies in the management of the condition. Psychosocial support is necessary to enhance coping with the condition."
https://openalex.org/W2808672680,"Tropical corals are often associated with dinitrogen (N2)-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs), and seasonal changes in key environmental parameters, such as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) availability and seawater temperature, are known to affect N2 fixation in coral-microbial holobionts. Despite, then, such potential for seasonal and depth-related changes in N2 fixation in reef corals, such variation has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this study quantified seasonal (winter vs. summer) N2 fixation rates associated with the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata collected from depths of 5, 10 and 20 m in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea). Findings revealed that corals from all depths exhibited the highest N2 fixation rates during the oligotrophic summer season, when up to 11% of their photo-metabolic nitrogen demand (CPND) could be met by N2 fixation. While N2 fixation remained seasonally stable for deep corals (20 m), it significantly decreased for the shallow corals (5 and 10 m) during the DIN-enriched winter season, accounting for less than 2% of the corals’ CPND. This contrasting seasonal response in N2 fixation across corals of different depths could be driven by 1) release rates of coral-derived organic matter, 2) the community composition of the associated diazotrophs, and/or 3) nutrient acquisition by the Symbiodinium community."
https://openalex.org/W2808272686,"Purpose To discuss the impact of intraocular lens-(IOL)-power, IOL-thickness, IOL-shape, corneal power and effective lens position (ELP) on the distance between the anterior IOL vertex (ALP) of a thick IOL and the ELP of its thin lens equivalent. Methods We calculated the ALP of a thick IOL in a model eye, which results in the same focal plane as a thin IOL placed at the ELP using paraxial approximation. The model eye included IOL-power (P), ELP, IOL-thickness (Th), IOL-shape-factor (X), and corneal power (DC). The initial values were P = 10 D (diopter: 1 D = 1 m-1), 20 D, 30 D, Th = 0.9 mm, ELP = 5 mm, X = 0, DC = 43 D. The difference between ALP and the ELP was illustrated as a function of each of the model parameters. Results The ALP of a thick lens has to be placed in front of the ELP for P>0 IOLs to achieve the same optical effect as the thin lens equivalent. The difference ALP-ELP for the initial values is -0.57 mm. Minus power IOLs (ALP-ELP = -0.07 mm, for IOL-power = -5 D) and convex-concave IOLs (ALP-ELP = -0.16 mm, for X = 1) have to be placed further posterior. The corneal power and ELP have less influence, but corneal power cannot be neglected. Conclusion The distance between ELP and ALP primarily depends on IOL-power, IOL-thickness, and shape-factor."
https://openalex.org/W2808467040,"Background Maternity care has to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is known that obstetric intervention can influence the time of birth, but no previous analysis at a national level in England has yet investigated in detail the ways in which the day and time of birth varies by onset of labour and mode of giving birth. Method We linked data from birth registration, birth notification, and Maternity Hospital Episode Statistics and analysed 5,093,615 singleton births in NHS maternity units in England from 2005 to 2014. We used descriptive statistics and negative binomial regression models with harmonic terms to establish how patterns of timing of birth vary by onset of labour, mode of giving birth and gestational age. Results The timing of birth by time of day and day of the week varies considerably by onset of labour and mode of birth. Spontaneous births after spontaneous onset are more likely to occur between midnight and 6am than at other times of day, and are also slightly more likely on weekdays than at weekends and on public holidays. Elective caesarean births are concentrated onto weekday mornings. Births after induced labours are more likely to occur at hours around midnight on Tuesdays to Saturdays and on days before a public holiday period, than on Sundays, Mondays and during or just after a public holiday. Conclusion The timing of births varies by onset of labour and mode of birth and these patterns have implications for midwifery and medical staffing. Further research is needed to understand the processes behind these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2807786890,"Objectives Statins, which are lipid-lowering agents, have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that may affect the occurrence of various infectious diseases. We assessed whether statins increase the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) with propensity score-matching. Methods The study was based on the National Health Insurance database and its subset database of the “medical check-up” population of South Korea. These cohorts consist of about one million and 570,000 people, respectively, representative of the entire population of South Korea. We identified 103,930 statin users and 430,685 non-statin users. After propensity score-matching, 25,726 statin users and the same number of non-statin users were finally analyzed. The development of HZ was monitored in these matched pairs over the 11 years from 2003 to 2013. Results Statin users had a significantly higher risk of HZ than non-statin users: hazard ratio (HR) 1.25 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.37) (p < .0001). The risk of HZ associated with statins was especially high in the elderly: HR 1.39 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.73) in the over 70-year-olds (p = 0.003) and HR 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.39) in the 60-to-69-year-olds (p = 0.056). Furthermore, there was a significant p for trend in terms of cumulative dose effect between the risk of HZ and the duration of statin use (p < .0001). Conclusions These epidemiologic findings provide strong evidence for an association between HZ and statin use, and suggest that unnecessary statins should be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2808265855,"Exercise intolerance is the first symptom of heart disease. Yet an objective and standardised method in canine cardiology to assess exercise capacity in a clinical setting is lacking. In contrast, exercise testing is a powerful diagnostic tool in humans, providing valuable information on prognosis and impact of therapeutic intervention. To investigate whether an exercise test reveals differences between dogs with early stage mitral regurgitation (MR) and dogs without cardiac disease, 12 healthy beagles (healthy group, HG) and 12 dogs with presymptomatic MR (CHIEF B1 / B2, patient group, PG) underwent a six-stage submaximal exercise test (ET) on a motorised treadmill. They trotted in their individual comfort speed for three minutes per stage, first without incline, afterwards increasing it by 4% for every subsequent stage. Blood samples were taken at rest and during two 3-minute breaks in the course of the test. Further samples were taken after the completion of the exercise test and again after a 3-hour recovery period. Measured parameters included heart rate, lactate and the cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide and cardiac Troponin I. The test was performed again under the same conditions in the same dogs three weeks after the first trial to evaluate individual repeatability. Cardiac biomarkers increased significantly in both HG and PG in the course of the test. The increase was more pronounced in CHIEF B1 / B2 dogs than in the HG. N-terminal pro-B-Type natriuretic peptide increased from 435 ± 195 to 523 ± 239 pmol/L (HG) and from 690 to 815 pmol/L (PG). cTnI increased from 0.020 to 0.024 ng/mL (HG) and from 0.06 to 0.08 ng/ml (PG). The present study provides a method to assess exercise-induced changes in cardiac biomarkers under clinical conditions. The increase of NT-proBNP and cTnI is more pronounced in dogs with early-stage MR than in healthy dogs. Results indicate that measuring the parameters before and after exercise is adequate and taking blood samples between the different stages of the ET does not provide additional information. Also, stress echocardiography was inconclusive. It can be concluded that exercise testing, especially in combination with measuring cardiac biomarkers, could be a helpful diagnostic tool in canine cardiology."
https://openalex.org/W2808406129,"The proteins S100A9 and S100A12 are associated with the human S100 calcium-binding protein family. These proteins promote interaction with target proteins and alter their conformation when they bind to calcium ions in EF-hand motifs. The V domain of RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products) is crucial for S100A9 binding. The binding of RAGE with S100 family proteins aids in cell proliferation. In this report, we demonstrate that S100A12 protein hinders the binding of S100A9 with the RAGE V-domain. We used fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy to analyze the interaction of S100A9 with S100A12. The binary complex models of S100A9-S100A12 were developed using data obtained from 1H-15N HSQC NMR titrations and the HADDOCK program. We overlaid the complex models of S100A9-S100A12 with the same orientation of S100A9 and the RAGE V-domain. This complex showed that S100A12 protein blocks the interaction between S100A9 and the RAGE V-domain. It means S100A12 may be used as an antagonist for S100A9. The results could be favorable for developing anti-cancer drugs based on S100 family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2808662089,"Regulating the air in low-oxygen environments protects hermetically stored grains from storage pests damage. However, pests that can tolerate hypoxic stress pose a huge challenge in terms of grain storage. We used various biological approaches to determine the fundamental mechanisms of Tribolium castaneum to cope with hypoxia. Our results indicated that limiting the available oxygen to T. castaneum increased glycolysis and inhibited the Krebs cycle, and that accumulated pyruvic acid was preferentially converted to lactic acid via anaerobic metabolism. Mitochondrial aerobic respiration was markedly suppressed for beetles under hypoxia, which also might have led to mitochondrial autophagy. The enzymatic activity of citrate synthase decreased in insects under hypoxia but recovered within 12 h, which suggested that the beetles recovered from the hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia-reperfusion resulted in severe oxidative damage to insects, and antioxidant levels increased to defend against the high level of reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, our findings show that mitochondria were the main target in T. castaneum in response to low oxygen. The beetles under hypoxia inhibited mitochondrial respiration and increased antioxidant activity after reoxygenation. Our research advances the field of pest control and makes it possible to develop more efficient strategies for hermetic storage."
https://openalex.org/W2808706936,"To introduce disclosure of patient safety incidents (DPSI) into a specific country, evidence of the effectiveness of DPSI is essential. Since such a disclosure policy has not been adopted in South Korea, hypothetical cases can be used to measure the effectiveness of DPSI. We evaluated the effectiveness of DPSI using hypothetical cases in a survey with a sample of the Korean general public. We used 8 hypothetical cases reflecting 3 conditions: the clarity of medical errors, the severity of harm, and conducting DPSI. Face-to-face interviews with 700 people using structured questionnaires were conducted. Participants were asked to read each hypothetical case and give remarks on the following: their judgment of a situation as a medical error and of the requirement for an apology, the willingness to revisit or recommend physicians, the intention to file a medical lawsuit and commence criminal proceedings against physicians, the level of trust in physicians, and the expected amount of compensation. The results indicated favorable findings in support of DPSI; DPSI reduced the likelihood of perceiving a situation as a medical error, promoted willingness to revisit and recommend physicians, and discouraged the intention to file a medical lawsuit and take commence criminal proceedings against physicians. Furthermore, DPSI increased patients' trust scores in physicians and reduced the expected amount of compensation. The general public had positive attitudes towards DPSI in South Korea. This result provides empirical evidence for reducing the psychological burden that the introduction of DPSI may have on health professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2808388015,"Postzygotic reproductive isolation may become strong only once the process of speciation is in its advanced stages. For taxa in the early stages of speciation, prezygotic reproductive isolation barriers may play a predominant role in maintaining species boundaries. Here, we study the recent capuchino seedeater biological radiation, a group of highly sympatric species from the genus Sporophila that have diversified during the Pleistocene in Neotropical grasslands. Capuchinos can be diagnosed by adult male coloration patterns and song, two sets of characters known to contribute to pre-mating reproductive isolation. However, it remains unknown whether potzygotic incompatibilities contribute to maintaining species limits in this group. Here we use existing breeding records from captive individuals to test for patterns consistent with F1 inviability. We compare hatching success, fledging success, and the sex ratio at adulthood between conspecific and hybrid capuchino pairs. We observed a trend towards lower numbers of the heterogametic sex among adult hybrids, consistent Haldane's rule, but this was supported by only one of our statistical tests. Our study is the first to document hybrid male capuchino phenotypes based on known crosses. We observed phenotypes that were similar or intermediate to those of the parental species, as well as novel plumage patterns that have not been described in the wild. One cross produced a plumage pattern that has been observed at low frequencies in natural populations. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the relative importance of the mechanisms of reproductive isolation in capuchino seedeaters."
https://openalex.org/W2808611528,"Background Bangladesh reports one of the highest rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the world. Despite wide recognition of IPV as an important public health and human rights issue, evidence for IPV prevention is still inadequate. Lack of guidance on effective IPV prevention in Bangladesh resulted in targeting only women in most of the programmes. Methods This paper assesses impact of SAFE, a 20-month intervention (March 2012 to October 2013) in slums of Dhaka on IPV and tests effectiveness of female only groups vs. no groups; and female + male groups vs. female only groups on IPV in the community using a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. SAFE’s core activities included interactive group sessions, community mobilisation, and services. The last two activities were common across arms. Findings Regression analyses (female survey: baseline n = 2,666; endline n = 2,670) showed no effect of SAFE on IPV against women aged 15–29. However, sub-group analyses demonstrated 21% risk reduction of physical IPV against adolescent girls aged 15–19 in the female + male group intervention arm. A consistent reduction in sexual violence was observed in both female and female + male arms for both groups of women, but the results were not statistically significant. Interpretation The findings emphasise the importance of combining male and female interventions for reducing physical IPV against adolescent girls. Implications for future research have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2808116502,"Plants have evolved a variety of means to energetically sense and respond to abiotic and biotic environmental stress. Two typical photochemical signaling responses involve the emission of volatile organic compounds and light. The emission of certain leaf wound volatiles and light are mutually dependent upon oxygen which is subsequently required for the wound-induced lipoxygenase reactions that trigger the formation of fatty acids and hydroperoxides; ultimately leading to photon emission by chlorophyll molecules. A low noise photomultiplier with sensitivity in the visible spectrum (300-720 nm) is used to continuously measure long duration ultraweak photon emission of dark-adapting whole Spathiphyllum leaves (in vivo). Leaves were mechanically wounded after two hours of dark adaptation in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It was found that (1) nitrogen incubation did not affect the pre-wound basal photocounts; (2) wound induced leaf biophoton emission was significantly suppressed when under anoxic stress; and (3) the aerobic wound induced emission spectra observed was > 650 nm, implicating chlorophyll as the likely emitter. Limitations of the PMT photocathode's radiant sensitivity, however, prevented accurate analysis from 700-720 nm. Further examination of leaf wounding profile photon counts revealed that the pre-wounding basal state (aerobic and anoxic), the anoxic wounding state, and the post-wounding aerobic state statistics all approximate a Poisson distribution. It is additionally observed that aerobic wounding induces two distinct exponential decay events. These observations contribute to the body of plant wound-induced luminescence research and provide a novel methodology to measure this phenomenon in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2808596098,"The fatty acid composition of the diet has been linked to the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Compared with monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids decrease fat oxidation and diet-induced thermogenesis. A potential limitation of previous studies was the short duration (≦5h) of calorimetry used. The present study compared the effects of a meal rich in saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on 24-h of fat oxidation. Ten males participated in two sessions of indirect calorimetry in a whole-room metabolic chamber. At each session, subjects consumed three meals rich in palm oil (44.3% as saturated, 42.3% as monounsaturated and 13.4% as polyunsaturated fatty acid) or rapeseed oil (11.7% as saturated, 59.3% as monounsaturated and 29.0% as polyunsaturated fatty acid). Fat oxidation over 24-h was significantly higher in the meal rich in rapeseed oil (779 ± 202 kcal/day) than that rich in palm oil (703 ± 158 kcal/day, P < 0.05), although energy expenditure was similar between both meal conditions. Meal rich in unsaturated fatty acids increased the oxidation of exogenous and/or endogenous fat. The results of a long calorimetry period indicate that rapeseed oil offered an advantage toward increased 24-h fat oxidation in healthy young males."
https://openalex.org/W2808669923,"Hepatic dysfunction is one of the clinical features in severe malaria. However, the mechanism of hepatic injury during malaria is still unknown. Myeloid-related protein (MRP) 14 is abundantly expressed by myeloid cells and involved in various inflammatory diseases. We previously reported that serum MRP14 is elevated in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. In order to verify whether extracellular MRP14 is involved in the pathology of hepatic injury during rodent malaria, we intravenously administrated recombinant MRP14 (rMRP14) to mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. The administration of rMRP14 did not affect parasite number or hematocrit. On the other hand, the hepatic injury was exacerbated in rMRP14-treated mice, and their serum concentration of hepatic enzymes increased significantly more than PBS-treated controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of the liver showed that more MRP14+ macrophages accumulated in rMRP14-treated mice than PBS-treated controls after infection. The administration of rMRP14 also promotes the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules in the liver, such as iNOS, IL-1β, IL-12, and TNF-α. Even in the absence of Plasmodium infection, administration of rMRP14 could induce the accumulation of MRP14+ macrophages and up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory molecules in the liver of naïve mice. The results indicate that MRP14 promotes the accumulation of MRP14+ cells and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules and NO, which amplify inflammatory cascade leading to hepatic injury. In conclusion, MRP14 is a one of key molecules for liver inflammation during rodent malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2807888504,"Dozens of computational methods are developed to identify species present in a metagenomic dataset. Many of these computational methods depend on available sequenced microbial species, which are still far from being representative. To see how newly sequenced genomes affect the analysis results, we re-analyzed a shotgun metagenomic dataset composed of twelve colitis free metagenomic samples and ten colitis-related metagenomic samples. Unexpectedly, we identified at least two new phyla that may relate to colitis development in patients, together with the phylum identified previously. Compared with the previously identified phylum that differed between the two types of samples, the differences associated with the two new phyla are statistically more significant. Moreover, the abundance of the two new phyla correlates more with the severity of colitis. Surprisingly, even by repeating the analyses implemented in the previous study, we found that at least one main conclusion in the previous study is not supported. Our study indicates the importance of re-analysis of the generated metagenomic datasets and the necessity of considering multiple updated tools in metagenomic studies. It also sheds light on the limitations of the popular tools used currently and the importance to infer the presence of taxa without relying upon available sequenced genomes."

For Exp. 1, five rumen cannulated Nellore bulls were used in a 5x5 Latin square arrangement, with 14 d for adaptation and 9 d for sample collection. Treatments were: dry ground corn, dry ground sorghum, reconstituted corn, reconstituted sorghum, and control (forage-based diet). Samples of rumen epithelium from ventral sac were excised, rinsed, snap-frozen and stored at -80°C until total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. In the Exp. 2, 24 Nellore bulls were assigned to a completely randomized design lasting 168 d. Experimental treatments were similar to those at Exp. 1, but without the control treatment. After the experimental period, bulls were slaughtered and rumen epithelium samples were rapidly excised for further histological analysis. Rumen epithelial tissue from animals fed reconstituted corn had lower expression of downregulated-in-adenoma (P = 0.03) and Na+/H+ exchanger 2 (trend; P = 0.09). The expression of Na+/ H+ exchanger 1 (P = 0.10) and putative anion transporter (P = 0.06) tended to be lower in rumen epithelium of bulls fed reconstituted grains. Ruminal concentration of valerate was greater for animals fed reconstituted grain (P = 0.01). Likewise, animals fed reconstituted corn tended to have greater butyrate ruminal concentration (P = 0.08). Keratinized layer thickness did not differ among treatments (P > 0.10). Therefore, reconstituted grains (especially corn) decrease the mRNA expression of genes involved in volatile fatty acids transport and pH control in the rumen epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2808125935,"Previous work demonstrates that individuals who obtain exemptions from school immunization requirements are geographically clustered, making regional differences in vaccination coverage a significant concern. Even where exemption levels are high, there are still parents that vaccinate. School-level assessments have determined that exemptors are more likely to attend wealthier schools with fewer minorities. Few studies have assessed divergent opinions within the context of a higher-exemption community to examine subtle differences in opinion surrounding vaccinations. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess attitudes and perceptions towards vaccinations and compare them for exemptors and non-exemptors. We administered surveys to parents in high-exemption (>10%) elementary schools in Arizona during the 2012-13 school year. A total of 404 surveys were completed by parents among schools in Maricopa (n = 7) and Yavapai (n = 2) counties. Of these, 35% (n = 141) were exemptors and 65% (n = 261) were non-exemptors. Exemptors were more likely than non-exemptors to be concerned about serious side-effects (p<0.001). They were more likely to report knowing someone who had been diagnosed with a vaccine-preventable disease (p<0.001) but less likely to report that this had been a serious illness in that person (p<0.001) and they believed it is better for a child to develop immunity through illness than vaccination (p<0.001). They were less likely to trust physicians (p<0.001) and information about vaccines (p<0.001) and were more likely to obtain their health care from a naturopath (p<0.001). In summary, exemptors in these Arizona schools do not appear to be exempting their children from vaccinations due to convenience, as has been hypothesized in other settings. Based on the divergent views within high-exemption schools and reported distrust of the medical establishment, target interventions for high-exemption schools are discussed. Additionally, given the lack of effective non-policy based interventions to-date, the negligible declines in personal belief exemption rates, and vaccine preventable disease rate increases in Arizona, especially in high-exemption areas, legislative action in Arizona may also warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2807742514,"The marine isopod genus Limnoria contains algae-eating species. Previous phylogeographic studies have suggested that Limnoria species feeding on buoyant kelp underwent low genetic differentiation on a large spatial scale because rafting on floating host kelps promotes high levels of gene flow. In this paper, we survey the genetic structure of Limnoria nagatai, which bores into the non-buoyant kelps Eisenia bicyclis and E. arborea. We analyze the mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome oxidase subunit I [COI] gene) and morphological traits of L. nagatai, and the host kelps E. bicyclis and E. arborea from 14 populations along the Japanese archipelago of the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan. Four major lineages are recognized within L. nagatai: three lineages in the Pacific Ocean, and one lineage in the Sea of Japan which might be a cryptic species. For L. nagatai, we show high genetic differentiation between geographically separated habitats in the Pacific Ocean, while low differentiation is found among continuous host kelps habitats in the Pacific Ocean as well as the Sea of Japan. L. nagatai in E. bicyclis in the Pacific Ocean has experienced large population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), whereas the lineage in E. bicyclis in the Sea of Japan has not. We suggest that Limnoria feeding on non-buoyant kelps, may attain low genetic differentiation because they might be able to disperse long distance if the habitat of host kelps is continuous. The historical events affecting Limnoria after the LGM may differ between the coasts of the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2807885022,"Walking on various surfaces encountered in everyday life requires lower limb prosthesis users to continually adapt their movement patterns. Elevated vacuum suspension systems could improve transtibial amputee gait on non-level surfaces; however, research is lacking to guide clinical practice. Twelve transtibial amputees were fitted with the Össur sleeveless vacuum suspension system (Unity). After a one month accommodation period, the CAREN-Extended system was used to evaluate gait on a self-paced treadmill when walking with continuous perturbations (medial-lateral translations, rolling hills, simulated uneven ground) with an active or inactive vacuum suspension system. Significant differences between active and inactive vacuum conditions (p<0.05) were found for some temporal-spatial and kinematic gait parameters, but the differences were small and not considered clinically significant. Our findings suggest that potential vacuum pump failures would not immediately affect gait performance in a moderately high functioning amputee population. However, residual limb volume changes over time due to the removal of elevated vacuum may adversely affect socket fit, leading to greater gait differences and reduced quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2807945645,"Depression is a global health problem associated with a significant public health burden and costs. Although studies on costs of diseases are being considered as an increasingly important factor for health policies, information concerning costs of inpatient care of depression is still insufficient. Thus, the main aim of this study was to evaluate costs of hospitalization of patients treated in 2016 in psychiatric clinics in Poznan (Poland) and in Kiel (Germany) and to analyze treatment used in these centers. The study was conducted from September 2017 to February 2018. 545 hospital records were considered (187 in Poznan and 358 in Kiel). Eventually, 490 hospital records were included, 168 in Poland and 322 in Germany. In general, the costs were calculated based on the patients’ sex and diagnosis (F32 and F33) separately and, subsequently, the outcomes were added and multiplied by the length of hospital stay, giving the cost of hospitalization. The annual cost of inpatient care of depression in 2016 was EUR 491,067.19 () in Poznan and EUR 2,847,991.00 in Kiel. In Poznan, hospitalization was underfunded reaching EUR 183,042.55 (37.27% of total costs in Poznan). In Poznan, the most frequently prescribed medicine was quetiapine, followed by olanzapine and venlafaxine, whereas in Kiel it was venlafaxine, followed by mirtazapine and promethazine. Although non-pharmacological therapies were commonly used in both centers, in Kiel this type of treatment was better structured. The study confirms the degree of the economic burden of inpatient care of depression. The underfunding of mental health revealed, emphasizes the need for urgent amendment of organization and funding of mental health care in Poland. Patients in Poznan were hospitalized on average 10 days longer than in Kiel, thus a reduction of length of hospitalization in Poznan seems possible. Although pharmacotherapy seemed to be comprehensive in both centers, there were some differences between Poznan and Kiel. Access to non-pharmacological therapies during outpatient care was limited in Poznan, however, compared to Kiel."
https://openalex.org/W2808127419,"During incidental learning statistical regularities are extracted from the environment without the intention to learn. Acquired implicit memory of these regularities can affect behavior in the absence of awareness. However, conscious insight in the underlying regularities can also develop during learning. Such emergence of explicit memory is an important learning mechanism that is assumed to involve prediction errors in the striatum and to be dopamine-dependent. Here we directly tested this hypothesis by manipulating dopamine levels during incidental learning in a modified serial reaction time task (SRTT) featuring a hidden regular sequence of motor responses in a placebo-controlled between-group study. Awareness for the sequential regularity was subsequently assessed using cued generation and additionally verified using free recall. The results demonstrated that dopaminergic modulation nearly doubled the amount of explicit sequence knowledge emerged during learning in comparison to the placebo group. This strong effect clearly argues for a causal role of dopamine-dependent processing for the development of awareness for sequential regularities during learning."
https://openalex.org/W2808194021,"Heading direction is determined from visual and inertial cues. Visual headings use retinal coordinates while inertial headings use body coordinates. Thus during eccentric gaze the same heading may be perceived differently by visual and inertial modalities. Stimulus weights depend on the relative reliability of these stimuli, but previous work suggests that the inertial heading may be given more weight than predicted. These experiments only varied the visual stimulus reliability, and it is unclear what occurs with variation in inertial reliability. Five human subjects completed a heading discrimination task using 2s of translation with a peak velocity of 16cm/s. Eye position was ±25° left/right with visual, inertial, or combined motion. The visual motion coherence was 50%. Inertial stimuli included 6 Hz vertical vibration with 0, 0.10, 0.15, or 0.20cm amplitude. Subjects reported perceived heading relative to the midline. With an inertial heading, perception was biased 3.6° towards the gaze direction. Visual headings biased perception 9.6° opposite gaze. The inertial threshold without vibration was 4.8° which increased significantly to 8.8° with vibration but the amplitude of vibration did not influence reliability. With visual-inertial headings, empirical stimulus weights were calculated from the bias and compared with the optimal weight calculated from the threshold. In 2 subjects empirical weights were near optimal while in the remaining 3 subjects the inertial stimuli were weighted greater than optimal predictions. On average the inertial stimulus was weighted greater than predicted. These results indicate multisensory integration may not be a function of stimulus reliability when inertial stimulus reliability is varied."
https://openalex.org/W2807859307,"The Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) is a commercially important species in North American waters, undergoing biological and ecological shifts. These are attributed, in part, to environmental modifications in its habitat and driven by climate change. Investigation of shell growth patterns, trace elements, and isotopic compositions require an examination of growth lines and increments preserved in biogenic carbonates. However, growth pattern analysis of S. solidissima is challenging due to multiple disturbance lines caused by environmental stress, erosion in umbonal shell regions, and constraints related to sample size and preparation techniques. The present study proposes an alternative method for describing chronology. First, we analyzed growth patterns using growth lines within the shell and hinge. To validate the assumption of annual periodicity of growth line formation, we analyzed the oxygen isotope composition of the outer shell layer of two specimens (46°54'20""N; 56°18'58""W). Maximum δ18Oshell values occurred at the exact same location as internal growth lines in both specimens, confirming that they are formed annually and that growth ceases during winter. Next, we used growth increment width data to build a standardized growth index (SGI) time-series (25-year chronology) for each of the three parts of the shell. Highly significant correlations were found between the three SGI chronologies (p < 0.001; 0.55 < τ < 0.68) of all specimens. Thus, ligament growth lines provide a new method of determining ontogenetic age and growth rate in S. solidissima. In a biogeographic approach, the shell growth performance of S. solidissima in Saint-Pierre and Miquelon was compared to those in other populations along its distribution range in order to place this population in a temporal and regional context."
https://openalex.org/W2807827931,"Background Therapeutic targeting of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway may benefit patients with advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Objectives To determine the prevalence of PIK3CA copy number gain and correlate this with the activity status of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in pre-malignant penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN) and invasive PSCC. Materials and methods Archival tissue blocks were obtained from 58 PeIN and 244 primary PSCC patients treated at St George’s Hospital. PIK3CA copy number status (CNS) was assessed by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. High-risk HPV DNA was detected with INNO-LiPA assay. p16INK4A, p-AKT and p-mTOR protein expression were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results Increased prevalence of PIK3CA copy number gain was seen in PSCC in comparison to PeIN (84/199 (42%) vs. 10/58 (17%); p = 0.0009). Analysis of the p-AKT and p-mTOR revealed a tendency to a more common expression of cytoplasmic p-AKT (p = 0.1318), nuclear p-AKT (p<0.0001) and cytoplasmic mTOR (p = 0.0006) in PeIN than PSCC. A significant association between p-AKT cytoplasmic immunoexpression and PIK3CA CNS (p = 0.0404) was found in PeIN. Conclusion Overall, PIK3CA copy number gain correlated with activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in PeIN and activation of this pathway is primarily involved in early penile carcinogenesis. Based on these results therapeutic targeting of this pathway in advanced PSCC is unlikely to produce significant clinical benefit. Future studies will need to focus on alternative therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2808020553,"Background Identifying and understanding traditional perceptions that influence newborn care practices and care-seeking behavior are crucial to developing sustainable interventions to improve neonatal health. The Zambia Chlorhexidine Application Trial (ZamCAT), a large-scale cluster randomized trial, assessed the impact of 4% chlorhexidine on neonatal mortality and omphalitis in Southern Province, Zambia. The main purpose of this post-ZamCAT qualitative study was to understand the impact of newborn care health messages on care-seeking behavior for neonates and the acceptability, knowledge, and attitudes towards chlorhexidine cord care among community members and health workers in Southern Province. Methods & findings Five focus group discussions and twenty-six in-depth interviews were conducted with mothers and health workers from ten health centers (5 rural and 5 peri-urban/urban). Community perceptions and local realities were identified as fundamental to care-seeking decisions and influenced individual participation in particular health-seeking behaviors. ZamCAT field monitors (data collectors) disseminated health messages at the time of recruitment at the health center and during subsequent home visits. Mothers noted that ZamCAT field monitors were effective in providing lessons and education on newborn care practices and participating mothers were able to share these messages with others in their communities. Although the study found no effect of chlorhexidine cord washes on neonatal mortality, community members had positive views towards chlorhexidine as they perceived that it reduced umbilical cord infections and was a beneficial alternative to traditional cord applications. Conclusion The acceptability of health initiatives, such as chlorhexidine cord application, in community settings, is dependent on community education, understanding, and engagement. Community-based approaches, such as using community-based cadres of health workers to strengthen referrals, are an acceptable and potentially effective strategy to improve care-seeking behaviors and practices."
https://openalex.org/W2808440353,"In recent years, yaoi has been increasingly popular among youth interested in Japanese media such as anime and manga. Yaoi is defined as commercial and fan-created media that thematically focus on the romantic love between two men, often in a sexually explicit way. Despite the widespread popularity of this Japanese subgenre, there is a lack of empirical studies on the motives for consuming yaoi media that analyze the full range of motives using reliable research methods. The present study aimed to explore and operationalize the motives for yaoi media consumption based on previous qualitative research (Pagliassotti, 2008). Using an online survey, 724 yaoi consumers (58% male; Mage = 30.1 years, SD = 10.4) completed the Yaoi Consumption Motives Questionnaire (YCMQ). According to confirmatory factor analyses, the bi-factor model of nine motives yielded closer fit to the data than the theoretically proposed, first-order ten-factor model and a second-order nine-factor model. The nine-factor YCMQ demonstrated strong psychometric properties in terms of factor structure, internal consistency, and measurement invariance. These results indicate that the 31-item YCMQ is an appropriate instrument to assess individuals' motives for consuming yaoi media."
https://openalex.org/W2808076939,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. The most common diagnostic method, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), can record episodes of arrhythmia from which the type and severity can be determined. The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor (P2; OSTAR Meditech Corp., New Taipei City, Taiwan) is used to measure cardiovascular pressure change with fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis to obtain heart rate frequency variability and accurate blood pressure data. We compared the diagnostic efficacy of the Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor to a 12-lead ECG (gold standard) for patients with AF. Three measurement methods were used in this study to analyze the heart index and compare the results with simultaneous 12-lead ECG: blood pressure; mean arterial pressure, which was calculated from individual blood pressure as a constant pressure; and a constant pressure of 60 mmHg. The physician used a 12-lead ECG and the Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor simultaneously. The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor used FFT analysis to diagnose AF, and the findings were compared to the 12-lead ECG readings. This unblinded clinical trial was conducted in the emergency department of Taipei Medical University Hospital. Twenty-nine subjects with AF and 33 without AF aged 25 to 97 y (mean, 63.5 y) were included. Subjects who were exposed to high-frequency surgical equipment during testing, those with cardiac pacemakers or implantable defibrillators, and pregnant women were excluded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 97%, 97%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, for method 1; 90%, 100%, 100%, and 91%, respectively, for method 2; and 100%, 94%, 94%, and 100%, respectively, for method 3. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for both methods ranged between 90% and 100%, indicating that the Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor can be effectively applied for AF detection."
