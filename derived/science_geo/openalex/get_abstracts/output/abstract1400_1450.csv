https://openalex.org/W1865658459,"Three new mesenchymal phenotypes were expressed in cultures of Swiss 3T3 and C3H/10T1/2CL8 mouse cells treated with 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. These phenotypes were characterized as contractile striated muscle cells, biochemically differentiated adipocytes and chondrocytes capable of the biosynthesis of cartilage-specific proteins. The number of muscle and fat cells which appeared in treated cultures was dependent upon the concentration of 5-azacytidine used, but the chondrocyte phenotype was not expressed frequently enough for quantitation. The differentiated cell types were only observed several days or weeks after treatment with the analog, implying that cell division was obligatory for the expression of the new phenotypes. Oncogenically transformed C3H/10T1/2CL8 cells also developed muscle cells after exposure to 5-azacytidine, but at a reduced rate when compared to the parent line. Five subclones of the 10T1/2 line which were the progeny of single cells all expressed both the muscle and fat phenotypes following 5-azacytidine treatment. The effects of the analog are therefore not due to the selection of preexisting myoblasts or adipocytes in the cell populations. Rather, it is possible that 5-azacytidine, after incorporation into DNA, causes a reversion to a more pluripotential state from which the new phenotypes subsequently differentiate."

https://openalex.org/W1989384629,"Two glycoproteins, GP-1 and GP-2, have been isolated from an extracellular membrane synthesized in cell culture by an embryonal carcinoma-derived cell line. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions have been determined. Both proteins are rich in half-cystine residues and contain approximately 12–15% carbohydrate. Antibodies have been obtained against one of the glycoproteins, GP-2, in rabbits. The antibody reacts with basement membranes from adult mouse and human kidney glomeruli and tubules, and all basement membranes tested from mouse embryonic tissues. The molecular properties of GP-2 are superficially similar to LETS protein; however, immunological and other criteria show that they are distinct proteins. The presence of LETS protein and GP-2 in basement membranes suggests that there are subtle interactions which are important in adhesion of epithelial cells to basement membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2033317965,"Messenger RNA from SL2 lymphoma cells was translated in a cell-free system in the presence of microsomal membranes. Mouse H-2Dd histocompatibility antigen was correctly assembled in the microsomal membranes, and transmembrane insertion of the nascent chain was accompanied by glycosylation and cleavage of the signal sequence. H-2Kd antigens, synthesized in vivo, comprised a transmembrane glycoprotein and an unglycosylated protein in the cytoplasm. The glycosylated forms of the H-2Dd and H-2Kd antigens were modified during intracellular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. β2-Microglobulin was also synthesized in vitro, and transfer of this protein into microsomal vesicles was accompanied by cleavage of its signal sequence. In the endoplasmic reticulum, β2-microglobulin can bind to newly synthesized H-2d glycoproteins. The mRNAs coding for β2-microglobulin and H-2Dd antigen could be separated on aqueous sucrose gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1972959987,"We have examined the proteins secreted into the growth medium by normal and transformed cells. Transformed cell lines from several mammalian species all secrete proteins in the 58,000 dalton molecular weight range. These proteins are all immunologically related and are secreted at low levels or not at all by the parental normal cell lines. Secretion of the 58K proteins occurs with either DNA or RNA virus transformation and with spontaneous transformation. The transformed cells also secrete phosphoproteins in the same size range, but these are immunologically distinct from the 58K proteins mentioned above. The sizes of the phosphoproteins are species-specific and unrelated to the transforming virus. Incubation of conditioned media from transformed cell cultures with gamma-32P-ATP labels phosphoproteins of the same sizes, indicating the presence in the media of both protein kinase and substrate. All three properties (58K protein, phosphoprotein, in vitro phosphorylation) are closely correlated with transformation in cells transformed by temperature-sensitive viruses. The biological implications of these results remain unknown, but the results may be relevant to recent data on the (phospho)proteins and protein kinase encoded by RNA tumor viruses and the molecular basis of the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1980613817,"Detergent-disrupted virions of Moloney murine leukemia virus synthesize a 9 kbp double-stranded infectious DNA. It contains mainly full-length, single-stranded DNA, and its infectivity and size are insensitive to digestion by the single-strand-specific S1 nuclease. Analysis of fragmentation of the DNA using restriction endonucleases has shown that it is indistinguishable from the linear double-stranded DNA synthesized in infected cells. On the basis of the positions of the cleavage sites for a number of enzymes, the 9 kbp DNA has a 575 base direct terminal repetition. It is longer than the viral RNA at both ends, evidently due to repetitive copying of segments of the RNA. Virions also synthesize an 8.4 kbp double-stranded circular DNA that lacks one copy of the terminal repetition, as well as viral DNA longer than 9 kbp. The enzymatic machinery in the virions of retroviruses therefore appears to be responsible for all the steps involved in making fully double-stranded linear and one form of circular DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1522431992,"Translation of total mRNA in heterologous protein-synthesizing systems is often employed as an indirect means of assessing relative mRNA concentrations. However, it is well known that the efficiency of translation of specific mRNAs differs. One such example is the poor translational efficiency of conalbumin mRNA relative to ovalbumin mRNA. In this report we have studied the translation of conalbumin and ovalbumin mRNAs in crude mRNA preparations and with highly purified mRNA preparations. We find that treatment of RNA with methylmercury hydroxide prior to translation improves the translational efficiency of both mRNAs and preferentially improves translational efficiency of conalbumin mRNA to the point where it more correctly reflects the relative concentration of these two mRNAs in crude mRNA preparations. Conalbumin mRNA is also a poor template for the synthesis of full length cDNA synthesis by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and treatment of this mRNA with methylmercury hydroxide increases the size of DNA sequences synthesized. We conclude that treatment with methylmercury hydroxide produces a partial denaturation of mRNA complexed with either itself or with other RNA molecules and results in more efficient utilization in both translational assays and DNA polymerization reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2113424916,"We have purified a cDNA fragment complementary to the mRNA coding for one of the major urinary proteins (MUPs) synthesized in the mouse liver. Using this cDNA as a hybridization probe, we have shown that the level of MUP mRNA is lower in the livers of females and castrated males than in those of males. The addition of testosterone to females and castrated males results in an increase in the concentration of the mRNA to levels found in males. There are approximately 15 genes per haploid genome coding for the MUPs; this allows a possible new interpretation of some of the genetic data concerning regulation of levels of the different MUPs in the urine ( Szoka and Paigen, 1978 Szoka P.R. Paigen K. Regulation of mouse major urinary protein production by the MUP-A gene. Genetics. 1978; 90: 597-612 PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, we have shown that mouse MUP and rat α2u-globulin mRNA share common sequences, but that there are surprising differences in gene number and regulation of the genes in these two closely related animals."

https://openalex.org/W1519994409,"Previous studies have demonstrated that human plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2 M) possesses a single subunit chain (Mr approximately 185,000) when incubated with dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol at 37 degrees C and analyzed by dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The present study details the observation that heating alpha 2 M to 90 degrees C under identical conditions produces at least two additional polypeptide chains, termed bands II and III, with apparent molecular weights of 125,00 and 62,000. The generation of these fragments is enhanced by increasing the time of incubation. The appearance of band II composition of the buffer, dodecyl sulfate concentrations, or alpha 2 M protein concentration in the incubation mixture. The electrophoretic bands II and III of alpha 2 M have dissimilar 125I-labeled tryptic peptide digests and also differ in their amino acid composition. The heat-induced fragmentation of alpha 2M is not affected by the inclusion of a variety of low molecular weight protease inhibitors, suggesting that the appearance of bands II and III is not due to enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. When the subunit chain of alpha 2M is first cleaved by trypsin into the previously described Mr = 85,000 derivative, neither band II nor III material, nor other lower molecular weight products are generated by heat treatment. Furthermore, preincubation of alpha 2M with methylamine prevents fragmentation of the subunit chain. These results indicate that these fragments are neither pre-existing subunits of alpha 2M nor derivatives formed prior to treatment for gel analysis. These data provide evidence that a covalent bond in the alpha 2M molecule is unusually susceptible to heat-induced cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W1603690551,"A general method is described for assessing the degradation of proteins metabolized by lysosomal mechanisms. The method depends on the lysosomal trapping of sucrose which is covalently bound to the protein of interest and thus caried into the lysosome with it. The validity of the method was demonstrated in vitro in studies of the catabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by cultured fibroblasts. Sucrose-derivatized LDL was not distinguished from 125I-LDL by fibroblasts, either in terms of surface binding or rate of uptake. 14C from [14C]sucrose-LDL accumulated in the cells as predicted; very little appeared in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction of the medium (2% of total uptake). 14C-labeled metabolites in the cells (modal apparent Mr = 1000-2000) were separated from undegraded LDL by gel filtration. LDL degradation calculated from the 14C metabolites accumulating intracellularly was in excellent agreement with that calculated from paired studies using 125I-LDL. Finally, the validity of the method was demonstrated in vivo using asialofetuin, a protein previously shown to be selectively taken up and degraded by the liver. In principle, the method described should be applicable to the study of the sites of degradation of any of the plasma proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1516081887,"Despite extensive structural dissimilarities, iron . bleomycin complexes and heme-containing oxygenases display remarkable similarities in binding oxygen antagonists and in spectral properties deriving from bound iron. Fe(II)-bleomycin reversibly forms a complex with either CO or isocyanide (lambda max = 384 and 497 nm, respectively), either of which interfere with its oxygen-dependent cleavage of DNA. A similar but paramagnetic complex forms with NO (lambda max = 470 nm; AN = 24 G). In contrast, cyanide enhances bleomycin activity against DNA. Complexes of bleomycin and FE(III), formed either by direct association or by autoxidation of the Fe(II) . bleomycin complex, exhibit indistinguishable EPR and visible spectra, which change characteristically with pH. At neutral pH, Fe(III) . bleomycin is a low spin complex (g = 2.45, 2.18, 1.89; lambda max = 365, 384 nm) and, at low pH, it is a high spin rhombic complex (geff = 9.4, 4.3; lambda max = 430 nm). These complexes are interconvertible (pK 4.3). Fe(II) . bleomycin oxidation, although reversible by spectral criteria, is accompanied by drug inactivation unless DNA is present."

https://openalex.org/W1491264243,"The periodic banding pattern of stained collagen fibrils observed in the electron microscopic can be correlated with the charge distribution deduced from the amino acid sequence. Earlier work used alpha 1 chain sequence data only. The present study incorporates alpha 2 as well as alpha 1 sequence data, so that the complete distribution of charged residues is used. Correlation is improved if it is supposed that the extrahelical terminal regions are contracted. The optimal value of the periodicity, D, (previously 232.3 +/- 0.5 residues using alpha 1 data only), is now 234.2 +/- 0.5 residues, assuming uniform spacing of residues in the helical body of the molecule. This value agrees better with values obtained by others from analyses of interactions between molecules, using sequence data alone. Using the improved value of D, the relative axial locations of the charged residues in the fibril are displayed. In this way, the charged residues contributing to each band in the fibril staining pattern can be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1678772685,"The reaction of Fe(II) . bleomycin with O2 to yield Fe(III) . bleomycin has been resolved into two kinetic events by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The first event is first order with respect to both bleomycin and O2 and may be regarded as a second order reaction (k = 6.1 x 10(3) M-1s-1 at 2 degrees C). The first product has no EPR spectrum. The optical spectrum resembles those of Fe(II) . bleomycin complexes with CO, NO, and ethyl isocyanide. We propose that the first product is an Fe(II) . bleomycin . O2 complex. The second kinetic event is first order with respect to the first accumulated product (k = 0.11 s-1 at 2 degrees C) and independent of oxygen concentration. The product of this reaction is indistinguishable from Fe(III) . bleomycin by optical and EPR spectroscopy."

The ex- tent of the reaction was followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.8, and the reaction products were separated by column chromatography on car- boxymethyl-cellulose and Sephadex following which the BP peptides were characterized by amino acid anal- ysis and partial sequence analysis. Components one and three were degraded with the initial site of cleav- age at the Phe-Phe bond at residues 42 and 43 to gen- erate peptides l-42 and 43-169. With more prolonged exposure to enzyme, peptide l-42 was degraded to form peptide l-36 and peptide 43-169 was degraded to form peptides 43-88, 89-169, and 92-169 as well as smaller amounts of peptides 43-89 and 43-91. Pepstatin in- hibited the initial cleavage of BP by cathepsin D. Mi- croheterogeneous components two, four, and five showed similar patterns of fragmentation to yield bands with the migration of peptides l-36, 43-88, and 89-169 or 92-169. Peptides 43-169, 89-169, and 92-169 had a decreasing cathodal migration progressing from components one to five. These findings demonstrate the sequential but limited cleavage of BP by brain cathepsin D. The effects of the enzyme on the micro- heterogeneous components of the molecule in forming fragments of different charge characteristics suggest that the processes regulating microheterogeneity may influence the outcome of degradation of BP by brain cathepsin D and possibly other proteinases. Myelin encephalitogenic or basic protein, which accounts for approximately 30% of myelin proteins in the central nerv- ous system (CNS) (l), has a monomeric molecular weight of 18,500 and consists of 169 amino acid residues (2,3).

https://openalex.org/W1539598570,"Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of rat serum demonstrated considerably increased serum concentrations of at least ten different proteins during turpentine-induced inflammation. One protein, which moved during electrophoresis like an alpha 1 globulin, showed a particularly large increase. This protein was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Sephadex G-100, and concanavalin A-Sepharose, and finally disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. It has a molecular weight of 56,000 determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. An apparent molecular weight of 68,000 was estimated for the reduced protein by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel plus sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that the native protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain. It has an E2801%, 1 cm of 5.2, an isoelectric pH of 4.7, and contains 19% carbohydrate. The protein does not inhibit bovine trypsin or chymotrypsin. Its physical properties and amino acid composition distinguish this protein from all other rat serum proteins hitherto characterized. During acute inflammation, induced 25 h previously, rats incorporated 20 times more [14C]leucine into this particular protein than did normal rats. However, incorporation into total serum protein during acute inflammation increased only slightly. Regardless of whether inflammation was induced by surgical injury or by a subcutaneous turpentine injection, within 48 h the serum concentration of this major acute-phase protein rose from the normal value of 0.46 g/liter to a maximum value of 7.2 g/liter, which constituted 10% of the total serum protein."
https://openalex.org/W2139572867,"Abstract It is known that in the vesicular stomatitis virus genome, the N gene and the NS gene are adjacent and found in the orientation 3′-N-NS-5′ on the single-stranded negative-sense genome RNA. The junction between the two genes is the site of several processes during synthesis of mRNAs from the genome RNA template—specifically, polyadenylation and termination of N mRNA synthesis and the beginning of NS mRNA synthesis, with capping and methylation of the NS mRNA. This paper presents the primary structure of the intercistronic region together with the flanking sequences in the two genes. This nucleotide sequence was determined by copying N mRNA into a double-stranded DNA, digesting the DNA with restriction nucleases and isolating a DNA fragment corresponding to a sequence close to but distinct from the 3′ terminus of N mRNA. This fragment was then annealed to genome RNA and used as a primer for reverse transcription through the end of the N gene and into the start of the NS gene. The sequence of this complementary DNA, and thus of the genome RNA across the junction, was obtained by the dideoxynucleoside triphosphate chain termination method. The structure of the junction (as the genome RNA strand), proceeding 3′ to 5′, consists of N gene heteropolymeric mRNA coding sequences, followed by 3′-UUUUUUUGA-5′, followed by NS gene heteropolymeric mRNA coding sequences. The oligo(U) tract is thought to be involved in initiating synthesis of the 3′ terminal poly(A) tract of N mRNA. Several other nearby sequences may be involved as control or signal entities in processing events. The only part of the junction not representedin the mature mRNAs is the sequence of 5′-CU-3′, which is complementary to the sequence 3′-GA-5′ shown above."
https://openalex.org/W87107736,"A highly purified cytosolic azoreductase isolated from the livers of 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats has been characterized with respect to its electron- accepting and -donating properties, the mechanism of its inhibition by dicumarol, and its similarity to DT- diaphorase. Anaerobic titration of the enzyme with NADPH as the electron donor indicates that each mole of enzyme can accept 4 reducing eq, or 2 electrons/mol of enzyme-bound FAD. The purified azoreductase cat- alyzes the reduction of methyl red and under anaerobic conditions, 2 mol of NADPH are required for the reduc- tion of 1 mol of methyl red which is consistent with the expected stoichiometry for reduction of the azo linkage of methyl red by NADPH. Dicumarol strongly inhibits the azoreductase-catalyzed reduction of methyl red. Spectrophotometric measurements indicate that dicu- marol binds to the purified azoreductase at a ratio of approximately 1 mol of dicumarol to 1 mol of enzyme- bound FAD. Dicumarol is a competitive inhibitor of methyl red reduction with respect to NADPH and ap- pears to inhibit the reaction by interfering with elec- tron transfer from NADPH to enzyme-bound FAD. Pu- rified rat azoreductase from rat liver appears to be identical with rat DT-diaphorase. This conclusion is based on the co-purification of both enzyme activities as well as the apparent homogeneity of the final enzyme preparation. Other properties of both enzymes are also consistent with this conclusion. The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methyl red (2’-carboxy-4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene) is localized mainly in the liver 105,000 x g supernatant fraction. This azoreductase activity can be induced 7- to lo-fold by pretreat- ment of rats with 3-methylcholanthrene (1, 2). We have re- cently reported the purification to apparent homogeneity of an azoreductase from the liver 105,000 x g supernatant frac- tion of 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats (3,4). The purified azoreductase has an apparent molecular weight of 52,000 as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Polyacryl- amide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gives a minimal molecular weight of 30,000 suggesting that the native enzyme exists as a dimer. The enzyme is a flavoprotein and contains 2 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme (4). This azoreductase actively catalyzes the reduction of methyl red and a structure activity study revealed that the 2’-carboxyl * The"

Attachment of sufficient quantities of PEG to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase substantially reduces immunological recognition and clearance of the conjugated enzyme in mice. The modified enzyme demonstrates altered catalytic properties such as shifts in the pH and temperature optima, an increase in the Michaelis-Menten constant, and a lowered Vmax in comparison with the native enzyme. PEG-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase has increased resistance to proteolytic digestion, particularly when in the presence of cinnamate, a competitive inhibitor, while the native enzyme is rapidly inactivated. In the ultracentrifuge PEG-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase exhibits a lower sedimentation rate than the unmodified enzyme, despite the fact that it is much larger. The electrophoretic mobility of PEG-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase is greatly decreased in comparison to the unmodified enzyme. PEG-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase had a much longer blood-circulating life in mice, both initially and after a number of injections, than did the native enzyme. PEG-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was a good immunogen but a poor antigen in mice and rabbits, that is, it readily induced antibody formation, but reacted poorly in vitro with the antibodies that were formed against it."

In addition, a number of congenital birth defects, including congenital nephrosis, severe Rh-he- molytic disease, and several open neural tube defects are associated with abnormally elevated concentrations of AFP in the maternal and fetal circulation and amniotic fluid (10-12). These striking and reproducible increases in the production of AFP in fetal abnormalities, in liver regenerative diseases, and in carcinomas of the liver and germ cells in humans has generated interest in the mechanism of control of the expres- sion of AFP. Recent studies by Tamaoki and his co-workers (13,14) have used cell-free translation assays to demonstrate that the rate of synthesis of a-fetoprotein in fetal and neonatal mouse liver is related to the concentration of translatable AFP mRNA. Taking this analysis one step further, Innis and Miller (15) reported the isolation of rat AFP mRNA. Complementary DNA to the AFP mRNA was used in hybridization kinetic experiments to show that the actual amount of AFP mRNA in adult liver mRNA was less than 1% of that in hepatoma cells. These studies imply that the control of AFP synthesis occurs at the level of mRNA transcription or processing, or both. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require large amounts of specific hybridization probes to the a-fetoprotein gene, as well as intimate knowledge about its structural or- ganization in the genome. Toward this end, we have con- structed chimeric plasmids containing portions of the mouse AFP mRNA sequence, and used them to identify three EcoRI fragments of mouse genomic DNA which encode in a discon- tinuous manner the single copy AFP gene. fluid.

PROCEDURES Purification of a-Fetoprotein-Amniotic fluid, pooled from 16- to Id-day mouse fetuses, was subjected to 35 to 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 70% pellet was dialyzed against 50 mu Tris.HCl (pH 7.5) and electrophoresed through a nondenaturing 7% polyacryl- amide gel (16). The AFP band was identified by a comparison to fetal and adult serum protein markers, extracted and concentrated by ethanol precipitation (16). This material was used to raise antisera to AFP by bimonthly injections into a rabbit. The rabbit antisera were regularly tested for anti-AFP activity by Ouchterlony analysis (17) against purified AFP, amniotic fluid, and adult mouse serum. Preparation of RNA-Yolk sac and livers, obtained from 16- to 18-day-old Swiss mouse fetuses were frozen in liquid Na. Poly(A) RNA was prepared by phenol extraction of total cellular RNA (18) followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (19). The RNA was fractionated on an 8 to 25% sucrose gradient in 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), which was centrifuged at 29,000 rpm for 22 h in a Beckman SW40 rotor.

Lib. on April 25, 2017 Messenger RNA for the oncofetal protein cu-fetopro- tein was isolated from yolk sacs of 16- to H-day-old mouse embryos. This RNA was used as a template to synthesize full-length double-stranded DNA containing predominantly a-fetoprotein coding sequences. Chi- merit plasmids containing the double-stranded DNA were constructed in two ways. First, molecular linkers containing the recognition site for the restriction en- donuclease HindI were ligated to the blunted ends of the DNA, and following cleavage with HindIII, the re- combinant molecules were ligated to the single Hind111 site in the plasmid vehicle pBR322. Second, internal Pst I fragments of the double-stranded DNA were ligated to the single Pst I site of pBR322. Following transfor- mation of the host Escherichiu coli x1776, colonies con- taining those chimeric plasmids which had incorpo- rated n-fetoprotein sequences were identified by selec- tive hybridization and arrest translation procedures. Two cloned sequences derived from the 5’ and 3’ regions of the mRNA were used as hybridization probes to detect the presence of the a-fetoprotein gene within a two-dimensional fingerprint of mouse genomic DNA cleaved with EcoRI, an enzyme which does not cleave within the messenger RNA sequence. The detection of 3 EcoRI fragments demonstrates that the single cu-fe- toprotein gene must be represented discontinuously in the mouse genome, with at least two intervening se- quences. a-fetoprotein mammalian development B.

These association constants are slightly weaker than the corresponding association constants for binding to human albumin. Competition experiments failed to show preferential binding of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fluorescence quenching was used to determine 11 ligand-ligand and ligand-tryptophanyl residue distances. Each of these 11 calculated distances (ranging from 19 A to 32 A) was within 5 A of the corresponding distances measured previously for human albumin (Berde, C.B., Hudson, B.S., Simoni, R.D., and Sklar, L.A. 1979, J.

Anti-H-Y antiserum in the presence of complement was cytotoxic only for gonadal cells expressing their own H-Y antigen, but not to ovarian cells loaded with H-Y antigen. H-Y antigen was co-redistributed with β2-microglobulin on newborn testicular cells, but some residual H-Y activity was found on similarly treated testis cells from 15 day old rats. After β2-microglobulin redistribution, testis cells maintained their binding capacity for exogenous H-Y antigen prepared from epididymal fluid or Daudi cell culture supernatants. This result suggests that exogenous H-Y antigen is bound via a gonad-specific receptor which is independent of β2-microglobulin and that this type of binding for H-Y antigen is different from the β2-m-associated expression of H-Y antigen on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1546355883,"A new form of cytoplasmic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C.1.1.1.49) was purified from rat liver by protamine sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography with diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and affinity chromatography with Cibacron blue agarose and NADP agarose. This form of the enzyme has a specific activity of over 600 units/mg of protein and gives essentially a single band by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The form of the enzyme isolated by this purification method is 3 times more active than the form purified from liver by previously reported procedures. The relative mass of this pure glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme was determined by disc gel electrophoresis to be 269,000. This high activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme, after inactivation by reaction with palmityl-CoA, was no longer precipitated by specific rabbit and goat antisera to this purified enzyme. Thus, the possibility still exists that starved fat-refed animals contain glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme protein in an inactivated form no longer detectable by either enzyme activity or immunoprecipitation."
https://openalex.org/W1534224401,"An improved purification procedure for the carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) of cohesive Polysphondylium pallidum cells has been devised. The procedure uses extraction of cells with lactose-containing buffer followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography of the redissolved precipitate on a column of acid-treated Sepharose 6B. All hemagglutination activity is adsorbed to the column and recoveries are about 70% of the activity of the starting cell lysate. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the protein obtained with this procedure resolved three subunits with molecular weights of 26,500 (A), 26,000 (B), and 25,000 (C). Three species are resolved by isoelectric focusing with apparent pI values of 6.4 (I), 7.3 (II), and 7.5 (III) which contain Subunits A, B, and C in the following ratios: I, B:C at 2:1; II, A:B at 2:1, and III, A:B at 1:2. All three isoforms agglutinate rabbit and human type O erythrocytes and are thus isolectins. Isoforms II and III are separated from Isoform I by galactose-gradient elution of the Sepharose 6B column. Isoforms II and III aggregate extensively (nonamers and multiples thereof), but reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol reverses this process yielding a single species of Mr = 73,000 (trimer). Isoform I exists as trimers and hexamers and reduction has no effect on this distribution. Amino acid compositions and tryptic peptide maps of S-[14C]carboxymethyl-isolectins indicate that Subunits A and B are very similar and may represent the same peptide chain, while Subunit C is a peptide quite distinct from A and B."
https://openalex.org/W1501347691,"The rates of oxidation of several goitrogens by lactoperoxidase and the rates of inactivation of lactoperoxidase by the same goitrogens have been measured. The influence of iodide on both reactions has also been evaluated. It has been shown by us that iodide acts catalytically in regulating lactoperoxidase activity at pH 8.8. The rate data have been analyzed by a computer program which solves the differential equations for the above mentioned reactions. From this computer analysis we have been able to obtain binding constants of the goitrogens and inactivation rate constants of lactoperoxidase. Iodide was shown to inhibit goitrogenic activity either by increasing the rate of drug oxidation or by reducing the rate of enzyme inactivation, or both, depending on the particular drug. Iodide had little or no effect on the goitrogen-binding constants. We have also shown that the relative rates of enzyme inactivation can be correlated with the potency of the goitrogen as an antithyroid drug."
https://openalex.org/W1536757979,"The expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was infestigated in a cloned cell culture derived from Morris hepatoma 7777, which shows a density-dependent variation in the AFP synthesis rate. The rate of secretion of AFP was found to be governed by the level of cytoplasmic mRNAAFP. Saturation hybridization of pulse-labeled RNA to excess cloned cDNAAFP was used to illustrate quantitatively how mRNAAFP is regulated in these tumor cells. It was found that the mRNAAFP level is primarily determined by its rate of transcription and mRNAAFP declines to 40% of its maximum level, and it accumulates at 20% of its maximum rate. The half-life of mRNAAFP was found to be 40 h, 5 to 6 times that of poly(A)-containing RNA. This difference in stability, in cells doubling every 20 h, results in a 2 1/2-fold increase in the fraction of mRNAAFP above that expected from the relative transcription rate of mRNAAFP. During maximal synthesis of AFP, mRNAAFP accumulates in the cytoplasm at a rate 25 times greater than an average middle abundance mRNA and 1000 times greater than the average low abundance mRNA. These results and the relatively high translational efficiency of mRNAAFP explain how cells can optimize production of an abundant protein."

The TAMM-labeled specimens reveal striking bright spots in the scanning transmission electron microscope which arise from clustering. Measurements of mass show increases consistent with the addition of four mercury atoms or one platinum atom, respectively, to each coat protein."

https://openalex.org/W2089815910,Regenerating optic axons of goldfish were loaded with [3H]RNA by injecting [3H]uridine into the eye and allowing time for the radioactivity to be delivered to the optic tectum. The axons were subsequently removed from the tecta by cutting the optic nerve and allowing the optic axons in the tectum to degenerate. Analysis of tectal [3H]RNA by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a selective loss of tritiated 4S RNA and not ribosomal RNA from the denervated tecta. These results support the hypothesis that regenerating optic axons of goldfish grow back into the tectum carrying 4C but not ribosomal RNA.
https://openalex.org/W1536184381,"The conformations of every C alpha H-C beta H2 moiety of the peptide gramicidin S are reported. Internal rotation occurs, but distinct preferences for one side chain rotamer, greater than 80%, are found for the D-phenylalanine and ornithine residues. Leucine and valine exhibit more extensive averaging while proline is shown to be at least 90% in the Ramachandran B conformation. The data are consistent with the coexistence of many tertiary conformations of gramicidin S; the statistical weights of the twelve major tertiary conformations consistent with the rotamer populations are reported. The relative statistical weights of the tertiary conformers depend upon temperature and solvent. A comparison of the conclusions from this publication and conformations derived by energy minimization procedures is made. Partial agreement was found, but the calculations have not yet predicted the wealth of coexisting tertiary conformations nor accounted for the subtle effects of solvent. It is proposed that a more complete picture of the conformational dynamics of gramicidin S and other peptides will result from calculations which use as a basis the extensive data reported here."

https://openalex.org/W1598135167,"Biosynthesis of specifically deuterated molecules and difference scalar decoupling permitted an analysis of all C alpha-C beta spin systems of gramicidin S. Proof is presented that proton magnetic resonance spectra obtained by difference scalar decoupling yield not only spectral assignments and simplification but also accurate chemicals shifts and scalar coupling constants. The variations in (3J alpha beta) and in proton chemical shifts at temperatures over the range of -54 degrees -+66 degrees C are consistent with the internal rotation around the C alpha-C beta bonds of Val1, Orn2, Leu3, and Phe4 residues discovered using carbon 13 spectroscopy. The value (3J alpha beta) = 1.5 Hz for the proline residue is consistent with there being only one C alpha-C beta conformer. This is supported by the small temperature dependence of (3J alpha beta). However, it cannot be rigorously excluded that oscillation between a major and a minor C alpha-C beta conformation occurs for proline."
https://openalex.org/W1610815582,Trans-stimulation of glycine uptake by cellular glycine in Ehrlich cells is a Na+-dependent phenomenon. In contrast trans-stimulated methionine or leucine uptake is Na+-independent. Trans-stimulated uptake of glycine does not show any characteristics of an ex change process but rather appears to be due to changes in membrane potential which occur as a result of a net Na+-dependent loss of cellular amino acids. Trans-stimulated influx of glycine occurs during the time of net loss of cellular glycine and is absent when the cellular amino acid level is at steady or when the cell is depolarized. Exchange of leucine or methionine occurs when the amino acid level is at steady state and it is not directly affected by depolarizing agents such as gramicidin.
https://openalex.org/W2062606168,Electron microscopic analysis of the DNA product synthesized by detergent-disrupted preparations of Rous sarcoma virus in vitro revealed the presence of several interesting molecular forms including covalently closed circular DNA. The identification of such circular DNA indicates that virions of retroviruses contain all the components necessary to facilitate the complete synthesis of mature forms of viral DNA and therefore provide a useful system to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in their synthesis.
