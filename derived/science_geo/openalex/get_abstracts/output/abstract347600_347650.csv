https://openalex.org/W2142046859,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer allows trans-acting factors present in the mammalian oocyte to reprogram somatic cell nuclei to an undifferentiated state. We show that four factors ( OCT4, SOX2, NANOG , and LIN28 ) are sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells. These induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. Such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W2069440689,"Whole genome expression profiles are widely used to discover molecular subtypes of diseases. A remaining challenge is to identify the correspondence or commonality of subtypes found in multiple, independent data sets generated on various platforms. While model-based supervised learning is often used to make these connections, the models can be biased to the training data set and thus miss inherent, relevant substructure in the test data. Here we describe an unsupervised subclass mapping method (SubMap), which reveals common subtypes between independent data sets. The subtypes within a data set can be determined by unsupervised clustering or given by predetermined phenotypes before applying SubMap. We define a measure of correspondence for subtypes and evaluate its significance building on our previous work on gene set enrichment analysis. The strength of the SubMap method is that it does not impose the structure of one data set upon another, but rather uses a bi-directional approach to highlight the common substructures in both. We show how this method can reveal the correspondence between several cancer-related data sets. Notably, it identifies common subtypes of breast cancer associated with estrogen receptor status, and a subgroup of lymphoma patients who share similar survival patterns, thus improving the accuracy of a clinical outcome predictor."
https://openalex.org/W2086239621,"TOR (Target of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein kinase and a central controller of cell growth. TOR is found in two functionally and structurally distinct multiprotein complexes termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) based proteomic strategy to identify new mammalian TOR (mTOR) binding proteins. We report the identification of Proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40) and the hypothetical protein Q6MZQ0/FLJ14213/CAE45978 as new mTOR binding proteins. PRAS40 binds mTORC1 via Raptor, and is an mTOR phosphorylation substrate. PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 autophosphorylation and mTORC1 kinase activity toward eIF-4E binding protein (4E-BP) and PRAS40 itself. HeLa cells in which PRAS40 was knocked down were protected against induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and cycloheximide. Rapamycin failed to mimic the pro-apoptotic effect of PRAS40, suggesting that PRAS40 mediates apoptosis independently of its inhibitory effect on mTORC1. Q6MZQ0 is structurally similar to proline rich protein 5 (PRR5) and was therefore named PRR5-Like (PRR5L). PRR5L binds specifically to mTORC2, via Rictor and/or SIN1. Unlike other mTORC2 members, PRR5L is not required for mTORC2 integrity or kinase activity, but dissociates from mTORC2 upon knock down of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2. Hyperactivation of mTOR by TSC1/2 knock down enhanced apoptosis whereas PRR5L knock down reduced apoptosis. PRR5L knock down reduced apoptosis also in mTORC2 deficient cells. The above suggests that mTORC2-dissociated PRR5L may promote apoptosis when mTOR is hyperactive. Thus, PRAS40 and PRR5L are novel mTOR-associated proteins that control the balance between cell growth and cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2100803874,"Is there an objective, biological basis for the experience of beauty in art? Or is aesthetic experience entirely subjective? Using fMRI technique, we addressed this question by presenting viewers, naïve to art criticism, with images of masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance sculpture. Employing proportion as the independent variable, we produced two sets of stimuli: one composed of images of original sculptures; the other of a modified version of the same images. The stimuli were presented in three conditions: observation, aesthetic judgment, and proportion judgment. In the observation condition, the viewers were required to observe the images with the same mind-set as if they were in a museum. In the other two conditions they were required to give an aesthetic or proportion judgment on the same images. Two types of analyses were carried out: one which contrasted brain response to the canonical and the modified sculptures, and one which contrasted beautiful vs. ugly sculptures as judged by each volunteer. The most striking result was that the observation of original sculptures, relative to the modified ones, produced activation of the right insula as well as of some lateral and medial cortical areas (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus and prefrontal areas). The activation of the insula was particularly strong during the observation condition. Most interestingly, when volunteers were required to give an overt aesthetic judgment, the images judged as beautiful selectively activated the right amygdala, relative to those judged as ugly. We conclude that, in observers naïve to art criticism, the sense of beauty is mediated by two non-mutually exclusive processes: one based on a joint activation of sets of cortical neurons, triggered by parameters intrinsic to the stimuli, and the insula (objective beauty); the other based on the activation of the amygdala, driven by one's own emotional experiences (subjective beauty)."
https://openalex.org/W2117583440,"Post-translational modifications of histones play crucial roles in the genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression from chromatin. Studies in mammals and yeast have found conserved modifications at some residues of histones as well as non-conserved modifications at some other sites. Although plants have been excellent systems to study epigenetic regulation, and histone modifications are known to play critical roles, the histone modification sites and patterns in plants are poorly defined. In the present study we have used mass spectrometry in combination with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and phospho-peptide enrichment to identify histone modification sites in the reference plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We found not only modifications at many sites that are conserved in mammalian and yeast cells, but also modifications at many sites that are unique to plants. These unique modifications include H4 K20 acetylation (in contrast to H4 K20 methylation in non-plant systems), H2B K6, K11, K27 and K32 acetylation, S15 phosphorylation and K143 ubiquitination, and H2A K144 acetylation and S129, S141 and S145 phosphorylation, and H2A.X S138 phosphorylation. In addition, we found that lysine 79 of H3 which is highly conserved and modified by methylation and plays important roles in telomeric silencing in non-plant systems, is not modified in Arabidopsis. These results suggest distinctive histone modification patterns in plants and provide an invaluable foundation for future studies on histone modifications in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2077055706,"Background The blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) control cerebral/spinal cord homeostasis by selective transport of molecules and cells from the systemic compartment. In the spinal cord and brain of both ALS patients and animal models, infiltration of T-cell lymphocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, and IgG deposits have been observed that may have a critical role in motor neuron damage. Additionally, increased levels of albumin and IgG have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid in ALS patients. These findings suggest altered barrier permeability in ALS. Recently, we showed disruption of the BBB and BSCB in areas of motor neuron degeneration in the brain and spinal cord in G93A SOD1 mice modeling ALS at both early and late stages of disease using electron microscopy. Examination of capillary ultrastructure revealed endothelial cell degeneration, which, along with astrocyte alteration, compromised the BBB and BSCB. However, the effect of these alterations upon barrier function in ALS is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the functional competence of the BSCB in G93A mice at different stages of disease. Methodology/Principal Findings Evans Blue (EB) dye was intravenously injected into ALS mice at early or late stage disease. Vascular leakage and the condition of basement membranes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes were investigated in cervical and lumbar spinal cords using immunohistochemistry. Results showed EB leakage in spinal cord microvessels from all G93A mice, indicating dysfunction in endothelia and basement membranes and confirming our previous ultrastructural findings on BSCB disruption. Additionally, downregulation of Glut-1 and CD146 expressions in the endothelial cells of the BSCB were found which may relate to vascular leakage. Conclusions/Significance Results suggest that the BSCB is compromised in areas of motor neuron degeneration in ALS mice at both early and late stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2042777577,"Background Influenza A viruses generate an extreme genetic diversity through point mutation and gene segment exchange, resulting in many new strains that emerge from the animal reservoirs, among which was the recent highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. This genetic diversity also endows these viruses with a dynamic adaptability to their habitats, one result being the rapid selection of genomic variants that resist the immune responses of infected hosts. With the possibility of an influenza A pandemic, a critical need is a vaccine that will recognize and protect against any influenza A pathogen. One feasible approach is a vaccine containing conserved immunogenic protein sequences that represent the genotypic diversity of all current and future avian and human influenza viruses as an alternative to current vaccines that address only the known circulating virus strains. Methodology/Principal Findings Methodologies for large-scale analysis of the evolutionary variability of the influenza A virus proteins recorded in public databases were developed and used to elucidate the amino acid sequence diversity and conservation of 36,343 sequences of the 11 viral proteins of the recorded virus isolates of the past 30 years. Technologies were also applied to identify the conserved amino acid sequences from isolates of the past decade, and to evaluate the predicted human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) supertype-restricted class I and II T-cell epitopes of the conserved sequences. Fifty-five (55) sequences of 9 or more amino acids of the polymerases (PB2, PB1, and PA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix 1 (M1) proteins were completely conserved in at least 80%, many in 95 to 100%, of the avian and human influenza A virus isolates despite the marked evolutionary variability of the viruses. Almost all (50) of these conserved sequences contained putative supertype HLA class I or class II epitopes as predicted by 4 peptide-HLA binding algorithms. Additionally, data of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) include 29 experimentally identified HLA class I and II T-cell epitopes present in 14 of the conserved sequences. Conclusions/Significance This study of all reported influenza A virus protein sequences, avian and human, has identified 55 highly conserved sequences, most of which are predicted to have immune relevance as T-cell epitopes. This is a necessary first step in the design and analysis of a polyepitope, pan-influenza A vaccine. In addition to the application described herein, these technologies can be applied to other pathogens and to other therapeutic modalities designed to attack DNA, RNA, or protein sequences critical to pathogen function."
https://openalex.org/W1966912859,"Agents that interfere with tumoral immune tolerance may be useful to prevent or treat cancer. Brassinin is a phytoalexin, a class of natural products derived from plants that includes the widely known compound resveratrol. Brassinin has been demonstrated to have chemopreventive activity in preclinical models but the mechanisms underlying its anticancer properties are unknown. Here, we show that brassinin and a synthetic derivative 5-bromo-brassinin (5-Br-brassinin) are bioavailable inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a pro-toleragenic enzyme that drives immune escape in cancer. Like other known IDO inhibitors, both of these compounds combined with chemotherapy to elicit regression of autochthonous mammary gland tumors in MMTV-Neu mice. Furthermore, growth of highly aggressive melanoma isograft tumors was suppressed by single agent treatment with 5-Br-brassinin. This response to treatment was lost in athymic mice, indicating a requirement for active host T-cell immunity, and in IDO-null knockout mice, providing direct genetic evidence that IDO inhibition is essential to the antitumor mechanism of action of 5-Br-brassinin. The natural product brassinin thus provides the structural basis for a new class of compounds with in vivo anticancer activity that is mediated through the inhibition of IDO."
https://openalex.org/W1981760485,"Techniques developed for the in vitro reproduction of three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic tissue will be valuable for investigating changes in cell function in tissues and for fabricating cell/matrix composites for applications in tissue engineering techniques. In this study, we show that the simple application of a continuous strain to a fibrin gel facilitates the development of fibril alignment and bundle-like structures in the fibrin gel in the direction of the applied strain. Myoblasts cultured in this gel also exhibited well-aligned cell patterning in a direction parallel to the direction of the strain. Interestingly, the direction of cell proliferation was identical to that of cell alignment. Finally, the oriented cells formed linear groups that were aligned parallel to the direction of the strain and replicated the native skeletal muscle cell patterning. In addition, vein endothelial cells formed a linear, aligned vessel-like structure in this system. Thus, the system enables the in vitro reproduction of 3D aligned cell sets replicating biological tissue patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2137332610,"The carnivorous plants of the genus Nepenthes, widely distributed in the Asian tropics, rely mostly on nutrients derived from arthropods trapped in their pitcher-shaped leaves and digested by their enzymatic fluid. The genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms and its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. The slippery inner surfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far been considered as the key trapping devices. However, the occurrence of species lacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects suggests the possible implication of other mechanisms.Using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and rheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of Nepenthes rafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial for the retention of insects in its traps. Trapping efficiency is shown to remain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the elastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of insect movements.This finding challenges the common classification of Nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great adaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to high rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. The viscoelastic trap constitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of Nepenthes species and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the sundew (Drosera) flypaper plants. Such large production of a highly viscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the plant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control."
https://openalex.org/W2085076832,"Increasing levels of global trade and intercontinental travel have been cited as the major causes of biological invasion. However, indirect factors such as economic development that affect the intensity of invasion have not been quantitatively explored. Herein, using principal factor analysis, we investigated the relationship between biological invasion and economic development together with climatic information for China from the 1970s to present. We demonstrate that the increase in biological invasion is coincident with the rapid economic development that has occurred in China over the past three decades. The results indicate that the geographic prevalence of invasive species varies substantially on the provincial scale, but can be surprisingly well predicted using the combination of economic development (R2 = 0.378) and climatic factors (R2 = 0.347). Economic factors are proven to be at least equal to if not more determinant of the occurrence of invasive species than climatic factors. International travel and trade are shown to have played a less significant role in accounting for the intensity of biological invasion in China. Our results demonstrate that more attention should be paid to economic factors to improve the understanding, prediction and management of biological invasions."
https://openalex.org/W2094888311,"Helicases often achieve functional specificity through utilization of unique structural features incorporated into an otherwise conserved core. The archaeal Rad3 (xeroderma pigmentosum group D protein (XPD)) helicase is a prototypical member of the Rad3 family, distinct from other related (superfamily II) SF2 enzymes because of a unique insertion containing an iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster. This insertion may represent an auxiliary domain responsible for modifying helicase activity or for conferring specificity for selected DNA repair intermediates. The importance of the FeS cluster for the fine-tuning of Rad3-DNA interactions is illustrated by several clinically relevant point mutations in the FeS domain of human Bach1 (FancJ) and XPD helicases that result in distinct disease phenotypes. Here we analyzed the substrate specificity of the Rad3 (XPD) helicase from Ferroplasma acidarmanus (FacRad3) and probed the importance of the FeS cluster for Rad3-DNA interactions. We found that the FeS cluster stabilizes secondary structure of the auxiliary domain important for coupling of single-stranded (ss) DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis to ssDNA translocation. Additionally, we observed specific quenching of the Cy5 fluorescent dye when the FeS cluster of a bound helicase is positioned in close proximity to a Cy5 fluorophore incorporated into the DNA molecule. Taking advantage of this Cy5 quenching, we developed an equilibrium assay for analysis of the Rad3 interactions with various DNA substrates. We determined that the FeS cluster-containing domain recognizes the ssDNA-double-stranded DNA junction and positions the helicase in an orientation consistent with duplex unwinding. Although it interacts specifically with the junction, the enzyme binds tightly to ssDNA, and the single-stranded regions of the substrate are the major contributors to the energetics of FacRad3-substrate interactions.

The function of many multisubunit DNA repair complexes requires activity of DNA helicases, which are ubiquitous, highly diverse molecular motors that convert the chemical energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis into mechanical work of unidirectional translocation along the DNA lattice (reviewed in Refs. 1Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1835-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Unidirectional translocation of a helicase may be coupled to other thermodynamically unfavorable processes, including separation of the nucleic acid duplexes and disassembly of protein-nucleic acid complexes. Coupling of ATP hydrolysis to translocation is achieved through the set of so-called “helicase signature motifs” that define the motor core of the enzyme (3Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 4Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The motor cores of numerous helicases are structurally and mechanistically similar, yet these enzymes display remarkable functional diversity (for review see Ref. 4Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). It has become clear in recent years that such diversity may be achieved in trans through utilization of specific processivity factors or in cis by incorporating additional structural features that direct interaction with nucleic acids, duplex destabilization, and strand separation activities.The Rad3 (XPD) 2The abbreviations used are: XPDxeroderma pigmentosum group D proteindsDNAdouble-stranded DNADTTdithiothreitolFPAfluorescence polarization anisotropyFeSiron-sulfur clusterNERnucleotide excision repairssDNAsingle-stranded DNAATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)ICP-MSinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. 2The abbreviations used are: XPDxeroderma pigmentosum group D proteindsDNAdouble-stranded DNADTTdithiothreitolFPAfluorescence polarization anisotropyFeSiron-sulfur clusterNERnucleotide excision repairssDNAsingle-stranded DNAATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)ICP-MSinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. helicase from Ferroplasma acidarmanus (FacRad3) provides an example of a helicase that utilizes a unique structural domain. The Rad3 family includes several closely related DNA helicases found in all three domains of life. All members of this family are bona fide DNA helicases that display 5′ → 3′ polarity of ssDNA translocation. These Rad3 family helicases (5Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) differ from the related SF2 (superfamily II) enzymes because of a unique insertion between signature motifs Ia and II (Fig. 1A) that contains an iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster (6Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The presence of an FeS cluster was recently reported for the archaeal Rad3 (6Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and bacterial DinG (7Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18437-18447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) helicases and inferred in other related enzymes. However, the mechanistic role of this cluster remains unclear. The FeS cluster-containing insertion may represent an “auxiliary domain” responsible for modifying helicase activity or for conferring specificity for a defined set of DNA structures.FeS clusters are ubiquitous and ancient prosthetic groups that are essential for fundamental biological processes (reviewed in Ref. 8Imlay J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The biochemical utility of FeS clusters in contemporary organisms usually rests upon either their ability to accept and donate electrons or upon a cationic feature that allows tight binding of the electron-rich oxygen and nitrogen atoms of organic substrates. Both the ability to transfer electrons and the cationic nature of the clusters are influenced by solvent exposure and the electrostatic environment, which may provide a means of regulation. The FeS cluster can also play a structural role by facilitating protein folding and by stabilizing the important structural elements. For example, 4Fe-4S clusters organize the elements forming the DNA-interacting surface and position the key catalytic residues in several DNA glycosylases, the only other DNA repair enzymes known to possess an FeS cluster (9Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of the DNA glycosylase to DNA shifts the redox potential of the buried FeS cluster and activates it toward oxidation (10Boal A.K. Yavin E. Lukianova O.A. O'Shea V.L. David S.S. Barton J.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8397-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, in Rad3 helicases, a majority of which are involved in various aspects of DNA repair, the FeS cluster may be important for the structural integrity of Rad3, or may have a more subtle role in regulation of other properties of this enzyme.The importance of the FeS cluster in Rad3 helicases can be illustrated by the differential effects of naturally occurring mutations. Two mutations found in this domain selectively impede activity of human Bach1 (Rad3 family member) helicase in the repair of two distinct types of DNA damage. The M299I mutation, linked to breast cancer and a defect in double strand break repair (11Cantor S.B. Bell D.W. Ganesan S. Kass E.M. Drapkin R. Grossman S. Wahrer D.C. Sgroi D.C. Lane W.S. Haber D.A. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), occurs immediately adjacent to a conserved Cys298 residue, a putative ligand for the FeS cluster. Notably, because of low expression yield of the human protein, it is unclear whether Bach1M299I contains an FeS cluster. In vitro, M299I decreases processivity of the Bach1 helicase and enhances its ATPase activity (12Gupta R. Sharma S. Doherty K.M. Sommers J.A. Cantor S.B. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6673-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The A349P mutation is directly adjacent to another conserved cysteine, Cys350, and is linked to Fanconi anemia and defective inter-strand DNA cross-link repair (13Levitus M. Waisfisz Q. Godthelp B.C. de Vries Y. Hussain S. Wiegant W.W. Elghalbzouri-Maghrani E. Steltenpool J. Rooimans M.A. Pals G. Arwert F. Mathew C.G. Zdzienicka M.Z. Hiom K. De Winter J.P. Joenje H. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 934-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Although the Bach1A349P mutant has not been characterized, Cys350 is the most conserved among four cysteines stabilizing the FeS cluster and is essential for helicase activity in Rad3 helicases (6Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The observation that the M299I and A349P mutations, found near the two conserved cysteines, are the separation of function mutations that result in distinct disease and cellular phenotypes underscores the importance of the FeS cluster-containing domain in the fine-tuning of the enzyme. Thus, understanding the function of the FeS cluster in Rad3 helicases will not only clarify the mechanistic role of the unique insertion that defines this helicase family, but it will also assist in unraveling the genotype/phenotype relationships in these enzymes.Eukaryotic Rad3 (yeast Rad3 (14Sung P.

Although the archaeal Rad3 (XPD) helicase has not been extensively studied, it is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to UV radiation along with other putative NER proteins (24Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The Rad3 helicase from a mesophilic archaeon provides an attractive model for our investigation. While being highly homologous to the human helicases whose mechanisms are of a great biomedical importance (Bach1, XPD, and Chl1) and to the previously described hyperthermophilic enzyme from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (6Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1), it can be expressed in Escherichia coli, purified in large quantities, and analyzed at ambient temperature using biochemical and biophysical techniques. Therefore, we purified the recombinant His6-tagged F. acidarmanus (25Dopson M. Baker-Austin C. Hind A. Bowman J.P. Bond P.L. Appl. Environ.

Comparing properties of the wild type and mutant enzymes enabled us to propose that the integrity of the FeS cluster is required for the folding and structural stability of an auxiliary domain important for coupling ATP hydrolysis to unidirectional translocation of the helicase, which explains the previously reported observation that disruption of the FeS cluster in the S. acidocaldarius Rad3 (XPD) helicase results in loss of helicase activity (6Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Additionally, we exploited our observation that the Rad3 FeS cluster quenches fluorescence of the Cy5 dye in a distance-dependent manner. Using this quenching as a probe, we demonstrated that upon binding of a helicase to the DNA molecules containing single-stranded and double-stranded features, the FeS cluster domain targets the enzyme to the junction. Thus, this auxiliary domain plays a dual role in Rad3 helicases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes and Reagents—Chemicals were of a reagent grade. Restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. Streptavidin was purchased from MP Biomedicals, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, and 10 mm NaCl, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ATP, ATPγS, and poly(dT) were from Sigma. The concentrations of ATP and poly(dT) were measured spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients ϵ259 = 15.4 mm-1 cm-1 (for ATP and ATPγS) and ϵ264 = 8520 m-1 cm-1 (for poly(dT)).Cloning and Mutagenesis of the FacRad3 Gene—The rad3 gene (GenBank™ accession number ZP_01709501) from F. acidarmanus (25Dopson M. Baker-Austin C. Hind A. Bowman J.P. Bond P.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers “FacRad3F” creating the NdeI recognition site flanking the start codon and “FacRad3R” introducing the XhoI site at the 3′-end of the termination codon (Table 1). The F. acidarmanus genomic DNA, kindly provided by Dr. Jill Banfield (University of California, Berkeley), was used as the template. The PCR product was cloned into pGEMT plasmid, a TA-cloning vector (Promega), sequenced to ensure the integrity of the coding sequence, and subcloned into pET28a plasmid, which allows expression of the protein with the His6 tag at the N terminus. The integrity of the insert was again confirmed through nucleotide sequencing (W. M. Keck Center for Functional and Comparative Genomics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The construct was designated pET28/facrad3.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′-3′)AssaysFacRad3FCATATGGAAAAATTTACCCCCAGGGAATGGCAGGFacRad3 cloningFacRad3RCTCGAGTTATTTTGTGTTAGGAAGCAAATTGGATTGC87SGGAAAAAGCAAATTAAGCCCGCTTAAAGAGAGGMutagenesisC105SGGGCAGAAAAATGTCAGCAAAGGGTGCCCCTTGC108SAATGTATGCAAAGGGAGCCCCTTGAAGGATAAAC169SAATGTAAAATCCTATTCCCCATATTATTCTGTGH01CCCAGTACGACGGCCAGTGCSD/HA/EMSAaSD indicates streptavidin displacement; HA indicates helicase assay; EMSA indicates electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FQ indicates fluorescence quenching assay; FF indicates fluorescence footprinting; A indicates anisotropy.H02GCACTGGCCGTCGTACTGGGSD/HA/EMSAH0120TCCCAGTACGACGGCCAGTGC (T)20SD/HA/EMSAH20T02(T)20GCACTGGCCGTCGTACTGGGHA/EMSAH20T02Bio(T)20GCACTGGCCGTCGTACTGGG/biotinSDU5T(T)5GGAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCFQU10T(T)10GGAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCFQU15T(T)15GGAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCFQ/FF/AU30T(T)30GGAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCFQU22GGAATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATCCFQiCy510TGGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTCC/Cy5/(T)10FQ22Cy5GGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTCC/Cy5/FQiAM1GGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTCC/TiCy5/(T)19FFiAM3GGATGGCTTAGAGCTTAAT/iCy5T/CC(T)20FFiAM7GGATGGCTTAGAGCT/iCy5T/AATTCC(T)20FFiAM14GGATGGCT/iCy5T/AGAGCTTAATTCC(T)20FF/AiAM7BotGGATGGCTTAGAGCT/iCy5T/AATTCCFFa SD indicates streptavidin displacement; HA indicates helicase assay; EMSA indicates electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FQ indicates fluorescence quenching assay; FF indicates fluorescence footprinting; A indicates anisotropy. Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—Each of the four conserved cysteines proposed to be ligands to the putative FeS cluster in FacRad3 helicase were individually substituted with serines. The mutations were carried out using the QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pET28/facrad3 plasmid as a template, following the procedure described by the manufacturer. The primers used for each mutagenesis reaction are listed in Table 1. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmids expressing mutant FacRad3 enzymes were designated pET28/facrad3-C87S, pET28/facrad3-C105S, pET28/facrad3-C108S, and pET28/facrad3-C169S, respectively.Purification of FacRad3 Enzymes—The His6-tagged wild type FacRad3 helicase as well as FacRad3C87S, FacRad3C105S, FacRad3C108S, and FacRad3C169S mutants were overexpressed in E. coli (BL21-Codon Plus, Stratagene) and purified by the following procedure. E. coli cells harboring the plasmid for expression of the wild type or mutant FacRad3 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the OD600 reached 0.3. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Induced cells were cultured overnight at 16 °C, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4); 500 mm NaCl; 1% v/v Triton X-100; 50 mm imidazole; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol; Complete mini-EDTA protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the clarified lysate was applied to a HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with nickel and equilibrated in buffer Ni-A (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4); 500 mm NaCl; 50 mm imidazole; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The His6-tagged proteins were eluted in buffer Ni-B (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4); 100 mm NaCl; 300 mm imidazole; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The Ni-B elution was then immediately applied to a HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer Heparin-A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 100 mm NaCl; 1 mm DTT). Proteins were eluted from heparin with a linear gradient from 100 mm to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing FacRad3 were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer B50 (50 mm Tris-HCl pH (8.0); 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm DTT). Dialysate was then filtered and applied to an anion exchange column (Mono Q 10/100) (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B50 and eluted with 30-column volume gradient from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing FacRad3 were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight against Storage Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 200 mm NaCl; 2 mm DTT; 50% glycerol). The purified enzymes were stored at -80 °C. Concentrations of the purified enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically using ϵ280 = 91300 m-1 cm-1.ICP Mass Spectroscopy—The iron content in the purified proteins was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. ICP-MS measurements were carried out at the UIUC Microanalysis Laboratory using the SCIEX ELAN DRCe ICP-MS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The far-UV CD spectra (from 200 to 250 nm) were recorded immediately after protein purification using a 1-mm cell in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Secondary structure content of the wild type FacRad3 and FacRad3C105S proteins was deconvoluted from the experimental data using the DICHROWEB On-line circular dichroism analysis application (26Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar).DNA Substrates—All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc., or Integrated DNA Technologies and were either PAGE- or high pressure liquid chromatography-purified. Where indicated, the oligonucleotides were 5′-radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passing the labeled oligonucleotides through Microspin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and stored at -20 °C. Substrates containing dsDNA regions were produced by annealing the appropriate oligonucleotides in the annealing buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 200 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). The annealing mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and the heat block was then removed and allowed to cool to room temperature for 3 h. The annealed substrates were then buffer-exchanged by passing through Microspin G-25 columns equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and stored at 4 °C.Internal Cy5 Labeling of Oligonucleotides for Fluorescence Footprinting Assays—The iAmMC6T-labeled oligonucleotides were reacted with Cy5 mono-NHS esters (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The length of labeling of amino-modified DNA with Cy5 NHS esters was extended from 1 to 6 h. The labeled oligonucleotides were then purified using MicroSpin G-25 columns followed by ethanol precipitation to remove unincorporated Cy5-NHS esters. The labeling efficiency was determined spectrophotometrically by comparing the ratio of oligonucleotide (measured at 260 nm) and Cy5 dye (measured at 649 nm). Labeling efficiencies for oligonucleotides “iAM1,” “iAM3,” “iAM7,” “iAM14,” and “iAM7Bot” were 125, 119.4, 101.3, 69.6, and 92.6%, respectively (higher than 100% labeling efficiency likely reflects the presence of free dye).ATP Hydrolysis Assays—A Cary 300 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian) was used to monitor ATP hydrolysis coupled to NADH oxidation (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml NADH, pyruvate kinase (47 units/ml), lactic dehydrogenase (37 units/ml), 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 nm of the indicated enzyme, 10 μm DNA (nucleotides) poly(dT) (ssDNA) or NdeI-linearized pBR322 (dsDNA). Upon preincubation at 37 °C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 3 mm, respectively). The rate of hydrolysis was determined using the following conversion: rate of decrease in NADH absorbance measured at 340 nm (s-1) × 9820 = the rate of ATP hydrolysis (in μm/min). The steady-state parameters of the ATP hydrolysis were determined by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism software.Streptavidin Displacement Assays—DNA translocation was observed using streptavidin displacement assays (28Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The partial duplex and fork substrates were produced by annealing the “H20T02bio” oligonucleotide to “H01” and “H0120T”, respectively (Table 1). The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide biotinylated at the 3′-end, the 32P-labeled partial duplex or fork substrates biotinylated at the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide on which the FacRad3 helicase is expected to translocate (10 nm of each substrate), was incubated with 300 nm streptavidin in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP for 5 min followed by the addition of 6 μm biotin. The zero time points were pulled, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 nm enzyme. Ten μl aliquots were taken at 2- and 5-min intervals and quenched by adding an equal volume of quench solution containing 0.6% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 10 μm poly(dT) for ssDNA or 10 μm of ssDNA of the same sequence as the radiolabeled strand in the duplex. Then 5 μl of 30% Ficoll 400 (w/v) containing 0.25% bromphenol blue (w/v) and 0.25% xylene cyanol (w/v) was added to the quenched reactions. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 15% (19:1) native polyacrylamide gel, visualized, and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software. The assays comparing activity of the wild type FacRad3 and FacRad3C105S enzymes were carried out in the presence of the indicated concentration of each enzyme and were stopped after 2 min.Helicase Assays—The partial duplex DNA with 5′- and 3′-overhangs were produced by annealing the “H20T02” oligonucleotide to the 32P-labeled H01 oligonucleotide and by annealing the oligonucleotide H0120T to the 32P-labeled “H02” oligonucleotide, respectively. Oligonucleotides H0120T and 32P-labeled H20T02 were annealed to produce the fork substrate, whereas oligonucleotides H01 and 32P-labeled H02 were annealed to form the blunt substrate. The assays were carried out in the presence of 500 nm of the wild type or mutant FacRad3 helicase and 50 nm (molecules) of the indicated DNA substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. The reactions were carried out at room temperature. After preincubation of all other components for 10 min, the helicase reactions were initiated by addition of 3 mm ATP and allowed to proceed for 15 min. Unwinding was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution containing 20% glycerol, 0.1 m EDTA, 1% (v/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 2.5 μm of unlabeled oligonucleotide (H02 and H20T02 for the reaction containing 3′-overhang and fork substrates, respectively and H01 for the reaction containing blunt and 5′-overhang substrates). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the products of the reactions were separated by electrophoresis on a 15% (19:1) native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer, visualized, and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software.Fluorescence-based Binding Assays—To determine the equilibrium binding parameters for the FacRad3-DNA interactions, we followed quenching of the Cy5 fluorescent dye incorporated at the ssDNA-dsDNA junction. The duplex DNA substrates used in these assays were annealed as described above. The partial duplex substrates with 5′-overhang of 5, 10, 15, and 30 nucleotides were produced by annealing “22Cy5” and “U5T”, “U10T”, “U15T”, and “U30T”, respectively. Annealing of the “iCy510T” and U10T resulted in the fork substrate with two 10-nucleotide-long overhangs, whereas the partial duplex with 3′-overhang was the result of annealing iCy510T and “U22” oligonucleotides. The assays were performed using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian). The Cy5 dye was excited at 649 nm, and its emission was detected at 666 nm. Stoichiometric titrations were carried out at 20 °C in the reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. One hundred mm NaCl was added to the reaction mixtures for the assays designed to compare affinities of the FacRad3 helicase for different substrates. The rea"
https://openalex.org/W2072716779,"Choline kinase alpha (CK-alpha) is one of two mammalian enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine in the biosynthesis of the major membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. We created mice lacking CK-alpha with an embryonic stem cell line containing an insertional mutation in the gene for CK-alpha (Chka). Embryos homozygous for the mutant Chka allele were recovered at the blastocyst stage, but not at embryonic day 7.5, indicating that CK-alpha is crucial for the early development of mouse embryos. Heterozygous mutant mice (Chka(+/-)) appeared entirely normal in their embryonic development and gross anatomy, and they were fertile. Although choline kinase activity was decreased by approximately 30%, the amount of phosphatidylcholine in cells and the levels of other enzymes involved in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis were unaffected. Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis measured by choline incorporation into hepatocytes was also not compromised in Chka(+/-) mice. Enhanced levels of choline and attenuated levels of phosphocholine were observed in both the livers and testes of Chka(+/-) mice. Triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester were elevated approximately 2-fold in the livers, whereas neutral lipid profiles in plasma were similar in Chka(+/-) and wild-type (Chka(+/+)) mice. Thus, Chka is an essential gene for early embryonic development, but adult mice do not require full expression of the gene for normal levels of phosphatidylcholine."

In typical MPD cases (N = 8), which served as a control group, those with a homozygous V617F mutation showed clear uniparental disomy (UPD) of 9p using SNP-A. Consistent with possible genomic instability, in 19/30 MDS/MPD-U patients, we found additional lesions not identified by metaphase cytogenetics. In addition to UPD9p, we also have detected UPD affecting other chromosomes, including 1 (2/30), 11 (4/30), 12 (1/30) and 22 (1/30). Transformation to AML was observed in 8/30 patients. In 5 V617F+ patients who progressed to AML, we show that SNP-A can allow for the detection of two modes of transformation: leukemic blasts evolving from either a wild-type jak2 precursor carrying other acquired chromosomal defects, or from a V617F+ mutant progenitor characterized by UPD9p. SNP-A-based detection of cryptic lesions in MDS/MPD-U may help explain the clinical heterogeneity of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2120718088,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to an abnormal polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal region of huntingtin protein (Exp-Htt). This expansion causes protein aggregation and neuronal dysfunction and death. Transcriptional dysregulation due to Exp-Htt participates in neuronal death in HD. Here, using the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, we identified a new molecular alteration that could account for gene dysregulation in these mice. Despite a nuclear activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) along with Elk-1 and cAMP responsive element binding, two transcription factors involved in c-Fos transcription, we failed to detect any histone H3 phosphorylation, which is expected after nuclear ERK activation. Accordingly, we found in the striatum of these mice a deficiency of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK-1), a kinase downstream ERK, critically involved in H3 phosphorylation and c-Fos induction. We extended this observation to Exp-Htt-expressing striatal neurons and postmortem brains of HD patients. In vitro, knocking out MSK-1 expression potentiated Exp-Htt-induced striatal death. Its overexpression induced H3 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression and totally protected against striatal neurodegeneration induced by Exp-Htt. We propose that MSK-1 deficiency is involved in transcriptional dysregulation and striatal degeneration. Restoration of its expression and activity may be a new therapeutic target in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2009004136,"The tonoplast K+ membrane transport system plays a crucial role in maintaining K+ homeostasis in plant cells. Here, we isolated cDNAs encoding a two-pore K+ channel (NtTPK1) from Nicotiana tabacum cv. SR1 and cultured BY-2 tobacco cells. Two of the four variants of NtTPK1 contained VHG and GHG instead of the GYG signature sequence in the second pore region. All four products were functional when expressed in the Escherichia coli cell membrane, and NtTPK1 was targeted to the tonoplast in tobacco cells. Two of the three promoter sequences isolated from N. tabacum cv. SR1 were active, and expression from these was increased ∼2-fold by salt stress or high osmotic shock. To determine the properties of NtTPK1, we enlarged mutant yeast cells with inactivated endogenous tonoplast channels and prepared tonoplasts suitable for patch clamp recording allowing the NtTPK1-related channel conductance to be distinguished from the small endogenous currents. NtTPK1 exhibited strong selectivity for K+ over Na+. NtTPK1 activity was sensitive to spermidine and spermine, which were shown to be present in tobacco cells. NtTPK1 was active in the absence of Ca2+, but a cytosolic concentration of 45 μm Ca2+ resulted in a 2-fold increase in the amplitude of the K+ current. Acidification of the cytosol to pH 5.5 also markedly increased NtTPK1-mediated K+ currents. These results show that NtTPK1 is a novel tonoplast K+ channel belonging to a different group from the previously characterized vacuolar channels SV, FV, and VK.

To gain insights into the biophysical properties of the TPK-type channels, we isolated the homologous genes from BY-2 cultured tobacco cells and Nicotiana tabacum cv. SR1. The protein sequences revealed a novel feature of the K+ filter in these channels. We also examined promoter activity and the intracellular localization of the channel and performed accurate electrophysiological measurements of NtTPK1 using the vacuolar membrane from enlarged mutant yeast cells with very low background currents, unlike the plant vacuolar membrane. The results showed that NtTPK1 was a novel tonoplast channel with characteristics different from those of previously characterized tonoplast channels. Plant Material—Tobacco BY-2 (N. tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2) cells were grown in BY-2 growth medium (modified Linsmaier and Skoog medium) (14Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) at 26 °C in the dark with constant shaking and were maintained by subculturing 1 ml of BY-2 cells into 100 ml of fresh medium every 7 days. Cloning of NtTPK1 Full-length cDNAs from N. tabacum cv. SR1 and BY-2 Cells—A search of the EST data base of tobacco BY-2 cells for sequence homology with the known TPK family (Transcriptome Analysis of BY-2 revealed a 684-bp partial clone which was a homologue of A. thaliana TPK2 (known as KCO2). Total RNA was isolated from N. tabacum cv. SR1 and BY-2 cells using a standard guanidine thiocyanate method (15Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To obtain the 5′-end of the NtTPK1 cDNA, 5′-RACE was performed as described previously (16Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was reverse-transcribed using three different NtTPK1-specific antisense primers, 5′-GGATGCAAAGATACGACCGG-3′, 5′-CGCCATACCCCACAGTGGTAAC-3′, and 5′-CAAAATGCGTAACCGG-3′, and RACE amplification primers. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and was used as template DNA for the isolation of full-length NtTPK1 cDNA by PCR reactions using primer 5′-ATGGAGAAAGAGCCTCTTC-3′, starting at the start codon, and primer 5′-TTAATGGTGGTGGCTTTCC-3′, starting at the first stop codon. Expression of NtTPK1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli NtTPK1 was amplified by PCR using the EcoRI site-containing sense primer 5′-CAGGAATTCATGGAGAAAGAGCCTCTTC-3′ and the SalI site-containing antisense primer 5′-CAGGTCGACTTAATGGTGGTGGCTTTCC-3′. The PCR fragment was then digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the yeast expression vector pKT10 (17Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol.

Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Growth tests of the plasmid-containing E. coli LB2003 at different K+ concentrations were carried out as described previously (21Uozumi N. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Muto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Generation of NtTPK1-overexpressing Tobacco BY-2 Transgenic Lines—Full-length cDNA for NtTPK1 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CACCATGGAGAAAGAGCCTCTTC-3′ and 5′-TTAATGGTGGTGGCTTTCC-3′ and subcloned into the pENTR/D TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then transferred into the GATEWAY destination vector pGWB2 containing the CAMV 35S promoter by an LR Clonase reaction (Invitrogen) (24Nakagawa T. Kurose T. Hino T. Tanaka K. Kawamukai M. Niwa Y. Toyooka K. Matsuoka K. Jinbo T. Kimura T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The [35S]NtTPK1 construct was introduced into A. tumefaciens EHA101 by electroporation (25Mersereau M. Pazour G.J. Das A. Gene. 1990; 90: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Stable transformation of BY-2 cells mediated by A. tumefaciens (strain EHA101) was carried out as described by Matsuoka and Nakamura (26Matsuoka K. Nakamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cloning of the NtTPK1 Promoter Region for Measurement of Promoter GUS Activity—Tobacco genomic DNA was extracted from tobacco leaves by the CTAB method (27McGarvey P. Kaper J.M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 428-432PubMed Google Scholar) and used as the template for the PCR. To isolate the NtTPK1 promoter region, thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR was performed (28Liu Y.G. Whittier R.F. Genomics. 1995; 25: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Three nested primers hybridizing to the NtTPK1 cDNA were used: the 1st PCR primer, 5′-GTCAAGAGCAGTGGCAGAAGCTTC-3′; 2nd PCR primer, 5′-CAGAGGTACCAAAGATAAGGCGTTC-3′; and 3rd PCR primer, 5′-TGTTCTGGTGCTGACATAAGG-3′. To confirm the DNA sequence of the NtTPK1 promoter region in the genomic DNA, three upstream primers, 5′-CGTTTATATCGTGTCAACCTTTG-3′,5′-GCGTTCTTGAATCCAAACGAC-3′, and 5′-GCTGGGAGAGTCCTATACCGC-3′, were used with the downstream primer 5′-TATGGGGTTTCGCCGGAAAACGG-3′. The promoter sequence was subcloned into the pENTR/D TOPO vector and transferred to the GATEWAY destination vector pGWB3 (24Nakagawa T. Kurose T. Hino T. Tanaka K. Kawamukai M. Niwa Y. Toyooka K. Matsuoka K. Jinbo T. Kimura T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). pGWB3 vector harboring the promoter sequence was used to transform BY-2 cells as described above. To measure promoter activity, fluorimetric determination of GUS activity was performed as reported previously (29Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8352) Google Scholar), using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide as substrate. BY-2 cells grown in BY-2 growth medium for 5 days were transferred for 10 min to BY-2 growth medium containing 250 mm NaCl or 500 mm mannitol, harvested by centrifugation, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Three replicates were used for each treatment. GUS activity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 455 nm on a spectrofluorometer (JASCO, Japan). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and the specific GUS activity determined as the rate of increase in fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) divided by the protein concentration (pmol of 4-MU/h/μg protein). Quantitative Real-time PCR Assay—Expression was measured in different tissues of N. tabacum cv. SR1 using One Step SYBR RT-PCR (Takara, Japan), a method that relies on real-time monitoring of the release of a fluorescent reporter dye (SYBR-Green I) as the PCR product accumulates in the reaction mix (31Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). The cDNA was amplified using an ABI Prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems). Amplification of tubulin cDNA under identical conditions was performed as an internal control to normalize cDNA levels. Preparation of BY-2 and Yeast Vacuolar Membranes—Vacuolar membranes were prepared from BY-2 cells as described previously (32Maeshima M. Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), except for a few modifications. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were ground in a mortar with liquid nitrogen and grinding medium (0.25 mm sorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (w/v) PVP-40, and 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5). The frozen cell homogenates were thawed and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min, then the supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 50 min, and the final precipitate suspended in 0.75 mm sucrose in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 (Tris-DEM) (microsomal membrane fraction). Further purification of vacuolar membranes was carried out by floating centrifugation. The microsomal membrane suspension was placed in a centrifuge tube and overlaid with the same volume of Tris-DEM buffer containing 0.25 mm sorbitol. After centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 30 min, the vacuolar membrane vesicles, which formed a band at the interface between the two solutions, were collected and suspended in 15 ml of Tris-DEM buffer containing 0.25 mm sorbitol. The suspension was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min and the pellet suspended in a small volume of the same buffer. Yeast vacuoles were prepared using the floating centrifugation method (33Yoshihisa T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Nakanishi Y. Yabe I. Maeshima M. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, NtTPK1-transformed S. cerevisae strain BJ5458 (Matα, ura3–52, trp1, lys2–801, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prbΔ1.6R can1, GAL), lacking two major vacuolar proteases (17Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was used. Immunoblotting—An anti-NtTPK1 antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide containing the sequence NH2-CGRITLADLMESHHH-COOH from the C terminus of NtTPK1 (Operon Biotechnologies, Japan). Antibodies against YVC1, a marker for the S. cerevisiae tonoplast, were raised against the peptide NH2-CNLTAVITDLLEKLDIKDKKECOOH located at the C terminus of YVC1 (35Palmer C.P. Zhou X.L. Lin J. Loukin S.H. Kung C. Saimi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies raised against v-PPase (34Nakanishi Y. Yabe I.

Plant J. 2005; 41: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or PAQ2 (plasma membrane aquaporin of Raphanus sativus) (37Suga S. Imagawa S. Maeshima M. Planta. 2001; 212: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were used to identify the BY-2 cell tonoplast, plasma membrane, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, respectively. Proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk in PBS-T (140 mm NaCl, 16.0 mm Na2HPO4, 2.00 mm KH2PO4, 3.75 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody (1:4000 in blocking buffer), washed three times with PBS-T, incubated for 30 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) (1:5000 in blocking buffer), and subjected to chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence signals on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were recorded using an LAS 3000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). Generation of the YVC1 Knock-out Strain—Deletion of the YVC1 gene in the strain BJ5458 was achieved by homologous recombination of the integration cassette with the LEU2 marker, amplified from the plasmid pUG73 (38Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The linearized LEU2 PCR product was used for yeast transformation as described previously (39Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). We named the YVC1-deleted strain SH1006. Preparation of Giant Yeast Cells and Isolation of Giant Yeast Vacuoles—Preparation of giant yeast from the yvc1 mutant. SH1006 was performed as described previously (34Nakanishi Y. Yabe I.

Briefly, at the early log phase (OD660 of 0.2), 1 ml of cells was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 m glucose, then for 15 min at 30 °C with 1 mg/ml of Zymolyase 20T in 1 m sorbitol, 2% (w/v) glucose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, and 0.25× dropout solution composed of all amino acids and adenines (17Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The spheroplasts formed were obtained as described previously (34Nakanishi Y. Yabe I. Maeshima M. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Giant vacuoles were prepared from giant spheroplasts by the osmotic shock method with the following modifications (34Nakanishi Y. Yabe I. Maeshima M. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Yabe I. Horiuchi K. Nakahara K. Hiyama T. Yamanaka T. Wang P.C. Toda K. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Hirata R. Anraku Y. Kusaka I. J.

The spheroplasts were concentrated by floating centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, then diluted with 5 volumes of a hypotonic solution (0.15 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 20 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.5) in the recording chamber of the patch-clamp apparatus. Electrophysiological Experiments—For electrophysiological analysis, NtTPK1 was expressed from the pKT10 plasmid in the YVC1-lacking yeast strain SH1006. Currents were recorded in the whole vacuole mode, as described previously (40Yabe I. Horiuchi K. Nakahara K. Hiyama T. Yamanaka T. Wang P.C. Toda K. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Hirata R. Anraku Y. Kusaka I.

All experiments were carried out using the standard patch-clamp technique at 25 °C. Measurement of Polyamine Levels in Tobacco Plants—Different tissues (leaf, shoot, and root) collected from 3–4-week-old tobacco plants were ground in an Eppendorf tube and extracted for 2 h at 70°C with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Levels of different polyamines were determined by HPLC as described previously (42Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bradford assay (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cloning of NtTPK1—We searched the EST data base of tobacco BY-2 cells for sequence homology with the known TPK family (43Czempinski K. Zimmermann S. Ehrhardt T. Muller-Rober B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2565-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and identified a partial cDNA homologous sequence in the data base and isolated the upstream cDNA by 5′-RACE and PCR. The isolated tobacco homologous gene was named NtTPK1. The NtTPK1 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1284 bp encoding a 428-amino acid protein (47.6 kDa) (GenBank™ accession number EU161633) (Fig. 1). In a further cloning approach, we isolated three more cDNAs from BY-2 cells and one from N. tabacum cv. SR1. The sequence of the cDNA from N. tabacum cv. SR1 was identical to the NtTPK1 sequence in the data base. The three sequences from BY-2 cells contained some amino acid differences compared with that of NtTPK1 and were named NtTPK1a, NtTPK1b, and NtTPK1c (Fig. 1). These different sequences were caused by an amphidiploid nature of tobacco plant. N. tabacum cv. SR1 is an amphidiploid species derived from ancestors related the Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis, which are both diploid species. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence for NtTPK1 showed 62, 60, and 60% identity with those of A. thaliana AtTPK2 (formerly KCO2), AtTPK3 (formerly KCO6), and AtTPK5 (formerly KCO5), respectively; in contrast, the percentage identity with AtTPK1 and AtTPK4 was 39 and 40%, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1. The phylogenetic tree is shown in supplemental Fig. 2.) The hydropathy profile of NtTPK1, generated using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (44Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) predicted four potential transmembrane domains, designated M1–M4 (Fig. 1). The predicted protein sequence contained two pore (P) domains, P1, located between M1 and M2, and P2, located between M3 and M4. In the two P domains of NtTPK1, the K+ channel-selective motif (TXGYGD) (45Heginbotham L. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1992; 258: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 46Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) was conserved, whereas in NtTPK1, NtTPK1b, and NtTPK1c, several amino acid substitutions were found. Interestingly, NtTPK1b and NtTPK1c contained, respectively, VHG and GHG at the GYG site in P2. Analysis of the NtTPK1 sequence using the PROSITE pattern search data base showed a single EF-hand motif in its C-terminal region. The EF-hand, a structure common to several calcium-binding proteins, consists of two perpendicular 10–12-residue α helices separated by a 12-residue loop region, forming a single calcium-binding site (helix-loop-helix) (47Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AtTPK1, AtTPK2, and AtTPK3 contain one (AtTPK2 and 3) or two (AtTPK1) EF-hands located in the C-terminal domain, while AtTPK4 has none (6Becker D. Geiger D. Dunkel M. Roller A. Bertl A. Latz A. Carpaneto A. Dietrich P. Roelfsema M.R. Voelker C. Schmidt D. Mueller-Roeber B. Czempinski K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15621-15626Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Heterologous Expression of NtTPK1 in E. coli—We expressed NtTPK1 in X.laevis oocyte and the K+ uptake-deficient S. cerevisiae CY162, but did not observe any K+ transport activity (data not shown). This suggested that NtTPK1 might not be targeted to the plasma membrane, but to a subcellular membrane. Functional expression of plant K+ transporters in E. coli has been described previously (21Uozumi N. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Muto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This expression system allows measurement of the K+ uptake activity of plant endosome membrane-associated K+ channels/transporters (23Uozumi N. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 281: C733-C739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NtTPK1, NtTPK1a, NtTPK1b, and NtTPK1c were expressed in E. coli strain LB2003, which is deficient in all three major K+ uptake systems (20Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the growth of the cells was examined at limiting K+ concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2A, all four sets of cells grew as well as LB2003 cells expressing the Arabidopsis K+ channel KAT1 (pPAB404-KAT1), whereas cells transformed with empty vector (pPAB404) did not grow. These data suggested that NtTPK1, NtTPK1a, NtTPK1b, and NtTPK1c could take up K+ in the E. coli mutant. The ability of NtTPK1b and NtTPK1c to rescue the K+ uptake deficiency of E. coli suggested that the second signature sequence was not necessary for K+ uptake by two-pore K+ channels. To assess this hypothesis, we introduced substitutions in the GYG sequence in P1 and/or P2 of NtTPK1 (Fig. 1A); these were Y193H (P1-Y193H), G192A+Y193A+G194A (P1-AAA), and Y309H in P1 (P2-Y309H) and G308A+Y309A+G310A in P2 (P2-AAA), and the two double replacements, P1-Y193H/P2-Y309H and P1-AAA/P-2AAA (Fig. 2, B and C). Fig. 2B shows that P2-Y309H and P2-AAA allowed growth of LB2003, whereas P1-Y193H, P1-AAA, P1-Y193H/P2-Y309H, and P1-AAA/P-2AAA did not complement the K+ uptake deficiency. These results indicated that the first selectivity filter of the GYG sequence is absolutely required, but the second less important for K+ passage in NtTPK1 (Fig. 2C). Osmotic Stress-dependent Expression of NtTPK1 and Tissue Specificity of Expression—Three distinct NtTPK1 promoter sequences were isolated from N. tabacum cv. SR1 genomic DNA using the TAIL-PCR method. The length of the three sequences upstream of the NtTPK1 initiation codon was 1,101, 1,296, and 1,964 bp, and they were designated as promoter-A, promoter-B, and promoter-C, respectively. Promoter-A and promoter-B shared the same 327 bp sequence (–327 to –1) and all three promot"
https://openalex.org/W2127801557,"Background Season of birth (SOB) has been associated with many physiological and psychological traits including novelty seeking and sensation seeking. Similar traits have been associated with genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine system. SOB and dopamine receptor genetic polymorphisms may independently and interactively influence similar behaviors through their common effects on the dopaminergic system. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a sample of 195 subjects, we examined whether SOB was associated with impulsivity, sensation seeking and reproductive behaviors. Additionally we examined potential interactions of dopamine receptor genes with SOB for the same set of traits. Phenotypes were evaluated using the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, the Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire, the Sensation Seeking Scale, and the Delay Discounting Task. Subjects were also asked about their age at first sex as well as their desired age at the birth of their first child. The dopamine gene polymorphisms examined were Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) TaqI A and D4 (DRD4) 48 bp VNTR. Primary analyses included factorial gender×SOB ANOVAs or binary logistic regression models for each dependent trait. Secondary analysis extended the factorial models by also including DRD2 and DRD4 genotypes as independent variables. Winter-born males were more sensation seeking than non-winter born males. In factorial models including both genotype and season of birth as variables, two previously unobserved effects were discovered: (1) a SOB×DRD4 interaction effect on venturesomeness and (2) a DRD2×DRD4 interaction effect on sensation seeking. Conclusion These results are consistent with past findings that SOB is related to sensation seeking. Additionally, these results provide tentative support for the hypothesis that SOB modifies the behavioral expression of dopaminergic genetic polymorphism. These findings suggest that SOB should be included in future studies of risky behaviors and behavioral genetic studies of the dopamine system."
https://openalex.org/W1988164693,"The Tat system transports folded proteins across bacterial and thylakoid membranes. In Gram-negative organisms, a TatABC substrate-binding complex and separate TatA complex are believed to coalesce to form an active translocon, with all three subunits essential for translocation. Most Gram-positive organisms lack a tatB gene, indicating major differences in organization and possible differences in mode of action. Here, we have studied Tat complexes encoded by the tatAdCd genes of Bacillus subtilis. Expression of tatAdCd in an Escherichia coli tat null mutant results in efficient export of a large, cofactor-containing E. coli Tat substrate, TorA. We show that the tatAd gene complements E. coli mutants lacking either tatAE or tatB, indicating a bifunctional role for this subunit in B. subtilis. Second, we have identified and characterized two distinct Tat complexes that are novel in key respects: a TatAdCd complex of ∼230 kDa that is significantly smaller than the analogous E. coli TatABC complex (∼370 kDa on BN gels) and a separate TatAd complex. The latter is a discrete entity of ∼270 kDa as judged by gel filtration chromatography, very different from the highly heterogeneous E. coli TatA complex that ranges in size from ∼50 kDa to over 600 kDa. TatA heterogeneity has been linked to the varying size of Tat substrates being translocated, but the singular nature of the B. subtilis TatAd complex suggests that discrete TatAC and TatA complexes may form a single form of translocon. The Tat system transports folded proteins across bacterial and thylakoid membranes. In Gram-negative organisms, a TatABC substrate-binding complex and separate TatA complex are believed to coalesce to form an active translocon, with all three subunits essential for translocation. Most Gram-positive organisms lack a tatB gene, indicating major differences in organization and possible differences in mode of action. Here, we have studied Tat complexes encoded by the tatAdCd genes of Bacillus subtilis. Expression of tatAdCd in an Escherichia coli tat null mutant results in efficient export of a large, cofactor-containing E. coli Tat substrate, TorA. We show that the tatAd gene complements E. coli mutants lacking either tatAE or tatB, indicating a bifunctional role for this subunit in B. subtilis.

The Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway is involved in the transport of proteins across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane and the plasma membranes of a wide range of bacteria (1Robinson C.

It differs fundamentally from the other export pathway, the Sec pathway, in its ability to translocate prefolded proteins over the plasma membrane. This process appears not to require energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis but is instead dependent on the presence of the proton motive force across the membrane (1Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol.

Substrates for this translocation pathway bear N-terminal signal peptides that contain a highly conserved, characteristic twin-arginine motif in the N-terminal domain of the signal peptide (9Chaddock A.M.

Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar).In Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative organisms, the above studies have identified three genes as being essential for Tat-dependent protein translocation: tatA, tatB, and tatC (usually in the form of a tatABC operon). The three tat genes of E. coli encode membrane proteins of 9.6, 18.4, and 28.9 kDa in size, respectively. The TatA and TatB proteins are both predicted to contain a single transmembrane spanning domain, whereas the larger TatC protein is predicted to contain six transmembrane-spanning domains (12Behrendt J. Standar K. Lindenstrauss U. Bruser T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 234: 303-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These three proteins have been shown to form two main types of complex within the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. The first is a TatABC complex of ∼370 kDa (13Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D.

J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is thought to be involved in substrate recognition and binding; in particular, substrates appear to interact initially with the TatB and TatC subunits (15Alami M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The second form of Tat complex appears to contain only TatA molecules, and whereas the E. coli TatABC complex is both discrete and stable, the TatA complexes range in size from less than 100 kDa to over 500 kDa (17Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 246: 295-305Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Single-particle electron microscopy reveals the TatA to form ring-like structures of varying diameter (18Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), prompting suggestions of a role in formation of the translocation pore.Tat systems in other Gram-negative organisms appear (so far) to conform to a similar pattern, whereas Gram-positive organisms contain very different Tat systems. In virtually every case, with the exception of Streptomyces species (19Schaerlaekens K. Schierova M. Lammertyn E. Geukens N. Anne J. Van Mellaert L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6727-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), these organisms contain only tatAC genes, indicating fundamental differences between the two types of Tat apparatus. Because TatA and TatB proteins share a degree of sequence homology, one possibility is that the TatA proteins in Gram-positive bacteria are bifunctional, performing the functions of both the TatA and TatB proteins of E. coli (20Jongbloed J.D. van der Ploeg R. van Dijl J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TatB may perform a function in E. coli that is not required in Gram-positive organisms, or the two types of system may differ in other key respects.In this report we have set out to characterize in detail a Tat system from a Gram-positive organism, Bacillus subtilis. This is a nonpathogenic, Gram-positive soil bacterium that secretes high levels of extracellular proteins. B. subtilis contains three variants of the tatA gene, denoted tatAd, tatAy, and tatAc, together with two variants of tatC, denoted tatCd and tatCy; it lacks a tatB gene. Recently studies have shown the presence of two distinct translocases, one involving TatAd and TatCd and the other involving TatAy and TatCy. TatAdCd and TatAyCy display differing substrate specificities (21Jongbloed J.D. Grieger U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Nijland R. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The secretion of PhoD, a protein with phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase activity, is completely TatAdCd-dependent (22Jongbloed J.D. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Muller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the three genes are part of the pho-regulon that is only expressed under phosphate-limiting conditions. No other TatAdCd-dependent proteins have been identified to date. TatAyCy has been shown to form an active translocase for the translocation of YwbN, an iron-dependent DyP-peroxidase (22Jongbloed J.D. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G.

The function of the third TatA component, TatAc, remains unknown.Little is currently known about the organization of the B. subtilis Tat proteins within the membrane. Here, we analyze the organization and nature of the complexes formed by the components of the B. subtilis TatAdCd pathway. We show that these subunits form an active translocase when expressed in an E. coli background, and we furthermore show that TatAd is indeed bifunctional. Finally, we show that the B. subtilis Tat complexes have unexpected properties that suggest a new model for Tat-dependent protein transport, involving a single defined translocon rather than a spectrum of size variants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—All of the strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1.

All of the enzymes used were from Roche Applied Science or Fermentas Life Sciences. The PCR was performed using Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). For arabinose-inducible overproduction of B. subtilis TatAdCd, plasmid pBAdCd was constructed as follows. The tatAdCd operon was amplified from B. subtilis 168 chromosomal DNA with primers RTEAdF (5′-CGC GTC TCG CAT GTT TTC AAA CAT TGG AAT ACC GGG CTT G-3′) and JJdstrep02 (5′-ATA TTC TAG ATT ATT TTT CAA ACT GTG GGT GCG ACC AAT TCG AAG CGG CCG CCG CTG TTT CTT CC-3′). RTEAdF was designed as such that restriction of the generated tatAdCd-strep PCR-amplified fragment with dovetail enzyme Esp3I would create an NcoI overhang to ensure direct cloning in the vector pBAD24. JJdstrep02 was constructed in such a way that a C-terminal Strep-tag II (26Voss S. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (underlined) would be directly attached to tatCd during the PCR amplification. pBAdCd was constructed by ligating an Esp3I- and XbaI-cleaved PCR-amplified fragment of tatAdCd-strep into NcoI- and XbaI-cleaved pBAD24. For isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible overproduction of B. subtilis TatAdCd, tatAdCd-strep was cut out of pBAdCds with NheI and XbaI and ligated into NheI/XbaI-cut pEXT22 to construct pEXT-AdCd.For arabinose-inducible overproduction of B. subtilis TatAd, plasmid pBAd-His was constructed as follows. The tatAd gene was amplified from B. subtilis 168 chromosomal DNA with primers RTEAdF (5′-CGC GTC TCG CAT GTT TTC AAA CAT TGG AAT ACC GGG CTT G-3′) and TatAdhis-Xba-R (5′-GCT CTA GAT CAG TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGG CCC GCG TTT TTG TCC TGC-3′).

The membranes were isolated as described previously and solubilized in 2% digitonin (13Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Solubilized membranes were incubated with 2 μg/ml avidin to block any biotin-containing proteins before application to an equilibrated 2 ml Streptactin affinity column (Institut fur Bioanalytik). The column was washed with eight column volumes of equilibration buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% digitonin. Bound protein was eluted from the column in six 1.0-ml fractions using the same buffer as above but containing 3 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma). Elution fractions were pooled and concentrated to 250 μl using Vivaspin-4 centrifugal concentrators (molecular weight cut-off, 10,000; Vivascience). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Superose-6HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and was eluted with the equilibration buffer described above. For complete purification of the TatAdCd complex, the sample of solubilized membrane was subjected to Q-Sepharose chromatography before the Streptactin and Superose-6HR chromatography steps; the method was as described in Ref. 13Bolhuis A.

The Strep-tag II on TatCd was detected directly using a Streptactin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Institut fur Bioanalytik). SufI, a Tat-dependent substrate of E. coli, was visualized using specific antibodies (kindly provided by T. Palmer).

The membranes were prepared as described above and solubilized in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 750 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, and 2% (w/v) digitonin. Solubilized membranes and purified protein were loaded and separated on a polyacrylamide gradient gel (5–13%). The proteins were detected by immunoblotting as described above.TMAO Reductase Activity and TorA-GFP Assays—TMAO reductase activity assay was performed as described previously (13Bolhuis A.

E. coli cells were grown anaerobically until mid-exponential growth phase prior to fractionation into periplasmic, cytoplasmic, and membrane fractions. The cell fractions were loaded and separated on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel that was subsequently assayed for TMAO reductase activity as described previously. For TorA-GFP export assays, a construct comprising the TorA signal peptide linked to GFP (30Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol,. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was expressed using the pBAD-24 plasmid as previously described (31Barrett C.M.L. Ray N. Thomas J.D. Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For these experiments, TatAdCd was expressed from the compatible pEXT22 vector.Microscopy—Images were recorded with a Leica DMRE microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal unit and an argon laser. The 488-nm laser line was selected, and the images were recorded with a photomultiplier using the Leica confocal software. The samples were visualized with a 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.4; Leica). The image size is 512 × 512 pixels, and the images were averaged from four successive scans.RESULTSOverexpressed TatAdCd Forms an Active Translocation Pathway in E. coli—We set out to determine whether overexpressed TatAdCd can form an active translocation pathway in E. coli, to use a single defined background for comparing Tat systems from Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. The tatAdCd genes were expressed in an E. coli tat null mutant (ΔtatABCDE), and we conducted a TMAO reductase activity assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TMAO reductase (TorA) is a periplasmic protein required for growth of E. coli on a minimal TMAO and glycerol medium. It is a known E. coli Tat substrate that is frequently used for Tat export assays because its presence can be detected through an assay using methyl-viologen-linked reduction on a native polyacrylamide gel. TatAdCd was overexpressed from plasmid pBAdCd in ΔABCDE cells under anaerobic conditions, after which the cells were fractionated, and TorA was localized as shown in Fig. 1.The right-hand sets of lanes in Fig. 1 show control tests in which the wild type E. coli strains, MC1061 and MC4100 (from which the ΔABCDE strain was derived) were fractionated into membrane, cytoplasm, and periplasm samples (lanes M, C, and P, respectively). The data show that the TorA activity is localized primarily in the periplasm as expected, with low levels found in the cytoplasm as is often observed (13Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the ΔABCDE strain (denoted Δtat), no periplasmic activity is detected, and TorA is found exclusively in the cytoplasm. Expression of plasmid-borne E. coli TatABC in this strain (from the pBAD-ABC vector) restores export activity as expected. The important point is that expression of B. subtilis TatAdCd, using the same vector, also leads to efficient export of TorA. Clearly, TatAdCd is able to form an active translocation pathway in the E. coli ΔABCDE strain, and this is the first demonstration that a TatAC-type system from a Gram-positive organism can function in a Gram-negative background and export authentic E. coli Tat substrates. Moreover, because TatB has been found to be essential for TorA translocation in E. coli (32Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), this strongly suggests that B. subtilis TatAd displays both TatA and TatB activity.Overexpression of TatAdCd Does Not Fully Complement E. coli ΔABCDE Cells in Tat-dependent Substrate Translocation—Although repeated tests consistently showed TatAdCd to be capable of efficiently exporting TorA, it was considered important to analyze its ability to also export other substrates. We first tested whether the cells can export a fusion protein comprising the TorA signal peptide linked to GFP. This fusion is exported by the Tat pathway in E. coli (30Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol,. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 31Barrett C.M.L. Ray N. Thomas J.D. Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We expressed TorA-GFP in E. coli ΔABCDE cells and coexpressed tatAdCd or E. coli tatABC on the compatible pEXT22 plasmid as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were fractionated into membrane, cytoplasm, and periplasm fractions, and the data are shown in Fig. 2A. In control tests (Fig. 2A, wild type panel), GFP is found as mature size protein in the periplasm (P) when expressed in wild type cells. Some mature size protein is also found in the cytoplasm, but we have observed this phenomenon before and concluded that it is due to proteolytic clipping of the precursor form (31Barrett C.M.L. Ray N. Thomas J.D. Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The TorA-GFP accumulates exclusively in the cytoplasm when expressed in a tat null mutant (Δtat panel), again mostly as mature size protein. The remaining panels show that the protein is exported if either E. coli TatABC or B. subtilis TatAdCd is coexpressed in a Δtat background. High levels of mature protein are present in the periplasm in both cases, confirming efficient export.FIGURE 2Expression of B. subtilis TatAdCd leads to export of TorA-GFP. A construct comprising the TorA signal peptide linked to GFP (TorA-GFP) was expressed from the pBAD-24 plasmid in wild type MC4100 cells, ΔtatABCDE cells (Δtat), and ΔtatABCDE cells expressing E. coli TatABC or B. subtilis TatAdCd (using the compatible pEXT22 plasmid). A, cells were fractionated into membrane, cytoplasm, and periplasm samples (M, C, and P, respectively) that were immunoblotted using anti-GFP antibodies. The mobilities of mature size GFP and the precursor form (Pre) are indicated. B, cells were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The scale bar is 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data were confirmed by confocal microscopy of the cells as shown in Fig. 2B. Clear periplasmic halos of GFP fluorescence are evident when the TorA-GFP is expressed in wild type cells or in cells expressing TatAdCd or E. coli TatABC. In contrast, the fluorescence is purely cytoplasmic when the construct is expressed in ΔtatABCDE cells.Fig. 2B also illustrates an important point regarding the ability of the TatAdCd system to export other substrates. Two Tat substrates in E. coli, amidase A and C, have been shown to be involved in cytokinesis (33Bernhardt T.G. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These substrates are mislocalized in a ΔABCDE deletion strain causing a distorted cell division phenotype; as a result the cells grow in long chain-like filaments (34Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The wild type phenotype is clearly restored by complementing the ΔABCDE strain with plasmid-borne TatABC (TatABC image). However, expression of B. subtilis TatAdCd also restores the wild type cell division phenotype (TatAdCd panel), strongly suggesting that the TatAdCd complex of B. subtilis is able to translocate one or both of the amidase A and C proteins.We also analyzed the translocation of SufI, another authentic E. coli Tat substrate, in the E. coli ΔABCDE deletion strain complemented with B. subtilis TatAdCd (Fig. 3). The mature size, 50-kDa SufI protein is clearly detected in the periplasm (P) of wild type MC4100 cells with some precursor protein apparent in the cytoplasmic fraction (C). An additional band slightly smaller than mature SufI is also detected in the membrane fraction (M), although the significance of this band is unclear. As expected, deletion of the E. coli Tat machinery resulted in accumulation of SufI in the cytoplasm (Δtat panel). In this case, export could not be restored by expression of TatAdCd of B. subtilis (Δtat/pBAdCd panel), with no SufI detected in the periplasm. We conclude that not all Tat-dependent substrates of E. coli can be translocated by this AC-type translocase.FIGURE 3SufI is not transported by B. subtilis TatAdCd. Membrane, cytoplasm, and periplasm samples (M, C, and P, respectively) were prepared and analyzed from wild type E. coli cells (MC4100 panel), from ΔtatABCDE cells (Δtat) and from ΔtatABCDE cells expressing B. subtilis TatAdCd from plasmid pBAdCd as indicated. The samples were immunoblotted using antibodies to E. coli SufI, the mobility of which is indicated.

https://openalex.org/W1965938141,"The Nef protein acts as critical factor during HIV pathogenesis by increasing HIV replication in vivo via the modulation of host cell vesicle transport and signal transduction processes. Recent studies suggested that Nef alters formation and function of immunological synapses (IS), thereby modulating exogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation to balance between partial T cell activation required for HIV-1 spread and prevention of activation induced cell death. Alterations of IS function by Nef include interference with cell spreading and actin polymerization upon TCR engagement, a pronounced intracellular accumulation of the Src kinase Lck and its reduced IS recruitment. Here we use a combination of Nef mutagenesis and pharmacological inhibition to analyze the relative contribution of these effects to Nef mediated alterations of IS organization and function on TCR stimulatory surfaces. Inhibition of actin polymerization and IS recruitment of Lck were governed by identical Nef determinants and correlated well with Nef's association with Pak2 kinase activity. In contrast, Nef mediated Lck endosomal accumulation was separable from these effects, occurred independently of Pak2, required integrity of the microtubule rather than the actin filament system and thus represents a distinct Nef activity. Finally, reduction of TCR signal transmission by Nef was linked to altered actin remodeling and Lck IS recruitment but did not require endosomal Lck rerouting. Thus, Nef affects IS function via multiple independent mechanisms to optimize virus replication in the infected host."
https://openalex.org/W2071305268,"Background The variation of venom composition with geography is an important aspect of intraspecific variability in the Vipera genus, although causes of this variability remain unclear. The diversity of snake venom is important both for our understanding of venomous snake evolution and for the preparation of relevant antivenoms to treat envenomations. A geographic intraspecific variation in snake venom composition was recently reported for Vipera aspis aspis venom in France. Since 1992, cases of human envenomation after Vipera aspis aspis bites in south-east France involving unexpected neurological signs were regularly reported. The presence of genes encoding PLA2 neurotoxins in the Vaa snake genome led us to investigate any neurological symptom associated with snake bites in other regions of France and in neighboring countries. In parallel, we used several approaches to characterize the venom PLA2 composition of the snakes captured in the same areas. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted an epidemiological survey of snake bites in various regions of France. In parallel, we carried out the analysis of the genes and the transcripts encoding venom PLA2s. We used SELDI technology to study the diversity of PLA2 in various venom samples. Neurological signs (mainly cranial nerve disturbances) were reported after snake bites in three regions of France: Languedoc-Roussillon, Midi-Pyrénées and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. Genomes of Vipera aspis snakes from south-east France were shown to contain ammodytoxin isoforms never described in the genome of Vipera aspis from other French regions. Surprisingly, transcripts encoding venom neurotoxic PLA2s were found in snakes of Massif Central region. Accordingly, SELDI analysis of PLA2 venom composition confirmed the existence of population of neurotoxic Vipera aspis snakes in the west part of the Massif Central mountains. Conclusions/Significance The association of epidemiological studies to genetic, biochemical and immunochemical analyses of snake venoms allowed a good evaluation of the potential neurotoxicity of snake bites. A correlation was found between the expression of neurological symptoms in humans and the intensity of the cross-reaction of venoms with anti-ammodytoxin antibodies, which is correlated with the level of neurotoxin (vaspin and/or ammodytoxin) expression in the venom. The origin of the two recently identified neurotoxic snake populations is discussed according to venom PLA2 genome and transcriptome data."
https://openalex.org/W2026853987,"Influenza A virus NS1 protein stimulates host-cell phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling by binding to the p85β regulatory subunit of PI3K. Here, in an attempt to establish a mechanism for this activation, we report further on the functional interaction between NS1 and p85β. Complex formation was found to be independent of NS1 RNA binding activity and is mediated by the C-terminal effector domain of NS1. Intriguingly, the primary direct binding site for NS1 on p85β is the inter-SH2 domain, a coiled-coil structure that acts as a scaffold for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. In vitro kinase activity assays, together with protein binding competition studies, reveal that NS1 does not displace p110 from the inter-SH2 domain, and indicate that NS1 can form an active heterotrimeric complex with PI3K. In addition, it was established that residues at the C terminus of the inter-SH2 domain are essential for mediating the interaction between p85β and NS1. Equivalent residues in p85α have previously been implicated in the basal inhibition of p110. However, such p85α residues were unable to substitute for those in p85β with regards NS1 binding. Overall, these data suggest a model by which NS1 activates PI3K catalytic activity by masking a normal regulatory element specific to the p85β inter-SH2 domain.

Class IA PI3Ks are dimeric enzymes consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit tethered to a smaller, non-catalytic, regulatory subunit (typically p85α or p85β). The interaction of p85 with p110 functions to both stabilize heat-labile p110, and suppress its enzymatic activity (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, within cells, p85 and p110 proteins exist as obligate heterodimers (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M.

All the domains of p85 contribute to the regulation of p110, and stimulatory signals (such as growth factors and hormones) act through multiple mechanisms in order to modulate the basal inhibition of PI3K. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of consensus YXXM motifs in activated growth factor receptors (or their specific adapter substrates) provides docking sites for the two p85 SH2 domains, and relieves the effect of p85 on p110 (6Carpenter C.L.

Additionally, binding of GTPases (such as Cdc42 and Rac) to the p85 BH domain, or binding of Src family kinases to the p85 proline-rich motifs, have also been shown to increase the activity of the p85:p110 heterodimer (8Tolias K.F.

In contrast, a novel adapter protein, Ruk, interacts with the N-terminal SH3 domain of p85 and negatively regulates PI3K function (11Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B. Filonenko V. Matsuka G. Davies A.M. Waterfield M. Buchman V.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct phosphorylations of p85 also determine p110 activity: Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 688 alleviates p110 inhibition (12Cuevas B.D. Lu Y. Mao M. Zhang J. LaPushin R. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27455-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), while autophosphorylation of serine 608 restores inhibition (13Foukas L.C. Beeton C.A. Jensen J. Phillips W.A. Shepherd P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, docking of adapter proteins to particular domains, or phosphorylation of key residues, probably induces conformational changes in p85 that are somehow transmitted to p110 and direct its catalytic activity.It is clear that many important chronic- and acute-disease causing viruses hijack the PI3K signaling pathway to facilitate their efficient replication (reviewed in Ref. 14Cooray S. J Gen Virol. 2004; 85: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As a parallel to the host-cell regulatory control of PI3K, viruses also activate this pathway by a variety of mechanisms. For example, tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the middle-T antigen of polyoma virus act to bind the SH2 domains of p85 and consequently stimulate PI3K activity (15Ichaso N. Dilworth S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus interacts with the SH3 domain of p85 to release p85-mediated inhibition of p110 (16Street A. Macdonald A. Crowder K. Harris M. J. Biol.

This effect is mediated solely by the viral non-structural (NS1) protein (18Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H. Lamb R.A. Randall R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NS1 functionally interacts with a plethora of viral and host-cell factors (summarized in Fig. 1B), although in virus-infected cells a major role for NS1 is to limit host innate immunity (reviewed in Ref. 23Garcia-Sastre A.

Under tissue culture conditions, NS1-mediated PI3K activation is clearly important for the efficient propagation of some (but not all) strains of influenza A virus (18Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H.

Indeed, recent data from other groups suggest that active PI3K signaling may contribute to the reduced induction of apoptosis in influenza A virus-infected cells (21Zhirnov O.P. Klenk H.D. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Shin Y.K. Li Y. Liu Q. Anderson D.H. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. J.

Foukas L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 194-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), together with the unique isoform selectivity displayed by NS1 (18Hale B.G.

Zhou Y. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12730-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is likely that other cell type-specific consequences of NS1-activated PI3K may also exist.Previously, we have demonstrated that two amino acid residues in the C-terminal effector domain of NS1 (tyrosine 89 and methionine 93) are necessary for binding p85β (18Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H. Lamb R.A. Randall R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Here, in an attempt to derive the mechanism by which NS1 activates PI3K, we report further on the domains of NS1 and p85β that mediate the interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Antibodies—293T, 1321N1, and 1321N1 cells stably expressing the V5-tagged influenza A virus NS1 protein (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34; PR8) or the V5-tagged NS1-Y89F mutant, have been detailed previously (18Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H. Lamb R.A. Randall R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-V5 and anti-p85β antibodies were purchased from Serotec, mouse anti-HA was from BabCo, and rabbit anti-Myc antibody was from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-NS1 antibody was generated against recombinant full-length PR8/NS1 protein expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service).Plasmids—Mammalian expression vectors for C-terminally V5-tagged wild-type PR8/NS1 and PR8/NS1-Y89F have been described previously (18Hale B.G.

Arginine 38 and lysine 41 were both changed to alanine by PCR mutagenesis of the relevant wild-type PR8/NS1 cDNA. Tyrosine 89 was changed to glutamic acid by a similar procedure. For mammalian expression vectors encoding N-terminally Myc-tagged domains of bovine p85β, cDNA fragments corresponding to each domain (SH3 (amino acids 1–100), nSH2 (amino acids 313–433), iSH2 (amino acids 433–610), and cSH2 (amino acids 611–724)) were amplified by PCR from pMT2.bov.p85β (provided by B. Vanhaesebroeck (Queen Mary University of London, UK)) and ligated between the NcoI and SpeI sites of pEFTag. Vectors for the E. coli expression of GST-PR8/NS1 and GST-PR8/NS1-Y89F were as before (18Hale B.G. Jackson D. Chen Y.H. Lamb R.A. Randall R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To create GST-PR8/NS1Δ72, cDNA encoding residues 73–230 of PR8/NS1 was amplified from an existing vector by PCR using specific primers. The forward primer also contained nucleotides (GAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCGCC) coding for the cleavage sequence of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. The digested PCR product was ligated between the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). For His6-tagged α-iSH2 (amino acids 440–616), His6-tagged β-iSH2 (amino acids 433–610), and His6-tagged β-564 (amino acids 433–564), the relevant cDNAs were PCR amplified from pCDNA3.bov.p85α (provided by B. Vanhaesebroeck, Queen Mary University of London, UK) or pMT2.bov.p85β (as appropriate), and ligated between the NcoI and NotI sites of pEHISTEV (provided by H. Lui, University of St. Andrews, UK). His6-tagged β/α-iSH2 was generated by 4-primer overlap PCR from the above plasmids, where the overlapping nucleotide sequence used for both p85α-iSH2 and p85β-iSH2 was GACAAGCGCATGAACAGC. Subsequently digested products were also ligated between the NcoI and NotI sites of pEHISTEV. His6-tagged PR8/NS1 was generated by partially digesting pGEX`TEV'PR8/NS1 with NcoI/NotI and ligating the ∼700-bp fragment into the corresponding sites of linearized pEHISTEV. The pGADT7.p110α-ABD plasmid (expressing HA-tagged p110α-ABD) was a kind gift from M. DeFrances (University of Pittsburgh) (27Zhu Z. He X. Johnson C. Stoops J. Eaker A.E. Stoffer D.S. Bell A.

The integrity of all newly generated constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Preparation of Cell Lysates and in Vitro PI3K Assays—Monolayers from 6-well plates were fixed and lysed by addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% v/v Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 at 4 °C, supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cell debris was centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g (4 °C), and lysate supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at –80 °C. For analysis, cell lysates were mixed for ∼2 h at 4°C with 10 μg of anti-V5 antibody pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation, washed, and analyzed for PI3K activity as described (28Batty I.H. Fleming I.N. Downes C.P. Biochem.

Plasmids encoding the relevant GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli strain BL-21 (DE3) and used to capture baculovirus-expressed proteins as before (18Hale B.G. Jackson D.

His6-tagged proteins were similarly expressed in BL-21 (DE3), but purified using Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare). Elution of GST-tagged proteins from glutathione-agarose was done using 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl (final pH adjusted to 7.6). Elution of His6-tagged proteins from Ni-NTA resin was done using 100 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl. As necessary, cleavage by recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen) was carried out overnight at room temperature with accompanying dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (ratio 50:1 protein:enzyme).Immunoprecipitations and SDS-PAGE Analysis—Plasmid transfection into mammalian cells, subsequent immunoprecipitations, and SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis were all performed as before (18Hale B.G.

T7-dependent in vitro translations were carried out using the TnT® Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). As required, [35S]methionine (1 μCi per μl of reaction mixture) was used to generate radiolabeled proteins.RESULTSThe RNA-binding Domain of NS1 Is Not Essential for the Interaction with p85β—The ability of influenza A virus NS1 protein to bind RNA has been mapped to a number of basic residues in the first 73 amino acids of the protein (29Qian X.Y. Chien C.Y. Lu Y. Montelione G.T. Krug R.M. Rna. 1995; 1: 948-956PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang W. Riedel K. Lynch P. Chien C.Y. Montelione G.T. Krug R.M. Rna. 1999; 5: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In particular, arginine 38 probably interacts directly with the RNA target, while lysine 41 contributes significantly toward binding affinity (30Wang W. Riedel K. Lynch P. Chien C.Y. Montelione G.T.

GST-PR8/NS1 fusion proteins (WT, Y89F, or Δ72) were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads and used to affinity isolate an excess of baculovirus-expressed p85β. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining revealed that a single 90-kDa protein (p85β) was specifically isolated by both WT GST-PR8/NS1 and GST-PR8/NS1Δ72, but not by the GST-PR8/NS1-Y89F mutant (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the C-terminal effector domain of NS1 alone is sufficient to form a stable complex with p85β.NS1 Binds the Inter-SH2 Domain of p85β—To determine the domain of p85β that NS1 targets, we generated N-terminal Myc-tagged constructs corresponding to four domains of p85β: SH3 (amino acids 1–100), nSH2 (amino acids 313–433), iSH2 (amino acids 433–610), and cSH2 (amino acids 611–724). Transient expression of these constructs in 293T cells was followed by affinity isolation using E. coli-expressed WT GST-PR8/NS1. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody revealed that only the inter-SH2 domain of p85β (herein referred to as β-iSH2) was pulled-down by GST-PR8/NS1 (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3NS1 binds the inter-SH2 domain of p85β. A, 293T cells were transfected for 48 h with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged domain constructs of p85β: SH3, nSH2, iSH2, or cSH2. Soluble antigen extracts were mixed with GST-NS1 glutathione-agarose beads and the resulting pull-downs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using an anti-Myc mAb. Input GST-NS1 amount was confirmed by detecting NS1 with a specific pAb. The original soluble antigen extracts were also probed with an anti-Myc mAb in order to assess relative expression of the Myc-tagged constructs. B, in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled β-iSH2 was mixed with unlabeled PR8/NS1 and immunoprecipitated using anti-NS1 pAb. Immunoprecipitation of β-iSH2 alone acted as a negative control. Protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE through 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels and subjected to phosphorimager analysis. Note that these in vitro translations produce both full-length His6-tagged β-iSH2 (upper band) and untagged β-iSH2 (lower band). C, inter-SH2 domain of p85β is the primary site of interaction for NS1. GST-NS1 immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads was mixed with 2-fold increasing amounts of purified His6-tagged β-iSH2 (E. coli expressed). After washing, a fixed amount of soluble p85β-expressing Sf9 cell lysate was added. Subsequent protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and GST-NS1 and β-iSH2 were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.

(Note that: (i) unlabeled PR8/NS1 was used because of the similar molecular weights of PR8/NS1 and β-iSH2; and (ii) β-iSH2 synthesized using this system is expressed in two forms: full-length His6-tagged β-iSH2 and untagged β-iSH2.) SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimager analysis showed that both forms of β-iSH2 were efficiently precipitated from lysate mixtures containing both β-iSH2 and PR8/NS1, but not from lysates containing β-iSH2 only (Fig. 3B). In addition, we also expressed and purified a recombinant His6-tagged form of β-iSH2 from E. coli (see construct in Fig. 4A), and assessed its ability to compete with full-length p85β for the binding of WT GST-PR8/NS1. As shown in Fig. 3C, the binding of increasing amounts of β-iSH2 to E. coli expressed GST-PR8/NS1 prevented the subsequent interaction of GST-PR8/NS1 with baculovirus-expressed p85β. Overall, these data reveal that β-iSH2 is the primary site of interaction between NS1 and p85β.FIGURE 4Purification of an untagged NS1Δ72:β-iSH2 complex.

https://openalex.org/W2067561877,"In response to bacterial infection, the neutrophil NADPH oxidase assembles on phagolysosomes to catalyze the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen, forming superoxide and downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS). The active oxidase is composed of a membrane-bound cytochrome together with three cytosolic phox proteins, p40(phox), p47(phox), and p67(phox), and the small GTPase Rac2, and is regulated through a process involving protein kinase C, MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The role of p40(phox) remains less well defined than those of p47(phox) and p67(phox). We investigated the biological role of p40(phox) in differentiated PLB-985 neutrophils, and we show that depletion of endogenous p40(phox) using lentiviral short hairpin RNA reduces ROS production and impairs bacterial killing under conditions where p67(phox) levels remain constant. Biochemical studies using a cytosol-reconstituted permeabilized human neutrophil cores system that recapitulates intracellular oxidase activation revealed that depletion of p40(phox) reduces both the maximal rate and total amount of ROS produced without altering the K(M) value of the oxidase for NADPH. Using a series of mutants, p47PX-p40(phox) chimeras, and deletion constructs, we found that the p40(phox) PX domain has phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)-dependent and -independent functions. Translocation of p67(phox) requires the PX domain but not 3-phosphoinositide binding. Activation of the oxidase by p40(phox), however, requires both PtdIns(3)P binding and an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain competent to bind to poly-Pro ligands. Mutations that disrupt the closed auto-inhibited form of full-length p40(phox) can increase oxidase activity approximately 2.5-fold above that of wild-type p40(phox) but maintain the requirement for PX and SH3 domain function. We present a model where p40(phox) translocates p67(phox) to the region of the cytochrome and subsequently switches the oxidase to an activated state dependent upon PtdIns(3)P and SH3 domain engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2063961010,"Background It has been recognized that modular organization pervades biological complexity. Based on network analysis, ‘party hubs’ and ‘date hubs’ were proposed to understand the basic principle of module organization of biomolecular networks. However, recent study on hubs has suggested that there is no clear evidence for coexistence of ‘party hubs’ and ‘date hubs’. Thus, an open question has been raised as to whether or not ‘party hubs’ and ‘date hubs’ truly exist in yeast interactome. Methodology In contrast to previous studies focusing on the partners of a hub or the individual proteins around the hub, our work aims to study the network motifs of a hub or interactions among individual proteins including the hub and its neighbors. Depending on the relationship between a hub's network motifs and protein complexes, we define two new types of hubs, ‘motif party hubs’ and ‘motif date hubs’, which have the same characteristics as the original ‘party hubs’ and ‘date hubs’ respectively. The network motifs of these two types of hubs display significantly different features in spatial distribution (or cellular localizations), co-expression in microarray data, controlling topological structure of network, and organizing modularity. Conclusion By virtue of network motifs, we basically solved the open question about ‘party hubs’ and ‘date hubs’ which was raised by previous studies. Specifically, at the level of network motifs instead of individual proteins, we found two types of hubs, motif party hubs (mPHs) and motif date hubs (mDHs), whose network motifs display distinct characteristics on biological functions. In addition, in this paper we studied network motifs from a different viewpoint. That is, we show that a network motif should not be merely considered as an interaction pattern but be considered as an essential function unit in organizing modules of networks."
https://openalex.org/W2070830713,"Preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes through approximately two rounds of mitosis, referred to as mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), but the events early in the differentiation process are not fully understood. Previously, we identified and characterized a novel gene, fad24 (factor for adipocyte differentiation 24), induced to express at the early stages of adipocyte differentiation. Although fad24 clearly has crucial roles in adipogenesis, its precise functions remain unknown. Here we show that the knockdown of fad24 by RNAi in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes repressed MCE. Moreover, FAD24 interacts with HBO1, a histone acetyltransferase and positive regulator of DNA replication initiation. The knockdown of hbo1 repressed MCE and adipogenesis, indicating that FAD24 acts in concert with HBO1 to promote adipogenesis by controlling DNA replication. Regarding the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of DNA replication by fad24, we revealed that FAD24 co-localizes with HBO1 to chromatin during late mitosis, which is when the prereplication initiation complex is assembled. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that FAD24 localizes to origins of DNA replication with HBO1. When fad24 expression was inhibited during adipocyte differentiation, the recruitment of HBO1 to origins of DNA replication was reduced. Thus, FAD24 controls DNA replication by recruiting HBO1 to origins of DNA replication and is required for MCE during adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2006739494,"Background Insulin stimulates cerebrocortical beta and theta activity in lean humans. This effect is reduced in obese individuals indicating cerebrocortical insulin resistance. In the present study we tested whether insulin detemir is a suitable tool to restore the cerebral insulin response in overweight humans. This approach is based on studies in mice where we could recently demonstrate increased brain tissue concentrations of insulin and increased insulin signaling in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex following peripheral injection of insulin detemir. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied activity of the cerebral cortex using magnetoencephalography in 12 lean and 34 overweight non-diabetic humans during a 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (each step 90 min) with human insulin (HI) and saline infusion (S). In 10 overweight subjects we additionally performed the euglycemic clamp with insulin detemir (D). While human insulin administration did not change cerebrocortical activity relative to saline (p = 0.90) in overweight subjects, beta activity increased during D administration (basal 59±3 fT, 1st step 62±3 fT, 2nd step 66±5, p = 0.001, D vs. HI). As under this condition glucose infusion rates were lower with D than with HI (p = 0.003), it can be excluded that the cerebral effect is the consequence of a systemic effect. The total effect of insulin detemir on beta activity was not different from the human insulin effect in lean subjects (p = 0.78). Conclusions/Significance Despite cerebrocortical resistance to human insulin, insulin detemir increased beta activity in overweight human subjects similarly as human insulin in lean subjects. These data suggest that the decreased cerebral beta activity response in overweight subjects can be restored by insulin detemir."

Here, we set out to model the gene network that controls T-cell activation in humans, which is critical for the development of autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The network was established on the basis of the quantitative expression from 104 individuals of 20 genes of the immune system, as well as on biological information from the Ingenuity database and Bayesian inference. Of the 31 links (gene interactions) identified in the network, 18 were identified in the Ingenuity database and 13 were new and we validated 7 of 8 interactions experimentally. In the MS patients network, we found an increase in the weight of gene interactions related to Th1 function and a decrease in those related to Treg and Th2 function. Indeed, we found that IFN-ß therapy induces changes in gene interactions related to T cell proliferation and adhesion, although these gene interactions were not restored to levels similar to controls. Finally, we identify JAG1 as a new therapeutic target whose differential behaviour in the MS network was not modified by immunomodulatory therapy. In vitro treatment with a Jagged1 agonist peptide modulated the T-cell activation network in PBMCs from patients with MS. Moreover, treatment of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with the Jagged1 agonist ameliorated the disease course, and modulated Th2, Th1 and Treg function. This study illustrates how network analysis can predict therapeutic targets for immune intervention and identified the immunomodulatory properties of Jagged1 making it a new therapeutic target for MS and other autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2065802574,"Most NAE (nucleic acid enzyme) sensors are composed of an RNA-cleaving catalytic motif and an aptameric receptor. They operate by activating or repressing the catalytic activity of a relevant NAE through the conformational change in the aptamer upon target binding. To transduce a molecular recognition event to a fluorescence signal, a fluorophore-quencher pair is attached to opposite ends of the RNA substrate such that when the NAE cleaves the substrate, an increased level of fluorescence can be generated. However, almost all NAE sensors to date harbor either NAEs that cannot accommodate a fluorophore-quencher pair near the cleavage site or those that can accept such a modification but require divalent transition metal ions for catalysis. Therefore, the signaling magnitude and the versatility of current NAE sensors might not suffice for analytical and biological applications. Here we report an RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme, termed ‘MgZ’, which depends on Mg2+ for its activity and can accommodate bulky dye moieties next to the cleavage site. MgZ was created by in vitro selection. The selection scheme entailed acidic buffering and ethanol-based reaction stoppage to remove selfish DNAs. Characterization of MgZ revealed a three-way junction structure, a cleavage rate of 1 min−1, and 26-fold fluorescence enhancement. Two ligand-responsive NAE sensors were rationally designed by linking an aptamer sequence to the substrate of MgZ. In the absence of the target, the aptamer-linked substrate is locked into a conformation that prohibits MgZ from accessing the substrate. In the presence of the target, the aptamer releases the substrate, which induces MgZ-mediated RNA cleavage. The discovery of MgZ and the introduction of the above NAE sensor design strategy should facilitate future efforts in sensor engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2079934389,"Prophages are integrated viral forms in bacterial genomes that have been found to contribute to interstrain genetic variability. Many virulence-associated genes are reported to be prophage encoded. Present computational methods to detect prophages are either by identifying possible essential proteins such as integrases or by an extension of this technique, which involves identifying a region containing proteins similar to those occurring in prophages. These methods suffer due to the problem of low sequence similarity at the protein level, which suggests that a nucleotide based approach could be useful.Earlier dinucleotide relative abundance (DRA) have been used to identify regions, which deviate from the neighborhood areas, in genomes. We have used the difference in the dinucleotide relative abundance (DRAD) between the bacterial and prophage DNA to aid location of DNA stretches that could be of prophage origin in bacterial genomes. Prophage sequences which deviate from bacterial regions in their dinucleotide frequencies are detected by scanning bacterial genome sequences. The method was validated using a subset of genomes with prophage data from literature reports. A web interface for prophage scan based on this method is available at http://bicmku.in:8082/prophagedb/dra.html. Two hundred bacterial genomes which do not have annotated prophages have been scanned for prophage regions using this method.The relative dinucleotide distribution difference helps detect prophage regions in genome sequences. The usefulness of this method is seen in the identification of 461 highly probable loci pertaining to prophages which have not been annotated so earlier. This work emphasizes the need to extend the efforts to detect and annotate prophage elements in genome sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2032814621,"Diabetes is characterized by reduced thyroid function and altered myogenesis after muscle injury. Here we identify a novel component of thyroid hormone action that is repressed in diabetic rat muscle.We have identified a gene, named DOR, abundantly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart, whose expression is highly repressed in muscle from obese diabetic rats. DOR expression is up-regulated during muscle differentiation and its loss-of-function has a negative impact on gene expression programmes linked to myogenesis or driven by thyroid hormones. In agreement with this, DOR enhances the transcriptional activity of the thyroid hormone receptor TR(alpha1). This function is driven by the N-terminal part of the protein. Moreover, DOR physically interacts with TR( alpha1) and to T(3)-responsive promoters, as shown by ChIP assays. T(3) stimulation also promotes the mobilization of DOR from its localization in nuclear PML bodies, thereby indicating that its nuclear localization and cellular function may be related.Our data indicate that DOR modulates thyroid hormone function and controls myogenesis. DOR expression is down-regulated in skeletal muscle in diabetes. This finding may be of relevance for the alterations in muscle function associated with this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2041424119,"Background Much of the developing world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, exhibits high levels of morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, and malaria. With the increasing awareness that the aforementioned infectious diseases impose an enormous burden on developing countries, public health programs therein could benefit from parsimonious general-purpose forecasting methods to enhance infectious disease intervention. Unfortunately, these disease time-series often i) suffer from non-stationarity; ii) exhibit large inter-annual plus seasonal fluctuations; and, iii) require disease-specific tailoring of forecasting methods. Methodology/Principal Findings In this longitudinal retrospective (01/1996–06/2004) investigation, diarrhea, acute respiratory infection of the lower tract, and malaria consultation time-series are fitted with a general-purpose econometric method, namely the multiplicative Holt-Winters, to produce contemporaneous on-line forecasts for the district of Niono, Mali. This method accommodates seasonal, as well as inter-annual, fluctuations and produces reasonably accurate median 2- and 3-month horizon forecasts for these non-stationary time-series, i.e., 92% of the 24 time-series forecasts generated (2 forecast horizons, 3 diseases, and 4 age categories = 24 time-series forecasts) have mean absolute percentage errors circa 25%. Conclusions/Significance The multiplicative Holt-Winters forecasting method: i) performs well across diseases with dramatically distinct transmission modes and hence it is a strong general-purpose forecasting method candidate for non-stationary epidemiological time-series; ii) obliquely captures prior non-linear interactions between climate and the aforementioned disease dynamics thus, obviating the need for more complex disease-specific climate-based parametric forecasting methods in the district of Niono; furthermore, iii) readily decomposes time-series into seasonal components thereby potentially assisting with programming of public health interventions, as well as monitoring of disease dynamics modification. Therefore, these forecasts could improve infectious diseases management in the district of Niono, Mali, and elsewhere in the Sahel."

Across different face judgments and stimulus sets, the data is equivocal as to whether or not familiarity impacts recognition processes. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we examine the effect of real-world personal familiarity in three simple delayed-match-to-sample tasks in which subjects were required to match faces on the basis of orientation (upright v. inverted), gender and identity. We find that subjects had a significant speed advantage with familiar faces in all three tasks, with large effects for the gender and identity matching tasks. Conclusion/Significance Our data indicates that real-world experience with a face exerts a powerful influence on face processing in tasks where identity information is irrelevant, even in tasks that could in principle be solved via low-level cues.

https://openalex.org/W2005983535,"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis in mitochondria is an essential process and is conserved from yeast to humans. Several proteins with Fe-S cluster cofactors reside in mitochondria, including aconitase [4Fe-4S] and ferredoxin [2Fe-2S]. We found that mitochondria isolated from wild-type yeast contain a pool of apoaconitase and machinery capable of forming new clusters and inserting them into this endogenous apoprotein pool. These observations allowed us to develop assays to assess the role of nucleotides (GTP and ATP) in cluster biogenesis in mitochondria. We show that Fe-S cluster biogenesis in isolated mitochondria is enhanced by the addition of GTP and ATP. Hydrolysis of both GTP and ATP is necessary, and the addition of ATP cannot circumvent processes that require GTP hydrolysis. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that GTP must enter into the matrix to exert its effects on cluster biogenesis. Upon import into isolated mitochondria, purified apoferredoxin can also be used as a substrate by the Fe-S cluster machinery in a GTP-dependent manner. GTP is likely required for a common step involved in the cluster biogenesis of aconitase and ferredoxin. To our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating a role of GTP in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis."

Intriguing features of the IS are the formation of regions of plasma membrane fusion and the intercellular exchange of membrane fragments between the conjugated cells. It is not known whether upon IS formation, intact intracellular proteins can transfer from target cells to lymphocytes to allow the transmission of signals across cell boundaries. Here we show by both FACS and confocal microscopy that human lymphocytes acquire from the cells they scan the inner-membrane protein H-Ras, a G-protein vital for common lymphocyte functions and a prominent participant in human cancer. The transfer was cell contact-dependent and occurred in the context of cell-conjugate formation. Moreover, the acquisition of oncogenic H-RasG12V by natural killer (NK) and T lymphocytes had important biological functions in the adopting lymphocytes: the transferred H-RasG12V induced ERK phosphorylation, increased interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion, enhanced lymphocyte proliferation, and augmented NK-mediated target cell killing. Our findings reveal a novel mode of cell-to-cell communication-allowing lymphocytes to extend the confines of their own proteome-which may moreover play an important role in natural tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1992038098,"Background Evidence is emerging that molecular chaperones, in addition to their intracellular protein folding actions, can act as intercellular signaling proteins with an ability to modulate leukocyte function. Recent evidence has also shown that these proteins can exist in the circulation and may be involved in disease pathogenesis. We have used periodontitis and its treatment as a model of inflammation in the human to determine its effects on levels of circulating HSP10, HSP60 and BiP. Methodology/Principal Findings A group of periodontal patients and matched controls were examined at the beginning of the study and then at 1 day and 6 months following periodontal or control therapy. Plasma levels of HSP10, HSP60 and BiP were measured by immunoassay and related to other plasma measures of inflammation. Periodontal patients had significantly less circulating levels of HSP10 or BiP compared with the controls. In contrast, more periodontal patients had intermediate levels of HSP60. Treatment of the periodontitis caused an increase in plasma levels of HSP10 although it had no effect on BiP. Treatment had no influence of HSP60 levels. Plasma HSP10 levels after therapy correlated with markers of periodontal clinical improvement. Conclusions/Significance Circulating levels of molecular chaperones are influenced by local inflammation. HSP10 is known to be an anti-inflammatory factor. The marked decrease of this circulating protein in active inflammation and its recovery post-treatment suggests that it may have a role in controlling periodontal inflammation."

Previously, we defined two discrete minimal estradiol-modulated stability sequences (MEMSS) within the extensive 3′-untranslated region of estrogen receptor α mRNA with an in vitro stability assay using cytosolic extracts from sheep uterus. We report here that excess MEMSS RNA inhibited the enhanced stability of estrogen receptor α mRNA in extracts from estradiol-treated ewes compared with those from control ewes. Several estradiol-induced MEMSS-binding proteins were characterized by UV cross-linking in uterine extracts from ewes in a time course study (0, 8, 16, and 24 h after estradiol injection). The pattern of binding proteins changed at 16 h post-injection, concurrent with enhanced estrogen receptor α mRNA stability and the highest rate of accumulation of estrogen receptor α mRNA. The predominant MEMSS-binding protein induced by estradiol treatment was identified as AUF1 (A + U-rich RNA-binding factor 1) protein isoform p45 (a product of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D gene). Immunoblot analysis indicated that only two of four AUF1 protein isoforms were present in the uterine cytosolic extracts and that estradiol treatment strongly increased the ratio of AUF1 isoforms p45 to p37. Nonphosphorylated recombinant AUF1p45 protected estrogen receptor α mRNA in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. These studies describe estrogenic induction of AUF1p45 binding to the estrogen receptor α mRNA as a molecular mechanism for post-transcriptional up-regulation of gene expression.

The pattern of binding proteins changed at 16 h post-injection, concurrent with enhanced estrogen receptor α mRNA stability and the highest rate of accumulation of estrogen receptor α mRNA. The predominant MEMSS-binding protein induced by estradiol treatment was identified as AUF1 (A + U-rich RNA-binding factor 1) protein isoform p45 (a product of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D gene). Immunoblot analysis indicated that only two of four AUF1 protein isoforms were present in the uterine cytosolic extracts and that estradiol treatment strongly increased the ratio of AUF1 isoforms p45 to p37. Nonphosphorylated recombinant AUF1p45 protected estrogen receptor α mRNA in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. These studies describe estrogenic induction of AUF1p45 binding to the estrogen receptor α mRNA as a molecular mechanism for post-transcriptional up-regulation of gene expression. Estrogens are a family of hormones with important roles in reproduction as well as in cardiovascular, bone, and brain function. Estrogens potently regulate physiology by altering gene expression in sensitive tissues (1Tsai M.J. Clark J.H. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1998: 55-94Google Scholar). The estrogen responsiveness of a tissue can be determined by its expression of the two genes encoding estrogen receptors, ERα 2The abbreviations used are: ERestrogen receptorAREA + U-rich elementE2estradiol-17βMEMSSminimal estrogen modulated stability sequence(s)NRSnonimmune rabbit serumPRprogesterone receptorUTRuntranslated regionhspheat shock proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasenhEn hours previously treated with E2. and ERβ (2Hewitt S.C.

Clark J.H. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1998: 55-94Google Scholar). However, nontranscriptional mechanisms of estrogen regulation of gene expression have been elucidated more recently, and many of them involve the actions of kinases and phosphatases (1Tsai M.J. Clark J.H. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1998: 55-94Google Scholar, 3Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Expression of the ERα gene is tightly regulated by steroid hormones from the ovary in responsive tissues. In the uterus, expression of the ERα gene is 10-fold greater than that of ERβ (4Wang H. Masironi B. Eriksson H. Sahlin L. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Studies with knock-out mice and with ERα- and ERβ-specific ligands indicate that the uterine effects of estradiol (E2) depend primarily upon expression of the ERα gene (5Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Reproduction. 2003; 125: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 6Fritzemeier K.H. Hillisch A. Elger W. Kaufmann U. Kollenkirchen U. Kosemund D. Lindenthal B. Muller G. Muhn P. Nubbemeyer R. Peters O. Siebel P. Hegele-Hartung C. Ernst Schering Research Foundation Workshop. 2004; 46: 127-150Google Scholar). Therefore, the up-regulation of ERα gene expression in the uterus was the focus of our studies. Both mRNA and protein products of the ERα gene are short-lived, so that changes in their rates of synthesis and degradation rapidly alter tissue concentrations of ERα (7Nardulli A.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2038-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Kenealy M.R. Flouriot G. Sonntag-Buck V. Dandekar T. Brand H. Gannon F.

The preovulatory surge of E2 up-regulates concentrations of ERα mRNA and protein in the uterus. This regulation occurs in several E2-sensitive tissues across diverse species ranging from fish to mammals (10Ing N.H. Robertson J.A. Embryo Implantation: Molecular, Cellular, and Clinical Aspects.

Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). E2 is the only cellular signal known to up-regulate ERα gene expression. Our laboratory discovered that E2 up-regulates expression of the ERα gene in sheep uterus by stabilizing ERα mRNA. In ovariectomized ewes injected with a physiological dose of E2, ERα mRNA concentrations increased 5-fold in 24 h (13Ing N.H. Spencer T.E. Bazer F.W. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although E2 treatment did not alter the rate of ERα gene transcription, it specifically increased the half-life of ERα mRNA 3.5-fold (14Ing N.H. Ott T.L. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). E2 increased ERα mRNA concentrations throughout the endometrium and myometrium, with the most robust response in the deep endometrial glands and the adjacent myometrium (15Ing N.H. Tornesi M.B. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which we used exclusively in this report of studies of the molecular mechanism of E2 stabilization of ERα mRNA. Hormones commonly autoregulate the expression of their receptor genes by regulating the stability of the mRNA encoding their receptor protein (16Ing N.H. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Staton J.M. Thomson A.M. Leedman P.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In general, hormone receptor mRNAs are inherently unstable because they have very long 3′-UTRs that contain destabilizing sequence elements such as the A + U-rich element (ARE) (8Kenealy M.R. Flouriot G. Sonntag-Buck V. Dandekar T. Brand H. Gannon F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2805-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol.

Human and sheep ERα mRNAs carry 14 and 10 putative class I AREs, respectively (19Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), all of which are located within their extensive 3′-UTR sequences (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Androgen receptor mRNA carries a class III ARE sequence that regulates its stability in response to androgens (20Yeap B.B. Wilce J.A. Leedman P.J. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For ERα, androgen receptor, and many other hormone receptor genes, changes in mRNA stability are the predominant way their expression is regulated (16Ing N.H. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism for this post-transcriptional regulation remains to be defined. E2 is the hormone that is best known for effects on the stabilities of specific mRNAs (16Ing N.H. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In frog liver, E2 stabilizes vitellogenin mRNA by inducing vigilin protein (150 kDa) to bind specific sequences in the 3′-UTR of vitellogenin mRNA that are thereby protected from cleavage (22Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 129-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cunningham K.S. Dodson R.E. Nagel M.A. Shapiro D.J. Schoenberg D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12498-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In rat uteri, E2 stabilizes IER2 (immediate early response 2 gene) mRNA 4.5-fold by inducing binding of AUF1 (the A + U-rich binding factor 1, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D) to its 3′-UTR (24Arao Y.

Kayama F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2255-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the primary transcript of the AUF1 gene is alternatively spliced to produce four mRNAs that encode 37-, 40-, 42-, and 45-kDa proteins (26Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). All bind AREs, but AUF1p37 and AUF1p42 associate with destabilized mRNAs, which they direct to exosomes for degradation (27DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol.

In contrast, AUF1p40 and AUF1p45 carry a unique mRNA stabilizing domain and are found associated with stabilized mRNAs (19Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem.

These examples lead us to hypothesize that E2 treatment of ewes induces such uterine proteins to bind and stabilize ERα mRNA. Materials—Common reagents were obtained from Sigma. Molecular biology enzymes were from Promega (Piscataway, NJ), except for RNase A (Roche Applied Science), RNase T1 (Ambion; Austin, TX), and ExTaq polymerase (Takara Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). Radiolabeled [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]UTP (1412 Ci/mmol) were purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Antisera P1b and P3a were developed to synthetic peptides of AUF1 carried by specific AUF1 isoforms (44Tolnay M. Baranyi L. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P1b peptide was within exon 2 (which encodes the mRNA stabilization domain in AUF1p40 and AUF1p45), whereas the P3a peptide spanned the exon 6:8 junction (contained in AUF1p37 and AUF1p40). Pan-specific antiserum that was raised to native AUF1 proteins containing all four isoforms was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY), along with positive control HeLa cell nuclear extract. Antibodies for HuR (3A2) and hsp 70 (W27) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas antiserum to hsp 27 was obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Invitrogen. Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Pierce. Bradford reagent and prestained SDS-PAGE standards (low range) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Animal Treatments and Sample Collection—Adult cross-bred ewes (Ovis aries) with normal estrous cycles were ovariectomized during the breeding season and rested 4 weeks. The ewes were split into four treatment groups (n = 5 ewes in each group) and received 0.5 ml of charcoal stripped corn oil (“control ewes”) or 0.5 ml of oil containing 50 μg E2. The treated ewes were hysterectomized at 8, 16, and 24 h after E2-injection, whereas controls were hysterectomized at 24 h post-injection. After removal of superficial endometrial tissue, the remaining deep endometrium and inner layer of myometrium (“uterine tissue”) was dissected from residual outer myometrium and perimetrium. This tissue was used to make S100 uterine cytosolic extracts (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All of the animal procedures were approved by the Texas A & M University Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. RNAs and the in Vitro Stability Assay—The assay and radiolabeled MEMSS, 18 S rRNA, and non-E2-regulated RNAs were described previously (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The MEMSS-I and -II used here were previously referred to as MEMSS-C and -D, respectively. The ERα mRNA distal 3′-UTR fragment (274 bases that contain MEMSS-II) was produced from a template generated by PCR with primers: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGAATTAATAAGTG and 5′-AAGGTGCTTGAGCATCCC (T7 promoter underlined). Sense strand RNAs were produced with in vitro transcription reactions containing [32P]UTP. As a negative control for E2-enhanced stability in vitro, we cloned the distal region of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA (cognate of the ERα 3′-UTR RNA above). It was predicted from genomic sequences because it was missing from the human reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_ 000926). That sequence was only 5 kb long with 750 bases of 3′-UTR, whereas the major endogenous PR mRNAs in mammalian uteri are 7.1-14 kb in length (45Kraus W.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2371-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Human and bovine genomic sequences containing the PR gene were scanned for polyadenylation sites with POLYADQ and ERPIN software programs (46Tabaska J.E. Zhang M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 47Gautheret D. Lambert A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both predicted a strong polyadenylation site, conserved in human and bovine genomic sequences, that was consistent in location with the 3′ end of a 14-kb PR mRNA. BLAST results of the region identified numerous oligo(dT)-primed mammalian expressed sequence tags (e.g. DY756947) that ended immediately 3′ to the predicted polyadenylation site, confirming its function. PCR primers were designed with bovine sequences: 5′-CTGTCAAGAGGGTGAGACTC (sense) and 5′-CTCTGAAGTCTACCTCTAGT (antisense), to amplify a cDNA ending 182 bp upstream of the polyadenylation site. The 700-bp cDNA (GenBank™ accession number EU184862) was amplified from reverse transcribed mRNA from sheep uterus, cloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) and then subcloned with BamHI and XbaI into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pBS-PR3′-UTR plasmid was linearized with XbaI prior to T3 RNA polymerase transcribing the sense cRNA PR 3′-UTR. Gel-purified RNAs (10,000 cpm) were combined with 5 μg of cytosolic extract proteins in 10-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.4 mm MgAc, 60 mm KCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 80 nm spermine, 7% glycerol, and 5 μg of yeast tRNA. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, RNAs were purified with proteinase K, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation prior to separation on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gels alongside a sample of the input labeled RNA. Radioactive signals were recorded from the dried gels with a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The images within a figure were from the same gel/experiment and were adjusted for contrast identically. For competition assays, the unlabeled RNA competitor was added to the extracts before the addition of 32P-labeled MEMSS RNA (2500 cpm). UV Cross-linking—UV cross-linking was performed essentially as described by Thomson et al. (48Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Extract proteins (18 μg) were bound to 32P-labeled MEMSS RNA (800,000 cpm) in 10-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, and 0.1 μg of yeast tRNA. After binding for 10 min at room temperature, the RNA was cross-linked to the bound proteins using UV irradiation (10 min at 2-cm distance) in a CL-1000 UV cross-linker (UVP Inc., Upland, CA) followed by digestion with 1 μg/μl RNase A and 0.3 unit/μl RNase T1. The proteins (labeled with the remaining 32P RNA tags) were then separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were imaged as described above. Competition reactions used less protein (10 μg) and labeled MEMSS RNA (100,000 cpm) and had a preincubation step with the protein and unlabeled competitor MEMSS RNA for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of 32P-labeled MEMSS RNA. Negative control competitor RNA (pGEM) was produced by in vitro transcription from pGEM11Zf+ linearized with EcoRI using T7 RNA polymerase. Immunoblotting—Protein samples (20 μg) from three control ewes and three ewes treated with E2 24 h previously were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis was continued until the 34-kDa marker was at the gel bottom to separate the individual AUF1 isoforms for analyses. Replicate samples for HuR, hsp 27, and hsp 70 analyses were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE until the dye front reached the gel bottom. All of the gels were electroblotted to Hybond C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking, the blots were incubated with primary antibodies raised to human proteins. Antisera P1b and P3a were used at 1:300 dilutions (44Tolnay M. Baranyi L. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Commercial antibodies were used according to supplier instructions. The specificity of the antibodies was determined by comparing immunoreactive bands on the blots with duplicate blots probed with control nonimmune rabbit serum (NRS) used at the same dilutions as the antibodies (not shown). The blots were developed with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent substrate. The images were captured on a Fluorochem 8800 (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). The signals were quantitated with AlphaEaseFC software, version 3. Immunoprecipitation—UV cross-linking was performed in reactions that were scaled up to be four times larger than those used in other applications. Extract proteins from a ewe treated with E2 16 h previously were used. After the RNase digestion, the labeled proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation, similar to that described by Giles et al. (49Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2937-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Replicate samples were precleared by incubating with 1 μl of NRS for 1 h at room temperature, then incubating with 20 μl of protein A/G Plus beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional hour, and finally collecting and discarding the beads. The proteins in the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of P1b, P3a, pan-specific AUF1 antiserum or NRS in 80-μl reactions containing binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml)). After the antibodies bound proteins during a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, IgG complexes were collected on 20 μl of protein A/G Plus. The complexes bound to the beads were washed four times with 400 μl of binding buffer prior to separation on 12.5% SDS-PAGE alongside unprecipitated UV cross-linked proteins (1/10 of input). The dried gels were imaged as described above. Production, Purification, and Use of Recombinant Proteins—The full-length coding sequences of human AUF1p45 and AUF1p37 were subcloned from pcDNA3-AUF1p45 and pcDNA-AUF1p37 using PCR primers 5′-GGCGGATCCACTATGTCGGAGGAGCAGTTC (sense) and 5′-GGCGAATTCGCTTAGTATGGTTTGTAGCTATTTTGATG (antisense) according to Accuprime polymerase (Invitrogen) instructions. The 1050- and 846-bp cDNAs were restricted with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes (sites underlined in primers) and subcloned into those sites in the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). After clone validation in FB5α Escherichia coli cells, pGEX2T, pGEX2T-AUF1p45, pGEX2T-AUF1p37, and pGEX2T-HuR (49Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol.

Purification of the recombinant proteins from 500-ml cultures grown at 30 °C was performed on glutathione-agarose (50Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured in a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and purity was assessed on 10% SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 6A). The recombinant proteins or their buffer (20 mm reduced glutathione, 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 10% glycerol) composed 20% of the in vitro stability assay reactions. The recombinant proteins were preincubated with uterine extract proteins from control ewes (1.8 μg) in the stability assay buffer for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of radiolabeled ERα RNA (10,000 cpm) and a 5-min incubation at room temperature. Data Analyses—Quantitated data were analyzed by least squares analysis of variance using General Linear Models procedures of the Statistical Analysis System (51SAS. (1982) SAS User's Guide: Basics, Statistical Analysis System Institute, Inc., Cary NCGoogle Scholar). Significance was taken as p < 0.05. In Vivo E2 Treatment Stabilizes ERα mRNA in Uterine Extracts in Vitro—In the mRNA stability assay we developed (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), radiolabeled ERα mRNA was much more stable during incubations with uterine extracts from E2-treated ovariectomized ewes compared with extracts from control ewes. Fig. 1 demonstrates that a significantly larger percentage of the 3′-UTR fragment of ERα mRNA (pictured in the [en] extract lane at left) remained intact during duplicate incubations with extracts from two ewes treated with E2 24 h previously (E2-1 and E2-2 in the top panel) than during incubations with extracts from control ewes (Con-1 and Con-2). In the latter two, the ERα mRNA fragment was degraded to smaller RNA products (data not shown and Ref. 18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol.

In contrast, the majority of the cognate 3′-UTR fragment of PR mRNA was unstable in extracts from both E2-treated and control ewes (Fig. 1, middle panel). This was expected because the instability of endogenous PR mRNA in sheep uteri was not affected by E2 treatment (14Ing N.H. Ott T.L. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 18 S rRNA was relatively stable in all uterine extracts, consistent with previous reports of 18 S rRNA and β-globin mRNA (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A small degree of E2-enhanced stability for PR mRNA and 18 S rRNA appeared here and in previous data (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, when data from four control and four E2-treated ewes were compared, the difference in percentages of intact RNA remaining in extracts from E2-treated ewes compared with controls was by far the greatest (80-fold compared with control) for the ERα 3′-UTR and much less for PR 3′-UTR (4-fold) and 18 S rRNA (2-fold). The E2-enhanced stability of ERα mRNA in Fig. 1 was similar to that in extracts from superficial endometrium, whereas there was no E2 effect detected in liver extracts from the same ewes (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All together, we concluded that the uterine extracts in the in vitro assay reflected the E2-enhanced stability of ERα mRNA in vivo (13Ing N.H. Spencer T.E. Bazer F.W. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Ing N.H. Ott T.L. Biol.

Inhibition of E2-enhanced ERα mRNA Stability by Excess MEMSS RNAs Implicates One or More E2-induced Binding/Stabilizing Protein(s)—Previously, we identified two 82-base-long sequences named MEMSS within the 4354-base-long ERα mRNA 3′-UTR that 1) retained enhanced stability in extracts from E2-treated ewes and 2) conferred E2-enhanced stability when transferred to heterologous RNAs (18Mitchell D.C. Ing N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Uterine proteins from E2-treated ewes were implicated in the enhanced stability of ERα mRNA in vitro, because this function was ablated by pretreatment with proteinase K"
https://openalex.org/W2115633449,"The magnitude of negative selection on alleles involved in age-specific mortality decreases with age. This is the foundation of the evolutionary theory of senescence. Because of this decrease in negative selection with age, and because of the absence of reproduction after menopause, alleles involved in women's late-onset diseases are generally considered evolutionarily neutral. Recently, genetic and epidemiological data on alleles involved in late onset-diseases have become available. It is therefore timely to estimate selection on these alleles. Here, we estimate selection on BRCA1 alleles leading to susceptibility to late-onset breast and ovarian cancer. For this, we integrate estimates of the risk of developing a cancer for BRCA1-carriers into population genetics frameworks, and calculate selection coefficients on BRCA1 alleles for different demographic scenarios varying across the extent of human demography. We then explore the magnitude of negative selection on alleles leading to a diverse range of risk patterns, to capture a variety of late-onset diseases. We show that BRCA1 alleles may have been under significant negative selection during human history. Although the mean age of onset of the disease is long after menopause, variance in age of onset means that there are always enough cases occurring before the end of reproductive life to compromise the selective value of women carrying a susceptibility allele in BRCA1. This seems to be the case for an extended range of risk of onset functions varying both in mean and variance. This finding may explain the distribution of BRCA1 alleles' frequency, and also why alleles for many late-onset diseases, like certain familial forms of cancer, coronary artery diseases and Alzheimer dementia, are typically recent and rare. Finally, we discuss why the two most popular evolutionary theories of aging, mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy, may underestimate the effect of selection on survival at old ages."

ABCA1 facilitates free cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues. We investigated the effects of LDLR deletion (LDLR-/-) on ABCA1 expression. LDLR-/- macrophages had reduced basal levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and cholesterol efflux. A high fat diet increased cholesterol in LDLR-/- macrophages but not wild type cells. A liver X receptor (LXR) agonist induced expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and cholesterol efflux in both LDLR-/- and wild type macrophages, whereas expression of LXRα or LXRβ was similar. Interestingly, oxidized LDL induced more ABCA1 in wild type macrophages than LDLR-/- cells. LDL induced ABCA1 expression in wild type cells but inhibited it in LDLR-/- macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. However, lipoproteins regulated ABCG1 expression similarly in LDLR-/- and wild type macrophages. Cholesterol or oxysterols induced ABCA1 expression in wild type macrophages but had little or inhibitory effects on ABCA1 expression in LDLR-/- macrophages. Active sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1a (SREBP1a) inhibited ABCA1 promoter activity in an LXRE-dependent manner and decreased both macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Expression of ABCA1 in animal tissues was inversely correlated to active SREBP1. Oxysterols inactivated SREBP1 in wild type macrophages but not in LDLR-/- cells. Oxysterol synergized with nonsteroid LXR ligand induced ABCA1 expression in wild type macrophages but blocked induction in LDLR-/- cells. Taken together, our studies suggest that LDLR is critical in the regulation of cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression in macrophage. Lack of the LDLR impairs sterol-induced macrophage ABCA1 expression by a sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1-dependent mechanism that can result in reduced cholesterol efflux and lipid accumulation in macrophages under hypercholesterolemic conditions.

There is a high degree of correlation of plasma cholesterol levels with the incidence of coronary heart disease. It has been shown that plasma cholesterol homeostasis is dependent on ingestion, synthesis, and metabolism of cholesterol (1Calvert G.D. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1994; 24: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that both the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 3The abbreviations used are: LDLRlow density lipoprotein (LDL) receptorHDLhigh density lipoproteinAcLDLacetylated LDLOxLDLoxidized LDLABCA1ATP binding cassette transporter A1FHfamilial hypercholesterolemiaLXRliver X receptorLXRELXR response elementSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) play key regulatory roles in cellular cholesterol metabolism (2Defesche J.C.

The LDLR is a cell surface-glycoprotein that endocytoses cholesterol bound to LDL, and it is responsible for the clearance of about 70% of plasma LDL cholesterol in human liver (2Defesche J.C. Semin.

The LDLR also binds β-VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) and certain intermediate density lipoprotein and HDL (5Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L.

Human LDLR mutations cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a common autosomal dominant disorder that affects approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the heterozygous form with about a 2-fold elevation in plasma LDL cholesterol (6Civeira F.

It eventually leads to the formation of tendon xanthomas and atherosclerotic plaques (8Descamps O.S. Leysen X. Van L.F. Heller F.R. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 157: 514-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Clinically overt coronary heart disease caused by heterozygous FH is observed at an age of 45-48 years in males and of 55-58 years in females (9Ose L. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The homozygous FH patients are rare (∼1:106). However, when it occurs, one sees a 4-5-fold elevation in plasma LDL cholesterol with marked cutaneous tuberous xanthomas. Often, there are frequent myocardial infarctions at the age of 20-30 years (9Ose L. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In mice, genetic deletion of the LDLR (LDLR knock-out, LDLR-/-) will cause a moderate increase in plasma LDL cholesterol when these animals are fed a normal chow. However, a severe elevation of LDL plasma cholesterol is associated with aortic lesions when mice are fed a Western diet (10Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Thus, LDLR-/- mice are used as a model for the study of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and FH (11Jawien J. Nastalek P. Korbut R. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2004; 55: 503-517PubMed Google Scholar). ABCA1 and ABCG1 belong to the large family of ATP-binding cassette transporters. By using the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP, ABCA1 and ABCG1 facilitate cholesterol efflux from macrophages and other cell types to apoAI and/or HDL (12Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Nagata K. Yamamoto A. Matsuo M. Ueda K. Med. Mol. Morphol. 2005; 38: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ABCA1 mutations cause Tangier disease, characterized by very low levels of HDL cholesterol, poorly lipidated and rapidly catabolized apoAI, cholesteryl ester accumulation in peripheral tissues, and a high risk of development of coronary heart disease (13Bodzioch M.

Loading of wild type macrophages with lipoproteins or sterols can increase ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux, thus potentially preventing uncontrolled lipid accumulation and formation of lipid-laden macrophage/foam cells (21Cavelier L.B.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP1/2), the nuclei membrane-bound transcription factors, regulate expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, endocytosis of LDL, synthesis of fatty acids, and glucose metabolism. Activity of SREBPs is feedback inhibited by cellular sterol levels (30Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

However, a separate report suggests that binding of SREBP2 to the E-box does not alter the E-box activity (33Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Yahagi N. Yoshikawa T. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H.

Recently, it has been shown that SREBP2 is a positive regulator of ABCA1 expression in transfected CHO-7 cells (34Wong J. Quinn C.M. Brown A.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Expression of SREBP1 and SREBP2 is cell type-dependent. SREBP1c and SREBP2 are predominantly expressed by the liver (35Edwards P.A.

Because of the existence of the sterol regulatory element in promoters of SREBP1 and SREBP2, they may cross-regulate each other (36Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H.

Although the role of the LDLR in the mediation of uptake and clearance of LDL cholesterol by hepatocytes has been well defined, it is unclear if the LDLR plays a role in macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Cellular endocytosis of LDL cholesterol is reduced in the absence of the LDLR. However, deletion of LDLR leads to atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. In addition to the contribution by scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of modified LDL, we hypothesized that lesion development is also due to the defect in macrophage cholesterol efflux. In this study we tested the hypothesis that lack of LDLR will impair sterol-induced macrophage ABCA1 expression. We demonstrate for the first time that the LDLR plays an important role in regulating macrophage cholesterol efflux. We show that LDLR deletion reduces basal levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and cholesterol efflux from macrophages and significantly reduces sterol-induced ABCA1 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, we show that these effects are mediated by an abnormal response of SREBP1 to sterols. Reagents—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A high fat diet (21% fat and 0.2% cholesterol) was purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). [3H]Cholesterol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Total and free cholesterol assay kits were obtained from Wako Chemicals USA, Inc. (Richmond, VA). Rabbit anti-mouse ABCA1 and ABCG1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Novus Biologicals, Inc.

All other antibodies were polyclonal, and they were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—Adult mice (both wild type (C57BL) and LDLR knock-out with the same background as C57BL, 10-12 weeks) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in fully accredited facilities (Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) at Weill Cornell Medical College. Mice were injected intraperitoneal (3 ml/mouse) with 4% autoclaved thioglycolate solution and kept for 5 days with free access to drinking water and chow. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated by lavage of the abdomen with PBS (2 × 8 ml) after sacrifice. They were cultured (density at 300 × 103 cells/cm2) in complete RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. After 3 h culture, floating cells (most are red blood cells) were removed by washing with PBS. Adherent cells were maintained in complete medium. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice fed a normal chow except indicated. Determination of Free and Total Cholesterol Levels in Peritoneal Macrophages—Wild type or LDLR-/- mice at 10 weeks of age were fed a normal chow or a high fat diet for 4 weeks. Peritoneal macrophages from each mouse were individually collected. After extraction, macrophage cellular lipids were used to determine free and total cholesterol levels as described (38Han J.

Isolation of LDL and HDL and Preparation of ApoAI, Acetylated LDL (AcLDL), and Oxidized LDL (OxLDL)—LDL (1.019-1.063 g/ml) and HDL (1.063-1.21 g/ml) were isolated from normal human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, dialyzed against PBS containing 0.3 mm EDTA, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored under N2 gas at 4 °C. Protein content was determined by the Lowry method. ApoAI was isolated from purified HDL by removal of lipids with an extraction solution of acetone and ethanol (1:1) (39Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Purity of apoAI was determined by SDS-PAGE. AcLDL and OxLDL were prepared as described elsewhere (40Han J. Parsons M. Zhou X. Nicholson A.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Hajjar D.P. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Determination of Free Cholesterol Efflux from Macrophages—Macrophages in 12-well plates were labeled in macrophage serum-free medium (Invitrogen, 1.5 ml/well) containing 50 μg/ml AcLDL and 150 nCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h. After removal of labeling medium, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium, then switched to serum-free medium or medium containing purified apoAI or HDL (1.5 ml/well). After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, medium from each well was collected for the determination of radioactivity in the supernatants. Remaining cells in the wells and Eppendorf tubes were lysed by addition of 0.2 n NaOH, and the combined lysate was determined for protein content which was used to normalize cholesterol efflux (dpm/μg of protein). Northern Blot Analysis of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRα, and LXRβ mRNA Expression—Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells in 60-mm dishes and used to determine expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRα, and LXRβ mRNA by Northern blot as described (40Han J.

Pellets of nuclei were washed once with buffer A and then buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 1 h with vortexing several times. The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, separated into aliquots, and stored at -20 °C until assay. Plasmid DNA Preparation and Transfection—cDNA encoding nuclear form of mouse SREBP1a (N-terminal 1-460 amino acids) was generated by PCR using the clone purchased from Invitrogen (cDNA clone MGC:66503 IMAGE:6824948) as a template DNA and the primers F-ACTCAGATCTCGATGGACGAGCTGGCCTTCG and B-CCGCGGTACCCTAGACCTGGCTATCCTCAAAGG. After the sequence was confirmed, the PCR product was digested with BglII and KpnI and then subcloned into an expression vector, pEGFP-C2 (pEGFP-nSREBP1a). Mouse ABCA1 promoters were constructed by PCR using the mouse genomic DNA and primers as shown in Table 1. For promoter activity assay, about 95% of the confluent 293 cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with the DNA for the ABCA1 promoter, nSREBP1a, and Renilla (for internal normalization) by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were lysed, and the cellular lysate was used to determine the activity of firefly and Renilla luciferases by using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).TABLE 1Sequences of primers for ABCA1 promotersPromoterTemplate DNA5′-primer3′-primerAaAfter sequence was confirmed, the PCR product was digested by XhoI and HindIII and then subcloned into pGL4 luciferase reporter vector (Promega) followed by transformation and amplification (–179 to +227)Mouse genomic DNATAGCCTCGAGGTCGCCGGTTTAAGGGGCGTGCCAAGCTTCCTCTTACCTGTTTTCCACTTTGBbThe hexanucleotides of the E-box (CACGTG) was deleted in primers for promoter B or replaced by underlined hexanucleotides in primers for promoter C.

Data were generated from the cholesterol assays, and the cholesterol efflux studies or the activity assays involving the ABCA1 promoters were analyzed by paired t test. High Fat Diet Induces Cholesterol Accumulation in LDLR-/- Macrophages—To determine whether LDLR deletion alters macrophage cholesterol levels, both wild type and LDLR-/- mice were fed a normal chow or a high fat diet. After 4 weeks of feeding, mice were used to collect samples of plasma as well as peritoneal macrophages. The high fat diet increased total and free cholesterol levels in the plasma of both types of mice but with a greater effect in the LDLR-/- mice (Table 2). For instance, both total and free cholesterol levels in the plasma of the wild type mice were increased ∼2-fold in those fed a high fat diet. In contrast, the high fat diet resulted in about a 4- and 5-fold increase in total and free plasma cholesterol levels in LDLR-/- mice.TABLE 2A high fat diet induces plasma and macrophage cholesterol accumulation in LDLR–/– mice Blood and peritoneal macrophages were collected from individual mice after 4 weeks of normal chow or a high-fat diet feeding.

Administration of a high fat diet increased plasma cholesterol levels in wild type mice, but it did not affect the cellular total or free cellular cholesterol levels in these macrophages (Table 2). In contrast, a high fat diet increased total cholesterol levels ∼2-fold in LDLR-/- macrophages (Table 2). The increase was due to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters since the free cholesterol levels were not changed. LDLR Deletion Does Not Change Expression of Scavenger Receptors but Reduces Efflux of Free Cholesterol and Expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in Macrophages—To study the pathways by which the high fat diet induced cholesterol accumulation in LDLR-/- macrophages, we initially focused on the effects of LDLR deletion on the expression of scavenger receptors. Type A and type B scavenger receptors (SRA and CD36) are major proteins responsible for the binding and internalization of modified LDL in macrophages (41Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 42Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 1A indicated that the expression of SRA or CD36 was not affected by LDLR deletion. Type BI scavenger receptor (SR-BI), a molecule mediating both free cholesterol efflux to HDL from cells and selective uptake of cholesteryl esters by cells (43Krieger M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), was also not changed (Fig. 1A). Thus, the major pathways for uptake of cholesterol remained unaffected in the absence of LDLR. ABCA1 and ABCG1 facilitate macrophage-free chol"
https://openalex.org/W2035892324,"Gene expression microarrays have been intensively applied to screen for genes involved in specific biological processes of interest such as diseases or responses to environmental stimuli. For mammalian species, cataloging of the global gene expression profiles in large tissue collections under normal conditions have been focusing on human and mouse genomes but is lacking for the pig genome.Here we present the results from a large-scale porcine study establishing microarray cDNA expression profiles of approximately 20.000 genes across 23 healthy tissues. As expected, a large portion of the genes show tissue specific expression in agreement with mappings to gene descriptions, Gene Ontology terms and KEGG pathways. Two-way hierarchical clustering identified expected tissue clusters in accordance with tissue type and a number of cDNA clusters having similar gene expression patterns across tissues. For one of these cDNA clusters, we demonstrate that possible tissue associated gene function can be inferred for previously uncharacterized genes based on their shared expression patterns with functionally annotated genes. We show that gene expression in common porcine tissues is similar to the expression in homologous tissues of human.The results from this study constitute a valuable and publicly available resource of basic gene expression profiles in normal porcine tissues and will contribute to the identification and functional annotation of porcine genes."
https://openalex.org/W2131931141,"Cancer is often associated with multiple and progressive genetic alterations in genes that are important for normal development. BCAS3 (Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 3) is a gene of unknown function on human chromosome 17q23, a region associated with breakpoints of several neoplasms. The normal expression pattern of BCAS3 has not been studied, though it is implicated in breast cancer progression. Rudhira, a murine WD40 domain protein that is 98% identical to BCAS3 is expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, erythropoiesis and angiogenesis. This suggests that BCAS3 expression also may not be restricted to mammary tissue and may have important roles in other normal as well as malignant tissues. We show that BCAS3 is also expressed in human ES cells and during their differentiation into blood vascular precursors. We find that BCAS3 is aberrantly expressed in malignant human brain lesions. In glioblastoma, hemangiopericytoma and brain abscess we note high levels of BCAS3 expression in tumor cells and some blood vessels. BCAS3 may be associated with multiple cancerous and rapidly proliferating cells and hence the expression, function and regulation of this gene merits further investigation. We suggest that BCAS3 is mis-expressed in brain tumors and could serve as a human ES cell and tumor marker."

https://openalex.org/W2014984539,"p53 plays a major role in the prevention of tumor development. It responds to a range of potentially oncogenic stresses by activating protective mechanisms, most notably cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. The p53 gene is also induced during normal liver regeneration, and it has been hypothesized that p53 serve as a proliferative ‘brake’ to control excessive proliferation. However, it has lately been shown that p53 inhibition reduces hepatocyte growth factor-induced DNA synthesis of primary hepatocytes. Here we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) activated p53 in a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent way, and thus induced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 in primary rat hepatocytes. p53 inactivation with a dominant-negative mutant (p53V143A) attenuated EGF-induced DNA synthesis and was associated with reduced CDK2 phosphorylation and retinoblastoma protein hyperphosphorylation. When p21Cip1 was ectopically expressed in p53-inactivated cells, these effects were neutralized. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in normal hepatocytes, EGF-induced expression of p53 is involved in regulating CDK2- and CDK4 activity, through p21Cip1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2073984455,"Majority of CpG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes tend to undergo DNA methylation, but most CpG islands are resistant to such epigenetic modification. Understanding about mechanisms that may lead to the methylation resistance of CpG islands is still very poor.Using the genome-scale in vivo DNA methylation data from human brain, we investigated the flanking sequence features of methylation-resistant CpG islands, and discovered that there are several over-represented putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) in methylation-resistant CpG islands, and a specific group of zinc finger protein binding sites are over-represented in boundary regions ( approximately 400 bp) flanking such CpG islands. About 77% of the over-represented putative TFBSs are conserved among human, mouse and rat. We also observed the enrichment of 4 histone methylations in methylation-resistant CpG islands or their boundaries.Our results suggest a possible mechanism that certain putative zinc finger protein binding sites over-represented in the boundary regions of the methylation-resistant CpG islands may block the spreading of methylation into these islands, and those TFBSs over-represented within the islands may both reinforce the methylation blocking and promote transcription. Some histone modifications may also enhance the immunity of the CpG islands against DNA methylation by augmenting these TFs' binding. We speculate that the dynamical equilibrium between methylation spreading and blocking is likely to be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the relatively stable DNA methylation pattern in human somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066586994,"The B-MYB proto-oncogene is a transcription factor belonging to the MYB family that is frequently overexpressed or amplified in different types of human malignancies. While it is suspected that B-MYB plays a role in human cancer, there is still no direct evidence of its causative role. Looking for mutations of the B-MYB gene in human cell lines and primary cancer samples, we frequently isolated two nonsynonymous B-MYB polymorphic variants (rs2070235 and rs11556379). Compared to the wild-type protein, the B-MYB isoforms display altered conformation, impaired regulation of target genes and decreased antiapoptotic activity, suggesting that they are hypomorphic variants of the major allele. Importantly, the B-MYB polymorphisms are common; rs2070235 and rs11556379 are found, depending on the ethnic background, in 10-50% of human subjects. We postulated that, if B-MYB activity is important for transformation, the presence of common, hypomorphic variants might modify cancer risk. Indeed, the B-MYB polymorphisms are underrepresented in 419 cancer patients compared to 230 controls (odds ratio 0.53; (95%) confidence interval 0.385-0.755; P=0.001). This data imply that a large fraction of the human population is carrier of B-MYB alleles that might be associated with a reduced risk of developing neoplastic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012404244,"There is a considerable gap between investigating the dynamics of single neurons and the computational aspects of neural networks. A growing number of studies have attempted to overcome this gap using the excitation in brain slices elicited by various chemical manipulations of the bath solution. However, there has been no quantitative study on the effects of these manipulations on the cellular and network factors controlling excitability. Using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique we recorded the membrane potential from the soma of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices from the somatosensory cortex of young rats at 22°C and 35°C. Using blockers of synaptic transmission, we show distinct changes in cellular properties following modification of the ionic composition of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Thus both cellular and network changes may contribute to the observed effects of slice excitation solutions on the physiology of single neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that the difference in the ionic composition of current standard ACSF from that of CSF measured in vivo cause ACSF to depress network activity in acute brain slices. This may affect outcomes of experiments investigating biophysical and physiological properties of neurons in such preparations. Our results strongly advocate the necessity of redesigning experiments routinely carried out in the quiescent acute brain slice preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2055961914,"The expression of p73 and p63 isoforms is frequently deregulated in human epithelial tumors. We previously showed that loss of p73 protein expression associates with malignant conversion in vivo and ionizing radiation (IR) resistance in vitro in a clonal model of mouse epidermal carcinogenesis. Here we show that loss of endogenous p73 expression in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells and tumors was concomitant with preferential DNA binding of the inhibitory DeltaNp63alpha isoform and reduction of transcriptionally active p63gamma isoforms binding to a p21 promoter sequence in vitro. Reconstitution of TAp73alpha in malignant cells increased the steady state DNA-binding capabilities of the endogenous transcriptionally active TAp63gamma and DeltaNp63gamma isoforms, correlating with restoration of tumor suppression but not IR sensitivity. Loss of p73 in malignant cells also coincided with increased presence of p53 family inhibitor Mdm2 in p53-specific DNA-bound complexes, whereas reconstitution of TAp73alpha expression resulted in exclusion of Mdm2 from these complexes. These results suggest a dual mechanism for TAp73alpha to foster tumor suppression through enhancement of the DNA-binding activity of p63gamma isoforms, and through inhibition of transcriptional repressors Mdm2 or DeltaNp63alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2154429645,"In this study, we show how light can be absorbed by the body of a living rat due to an injected pigment circulating in the blood stream. This process is then physiologically translated in the tissue into a chemical signature that can be perceived as an image by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We previously reported that illumination of an injected photosynthetic bacteriochlorophyll-derived pigment leads to a generation of reactive oxygen species, upon oxygen consumption in the blood stream. Consequently, paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin accumulating in the illuminated area induces changes in image contrast, detectable by a Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)-MRI protocol, termed photosensitized (ps)MRI. Here, we show that laser beam pulses synchronously trigger BOLD-contrast transients in the tissue, allowing representation of the luminous spatiotemporal profile, as a contrast map, on the MR monitor. Regions with enhanced BOLD-contrast (7-61 fold) were deduced as illuminated, and were found to overlap with the anatomical location of the incident light. Thus, we conclude that luminous information can be captured and translated by typical oxygen exchange processes in the blood of ordinary tissues, and made visible by psMRI (Fig. 1). This process represents a new channel for communicating environmental light into the body in certain analogy to light absorption by visual pigments in the retina where image perception takes place in the central nervous system. Potential applications of this finding may include: non-invasive intra-operative light guidance and follow-up of photodynamic interventions, determination of light diffusion in opaque tissues for optical imaging and possible assistance to the blind."
https://openalex.org/W2135713546,"Eukaryotic gene expression is often under the control of cooperatively acting transcription factors whose binding is limited by structural constraints. By determining these structural constraints, we can understand the “rules” that define functional cooperativity. Conversely, by understanding the rules of binding, we can infer structural characteristics. We have developed an information theory based method for approximating the physical limitations of cooperative interactions by comparing sequence analysis to microarray expression data. When applied to the coordinated binding of the sulfur amino acid regulatory protein Met4 by Cbf1 and Met31, we were able to create a combinatorial model that can correctly identify Met4 regulated genes. Interestingly, we found that the major determinant of Met4 regulation was the sum of the strength of the Cbf1 and Met31 binding sites and that the energetic costs associated with spacing appeared to be minimal."
https://openalex.org/W2013493652,"In many high complexity systems (cells, organisms, institutions, societies, economies, etc.), it is unclear which components should be regulated to affect overall performance. To identify and prioritize molecular targets which impact cellular phenotypes, we have developed a selection procedure (“SPI”–single promoting/inhibiting target identification) which monitors the abundance of ectopic cDNAs. We have used this approach to identify growth regulators. For this purpose, complex pools of S. cerevisiae cDNA transformants were established and we quantitated the evolution of the spectrum of cDNAs which was initially present. These data emphasized the importance of translation initiation and ER-Golgi traffic for growth. SPI provides functional insight into the stability of cellular phenotypes under circumstances in which established genetic approaches cannot be implemented. It provides a functional “synthetic genetic signature” for each state of the cell (i.e. genotype and environment) by surveying complex genetic libraries, and does not require specialized arrays of cDNAs/shRNAs, deletion strains, direct assessment of clonal growth or even a conditional phenotype. Moreover, it establishes a hierarchy of importance of those targets which can contribute, either positively or negatively, to modify the prevailing phenotype. Extensions of these proof-of-principle experiments to other cell types should provide a novel and powerful approach to analyze multiple aspects of the basic biology of yeast and animal cells as well as clinically-relevant issues."
