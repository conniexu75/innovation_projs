https://openalex.org/W1968131916,"The primary motor cortex (MI) contains a map organized so that contralateral limb or facial movements are elicited by electrical stimulation within separate medial to lateral MI regions. Within hours of a peripheral nerve transection in adult rats, movements represented in neighboring MI areas are evoked from the cortical territory of the affected body part. One potential mechanism for reorganization is that adjacent cortical regions expand when preexisting lateral excitatory connections are unmasked by decreased intracortical inhibition. During pharmacological blockade of cortical inhibition in one part of the MI representation, movements of neighboring representations were evoked by stimulation in adjacent MI areas. These results suggest that intracortical connections form a substrate for reorganization of cortical maps and that inhibitory circuits are critically placed to maintain or readjust the form of cortical motor representations."
https://openalex.org/W2024358879,"The active site of voltage-activated potassium channels is a transmembrane aqueous pore that permits ions to permeate the cell membrane in a rapid yet highly selective manner. A useful probe for the pore of potassium-selective channels is the organic ion tetraethylammonium (TEA), which binds with millimolar affinity to the intracellular opening of the pore and blocks potassium current. In the potassium channel encoded by the Drosophila Shaker gene, an amino acid residue that specifically affects the affinity for intracellular TEA has now been identified by site-directed mutagenesis. This residue is in the middle of a conserved stretch of 18 amino acids that separates two locations that are both near the external opening of the pore. These findings suggest that this conserved region is intimately involved in the formation of the ion conduction pore of voltage-activated potassium channels. Further, a stretch of only eight amino acid residues must traverse 80 percent of the transmembrane electric potential difference."
https://openalex.org/W2065679706,"Transcription of a eukaryotic structural gene by RNA polymerase II requires the ordered assembly of general transcription factors on the promoter to form a pre-initiation complex. Here we analyze affinity-purified complexes at various stages of assembly to determine the mechanism of action of an acidic transcriptional activator. We show that the activator can function in the absence of ATP and stimulates transcription by increasing the number of functional preinitiation complexes. The activator effects this increase by recruiting the general transcription factor TFIIB to the promoter. Using protein affinity chromatography we demonstrate a specific interaction between an acidic activating region and TFIIB. Based on these combined results, we propose that TFIIB is a direct target of an acidic activator."

https://openalex.org/W2031017369,"The structure of the ion conduction pathway or pore of voltage-gated ion channels is unknown, although the linker between the membrane spanning segments S5 and S6 has been suggested to form part of the pore in potassium channels. To test whether this region controls potassium channel conduction, a 21-amino acid segment of the S5-S6 linker was transplanted from the voltage-activated potassium channel NGK2 to another potassium channel DRK1, which has very different pore properties. In the resulting chimeric channel, the single channel conductance and blockade by external and internal tetraethylammonium (TEA) ion were characteristic of the donor NGK2 channel. Thus, this 21-amino acid segment controls the essential biophysical properties of the pore and may form the conduction pathway of these potassium channels."

https://openalex.org/W2049356398,"The Drosophila learning mutant, rutabaga, is deficient in the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase, and studies of associative learning in Aplysia have implicated this enzyme in neuroplasticity. Therefore, the distribution of mRNA encoding the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in rat brain was examined by in situ hybridization. mRNA for this enzyme is expressed in specific areas of brain that have been implicated in learning and memory, including the neocortex, the hippocampus, and the olfactory system. The presence of mRNA for this enzyme in the pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampal formation provides evidence that it is found in neurons. These data are consistent with the proposal that the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase plays an important role in learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2035737042,"Site-directed mutagenic replacement of M subunit Leu214 by His in the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides results in incorporation of a bacteriochlorophyll molecule (BChl) in place of the native bacteriopheophytin (BPh) electron acceptor. Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the ground-state absorption spectrum of the (M)L214H mutant, pigment and metal analyses, and time-resolved optical experiments. The genetically modified RC supports transmembrane charge separation from the photoexcited BChl dimer to the primary quinone through the new BChl molecule, but with a reduced quantum yield of 60 percent (compared to 100 percent in wild-type RCs). These results have important implications for the mechanism of charge separation in the RC, and rationalize the choice of (bacterio)pheophytins as electron acceptors in a variety of photosynthetic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2131448186,"K+ channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. In the heart these channels are responsible for the rapid repolarizing phases of the action potential and are the targets of several antiarrhythmic drugs. Full-length cDNA clones were isolated from human ventricular libraries that encode two voltage-gated K+ channels. These two cDNAs, designated HK1 and HK2, encode proteins of 653 and 605 amino acids, respectively. HK1 is the human equivalent (98% identity) of an inactivating K+ channel previously described in rat heart (RHK1) whereas the HK2 channel is 86% identical to a cloned rat brain K+ channel (Kv1). The only amino acid sequence identity (72%) between HK1 and HK2 is within the central region containing the membrane spanning domains. Northern blot analysis of human mRNA indicated that HK1 is slightly more abundant in ventricle than atrium whereas HK2 is much more abundant in atrium relative to ventricle. Both channel transcripts are present in ventricle at levels equivalent to voltage-gated Na+ channels. Analysis of the gene encoding HK1 suggests the coding sequence is intronless and is represented once in the human genome.—Tamkun, M. M.; Knoth, K. M.; Walbridge, J. A.; Kroemer, H.; Roden, D.

https://openalex.org/W1491991731,"The transmembrane epithelial cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin (uvomorulin) associates via its cytoplasmic domain with three or more proteins whose structure and function are not yet established. The associated proteins, also termed catenins (Ozawa, M., Baribault, H., and Kemler, R. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 1711-1717), are of interest because they may form a link to the cytoskeleton, and/or regulate E-cadherin function. In this report immunoprecipitates of E-cadherin complexes, isolated from Xenopus laevis A6 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers, were stringently washed to leave a single very tightly associated protein of approximately 92 kDa. We report on the 92-kDa protein's association with E-cadherin in the presence of various perturbants, its preferential dissociation from the immune complex upon exposure to mixed detergent micelles containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, and its preparative purification to homogeneity. We have additionally found that E-cadherin and its associated proteins may be easily and quantitatively extracted from both subconfluent and fully confluent cells by a variety of mild nonionic detergents made up in isotonic buffers. In contrast, such extractions at short times left most of the cytoskeletal protein fodrin in the insoluble pellet fraction. Western blots of immunoprecipitated E-cadherin complexes failed to detect the presence of fodrin, or that of the cytoskeletal proteins adducin, alpha-actinin, and vinculin. If the E-cadherin-associated protein complex interacts with known proteins of the cell cytoskeleton, such interactions are labile and/or transient."

Four monoclonal antibodies were raised against H6H purified from cultured roots of Hyoscyamus niger. The IgG1 antibody mAb5 inhibited H6H activities present in cell-free extracts of H. niger roots and specifically recognized 38-40-kDa proteins from six different scopolamine-producing plant species in Western blot analysis after sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The other three monoclonal antibodies all recognized SDS-denatured H6H protein from Hyoscyamus species, but did not bind to native H6H. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from various tissues of H. niger using these antibodies showed that H6H is abundant in cultured roots, present in plant roots, but absent in leaf, stem, calyx, cultured cells, and cultured shoots. Immunohistochemical studies using monoclonal antibody and immunogold-silver enhancement detected H6H only in the pericycle cells of the young root in several scopolamine-producing plants. Mature roots that underwent secondary growth and lacked the pericycle did not react with the antibody. This pericycle-specific localization of scopolamine biosynthesis provides an anatomical explanation for the tissue-specific biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids and may be important for translocation of tropane alkaloids from the root to the aerial parts."

https://openalex.org/W1482008147,"Insulin-dependent cell growth has been correlated with insulin receptor function, particularly receptor-associated kinase activity, in in vitro studies. The insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 95-kDa receptor subunit was clearly inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, by the presence of unbranched neolacto series gangliosides having a NeuAc2----3Gal terminus, particularly 2----3-sialosylparagloboside (2----3SPG; IV3NeuAc-nLc4), but not by other gangliosides with a NeuAc2----6Gal terminus or by branched neolacto series gangliosides (e.g. G10). Such inhibition of phosphorylation was minimal with ganglio series gangliosides and negligible with sphingosine, neutral glycolipids, or sulfatide. 2----3SPG did not affect insulin binding to the insulin receptor. Insulin-dependent cell growth and its inhibition by 2----3SPG were observed in three human cell lines so far tested: lymphoid cell line IM9, promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, and erythroleukemia cell line K562. Since IM9 cells contain a much higher quantity of insulin receptor than do HL-60 or K562 cells, insulin-dependent receptor phosphorylation and its inhibition by 2----3SPG in intact cells were clearly observed with IM9 cells. Receptor phosphorylation in intact cells was inhibited when cells were preincubated in the presence of 2----3SPG. Insulin-dependent growth of HL-60 and K562 cells was also inhibited by prolonged culture (96-144 h) with exogenous 2----3SPG. Subsequent to the inhibition of insulin-dependent HL-60 cell growth, a remarkable phenotypic transformation was observed, i.e. changes in morphology, enzymes, and cell-surface markers to those characteristic of monocytes. The level of 2----3SPG in HL-60 cells increased when cells were cultured with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to the same degree seen in cells cultured with 5 microM 2----3SPG. Both these treatments led to inhibition of insulin-dependent cell growth, followed by induction of monocytic differentiation. Thus, the cellular level of 2----3SPG may modulate insulin-dependent cell growth and define the lineage specificity of differentiation through modulation of receptor-associated kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1912326937,"Abstract Mild oxidative stress, as elicited by ascorbate, oxygen, and trace metals, affects the binding properties of human serum albumin via purely conformational changes. In fact, no gross alteration can be observed in the electrophoretic and chromatographic patterns of albumin, whereas localized modifications are indicated by the changes in absorption and fluorescence spectra and in polarization degree. The oxidized protein presents a small increase of bityrosine production and a time-dependent increase in the content of carbonyl groups, whereas proteolytic susceptibility is unchanged. A higher affinity for cis-parinaric acid and a slight loss of solubility in high salt indicate a greater surface hydrophobicity. Pinpoint denaturation of the albumin molecule is also suggested by a decreased esterase activity in the presence of p-nitrophenyl acetate. Conformational stability evaluated through thermal shock and addition of moderate amounts of guanidine indicate that the oxidized protein is more heat-resistant, less flexible, and more rigid than the native one. Although limited, structural damages afforded by the oxidative stress cause alterations of albumin binding properties as documented by experiments with probes and physiological ligands. The loss of biological activity of human serum albumin induced by ascorbate system appears of medical relevance, because it can affect drug metabolism and particularly drug tolerance in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W1485090153,"Ligand binding activity of intrinsic factor-cobalamin receptor (IFCR) was determined in homogenates and isolated brush-border membranes (BBM) of ileum and kidney from dogs exhibiting simple autosomal recessive inheritance of selective cobalamin malabsorption (Fyfe, J. C., Giger, U., Hall, C. A., Jezyk, P. F., Klumpp, S. A., Levine, J. S., and Patterson, D. F. (1991) Pediatr. Res. 29, 24-31). IFCR activity of affected dog ileal homogenates was 3-4-fold higher than normal whereas IFCR activity in affected dog kidney homogenates was one-tenth of normal. The recovery of IFCR activity in the BBM of ileum and renal cortex of affected dogs was 30- and 20-fold less than normal, respectively. The dissociation constant (Kd) for intrinsic factor-cobalamin was similar in BBM of both tissues and was the same in affected and normal dogs. In the affected dog ileal BBM, activities of alkaline phosphatase and sucrase-isomaltase and vesicular transport of glucose and Na(+)-taurocholate were normal. Immunoblots showed no IFCR cross-reactive material in the ileal or renal BBM of affected dogs. IFCR purified by affinity chromatography from kidney of both normal and affected dogs had an Mr = 230,000. However, amino acid analysis revealed that the affected dog IFCR had more lysine than the normal, and protease cleavage of the purified IFCRs revealed different peptide maps. Asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of both proteins were sensitive to peptide N-glycosidase F cleavage, but only the affected dog IFCR was endoglycosidase H sensitive. These results suggest that cobalamin malabsorption in this canine family is caused by inefficient BBM expression of IFCR due to a mutation of IFCR and its retention in an early biosynthetic compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2004095370,"The Shaker gene, responsible for A-type potassium channels in Drosophila muscle, encodes a large family of transcripts capable of generating a variety of kinetically distinct A channels when expressed in oocytes. We describe a distinct class of A channel encoded by the Shaker gene in a novel preparation of dissociated Drosophila photoreceptors. Whole-cell recordings reveal a rapidly inactivating A current that is absent in Shaker mutants and that can be readily isolated in cell-attached patches. Although very similar to their muscle counterparts, the photoreceptor A channels show a striking 40-50 mV negative shift in their voltage-operating range. Two mutations (ShE62 and T(1;Y)W32), which exclude only certain classes of Shaker transcripts, were used to show that photoreceptor A channels are encoded by multiple transcripts distinct from those encoding muscle A channels, while PCR techniques identified four transcripts (ShA1, ShA2, ShG1, and ShG2) in mRNA from dissected retina."
https://openalex.org/W2015249727,"We have identified a yeast protein that binds specifically to the ARS consensus sequence. By two-step chromatography we have purified the factor to apparent homogeneity as a single polypeptide of 67 kd. The purified ARS consensus-binding protein (ACBP) recognizes the ARS consensus of the four genomic ARS elements tested, binding preferentially to the T-rich single strand. Point mutations in the consensus significantly reduce the affinity of the single-strand binding. At the histone H4 ARS, ACBP recognizes both the perfect ARS consensus and a match 3′ of it. These two binding sites correlate with the boundaries of the minimal functional H4 ARS element. A similar configuration of binding sites is found at ARS1. We propose a model implicating this factor in an early step of the initiation of DNA replication."

We describe here several new olfactory system-specific glycoforms of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM in the frog, R. catesbeiana. Using immunochemical methods for in situ localization, we show that the lectin dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and two monoclonal antibodies, 9OE and 3A6, detect three unique N-CAM forms present on primary sensory olfactory axons. In addition, DBA and monoclonal antibody 9OE recognize glycoconjugates and/or N-CAM glycoforms expressed specifically in discrete central olfactory pathways and regions in frog brain. This is a novel example of unique adhesion molecule forms present in a chain of two neurons within a vertebrate neural pathway. Together these glycoconjugates and N-CAM glycoforms may participate in cellular interactions associated with olfactory system pathway formation and renewal."
https://openalex.org/W1500638303,"A cDNA for the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) has been cloned from a bovine adrenal library. An initiator methionine codon precedes the amino-terminal amino acid found in the isolated protein. Rhodanese is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transferred to the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, any amino-terminal sequence required for organelle import is retained in the mature protein. Furthermore, the DNA sequence shows that there are three additional amino acids, Gly-Lys-Ala, at the carboxyl terminus that are not found by protein sequencing. Additionally, comparison of the published amino acid sequence with that encoded by the open reading frame revealed three differences in the amino acid sequence. Comparison of the bovine and chicken liver sequences shows an overall level of 70% sequence homology, but there is complete identity of all residues that have been implicated in the function of the enzyme. When two mammalian cells, cos-7 and 293 cells, were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the rhodanese coding region, rhodanese activity in lysates increased approximately 20-fold. Fluorograms of denaturing polyacrylamide gels detected a large increase in a polypeptide that co-migrated with the native protein and reacted with anti-rhodanese antibodies. Nondenaturing gels showed two active species that co-migrated with the two major electrophoretic forms purified by current procedures. Escherichia coli, transformed with a plasmid containing the rhodanese coding region, showed a 15-fold increase in rhodanese activity over baseline values. When the E. coli recombinant protein was analyzed on a nondenaturing gel, only one species was observed that co-electrophoresed with the more electropositive variant seen in purified bovine liver rhodanese. This single variant could be converted by carboxypeptidase B digestion to a form of the enzyme that co-migrated with the more electronegative species isolated from bovine liver. Thus, two major, enzymatically active electrophoretic variants, commonly observed in mammalian cells, can be accounted for by carboxyl-terminal processing without recourse to other post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1583592656,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F, a multiprotein cap binding complex, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and insulin (Morley, S.J., and Traugh, J.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2401-2404; Morley, S.J., and Traugh, J.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10611-10616). The effect of phosphorylation on the activity of purified eIF-4F, utilizing both protein kinase C and a multifunctional S6 kinase, previously identified as protease activated kinase II, has been examined; these protein kinases modify eIF-4F p25 and p220 and eIF-4F p220, respectively. Studies with an eIF-4F-dependent protein synthesis system showed that phosphorylation of eIF-4F with either protein kinase resulted in a 3-5-fold stimulation of translation relative to the nonphosphorylated control. Chemical cross-linking of eIF-4F to cap-labeled mRNA, showed that phosphorylation increased the interaction of both the p25 and p220 subunits of eIF-4F with the 5' end of mRNA. This effect was manifested by a stimulation of initiation complex formation as measured by an increase in the association of labeled mRNA with 40 S ribosomal subunits in the translation system. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF-4F enhances binding to mRNA, resulting in a stimulation of protein synthesis at initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2162953223,"Abstract The glucose-phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase likely plays an important role in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the islets of Langerhans and has previously been thought to be expressed only in that tissue and in liver. In this study, we demonstrate high levels of glucokinase mRNA in the anterior pituitary cell line AtT20ins, which has been engineered to secrete correctly processed insulin, as well as in primary anterior pituitary tissue. Unlike islet or liver cells, expression of glucokinase mRNA in anterior pituitary cells was not accompanied by expression of the high Km glucose transporter (GLUT-2) mRNA. The glucokinase transcript in anterior pituitary cells was similar in size to islet glucokinase mRNA, which has a unique, elongated 5'-end relative to the liver glucokinase message. Amplification and sequence analysis of the glucokinase mRNA expressed in islets, RIN1046-38 cells, and anterior pituitary cells confirmed that the glucokinase transcripts in these cell types contain the same 5'-sequence. In addition, a novel alternative transcript was identified that contains a 52-nucleotide deletion and that predicts a 58-amino acid peptide as a result of a frame shift. Both the deleted and undeleted transcripts were found in islets, RIN cells, and AtT20ins cells, whereas only the deleted product was identified in primary anterior pituitary tissue. An antibody prepared against a peptide found at the N terminus of the islet isoform of glucokinase easily detected a protein with a size predicted by the undeleted transcript in extracts prepared from islets, RIN1046-38 cells, and AtT20ins cells. Since both the glucokinase protein and mRNA are naturally expressed in AtT20ins and RIN1046-38 cells, we compared the effect of varying concentrations of glucose on insulin secretion from the two lines. Insulin secretion from RIN1046-38 cells was stimulated by glucose in a dose-dependent manner over the range 0-2.5 mM, where it reached a maximum. AtT20ins cells, in contrast, exhibited no response to glucose at any concentration tested, despite the fact that insulin secretion from both cell lines was stimulated by incubation with dibutyryl cAMP. We conclude that glucokinase expression in AtT20ins cells may be necessary, but is not sufficient to confer glucose-stimulated insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1751194977,"We have isolated and structurally characterized genomic DNA and cDNA sequences encoding ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rbu-P2 carboxylase) activase from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Three Rbu-P2 carboxylase activase (Rca) polypeptides are encoded in the barley genome by two closely linked, tandemly oriented nuclear genes (RcaA and RcaB); cDNAs encoding each of the three Rbu-P2 carboxylase activase polypeptides were isolated from cDNA libraries of barley leaf mRNA. RcaA produces two mRNAs, which encode polypeptides of 42 and 46 kDa, by an alternative splicing mechanism identical to that previously reported for spinach and Arabidopsis Rca genes (Werneke, J.M., Chatfield, J.M., and Ogren, W. L. (1989) Plant Cell 1, 815-825). RcaB is transcribed to produce a single mRNA, which encodes a mature peptide of 42 kDa. Genomic Southern blots indicate that RcaA and RcaB represent the entire Rbu-P2 carboxylase activase gene family in barley. The genes share 80% nucleotide sequence identity, and the 42-kDa polypeptides encoded by RcaA and RcaB share 87% amino acid sequence identity. Coding regions of the two barley Rca genes are separated by 1 kilobase pair of flanking DNA. DNA sequence motifs similar to those thought to control light-regulated gene expression in other nuclear-encoded plastid polypeptide genes are found at the 5' end of both barley Rca genes. Probes specific to three mRNAs were used to determine the relative contribution each species makes to the total Rca mRNA pool."

https://openalex.org/W1521900848,"We recently cloned and sequenced alpha 1 (VIII) collagen cDNAs and demonstrated that type VIII collagen is a short-chain collagen that contains both triple helical and carboxyl-terminal non-triple helical domains similar to those of type X collagen (Yamaguchi, N., Benya, P., van der Rest, M., and Ninomiya, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16022-16029). We report here on the structural organization of the gene encoding the rabbit alpha 1 (VIII) collagen chain. The alpha 1 (VIII) gene contains four exons, whose sizes are 69, 120, 331, and 2278 base pairs. The first and second exons encode only 5'-untranslated sequences, whereas the third exon codes for a very short (3 nucleotides) stretch of 5'-untranslated sequence, the signal peptide, and almost the entire amino-terminal non-triple helical (NC2) domain (109 1/3 codons). Interestingly, the last exon encodes the rest of the translated region, including 7 2/3 codons of the NC2 domains, the complete triple helical domain (COL1, 454 amino acid residues), the entire carboxyl-terminal non-triple helical domain (NC1, 173 amino acid residues), and the 3'-untranslated region. This exon-intron structure is in stark contrast to the multi-exon structure of the fibrillar collagen (types I, II, III, V, and XI) genes, but it is remarkably similar to that of the type X collagen gene (LuValle, P., Ninomiya, Y., Rosenblum, N. D., and Olsen, B. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18278-18385). The data suggest that the alpha 1 (VIII) and the alpha 1 (X) genes belong to the same subclass within the collagen family and that they arose from a common evolutionary precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1503075447,"Many nascent proteins that are destined to be anchored to plasma membranes by a phosphatidylinositol glycan (PI-G) are in the range of 50-70 kDa so that changes of 2-3 kDa between precursors and products during processing are not easily detected. Furthermore, PI-G-anchored proteins are generally glycosylated so that changes between the nascent (prepro) proteins and the mature products are not due simply to the loss of signal peptides. These problems have made it difficult to monitor the processing of the prepro form of wild type human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) in a cell-free system. We have designed a smaller and simpler substrate of PI-G transamidase derived by deletion of approximately 60% of the internal sequence of preproPLAP 513. This engineered protein, preprominiPLAP 208, retains the NH2- and COOH-terminal signal peptides of PLAP as well as all the epitopes for site-directed antibodies of the latter, but is devoid of glycosylation sites, the active site, and most of the cysteine residues. With preprominiPLAP, it has been possible to demonstrate, in a cell-free system, step by step conversion to the pro form and then to the mature form, with the concomitant loss of the appropriate signal peptides. These changes were shown to be time- and enzyme concentration-dependent. Studies with Asp-179 site-directed mutants of preprominiPLAP showed the same specificity for amino acids with a monosubstituted beta carbon at the cleavage/attachment site that were found previously with wild type PLAP."
https://openalex.org/W1577577942,"Abstract DNA polymerase III of Escherichia coli requires multiple auxiliary factors to enable it to serve as a replicative complex. We demonstrate that auxiliary components of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the gamma delta complex and beta subunit, markedly stimulate DNA polymerase II on long single-stranded templates. DNA polymerase II activity is enhanced by single-stranded DNA binding protein, but the stimulation by gamma delta and beta can be observed either in the absence or presence of single-stranded DNA binding protein. In contrast with DNA polymerase III, the requirement of DNA polymerase II for gamma delta cannot be bypassed by large excesses of the beta subunit at low ionic strength in the absence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein. The product of the DNA polymerase II-gamma delta-beta reaction on a uniquely primed single-stranded circle is of full template length; the reconstituted enzyme apparently is incapable of strand displacement synthesis. The possible biological implications of these observations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1592117307,"We report here the finding that normal, young cartilages, in distinction from all other tissues examined, have unusually high levels of n-9 eicosatrienoic (20:3 cis-delta 5,8,11) acid and low levels of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA). This pattern is identical to that found in tissues of animals subjected to prolonged depletion of nutritionally essential n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EFA). This apparent deficiency is consistently observed in cartilage of all species so far studied (young chicken, fetal calf, newborn pig, rabbit, and human), even though levels of n-6 PUFA in blood and all other tissues is normal. The n-9 20:3 acid is particularly abundant in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and the free fatty acid fractions from the young cartilage. Several factors appear to contribute to the reduction in n-6 PUFA and the appearance of high levels of the n-9 20:3 acid in cartilage: 1) limited access to nutritional sources of EFA due to the impermeability and avascularity of cartilage, 2) rapid metabolism of n-6 PUFA to prostanoids by chondrocytes, and 3) a unique fatty acid metabolism by cartilage. Evidence is presented that each of these factors contributes. Previously, EFA deficiency has been shown to greatly suppress the inflammatory response of leukocytes and rejection of tissues transplanted into allogeneic recipients. Because eicosanoids, which are derived from EFA, have been implicated in the inflammatory responses associated with arthritic disease, reduction of n-6 PUFA and accumulation of the n-9 20:3 acid in cartilage may be important for maintaining normal cartilage structure."

https://openalex.org/W1549527149,"Because receptors, G proteins, and phospholipases all exist within a membrane lipid environment, it is not unreasonable to assume that an enzyme capable of changing the lipid environment can affect the coupling relationship among these signal transducing components. Our previous study showed that a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor regulates phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D via a G protein in brain. We demonstrate here that phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D are simultaneously activated within 15 s by muscarine in the presence of 1 μM GTPγS. More important, inhibition of phospholipase D by zinc attenuated carbamylcholine-induced activation of phospholipase C by 30%. Our additional evidence strongly indicates that the receptor-regulated phospholipase D plays an important modulatory role in agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol breakdown. This modulatory effect may be achieved by changing the membrane microenvironment in which phospholipase C and phosphoinositol lipids reside, consequently amplifying the inositol phospholipid signaling process. Our results lead us to postulate that the potential interaction between two different signaling pathways may provide a cell with intracellular coordination and enable the cell to achieve functional responses.—Qian, Z.; Drewes, L.

https://openalex.org/W2408806263,"Cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) is a retinol-specific binding protein. A rat cDNA clone of CRBP was expressed in Escherichia coli. In order to determine amino acid residues in CRBP which may be important for the binding of all-trans-retinol, comparative model-building studies were performed in which strong sequence similarities were identified between CRBP and several other binding proteins. Based on this analysis, specific amino acids were predicted to be important in retinol binding, and these predictions were tested using the technique of site-directed mutagenesis to subtly alter the protein's structure and function. Specifically, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to alter the Gln-108 to Arg-108 (Q108R). Making use of fluorescence, Q108R was found to have a 3-fold lower affinity for all-trans-retinol, and the fine structure of the excitation spectrum of the Q108R.all-trans-retinol complex was also different than for the wild type.all-trans-retinol complex. The mutant bound 13-cis-retinol with an excitation spectrum identical to wild type bound to 13-cis-retinol, but with only one-half of the fluorescence intensity. In competition binding experiments, the Q108R mutant was found to have similar binding affinities for all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid, and retinal, while wild type CRBP was only able to bind to all-trans-retinol. Thus, altering a single amino acid in CRBP (Gln-108 to Arg-108) caused a significant change in the ligand binding specificity of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1572418079,"Abstract The possible self-association of tissue factor molecules was investigated by treating cells expressing tissue factor with bifunctional cross-linking agents. The two reagents chosen were 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) and sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3'-dithiopropionate, both of which are membrane-impermeable and thiol-cleavable. A human bladder carcinoma cell line, J82, and a transfected human kidney cell line expressing high amounts of recombinant tissue factor were used in these studies. Exposure of the intact cells to the crosslinking reagents was found to result in the formation of multimeric tissue factor-containing complexes, the extent of which appeared to be dependent upon the amount of tissue factor expressed by the cell. The self-association of tissue factor was prevented in a variant tissue factor molecule harboring a non-homologous transmembrane domain."
https://openalex.org/W1644383883,"Abstract Two spontaneous variants of the murine anti-digoxin antibody-producing hybridoma cell line 26-10 were isolated by two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting on the basis of altered hapten binding. The variable region sequences of the antibodies produced by the mutant lines revealed that each contains a single amino acid change in the heavy chain second complementarity determining region. A Tyr to His change at position 50 leads to a 40-fold reduction in affinity for digoxin. A Ser to Phe mutation at position 52 results in a 300-fold reduction in affinity for digoxin. A competition assay involving 33 digoxin analogues was used to examine the specificity of hapten binding of 26-10 and the two mutant antibodies. The position 50 mutant has a distinct specificity change; it exhibits a preference for digoxin congeners containing a hydroxyl group at the steroid 12 position, whereas the 26-10 parent does not. The affinities of all three antibodies for hapten are progressively lowered by substitutions of increasing size at the digoxin steroid D ring 16 position. Although 26-10 binds digoxin and its genin form equally, 12 and 16 steroid position substitutions which lower affinity also confer a preference for a sugar at the steroid 3 position. These results suggest that position 50 contributes to specificity of the antibody and that alterations of the hapten can lead to differences in recognition, possibly through a shift in hapten orientation within the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1758823803,"A method allowing one to measure the rate of glucose phosphorylation in the livers of anesthetized rats is described. Upon injection of [2-3H]glucose into the portal vein, about 90% of the radioactivity remained in the liver for approximately 30 s. The proportion of radioactivity accounted for by tritiated water increased linearly at a rate of about 5%/min in control animals. Fructose injected into the penile vein stimulated this rate up to 2.2- and 2.7-fold in fed and overnight starved rats respectively, a maximal effect being observed at a dose of 50 mg/kg under both conditions. Fructose was also active when administered by intragastric infusion. The ketose caused increases in the concentration of fructose 1-phosphate, which reached values known to relieve the inhibition exerted on glucokinase by its regulatory protein.—–Van Schaftingen, E.; Davies, D.

https://openalex.org/W2161449397,"Retinoids induce the promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway in vitro. A number of water-soluble and nitrogen-containing retinoids were synthesized in our laboratory [retinoyl-glucose (RAGL), retinyl-glucose (ROGL), retinoyl-adenosine (RADS), retinoyl-adenine (RAD), retinoyl-beta-glucuronide (beta RAG), and retinoyl-alpha-glucuronide (alpha RAG)]. These retinoids (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), as well as retinoic acid (RA) and retinol (ROL), were tested for their ability to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells in vitro and to affect cell growth and viability during a 24- to 72-h incubation period. Differentiation was assessed by measuring the percentage of cells expressing the Mac-1 antigen on their cell surfaces. RA and the conjugates of RA were all quite active in inducing HL-60 cell differentiation, whereas ROL and ROGL had much less activity at equimolar concentrations. beta RAG, alpha RAG, RADS, and RAD were less toxic, whereas the glucose conjugates of retinol and retinoic acid (ROGL and RAGL) were both considerably more toxic than either RA or ROL at equimolar concentrations. All retinoids affected cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion. At 24 h, free RA or ROL was not detected in the cells after incubation with any of the retinoid conjugates."

https://openalex.org/W1553752476,"Abstract Little is known about copper metabolism at the cellular level. The brindled mouse is an animal model of Menkes disease which is an inborn error of copper metabolism. Control and brindled mice were used to identify copper-binding proteins with possible roles in normal copper metabolism that are affected by the defect in the brindled mice. When 64Cu-labeled hepatic or renal cytosols from control mice were applied to Mono Q or Superose columns, a approximately 48-kDa protein coeluted with the protein fractions which contained the radiolabeled copper. Large decreases in copper binding were detected in these fractions from the brindled mice. The same column fractions which showed decreased copper binding showed large decreases in the levels of the approximately 48-kDa protein. Decreased copper binding and approximately 48-kDa protein were not simply secondary to the abnormal hepatic and renal copper levels that are found in the brindled mice since although their liver copper levels are low, their kidney copper levels are high. Elevated levels of an approximately 80-kDa heat shock protein were also detected in the hepatic and renal cytosols from the brindled mice. Consistent with expression of the primary defect in both the liver and kidney, the levels of the approximately 48- and approximately 80-kDa proteins were affected similarly in both organs. Irrespective of how the low levels of the approximately 48-kDa protein may be related to the basic defect in the brindled mice, the data are consistent with an important role for the approximately 48-kDa protein in intracellular copper metabolism."
