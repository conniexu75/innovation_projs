https://openalex.org/W2765303057,"Metabolic flux analysis in mice reveals that lactate often acts as the primary carbon source for the tricarboxylic acid cycle both in normal tissues and in tumour microenvironments. Glucose is thought to be the primary source of fuel for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, which produces important metabolites and energy. Sheng Hui et al. now perform whole-body metabolite analysis in mice. They find that circulating lactate rather than glucose can be a major source of carbon and hence fuel for TCA metabolism in both fed and fasting mice. They furthermore show this to be the case in tumour tissue. Mammalian tissues are fuelled by circulating nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and various intermediary metabolites. Under aerobic conditions, glucose is generally assumed to be burned fully by tissues via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to carbon dioxide. Alternatively, glucose can be catabolized anaerobically via glycolysis to lactate, which is itself also a potential nutrient for tissues1 and tumours2,3,4,5. The quantitative relevance of circulating lactate or other metabolic intermediates as fuels remains unclear. Here we systematically examine the fluxes of circulating metabolites in mice, and find that lactate can be a primary source of carbon for the TCA cycle and thus of energy. Intravenous infusions of 13C-labelled nutrients reveal that, on a molar basis, the circulatory turnover flux of lactate is the highest of all metabolites and exceeds that of glucose by 1.1-fold in fed mice and 2.5-fold in fasting mice; lactate is made primarily from glucose but also from other sources. In both fed and fasted mice, 13C-lactate extensively labels TCA cycle intermediates in all tissues. Quantitative analysis reveals that during the fasted state, the contribution of glucose to tissue TCA metabolism is primarily indirect (via circulating lactate) in all tissues except the brain. In genetically engineered lung and pancreatic cancer tumours in fasted mice, the contribution of circulating lactate to TCA cycle intermediates exceeds that of glucose, with glutamine making a larger contribution than lactate in pancreatic cancer. Thus, glycolysis and the TCA cycle are uncoupled at the level of lactate, which is a primary circulating TCA substrate in most tissues and tumours."

However, it is difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2766609999,"The skin barrier is the body's first line of defence against environmental assaults, and is maintained by epithelial stem cells (EpSCs). Despite the vulnerability of EpSCs to inflammatory pressures, neither the primary response to inflammation nor its enduring consequences are well understood. Here we report a prolonged memory to acute inflammation that enables mouse EpSCs to hasten barrier restoration after subsequent tissue damage. This functional adaptation does not require skin-resident macrophages or T cells. Instead, EpSCs maintain chromosomal accessibility at key stress response genes that are activated by the primary stimulus. Upon a secondary challenge, genes governed by these domains are transcribed rapidly. Fuelling this memory is Aim2, which encodes an activator of the inflammasome. The absence of AIM2 or its downstream effectors, caspase-1 and interleukin-1β, erases the ability of EpSCs to recollect inflammation. Although EpSCs benefit from inflammatory tuning by heightening their responsiveness to subsequent stressors, this enhanced sensitivity probably increases their susceptibility to autoimmune and hyperproliferative disorders, including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2766422151,"Ubiquitination controls the stability of most cellular proteins, and its deregulation contributes to human diseases including cancer. Deubiquitinases remove ubiquitin from proteins, and their inhibition can induce the degradation of selected proteins, potentially including otherwise 'undruggable' targets. For example, the inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) results in the degradation of the oncogenic E3 ligase MDM2, and leads to re-activation of the tumour suppressor p53 in various cancers. Here we report that two compounds, FT671 and FT827, inhibit USP7 with high affinity and specificity in vitro and within human cells. Co-crystal structures reveal that both compounds target a dynamic pocket near the catalytic centre of the auto-inhibited apo form of USP7, which differs from other USP deubiquitinases. Consistent with USP7 target engagement in cells, FT671 destabilizes USP7 substrates including MDM2, increases levels of p53, and results in the transcription of p53 target genes, induction of the tumour suppressor p21, and inhibition of tumour growth in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2766290879,"G-protein-coupled receptors mediate the biological effects of many hormones and neurotransmitters and are important pharmacological targets. They transmit their signals to the cell interior by interacting with G proteins. However, it is unclear how receptors and G proteins meet, interact and couple. Here we analyse the concerted motion of G-protein-coupled receptors and G proteins on the plasma membrane and provide a quantitative model that reveals the key factors that underlie the high spatiotemporal complexity of their interactions. Using two-colour, single-molecule imaging we visualize interactions between individual receptors and G proteins at the surface of living cells. Under basal conditions, receptors and G proteins form activity-dependent complexes that last for around one second. Agonists specifically regulate the kinetics of receptor-G protein interactions, mainly by increasing their association rate. We find hot spots on the plasma membrane, at least partially defined by the cytoskeleton and clathrin-coated pits, in which receptors and G proteins are confined and preferentially couple. Imaging with the nanobody Nb37 suggests that signalling by G-protein-coupled receptors occurs preferentially at these hot spots. These findings shed new light on the dynamic interactions that control G-protein-coupled receptor signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2766738665,"The ubiquitin system regulates essential cellular processes in eukaryotes. Ubiquitin is ligated to substrate proteins as monomers or chains and the topology of ubiquitin modifications regulates substrate interactions with specific proteins. Thus ubiquitination directs a variety of substrate fates including proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinase enzymes cleave ubiquitin from substrates and are implicated in disease; for example, ubiquitin-specific protease-7 (USP7) regulates stability of the p53 tumour suppressor and other proteins critical for tumour cell survival. However, developing selective deubiquitinase inhibitors has been challenging and no co-crystal structures have been solved with small-molecule inhibitors. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance-based screening and structure-based design, we describe the development of selective USP7 inhibitors GNE-6640 and GNE-6776. These compounds induce tumour cell death and enhance cytotoxicity with chemotherapeutic agents and targeted compounds, including PIM kinase inhibitors. Structural studies reveal that GNE-6640 and GNE-6776 non-covalently target USP7 12 Å distant from the catalytic cysteine. The compounds attenuate ubiquitin binding and thus inhibit USP7 deubiquitinase activity. GNE-6640 and GNE-6776 interact with acidic residues that mediate hydrogen-bond interactions with the ubiquitin Lys48 side chain, suggesting that USP7 preferentially interacts with and cleaves ubiquitin moieties that have free Lys48 side chains. We investigated this idea by engineering di-ubiquitin chains containing differential proximal and distal isotopic labels and measuring USP7 binding by nuclear magnetic resonance. This preferential binding protracted the depolymerization kinetics of Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains relative to Lys63-linked chains. In summary, engineering compounds that inhibit USP7 activity by attenuating ubiquitin binding suggests opportunities for developing other deubiquitinase inhibitors and may be a strategy more broadly applicable to inhibiting proteins that require ubiquitin binding for full functional activity."

https://openalex.org/W2765568857,"Diverse forms of nanoscale architecture generate structural colour and perform signalling functions within and between species. Structural colour is the result of the interference of light from approximately regular periodic structures; some structural disorder is, however, inevitable in biological organisms. Is this disorder functional and subject to evolutionary selection, or is it simply an unavoidable outcome of biological developmental processes? Here we show that disordered nanostructures enable flowers to produce visual signals that are salient to bees. These disordered nanostructures (identified in most major lineages of angiosperms) have distinct anatomies but convergent optical properties; they all produce angle-dependent scattered light, predominantly at short wavelengths (ultraviolet and blue). We manufactured artificial flowers with nanoscale structures that possessed tailored levels of disorder in order to investigate how foraging bumblebees respond to this optical effect. We conclude that floral nanostructures have evolved, on multiple independent occasions, an effective degree of relative spatial disorder that generates a photonic signature that is highly salient to insect pollinators. Disordered nanoscale striations on petals, tepals and bracts have evolved multiple times among flowering plants and provide a salient visual signal to foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). The natural world is always a bit fuzzy at the edges, but the fuzziness has a purpose. The surfaces of petals of many flowers have striations or ridges, which scatter light. But these arrays of ridges are not always arranged in a regimental order. In this paper, Beverley Glover and colleagues find that all of the flowering plants that they examined whose petals have such striations always display the same degree of disorder. This creates a 'blue halo' around the petals that pollinators find attractive. The authors find that similarly disorderly conduct happens in all flowering plants that are pollinated by insects or other animals, whereas the most primitive flowers, which are not pollinated by animals, seem not to have this capacity for orderly disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2765958735,"Although a plurality of drugs target G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), most have emerged from classical medicinal chemistry and pharmacology programs and resemble one another structurally and functionally. Though effective, these drugs are often promiscuous. With the realization that GPCRs signal via multiple pathways, and with the emergence of crystal structures for this family of proteins, there is an opportunity to target GPCRs with new chemotypes and confer new signaling modalities. We consider structure-based and physical screening methods that have led to the discovery of new reagents, focusing particularly on the former. We illustrate their use against previously untargeted or orphan GPCRs, against allosteric sites, and against classical orthosteric sites that selectively activate one downstream pathway over others. The ligands that emerge are often chemically novel, which can lead to new biological effects."
https://openalex.org/W2766970278,"Partner dance has been shown to be beneficial for the health of older adults. Robots could potentially facilitate healthy aging by engaging older adults in partner dance-based exercise. However, partner dance involves physical contact between the dancers, and older adults would need to be accepting of partner dancing with a robot. Using methods from the technology acceptance literature, we conducted a study with 16 healthy older adults to investigate their acceptance of robots for partner dance-based exercise. Participants successfully led a human-scale wheeled robot with arms (i.e., a mobile manipulator) in a simple, which we refer to as the Partnered Stepping Task (PST). Participants led the robot by maintaining physical contact and applying forces to the robot’s end effectors. According to questionnaires, participants were generally accepting of the robot for partner dance-based exercise, tending to perceive it as useful, easy to use, and enjoyable. Participants tended to perceive the robot as easier to use after performing the PST with it. Through a qualitative data analysis of structured interview data, we also identified facilitators and barriers to acceptance of robots for partner dance-based exercise. Throughout the study, our robot used admittance control to successfully dance with older adults, demonstrating the feasibility of this method. Overall, our results suggest that robots could successfully engage older adults in partner dance-based exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2765927213,"Autophagy is a conserved process in which cytoplasmic components are sequestered for degradation in the vacuole/lysosomes in eukaryotic cells. Autophagy is induced under a variety of starvation conditions, such as the depletion of nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, zinc, and others. However, apart from nitrogen starvation, it remains unclear how these stimuli induce autophagy. In yeast, for example, it remains contentious whether autophagy is induced under carbon starvation conditions, with reports variously suggesting both induction and lack of induction upon depletion of carbon. We therefore undertook an analysis to account for these inconsistencies, concluding that autophagy is induced in response to abrupt carbon starvation when cells are grown with glycerol but not glucose as the carbon source. We found that autophagy under these conditions is mediated by nonselective degradation that is highly dependent on the autophagosome-associated scaffold proteins Atg11 and Atg17. We also found that the extent of carbon starvation–induced autophagy is positively correlated with cells’ oxygen consumption rate, drawing a link between autophagy induction and respiratory metabolism. Further biochemical analyses indicated that maintenance of intracellular ATP levels is also required for carbon starvation–induced autophagy and that autophagy plays an important role in cell viability during prolonged carbon starvation. Our findings suggest that carbon starvation–induced autophagy is negatively regulated by carbon catabolite repression.

The structural and optical properties of the calcined silver nanoparticles at 600°C with diverse Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) concentrations varied from 2% to 4% were studied by means of different techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the production of pure Ag nanoparticles at a given Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) concentration. The X-ray powder diffraction spectra are evidence for the transformation of the amorphous sample at 30°C to the cubic crystalline nanostructures at the calcination temperatures for all Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) concentrations. The transmission electron microscopy images showed the creation of spherical silver nanoparticles with the average particle size decreased by increasing Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) concentrations from 4.61 nm at 2% to 2.49 nm at 4% Poly(vinylpyrrolidone). The optical properties were investigated by means of UV-vis absorption spectrophotometer, which showed an increase in the conduction band of Ag nanoparticles with increasing Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) concentrations from 2.83 eV at 2% Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) to 2.94 eV at 4% Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) due to decreasing particle size. This was due to less attraction between conduction electrons and metal ions for smaller particle size corresponding to fewer atoms that made up the metal nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2766686162,"Here we introduce a new assessment of emotion regulation called the Mentalized Affectivity Scale (MAS). A large online adult sample (N = 2,840) completed the 60-item MAS along with a battery of psychological measures. Results revealed a robust three-component structure underlying mentalized affectivity, which we labeled: Identifying emotions (the ability to identify emotions and to reflect on the factors that influence them); Processing emotions (the ability to modulate and distinguish complex emotions); and Expressing emotions (the tendency to express emotions outwardly or inwardly). Hierarchical modeling suggested that Processing emotions delineates from Identifying them, and Expressing emotions delineates from Processing them. We then showed how these components are associated with personality traits, well-being, trauma, and 18 different psychological disorders (including mood, neurological, and personality disorders). Notably, those with anxiety, mood, and personality disorders showed a profile of high Identifying and low Processing compared to controls. Further, results showed how mentalized affectivity scores varied across psychological treatment modalities and years spent in therapy. Taken together, the model of mentalized affectivity advances prior theory and research on emotion regulation and the MAS is a useful and reliable instrument that can be used in both clinical and non-clinical settings in psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2766142738,"GPCRs have diverse signaling capabilities, based on their ability to assume various conformations. Moreover, it is now appreciated that certain ligands can promote distinct receptor conformations and thereby bias signaling toward a specific pathway to differentially affect cell function. The recently deorphanized G protein-coupled receptor OGR1 [ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR68)] exhibits diverse signaling events when stimulated by reductions in extracellular pH. We recently demonstrated airway smooth muscle cells transduce multiple signaling events, reflecting a diverse capacity to couple to multiple G proteins. Moreover, we recently discovered that the benzodiazepine lorazepam, more commonly recognized as an agonist of the γ-aminobutyric acid A(GABAA) receptor, can function as an allosteric modulator of OGR1 and, similarly, can promote multiple signaling events. In this study, we demonstrated that different benzodiazepines exhibit a range of biases for OGR1, with sulazepam selectively activating the canonical Gs of the G protein signaling pathway, in heterologous expression systems, as well as in several primary cell types. These findings highlight the potential power of biased ligand pharmacology for manipulating receptor signaling qualitatively, to preferentially activate pathways that are therapeutically beneficial.—Pera, T., Deshpande, D.

https://openalex.org/W2765832939,"Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are used as a rich source of metabolic energy by several bacteria including important pathogens. Because LCFAs also induce oxidative stress, which may be detrimental to bacterial growth, it is imperative to understand the strategies employed by bacteria to counteract such stresses. Here, we performed a genetic screen in Escherichia coli on the LCFA, oleate, and compared our results with published genome-wide screens of multiple non-fermentable carbon sources. This large-scale analysis revealed that among components of the aerobic electron transport chain (ETC), only genes involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, an electron carrier in the ETC, are highly required for growth in LCFAs when compared with other carbon sources. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that this increased requirement of ubiquinone is to mitigate elevated levels of reactive oxygen species generated by LCFA degradation. Intriguingly, we find that unlike other ETC components whose requirement for growth is inversely correlated with the energy yield of non-fermentable carbon sources, the requirement of ubiquinone correlates with oxidative stress. Our results therefore suggest that a mechanism in addition to the known electron carrier function of ubiquinone is required to explain its antioxidant role in LCFA metabolism. Importantly, among the various oxidative stress combat players in E. coli, ubiquinone acts as the cell's first line of defense against LCFA-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our results emphasize that ubiquinone is a key antioxidant during LCFA metabolism and therefore provides a rationale for investigating its role in LCFA-utilizing pathogenic bacteria."

Previous studies have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the activity of FoxO1, which has been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism. However, its function and mechanism of action in DM-induced energy disorders and also in bone development remains unclear. Here, using in vitro and in vivo approaches including osteoblast-specific, conditional FoxO1-knock-out mice, we demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 ameliorates abnormal osteoblast proliferation in DM-induced oxidative stress conditions and rescues the impaired glucose and bone metabolism through FoxO1 nuclear exclusion resulting from the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2766427936,"Acute pancreatitis is a disease associated with inflammation and tissue damage. One protein that protects against acute injury, including ischemic injury to both the kidney and heart, is renalase, which is secreted into the blood by the kidney and other tissues. However, whether renalase reduces acute injury associated with pancreatitis is unknown. Here, we used both in vitro and in vivo murine models of acute pancreatitis to study renalase's effects on this condition. In isolated pancreatic lobules, pretreatment with recombinant human renalase (rRNLS) blocked zymogen activation caused by cerulein, carbachol, and a bile acid. Renalase also blocked cerulein-induced cell injury and histological changes. In the in vivo cerulein model of pancreatitis, genetic deletion of renalase resulted in more severe disease, and administering rRNLS to cerulein-exposed WT mice after pancreatitis onset was protective. Because pathological increases in acinar cell cytosolic calcium levels are central to the initiation of acute pancreatitis, we also investigated whether rRNLS could function through its binding protein, plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4b (PMCA4b), which excretes calcium from cells. We found that PMCA4b is expressed in both murine and human acinar cells and that a PMCA4b-selective inhibitor worsens pancreatitis-induced injury and blocks the protective effects of rRNLS. These findings suggest that renalase is a protective plasma protein that reduces acinar cell injury through a plasma membrane calcium ATPase. Because exogenous rRNLS reduces the severity of acute pancreatitis, it has potential as a therapeutic agent."

https://openalex.org/W2766576835,"The prevalence of hyperuricemia has increased rapidly over the past decades. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental endocrine disruptor. We investigated the effects of BPA on uric acid metabolism and its potential mechanisms. Experiments were performed in different animal models, cell cultures, and humans. In 3 different animal models, BPA exposure increased serum and hepatic uric acid with enhanced activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) in liver, whereas the excretion of uric acid was unchanged. Both in vivo and in vitro, BPA-induced uric acid production was decreased after treatment with allopurinol, which is a XO inhibitor. XO led to the accumulation of uric acid after xanthine was added, with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, which was enhanced by BPA. Altered secondary structures of XO were found by circular dichroism analysis in the conditions of different BPA concentrations. Molecular docking portrayed Asp360 and Lys422 of XO to be the preferred binding sites for BPA. Mutation of both sites significantly blocked the effect of BPA on XO activity. In humans, patients with hyperuricemia exhibited higher levels of serum BPA than subjects without hyperuricemia.

We investigated the possible function of male-infant-male interactions (MIMIs) in male-male social bonding processes by analysing about 9000h of focal animal observations collected on two groups of wild Assamese macaques. In support of an agonistic buffering function of MIMIs, after engaging in a MIMI upon approach, subordinates stayed longer in close proximity of a dominant male. Overall, the frequency of MIMIs increased the stronger the affiliative relationship between two males, suggesting that MIMIs like grooming function in relationship maintenance. We did not find support for a role of MIMIs in bond formation as the frequency of MIMIs did not affect the time a male dyad spent in proximity in the consecutive year. Our results contribute to the general debate on behaviours influencing social dynamics in group living mammals."

Cytoplasmic dynein moves post-Golgi vesicles that carry rhodopsin toward the base of the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells; however, the identity of the motors that are involved in the vesicular trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins in nonphotoreceptor cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the minus end–directed kinesin KIFC1 (kinesin family member C1) is required for both ciliary membrane protein transport and serum starvation–induced ciliogenesis in retinal pigmented epithelial 1 cells. Although KIFC1 is known as a mitotic motor that is sequestered in the nucleus during interphase, KIFC1 immunoreactivity appeared in the Golgi region after serum starvation. Knockdown of KIFC1 inhibited the export of ciliary receptors from the Golgi complex. KIFC1 overexpression affected the Golgi localization of GMAP210 (Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210) and IFT20 (intraflagellar transport 20), which are involved in membrane protein transport to cilia. Moreover, KIFC1 physically interacted with ASAP1 (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat and PH domain 1), which regulates the budding of rhodopsin transport carriers from the Golgi complex, and KIFC1 depletion caused Golgi accumulation of ASAP1. A decrease in the centrosomal levels of IFT20 and TTBK2 (τ-tubulin kinase 2) was associated with ciliogenesis defects in KIFC1-depleted cells.

https://openalex.org/W2767187646,"Dairy proteins—whey protein, in particular—are satiating and often recommended for weight control; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which whey protein and its components promote satiety and weight loss. We used diet-induced obese rats to determine whether the hypophagic effects of diets that are enriched with whey and its fractions, lactalbumin and lactoferrin, are mediated by the gut hormone, peptide YY (PYY). We demonstrate that high protein diets that contain whey, lactalbumin, and lactoferrin decreased food intake and body weight with a concurrent increase in PYY mRNA abundance in the colon and/or plasma PYY concentrations. Of importance, blockade of PYY neuropeptide Y receptor subtype 2 (Y2) receptors with a peripherally restricted antagonist attenuated the hypophagic effects of diets that are enriched with whey protein fractions. Diets that are enriched with whey fractions were less preferred; however, in a modified conditioned taste preference test, PYY Y2 receptor blockade induced hyperphagia of a lactoferrin diet, but caused a reduction in preference for Y2 antagonist-paired flavor, which suggested that PYY signaling is important for lactoferrin-induced satiety, but not essential for preference for lactoferrin-enriched diets. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the satiety of diets that are enriched with whey protein components is mediated, in part, via enhanced PYY secretion and action in obese male rats.—Zapata, R.

https://openalex.org/W2765594772,"Biological sex differences affect the course of HIV infection, with untreated women having lower viral loads compared to their male counterparts but, for a given viral load, women have a higher rate of progression to AIDS. However, the vast majority of data on viral evolution, a process that is clearly impacted by host immunity and could be impacted by sex differences, has been derived from men. We conducted an intensive analysis of HIV-1 gag and env-gp120 evolution taken over the first 6-11 years of infection from 8 Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) participants who had not received combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). This was compared to similar data previously collected from men, with both groups infected with HIV-1 subtype B. Early virus populations in men and women were generally homogenous with no differences in diversity between sexes. No differences in ensuing nucleotide substitution rates were found between the female and male cohorts studied herein. As previously reported for men, time to peak diversity in env-gp120 in women was positively associated with time to CD4+ cell count below 200 (P = 0.017), and the number of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites generally increased over time, followed by a plateau or decline, with the majority of changes localized to the V1-V2 region. These findings strongly suggest that the sex differences in HIV-1 disease progression attributed to immune system composition and sensitivities are not revealed by, nor do they impact, global patterns of viral evolution, the latter of which proceeds similarly in women and men."

The Gs family of Gα proteins, comprised of two highly homologous Gs and Golf subtypes, positively couple to adenylate cyclase (thus, “s” for stimulatory). Upon activation, both Gs and Golf promote cAMP production and subsequent signaling events such as activation of the PKA cascade. Gs is ubiquitously expressed in most organs, whereas Golf is mainly restricted to the brain. Moreover, within the brain, Gs and Golf exhibit distinct expression patterns. Gs is uniformly expressed throughout the brain, except in the striatum where its expression is very low. In contrast, Golf is highly expressed in the striatum and olfactory tubercle, as well as in the hippocampus and cerebellum to a lesser extent (41Belluscio L. Gold G.H. Nemes A. Axel R. Mice deficient in Golf are anosmic.Neuron. 1998; 20: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The contrast in tissue expression for Gs and Golf is quite dramatic and unique among other Gα homologs (e.g. Gi versus Go, Gq versus G11, and G12 versus G13) (1Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M.

However, the extent to which conformational changes in G protein are conserved in living cells, as well as across different receptors and different G-protein isoforms, remains unclear. In particular, little is known about the Gs homolog Golf in terms of its functional similarities and differences. Despite their different expression patterns, the high degree of homology in amino acid sequences (89% identity) has led to the assumption that Gs and Golf function essentially identically at both the molecular and cellular levels. For this reason, as well as the fact that Golf expression is typically poor in heterologous cells, Gs functional assays have been used as surrogates for Golf activation, begging the question of just how similar these processes are. The answer may provide specific ways to target selectively physiological functions mediated by either Gs or Golf signaling. In the current study, we first focused on β2AR-Gs activation in intact cells to investigate conformational changes of different domains of Gs. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assays, we assessed movements both within the G protein, as well as between the receptor and Gα subunit. Using a library of novel Gs biosensors with either luciferase or GFP variants inserted at various positions throughout the structure, we studied conformational changes in living cells and compared the results to the crystal structures of the closed and open conformations of Gs (2Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S. Pardon E. Calinski D. Mathiesen J.M. Shah S.T. Lyons J.A. Caffrey M.

Sprang S.R. Crystal structure of the adenylyl cyclase activator Gsα.Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We then studied conformational changes in Gs induced by activation of the D1R, A2AR, and β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR). Next, taking advantage of the significant homology, we created a series of Golf biosensor constructs with insertions at the same nine positions used for Gs. Agonist-induced conformational changes in Golf were compared with those in Gs. Finally, Golf assay optimization was carried out for D1R. Our analysis using these Gs biosensors suggests that conformational changes within the Gs heterotrimer are similar when induced by different Gs-coupled receptors. Comparison between the Gs and Golf sensor readouts also indicates a very similar regulation of activation by endogenous agonists. Using this set of Gs and Golf biosensors, the efficacy and potency of agonists, as well as the activation preference between Gs and Golf, can be studied in relation to structural changes and subsequent effector activation. Our results with D1R establish that these biosensors represent a novel pharmacological tool to study structure-function relationships comparing Gs and Golf. A dramatic structural change is apparent between the closed (PDB code 1AZT) and open (PDB code 3SN6) states of the Gs heterotrimer, particularly in the α-helical domain (Fig. 1A). To detect such conformational changes upon G-protein activation, biosensors were constructed in which Rluc or mVenus were inserted at nine different insertion positions in the loop motifs of different domains in Gs (Fig. 1, A and B). The insertion positions (i.e. loop regions) were selected to avoid structural perturbations. Position 7 is located between the N terminus and αN. Positions 67 and 71 are situated in the linker-loop motif, which was not resolved in the crystal structures; they are in the hinge domain that connects the Ras-like catalytic domain and α-helical domain. Insertion of GFP at position 71 of Gs has been functionally validated previously (7Yu J.-Z. Rasenick M.M. Real-time visualization of a fluorescent Gs: dissociation of the activated G protein from plasma membrane.Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Positions 99, 154, and 175 are located in the α-helical domain (position 99, proximal; positions 154 and 175, distal), whereas positions 305, 338, and 349 are located in the Ras-like domain, avoiding the catalytic core. Insertion of mVenus (YFP variant) or Rluc8 at these positions led to similar levels of expression based on levels of fluorescence for the mVenus constructs and luminescence for the RLuc8 constructs (data not shown). Relative movements between Gs and Gγ2 upon receptor activation were studied, similarly to previous analysis of Gi activation using Gi biosensors with insertions at positions 60, 91, and 122 (aligned with positions 67, 99, and 131 in Gs, respectively) (8Galés C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A. Hébert T.E. Bouvier M. Real-time monitoring of receptor and G-protein interactions in living cells.Nat.

Of the nine insertion constructs we created, when co-expressed with β2AR (Fig. 2A), Gs with insertions at positions 305, 338, and 349 failed to show significant isoproterenol-induced BRET changes, although the fluorescence and luminescence levels were not significantly different from other biosensors. Insertion positions, 67, 71, 99, and 154, on the other hand, produced substantial agonist-induced BRET changes. When co-expressed with β2AR (Fig. 2A), isoproterenol increased BRET between Gs67-Rluc and γ2-GFP10 or Gs71-Rluc and γ2-GFP10, consistent with greater proximity of the sensors in the two subunits. In contrast, Gs99-Rluc and γ2-GFP10 or Gs154-Rluc and γ2-GFP10 decreased BRET, indicating an increase in distance. When the donor–acceptor pair was reversed, the directions of BRET change in Gs-Venus-γ2-Rluc remained the same (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, when co-expressed with D1R (Fig. 2B), the directions of change for all the positions were consistent with the β2AR results. Activation of adrenergic β1AR and adenosine A2AR also showed the same directionality as D1R and β2AR (supplemental Fig. S2). Although the β1 and γ2 subunits are widely expressed in the brain, β2 and γ7 subunits have been reported to be enriched in the striatum where they play an important role in D1R- and A2AR-mediated signaling (10Schwindinger W.F.

Therefore, β1/γ2-Venus or β1/γ2-GFP10 was replaced with β2/γ7-Venus or β2/γ7-GFP10 to study D1R activation. The directionalities of BRET change were the same for the β1/γ2 and β2/γ7 pairs (supplemental Fig. S1). When tested for β2AR with β1/γ2 or β2/γ7, the same directionalities were also observed (supplemental Fig. S1). Venus-fused Gs constructs were also tested for their use in measuring receptor–Gα engagement (supplemental Fig. S3). With both β2AR and D1R, sensor position 154 showed the largest dynamic range for agonist-induced effects, ∼3-fold greater than that observed for the previously studied position 71 insertion (7Yu J.-Z.

To provide a structural context to our BRET results, we used the closed crystal structure of Gs (6Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Crystal structure of the adenylyl cyclase activator Gsα.Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and the open conformation of the Gs crystal structure in complex with β2AR (2Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S. Pardon E. Calinski D. Mathiesen J.M. Shah S.T. Lyons J.A. Caffrey M. Gellman S.H. et al.Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar) as beginning and ending structures, respectively, to simulate domain movement between the closed and open crystal structures of Gs (Fig. 2, C and D). A missing loop (residues 66–72) of the closed Gs crystal structure was built using the Rosetta loop prediction algorithm. The best scoring conformation was extracted and equilibrated in the context of the protein by a 20-ns all-atom MD simulation. Adiabatic biased MD was then employed to generate a continuous, low-energy transition path starting from the closed Gs crystal structure and reducing the root mean square deviation from the open Gs crystallographic conformation. Distances between the Cα atoms of experimental insertion points for the different configurations are reported in supplemental Table S1, showing the general agreement with changes in BRET values. The hinge loop (positions 67 and 71), buried partially between Ras-like and α-helical domains in closed state, opens and moves closer to the γ subunit in the open state. In contrast, the α-helical domain (positions 99 and 154) moves away from the γ subunit. As mentioned above, the Golf subunit is widely expressed in the striatum, where it is critical to the function of D1R. Taking advantage of its 89% sequence identity to Gs, luciferase or mVenus was inserted at the same nine positions explored above (Fig. 1B). Given their enriched expression in striatum (12Hervé D.

Similar to the Gs results, both Golf-Rluc-γ7-GFP10 and Golf-Venus-γ7-Rluc configurations revealed an increase in BRET values at the hinge region (position 69) and a decrease in BRET values or a lack of response in the α-helical domain (positions 100 and 155) for β2AR receptor activation (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S2). The same directionalities were observed for D1R, further supporting the conservation of domain movements of these homologous G proteins when activated by different receptors (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S2). The results are also consistent with a large displacement of the α-helical domain in Golf, similar to that observed in Gs (Fig. 2, C and D) and to the crystal structure of the active complex (2Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S. Pardon E. Calinski D. Mathiesen J.M. Shah S.T. Lyons J.A. Caffrey M.

To establish a reliable assay for drug screening at the D1R with regard to Golf coupling, different configurations of BRET were tested (supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 4). Fig. 4 shows direct comparisons between Gs and Golf biosensors in the activation and engagement modes. For Gα-γ activation assays, the relative potency and efficacy differences between dopamine, a full agonist, and norepinephrine, a less potent agonist, were tested. The potency differences between the two agonists were similar for activation of Gs and Golf (Fig. 4, A and B, and supplemental Table S3). The engagement assays also demonstrated a tight agreement of relative potency and efficacy between dopamine and norepinephrine in Gs and Golf (Fig. 4, C and D, and supplemental Table S3). The engagement (i.e. D1R-Rluc-Golf-Venus) BRET configuration was pursued for optimization because of its larger dynamic window. Different β-γ subunit combinations were tested (supplemental Fig. S5). Although the β1-γ7 and β2-γ7 combinations showed a similar dynamic range, β2-γ7 was chosen for the rest of the studies because of the established expression overlap in striatum (10Schwindinger W.F.

One of the crucial factors for successful Golf BRET assay regardless of configuration was co-expression of the G-protein chaperone Ric8 (18Chan P. Gabay M. Wright F.A. Kan W. Oner S.S. Lanier S.M.

Because luciferase expression, detected by luminescence, does not differ significantly with and without Ric8 co-expression, the dramatic change in dynamic range of BRET may have to do with chaperone activities of Ric8, possibly rescuing misfolding or aiding proper localization of the Golf biosensor to the receptor complex rather than simply enhancing its expression (supplemental Fig. S4). Overall, cross-comparison of the D1R-Gα engagement and Gα-γ activation assays validates the potency and efficacy range of the four assays tested and thus their utility in pharmacological characterization of D1R activation. Because the Ras-like domain, hinge region, and α-helical domain are well-conserved in other classes of Gα subunits (21Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Heterotrimeric G protein activation by G-protein–coupled receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), the relative movements upon activation were compared in other Gα subunits. The same three sensor insertions (i.e. Gs equivalent of positions 67, 99, and 154) were made in Gi1 and Gq at the aligned amino acid residues (Fig. 5A). Upon transfection with dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and using dopamine as ligand, for Gi1, the hinge region (position 60) moves closer to the γ subunit, whereas the α-helical domain (positions 91 and 145) moves away from the γ subunit (Fig. 5B), similar to our results in Gs (Fig. 2). The conformational changes in the hinge and α-helical domains of Gi1 are consistent with previous reports with insertions at positions 60 and 91 (8Galés C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A.

Upon transfection with muscarinic M1 receptor (M1R) and using carbachol as ligand, Gq sensors also revealed the same directionalities of BRET change for the α-helical domain (positions 97 and 150) (Fig. 5C) but with a very robust dynamic range for drug response with the position 97 sensor. However, the insertion at position 66 (equivalent to 67 in Gs) yielded very little agonist-induced BRET (Fig. 5C, orange curve), although the luminescence was similar (data not shown), suggesting a possible structural difference in the hinge loop of Gq. Finally, using the Venus-fused Gi1 or Gq sensors, receptor–Gα engagement BRET was assessed for D2R or M1R (supplemental Fig. S6). Consistent with the Gs results, insertion at position 150 of Gq (aligned to 154 in Gs) gave the largest efficacy window, as well as higher potency when compared with the previously characterized position 97 (22Qin K. Dong C. Wu G. Lambert N.A. Inactive-state preassembly of Gq-coupled receptors and Gq heterotrimers.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S6B). This trend was not maintained with Gi1, where insertion at position 91 (aligned with position 99 in Gs) produced the most robust sensor (supplemental Fig. S6A). Taken together, these results with G-protein activation BRET have established generally conserved movements of the α-helical domain in three different classes of Gα subunits, albeit with subtle differences. The seminal work leading to the crystal structure of the active β2AR-Gs heterotrimer complex has enabled comparison between open and closed structures of the G protein, as well as interactions of the G protein with the receptor, providing molecular details of key conformational changes associated with the activation process (2Rasmussen S.G.

Although the α-helical domain may undergo spontaneous fluctuation between the open and closed states, insertion of the α5 helix of Gs into the intracellular vestibule of the β2AR promotes opening of the α-helical domain. The pronounced decrease in BRET values in living cells indicates a distancing event between the α-helical domain and the γ subunit, consistent with an opening movement from three different amino acid positions of the α-helical domain (positions 99, 154, and 175).

Here we clearly demonstrate that zebrafish ZNF365 is a newly identified LPS-binding protein capable of interacting with the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, and Aeromonas hydrophila, and functions as an antibacterial effector molecule capable of directly killing the bacteria. We also reveal that N-terminal residues 30-55 consisting of the ZnF_C2H2 domain are indispensable for ZNF365 antimicrobial activity. Importantly, microinjection of recombinant ZNF365 into early embryos significantly enhanced the resistance of the embryos against pathogenic A. hydrophila challenge, whereas down-regulation of ZNF365 by injection of znf365 morpholino into embryos considerably lowered their resistance against A. hydrophila challenge. Furthermore, the N-terminal peptide Z30-55 with in vitro antibacterial activity also promoted the resistance of embryos against A. hydrophila, but the peptide Z56-345 without in vitro antibacterial activity did not. Collectively, these results indicate that ZNF365 is a maternal LPS-binding protein that can protect the early embryos of zebrafish against pathogenic attacks, a novel role to be assigned to ZNF365 proteins. This work also provides new insights into the immunologic function of the zinc finger proteins that are widely distributed in various animals.-Du, X., Zhou, Y., Song, L., Wang, X., Zhang, S.

Here, we report that WT1 stimulates expression of Kdr, the gene encoding VEGF receptor 2, in murine embryonic gonads. We found that WT1 and KDR are co-expressed in Sertoli cells of the testes and somatic cells of embryonic ovaries. Vivo-morpholino–mediated WT1 knockdown decreased Kdr transcripts in cultured embryonic gonads at multiple developmental stages. Furthermore, WT1 bound to the Kdr promoter in the chromatin of embryonic testes and ovaries. Forced expression of the WT1(−KTS) isoform, which functions as a transcription factor, increased KDR mRNA levels, whereas the WT1(+KTS) isoform, which acts presumably on the post-transcriptional level, did not. ChIP indicated that WT1(−KTS), but not WT1(+KTS), binds to the KDR promoter. Treatment with the KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU1498 or the KDR ligand VEGFA revealed that KDR signaling represses the testis-promoting gene Sox9 in embryonic XX gonads. WT1 knockdown abrogated the stimulatory effect of SU1498-mediated KDR inhibition on Sox9 expression. Exposure to 1% O2 to mimic the low-oxygen conditions in the embryo increased Vegfa expression but did not affect Sox9 mRNA levels in gonadal explants. However, incubation in 1% O2 in the presence of SU1498 significantly reduced Sox9 transcripts in cultured testes and increased Sox9 levels in ovaries. These findings demonstrate that both the local oxygen environment and WT1, which enhances KDR expression, contribute to sex-specific Sox9 expression in developing murine gonads.

Gonadal development is a unique process in which the undifferentiated genital ridge can give rise to two distinct organs, the testes and the ovaries. A single gene on the Y chromosome, Sry (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) is both necessary and sufficient for testis formation (1Koopman P. Gubbay J. Vivian N. Goodfellow P.

A role of WT1 in murine testis differentiation is confirmed by the disruption of seminiferous tubules and the loss of germ cells upon conditional Wt1 deletion in Sertoli cells. Abnormal testis formation in these mice correlates with SOX9 depletion from WT1-deficient Sertoli cells after cessation of Sry expression (14Gao F. Maiti S. Alam N. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R.

VEGF and its cognate receptor (KDR, also known as VEGFR2 or FLK-1) are essential for establishing the testis vasculature possibly by recruiting KDR-positive endothelial cells from the adjacent mesonephros, a transitory stage of the kidney (17Capel B.

Although WT1 has indeed been reported to enhance VEGF expression (32Hanson J. Gorman J. Reese J. Fraizer G.

In the present study, we therefore tested the hypothesis that WT1 stimulates transcription of the Kdr gene in developing testes and ovaries. Because oxygen levels are usually lower in embryonic than in adult tissues (reviewed in Ref. 34Meschia G. Fetal oxygenation and maternal ventilation.Clin.

Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11987-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we first explored whether WT1 is required for normal Kdr expression in embryonic testes and ovaries. For this purpose, XX and XY gonads were isolated from murine embryos at 11.5, 12.5, and 13.5 dpc, respectively, and cultured ex vivo for 72 h in the presence of a sequence-specific antisense vivo-morpholino to inhibit WT1 protein translation (Fig. 1A). All experiments were performed in a pairwise manner (i.e. the second gonad of each embryo was incubated with a mismatch vivo-morpholino, which differed from the Wt1 morpholino in five nucleotides). Antisense inhibition of WT1 (Wt1 vivo-morpholino) significantly decreased Kdr transcripts in XY gonads isolated at 11.5 and 12.5 dpc, but not at 13.5 dpc. In XX gonads, WT1 knockdown significantly reduced Kdr mRNA levels at all three developmental stages analyzed (Fig. 1A). Of note, in XY gonads, basal Kdr expression diminished after developmental time (Fig. 1A). WT1 and KDR are also expressed in embryonic kidneys. However, knockdown of WT1 did not significantly change Kdr transcript levels in murine embryonic kidney explants, suggesting a rather gonad-specific role for the regulation of Kdr expression by WT1 (supplemental Fig. S1). Embryonic gonads consist of multiple cell types and therefore do not allow one to distinguish between cell-autonomous and indirect effects of WT1 on Kdr expression. We addressed this issue by using the murine mesonephros-derived M15 cell line, which has robust WT1 protein levels. Transfection with Wt1 siRNA reduced Kdr transcripts in M15 cells ∼4-fold (p < 0.05) compared with treatment with non-targeting siRNA. Efficient gene silencing was monitored by immunoblotting with an anti-WT1 antibody (Fig. 1B). Assuming a direct stimulatory effect on transcription, one would expect that WT1 binds to regulatory regions in the Kdr gene. The latter possibility was tested by ChIP in embryonic XY and XX gonads, using the promoter of the Egr3 gene as a positive control (35Motamedi F.J. Badro D.A. Clarkson M. Lecca M.R. Bradford S.T.

Enrichment of immunoprecipitated Kdr and Egr3 DNA was compared with a gene desert region with closed chromatin in the mouse genome (ChIP neg). A histone H3K4me3 antibody was used for the precipitation of open chromatin. Precipitation with WT1 antibody enriched the proximal promoter of the Kdr gene (Kdr F1/R1) ∼8- and 14-fold in XY and XX gonads, respectively (Fig. 1D).

A second genomic region including another putative WT1-binding element (Kdr F2/R2) in the 5′-UTR of the Kdr gene was not enriched with the WT1 antibody. These findings indicate that WT1 is necessary for normal Kdr expression and binds to the Kdr promoter in murine embryonic gonads. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing gives rise to WT1 isoforms, WT1(+KTS) and WT1(−KTS), which differ in their chromatin-binding affinity. The WT1(−KTS) protein, which lacks the KTS (lysine-threonine-serine) amino acid insertion between zinc fingers 3 and 4, exhibits high DNA-binding affinity and functions as a transcription factor (reviewed in Ref. 28Toska E. Roberts S.G. Mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by WT1 (Wilms' tumour 1).Biochem. J. 2014; 461: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By contrast, the WT1(+KTS) isoform has been reported to interact with RNA rather than DNA (26Larsson S.H. Charlieu J.P. Miyagawa K. Engelkamp D. Rassoulzadegan M. Ross A. Cuzin F. van Heyningen V.

Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 789-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used human osteosarcoma cells with inducible expression of either WT1(−KTS) or WT1(+KTS) protein to examine the effects of both WT1 isoforms on KDR expression (Fig. 2A). Induction of WT1(−KTS) by removal of tetracycline (−tet) from the culture medium increased KDR transcripts in UB27 cells more than 4- and 8-fold (p < 0.05) after 48 and 72 h, respectively. Overexpression of WT1(+KTS) in UD28 cells had no significant effect on KDR mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). ChIP was performed to investigate whether WT1(−KTS) and WT1(+KTS) proteins bind to the promoter of the human KDR gene (Fig. 2C). Induced expression (−tet) of WT1(−KTS) in UB27 cells significantly enriched KDR promoter DNA using WT1 antibody for immunoprecipitation. Non-induced (+tet) UB27 cells, which contain no WT1(−KTS) protein, showed no enrichment (Fig. 2C). Intronic DNA sequence of the ACTB gene lacking known WT1 binding sites served as a reference locus. An acetyl-histone H3 antibody was used as a control for immunoprecipitation of chromatin. Notably, incubation with WT1 antibody failed to enrich the KDR promoter in UD28 cells in the absence (−tet) and presence (+tet) of tetracycline (i.e. at high and low levels of WT1(+KTS), respectively) (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that only WT1(−KTS) and not WT1(+KTS) protein binds to the KDR promoter and stimulates expression of the KDR gene. WT1 expression in mature gonads is restricted to Sertoli cells of the testis and granulosa cells of the ovary (12Pelletier J. Schalling M. Buckler A.J. Rogers A. Haber D.A. Housman D. Expression of the Wilms' tumor gene WT1 in the murine urogenital system.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Assuming that WT1 regulates Kdr expression in embryonic gonads, one would expect that both proteins are co-expressed during gonadal development. To test this, we performed double immunofluorescence staining with rabbit anti-KDR and mouse anti-WT1 antibodies in the gonads of rats. Rat tissue was chosen for technical reasons because of its suitability for the use with primary antibodies raised in mouse and rabbit. Embryonic XY and XX gonads were analyzed at the developmental stage 15.5 dpc, which corresponds to ∼14 dpc in mice (37Clement T.M. Bhandari R.K. Sadler-Riggleman I. Skinner M.K. SRY directly regulates the neurotrophin 3 promoter during male sex determination and testis development in rats.Biol. Reprod. 2011; 85: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A clear overlapping expression of KDR and WT1 was seen in the seminiferous cords of embryonic XY gonads (Fig. 3d). Whereas WT1 localized to the nuclei of Sertoli cells, KDR was detected in their cytoplasm and the basal membrane of the seminiferous cords (Fig. 3, a–d). A similar distribution of both proteins could also be observed in adult testes (Fig. 3, f–i). In the developing XX gonad, WT1 expression is restricted to the somatic cells and later the pregranulosa cells. KDR is observed at the basement membrane of the pregranulosa cells enclosing the late stage primary oocytes in the inner zone of the developing ovary (Fig. 3, k–n). In adult ovaries, WT1 is present in the granulosa cells. Here, KDR protein is mainly located to the follicular basement membrane in the non-vascularized zona granulosa. KDR expression could also be observed in the blood vessels of the theca interna (Fig. 3, p–s). Accumulating evidence suggests a role for VEGF signaling via KDR in gonadal development (15Bott R.C. McFee R.M. Clopton D.T. Toombs C. Cupp A.S.

We therefore asked the question whether inhibition of KDR activity would impair the expression of testis- and ovary-promoting genes in XY and XX gonads. For this purpose, we analyzed the expression of Sox9, Sf1 (Nr5a1), Amh, Foxl2, Dax1, and Gata4 in 12.5-dpc XX and XY gonad cultures (Fig. 4A). Endogenous mRNA levels of Sox9, Sf1, and Amh were significantly higher in XY than in XX gonads, whereas XX gonads contained higher amounts of Foxl2 and Dax1 transcripts than XY gonads. Gata4 transcript levels were not significantly different in embryonic testes and ovaries (Fig. 4A). To explore the importance of KDR for the expression of these genes in XY and XX gonads, we incubated the explants for 48 h with the KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU1498, which has previously been found to inhibit testis cord formation in rats (15Bott R.C. McFee R.M. Clopton D.T. Toombs C. Cupp A.S. Vascular endothelial growth factor and kinase domain region receptor are involved in both seminiferous cord formation and vascular development during testis morphogenesis in the rat.Biol. Reprod. 2006; 75: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SU1498 did not significantly change mRNA levels of Foxl2 and Dax1 in XY and XX gonads. However, SU1498 increased Sf1 and Gata4 transcripts in XX gonads and Sox9 expression in both embryonic testes and ovaries (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that KDR signaling suppresses the testis-promoting genes Sox9 and Sf1 in XX gonads. Kdr expression in embryonic gonads is stimulated by WT1 (Figs. 1–3). One can therefore predict that WT1 knockdown will reduce SU1498 activity due to down-regulation of its target, KDR. To test this, cultured gonads were treated with the KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU1498 in the presence of the Wt1 vivo-morpholino. Consistently, Wt1 silencing abrogated the effect of SU1498 on Sox9, Sf1, and Gata4 mRNA levels in cultured testes and ovaries (Fig. 4B). Next, we explored how WT1 and KDR influence gonadal Sox9 expression. Maintenance of the tubular architecture in embryonic XY gonads requires activation of the testis-determining gene Sox9 by WT1 in Sertoli cells (14Gao F. Maiti S. Alam N. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Lécureuil C. Guillou F. Huff V. The Wilms tumor gene, Wt1, is required for Sox9 expression and maintenance of tubular architecture in the developing testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11987-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Sox9 mRNA levels dropped in XY gonads (12.5 dpc) treated with the Wt1 vivo-morpholino (Fig. 5A). By contrast, WT1 knockdown increased Sox9 transcript levels in XX gonads ∼2-fold (p < 0.005), and inhibition of KDR signaling with SU1498 prevented this effect (Fig. 5, A and B). SU1498 also enhanced the inhibitory influence of WT1 silencing on Sox9 expression in developing XY gonads (Fig. 5, A and B). These findings indicate that WT1 regulates Sox9 in embryonic gonads in a sexually dimorphic manner; whereas it directly stimulates transcription of the testis-promoting gene Sox9 in Sertoli cel"

Δp, NADH and proton leak decreased with work intensity. The contribution of proton leak to oxygen consumption () decreased from about 60% at rest to about 3 and 1% at moderate and heavy/severe exercise, respectively, while the ATP/O2 ratio increased from 2.1 to 5.5 and 5.7. A two-fold increase in proton leak activity or its decrease to zero decreased/increased the ATP/O2 ratio by only about 3 and 1% during moderate and heavy/severe exercise, respectively. The low contribution of proton leak to in intensively working skeletal muscle was mostly caused by a huge increase in ATP usage intensity during rest-to-work transition, while OXPHOS, and thus oxidative ATP supply and related to it, was mostly stimulated by high each-step activation (ESA) of OXPHOS complexes. The contribution of proton leak to and ATP/O2 ratio in isolated mitochondria should not be directly extrapolated to working muscle, as mitochondria lack ESA, at least in the absence of Ca2+, and therefore cannot be elevated as much as in intact muscle."

Eight dialysis-related measures determine ratings. Little is known about the association between surrounding community sociodemographic characteristics and star ratings. Using data from the U.S. Census and over 6000 dialysis clinics across the country, we examined the association between dialysis clinic star ratings and characteristics of the local population: 1) proportion of population below the federal poverty level (FPL); 2) proportion of black individuals; and 3) proportion of Hispanic individuals, by correlation and regression analyses. Secondary analyses with Quality Incentive Program (QIP) scores and population characteristics were also performed. We observed a negligible correlation between star ratings and the proportion of local individuals below FPL; Spearman coefficient, R = -0.09 (p<0.0001), and a stronger correlation between star ratings and the proportion of black individuals; R = -0.21 (p<0.0001). Ordered logistic regression analyses yielded adjusted odds ratio of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [0.80-1.30], p = 0.12) and 0.55 ([0.48-0.63], p<0.0001) for high vs. low level of proportion below FPL and proportion of black individuals, respectively. In contrast, a near-zero correlation was observed between star ratings and the proportion of Hispanic individuals. Correlations varied substantially by country region, clinic profit status and clinic size. Analyses using clinic QIP scores provided similar results. Sociodemographic characteristics of the surrounding community, factors typically outside of providers' direct control, have varying levels of association with clinic dialysis star ratings."

Mid1 was found to have a 20-amino-acid-long N-terminal signal peptide and appeared to be entirely localized extracellularly. A signal peptide–deleted Mid1 protein, Mid1ΔN23, was N-glycosylated and retained Ca2+ influx activity through Cch1. Moreover, an N-terminal truncation analysis revealed that even truncated Mid1 lacking 209 N-terminal amino acid residues was N-glycosylated and maintained Ca2+ influx activity.

In the sec71Δ and sec72Δ single mutants defective in the post-translational protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Mid1ΔN23 could not mediate Ca2+ influx and did not undergo N-glycosylation, whereas wild-type Mid1 exhibited normal Ca2+ influx activity and N-glycosylation in these mutants.

Among Ca2+-permeable ion channels, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) 3The abbreviations used are: VGCCvoltage-gated Ca2+ channelGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolERendoplasmic reticulumNALCNNa+ leak channel non-selectiveSRPsignal recognition particleEndo Hendoglycosidase H. have been the most intensively studied from basic to clinical viewpoints because they play crucial roles in synaptic transmission in neurons and contraction in skeletal muscle cells by mediating Ca2+ influx in response to changes in membrane potential in animal cells (1Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated calcium channels.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a003947Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). VGCCs are composed of four subunits: the pore-forming α1 subunit and three auxiliary subunits, α2/δ, β, and γ. The α2/δ subunit is composed of four subtypes, each of which is the product of a single gene encoding an ∼140-kDa protein with a C-terminal potential transmembrane segment or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attachment site and a number of N-glycosylation sites (2Dolphin A.C. The α2/δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The single polypeptide is post-translationally cleaved into α2 and δ fragments, after which both are bound by disulfide bonding. In the mature form of the α2/δ protein, α2 is exposed entirely to the extracellular space; δ is anchored to the plasma membrane; and both are N-glycosylated, giving this protein a total molecular mass of ∼180 kDa. Although necessary for the modulation of VGCC properties, the α2/δ subunit does not affect single channel conductance, suggesting that it is not required for Ca2+ permeation of the α1 subunit (3Wakamori M.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a VGCC-related Ca2+ channel composed of essential Cch1 and Mid1 subunits. Cch1 was identified by scanning the yeast sequence database and is 24% identical to the α1 subunit of mammalian L-type VGCCs in overall amino acid sequences and is, thus, called an α1 homolog (6Paidhungat M.

In addition, many of the fungal Mid1 orthologs have a GPI anchor attachment motif at the C-terminal region, similar to animal α2/δ proteins. Therefore, Mid1 may be called an α2/δ-like protein. In contrast to the α1 subunit of animal VGCCs, Cch1 is completely dependent on Mid1 to mediate Ca2+ influx (6Paidhungat M. Garrett S.

Although homologous to the α1 subunits of animal VGCCs, Cch1 is more homologous to a recently identified subfamily of animal VGCC α1 subunits, the Na+ leak channel non-selective (NALCN), as revealed by a phylogenetic analysis (13Liebeskind B.J.

In support of the close similarities between Cch1 and NALCN, their auxiliary subunits exhibit similar functional essentialities; as described above, Mid1 is essential for the function of Cch1. Likewise, the auxiliary subunits UNC80, UNC79, NLF-1, and CG33988 of animal NALCN are required for the function of NALCN; however, their localization and overall structure are divergent (16Lu B.

The cysteine-rich domains of Mid1, NLF-1, CG33988, and FAM155A and -B are highly conserved and, thus, designated as the Mid1 domain, leading to the hypothesis that the relationship between the Mid1 domain and NALCN has persisted over one billion years of evolution (18Ghezzi A.

In this context, it has become more important to characterize the basic molecular nature of Mid1 as a model of essential subunits of the NALCN family. There are two major protein translocation mechanisms that transfer secretory and plasma membrane proteins across the ER membrane (19Zimmermann R. Eyrisch S. Ahmad M. Helms V. Protein translocation across the ER membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 912-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Delic M. Valli M. Graf A.B. Pfeffer M. Mattanovich D. Gasser B. The secretory pathway: exploring yeast diversity.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2013; 37: 872-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One is co-translational translocation, which is enabled by a direct link between translation and translocation. Before the synthesis of these proteins is finished, their signal peptides are recognized and bound by the signal recognition particle (SRP) in the cytoplasm. The SRP mediates the binding of the complex to the SRP receptor at the ER membrane. The signal peptide is then inserted into the translocation channel or translocon composed of the Sec61 protein and others. S. cerevisiae cells with the sec61Δ mutation are inviable (21Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. A yeast mutant defective at an early stage in import of secretory protein precursors into the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The other mechanism is post-translational translocation. Whereas this mechanism also requires the translocon and the signal peptides of the proteins, it needs the Sec62/Sec63 complex, composed of Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 (also termed Sec66), and Sec72 (also termed Sec67) in place of SRP. Sec71 and Sec72 are fungi-specific subunits. In S. cerevisiae, the sec62Δ and sec63Δ single mutants are inviable (22Rothblatt J.A. Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Daum G. Schekman R. Multiple genes are required for proper insertion of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2641-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas the sec71Δ and sec72Δ single mutants are viable (23Green N. Fang H. Walter P. Mutations in three novel complementation groups inhibit membrane protein insertion into and soluble protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The viability of the latter two mutants provides a useful tool for testing the dependence of protein translocation on the post-translational mechanism. In the present study, we show that 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of Mid1 are a signal peptide. Although this signal peptide functions properly, the signal peptide–deleted forms of Mid1 are also N-glycosylated and become functional for mediating Ca2+ influx. One of these forms, Mid1ΔN23, is suggested to be delivered into the ER by the post-translational translocation mechanism in a Sec71- and Sec72-dependent fashion, whereas the complete Mid1 is delivered by the co-translational translocation mechanism. We suggest that Mid1 is delivered into the ER by at least two protein translocation mechanisms, and this is dependent on its molecular form. We also demonstrate that most of the 16 potential N-glycosylation sites of Mid1 are N-glycosylated and that the N and C termini are exposed to the extracellular space, suggesting that the entire sequence of Mid1 is present outside the cell.

Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (7094) Google Scholar), predicted that the Mid1 protein has a signal peptide with 20 amino acid residues at the N terminus. To confirm this prediction experimentally, we attempted to elucidate the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature Mid1 protein. We purified FLAG-tagged Mid1 from yeast cells using differential centrifugation and immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 2). The purified protein was subjected to sequencing by Edman degradation, and the first five N-terminal amino acids were identified as LFQDF, which was identical to the Leu21-Phe22-Gln23-Asp24-Phe25 sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the MID1 gene. Therefore, we concluded that the Mid1 protein has a signal peptide composed of 20 N-terminal amino acid residues (Fig. 2). To establish whether the N-terminal signal peptide is important for Mid1 to become active through proper processing and modifications, we constructed a truncated form of this protein lacking 23 N-terminal amino acid residues (ΔN23), expressed it from the MID1 promoter in the mid1 mutant, and assayed its ability to rescue the mid1 phenotypes, such as weak Ca2+ uptake activity and the loss of viability in the presence of the mating pheromone α-factor. Fig. 3 (A and B) shows that the ΔN23 protein rescued both phenotypes; however, this rescuing activity was slightly weaker than that of the wild-type Mid1 protein. These results indicate that the signal peptide is not essential for Mid1 to acquire activity but is required for full activity. These results also suggest that the ΔN23 protein is targeted properly to the plasma membrane to cooperate with Cch1. The above results with the ΔN23 protein prompted us to investigate how much of the N-terminal region may be truncated while maintaining the activity of Mid1. We constructed a series of N-terminally truncated forms of Mid1, such as ΔN32, ΔN51, ΔN68, ΔN112, ΔN209, and ΔN219, the numbers of which represent the deleted number of amino acid residues from the N terminus. We then expressed them from the MID1 promoter or a transcriptionally strong TDH3 promoter (28Nacken V. Achstetter T. Degryse E. Probing the limits of expression levels by varying promoter strength and plasmid copy number in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Gene. 1996; 175: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in the mid1 mutant and measured their activities, similar to ΔN23. As shown in Fig. 3, all of the truncated Mid1 proteins except for ΔN219 retained Ca2+ influx activities and viability maintenance; however, their activities were one-half to one-third wild-type levels when these constructs were expressed from the promoter of MID1 (see white bars). The ΔN209 protein retained weak Ca2+ accumulation activity and viability (mid1 versus ΔN209 in white bars, p < 0.03). However, when these constructs were expressed from the TDH3 promoter, even the ΔN209 protein exhibited activity that was more than one-half that of wild-type levels, whereas the ΔN219 protein did not (see dark gray bars). These results indicate that 209 N-terminal amino acid residues are non-essential for the function of Mid1. We also found that HA-tagged deletion mutant proteins (ΔN32-HA and ΔN51-HA), which were expressed from the MID1 promoter, had slightly stronger activities than the untagged counterparts (Fig. 3), suggesting that the HA tag does not impair the activity of the truncated forms of Mid1. Intact Mid1 is an N-glycosylated protein (7Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. MID1, a novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a plasma membrane protein, is required for Ca2+ influx and mating.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, functionally active, N-terminally truncated forms of Mid1, such as ΔN23, ΔN32, ΔN51, ΔN68, ΔN112, and ΔN209, were expected to be N-glycosylated. To examine this hypothesis, we performed a Western blot analysis of the wild-type and ΔN112 proteins before and after the endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion of whole-cell extracts. Fig. 4A shows that the higher-molecular weight population of the two proteins was Endo H-sensitive and, thus, was N-glycosylated. Similar to ΔN112, all of the other truncated proteins were N-glycosylated; however, the amounts of the proteins were reduced to approximately one-half to one-third those of wild-type Mid1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, even the non-active form of Mid1, ΔN219, was N-glycosylated. These results indicate that the truncation of at least 219 amino acid residues from the N terminus did not affect N-glycosylation and also imply that yeast cells possess a mechanism by which proteins that have lost the N-terminal signal peptide may still be incorporated into the lumen of the ER and then N-glycosylated. Because the above results suggest that the region spanning from Pro210 to Met219 is essential for the function of Mid1 (Fig. 3, A and B), we deleted this region and examined the activity of the deletion mutant (designated Δ210–219). The Δ210–219 protein completely lost its activity (see the first and second bars from the right ends in Fig. 3, A and B). We then compared the amino acid sequence of this region of the S. cerevisiae Mid1 protein with those of 96 orthologs and found that Asp216 and Asp218 were highly conserved during evolution (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we performed an amino acid replacement analysis for the two acidic residues. Asp216 and Asp218 were replaced by the small, non-polar amino acid, Ala, or the polar, uncharged amino acid, Asn, the side-chain volume of which was similar to that of Asp, resulting in the D216A, D216N, D218A, and D218N mutant proteins. Fig. 5 (B and C) shows that D216A and D216N exhibited Ca2+ influx activities and viability maintenance similar to those of the wild-type Mid1, suggesting that the acidity and side-chain volume of Asp216 are not important for the activity of Mid1. On the other hand, D218N lost both activities, whereas D218A did not. Furthermore, D218Q, but not D218E, lost both activities. In terms of the physicochemical properties of amino acids, the hydrophilicities of Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln are known to be similar (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17166) Google Scholar), whereas Ala possesses a small side chain. Therefore, we speculated that an amino acid residue at the position of Asp218 may be acidic or small. Both factors may be important for Mid1. We also found that the D216A/D218A double mutant lost both activities (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that at least one Asp residue is essential for the function of Mid1 in this region. To elucidate how the N-terminal signal peptide–deleted forms of Mid1 are delivered into the ER, we focused on yeast mutants lacking Sec proteins, which are present in the ER membrane. Secretory and plasma membrane proteins are translocated into the ER through two major protein translocation mechanisms. One is co-translational and the other post-translational (19Zimmermann R. Eyrisch S. Ahmad M. Helms V. Protein translocation across the ER membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 912-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Delic M. Valli M. Graf A.B. Pfeffer M. Mattanovich D. Gasser B. The secretory pathway: exploring yeast diversity.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2013; 37: 872-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These co-translational and post-translational protein translocation mechanisms both utilize the common translocation channel composed of the Sec61 protein. However, the former depends on the SRP for the targeting of the ribosome-nascent polypeptide complex to the Sec61 complex, whereas the latter depends on the Sec62/63/71/72 complex for the targeting of fully translated proteins to the Sec61 complex in S. cerevisiae. In the present study, we employed the sec71Δ and sec72Δ mutations to investigate the mechanisms by which the N-terminal signal peptide–deleted forms of Mid1 were delivered into the ER and became functional. We also employed the Mid1ΔN23 protein as a model of the N-terminal signal peptide–deleted forms of Mid1. We did not employ the sec61Δ, sec62Δ, or sec63Δ mutation because these are lethal mutations (21Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.

Multiple genes are required for proper insertion of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum in yeast.J.

Eyrisch S. Ahmad M. Helms V. Protein translocation across the ER membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 912-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Delic M. Valli M. Graf A.B.

Schekman R. Bip and Sec63p are required for both co- and posttranslational protein ttranslocation into the yeast endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mid1ΔN23 and a control protein, wild-type Mid1, were expressed individually from the MID1 promoter in either mid1Δ, mid1Δ sec71Δ, or mid1Δ sec72Δ mutants, and the Ca2+ accumulation activity and viability of each mutant expressing one of the two proteins were examined after cells were exposed to α-factor. Fig. 6A shows that in the mid1Δ mutant, Mid1ΔN23 exhibited approximately half the activity of wild-type Mid1, suggesting that yeast cells possess a mechanism that properly translocates N-terminal signal peptide–deleted proteins. This was also implied from the results shown in Fig. 3A (see the bar of MID1 and ΔN23). In the sec71Δ background, Mid1ΔN23-expressing cells lost Ca2+ accumulation activity to an almost negative control level (compare mid1Δ sec71Δ/MID1ΔN23 with mid1Δ/vector), whereas wild-type Mid1-expressing cells did not lose this activity (Fig. 6A), indicating that Mid1ΔN23 depends almost completely on Sec71 to become functional. In the sec72Δ background, Mid1ΔN23-expressing cells lost Ca2+ accumulation activity completely (Fig. 6A). In addition, the activity of wild-type Mid1-expressing cells was decreased to approximately two-thirds that of wild-type Mid1-expressing cells in the mid1Δ mutant (compare mid1Δ sec72Δ/MID1 with mid1Δ/MID1). These results suggest that Mid1ΔN23 is completely dependent on Sec72 to become functional. The results obtained with the sec71Δ and sec72Δ mutations suggest that Mid1ΔN23 is translocated into the ER post-translationally. The difference in the activity of wild-type Mid1 between the sec71Δ and sec72Δ backgrounds was not unexpected because individual proteins with the N-terminal signal peptide are known to be differentially sensitive to the mutations. For example, the Sec63-invertase fusion protein (an ER membrane protein) was translocated more efficiently into the ER in the sec72Δ mutant than in the sec71Δ mutant, whereas pro-α-factor (a secretory protein) was translocated more efficiently into the ER in the sec71Δ mutant than in the sec72Δ mutant (23Green N. Fang H. Walter P. Mutations in three novel complementation groups inhibit membrane protein insertion into and soluble protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Viability assays led to essentially the same conclusion (Fig. 6B). In the mid1Δ mutant, cells expressing Mid1ΔN23 slightly lost viability 8 h after exposure to α-factor. In the sec71Δ and sec72Δ backgrounds, cells expressing Mid1ΔN23 lost viability completely, whereas those expressing wild-type Mid1 did not. To clarify whether the absence of Ca2+ accumulation activity and lack of viability of Mid1ΔN23-expressing cells in the sec71Δ and sec72Δ backgrounds is due to a failure in the translocation of the Mid1ΔN23 protein across the ER membrane, we performed a Western blot analysis of the wild-type Mid1 and Mid1ΔN23 proteins tagged with the epitope FLAG between the N-terminal 51st"

The transfer of a glycan from a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) donor to the asparagine residue of a nascent polypeptide chain is catalyzed by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Trypanosoma brucei encodes three paralogue single-protein OSTs called TbSTT3A, TbSTT3B, and TbSTT3C that can functionally complement the Saccharomyces cerevisiae OST, making it an ideal experimental system to study the fundamental properties of OST activity. We characterized the LLO and polypeptide specificity of all three TbOST isoforms and their chimeric forms in the heterologous expression host S. cerevisiae where we were able to apply yeast genetic tools and newly developed glycoproteomics methods. We demonstrated that TbSTT3A accepted LLO substrates ranging from Man5GlcNAc2 to Man7GlcNAc2. In contrast, TbSTT3B required more complex precursors ranging from Man6GlcNAc2 to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structures, and TbSTT3C did not display any LLO preference. Sequence differences between the isoforms cluster in three distinct regions. We have swapped the individual regions between different OST proteins and identified region 2 to influence the specificity toward the LLO and region 1 to influence polypeptide substrate specificity. These results provide a basis to further investigate the molecular mechanisms and contribution of single amino acids in OST interaction with its substrates.

Asparagine-linked protein glycosylation (N-glycosylation) is a highly conserved post-translational modification in eukaryotes. N-Glycosylation is an essential process and plays important roles in protein folding quality control, cell–cell interactions, and developmental processes (1Lowe J.B. Marth J.D. A genetic approach to mammalian glycan function.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 643-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Helenius A. Aebi M.

The biosynthesis of the LLO is an ordered, stepwise process conducted by the concerted action of specific glycosyltransferases that are encoded by the asparagine-linked glycosylation (ALG) genes. LLO biosynthesis is initiated by the addition of N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphate (GlcNAc-P) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the lipid carrier on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane using nucleotide-activated UDP-GlcNAc as donor to form Dol-PP-GlcNAc2. Subsequently, the LLO is elongated by five mannose (Man) residues. The Man5GlcNAc2 LLO is then translocated into the ER lumen. There, Dol-P-bound Man serves as donor for the further elongation of the LLO with Man until a Man9GlcNAc2 structure is built up. In most of the fungi and animal species, the addition of three glucose (Glc) residues from Dol-P-Glc terminates LLO biosynthesis (3Burda P. Aebi M.

The mature Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 LLO is used as donor substrate by the OST that transfers the oligosaccharide from the lipid carrier en bloc to an asparagine residue of a nascent polypeptide chain. In eukaryotes, the acceptor asparagine residue is located within a conserved sequon consisting of three amino acids: asparagine, a second amino acid (any, but proline), and threonine or serine (NX(T/S)) (4Gavel Y. von Heijne G.

All other subunits found in hetero-oligomeric OST complexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or mammals are missing in Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major, suggesting that these proteins function as single subunit OSTs similar to enzymes known from bacterial and archaeal N-glycosylation systems (14Wacker M.

T. brucei is a protozoan parasite causing African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. T. brucei cells encounter two hosts during their life cycle. The parasite exists as the procyclic form in an insect vector (the tsetse fly), and it is referred to as bloodstream form when afflicting the mammalian host. The surface of T. brucei cells is covered by glycoproteins termed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) in the bloodstream form and procyclins in its procyclic life stage. N-Glycosylation epitopes on VSG play an important role in T. brucei virulence (20Castillo-Acosta V.M. Ruiz-Pérez L.M. Etxebarria J. Reichardt N.C. Navarro M. Igarashi Y. Liekens S. Balzarini J.

The three paralogue STT3s encoded by the T. brucei genome display distinct preferences for the LLO donor as well as for the acceptor polypeptide substrate. Whereas TbSTT3A was shown to preferentially transfer Man5GlcNAc2 glycans to acceptor polypeptide chains, both TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C glycosylated acceptor sites with Man9GlcNAc2 glycans (19Izquierdo L.

Analysis of the OST protein products revealed that TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C preferentially glycosylate sequons with acidic amino acids in the sequon's vicinity. By contrast, TbSTT3B did not display a particular preference for glycosylation sequons and the amino acids surrounding them (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the functional expression of T. brucei STT3 proteins in yeast to analyze their function in detail. We took advantage of the “genetic tailoring” (26Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Genetic tailoring of N-linked oligosaccharides: the role of glucose residues in glycoprotein processing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vivo.Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) of the OST substrate and the quantitative analysis of glycosylation site occupancy (27Poljak K. Selevsek N. Ngwa E.M. Grossmann J. Losfeld M.E. Aebi M. Quantitative profiling of N-linked glycosylation machinery in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2017; (RA117.000096)PubMed Google Scholar) to characterize T. brucei OST function. Domain-swap experiments made it possible to assign functional properties to specific regions of the STT3 proteins. In vivo analysis of the TbSTT3 LLO specificity revealed that TbSTT3B transfers primarily Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides, whereas TbSTT3A transfers Man5GlcNAc2 glycans to its preferred glycosylation site of VSG221. Data acquired in the Δstt3 S. cerevisiae strain suggested that TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C both accept Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 as LLO substrate, whereas TbSTT3A cannot utilize the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 LLO substrate (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore further investigated the LLO specificity of all three TbSTT3 paralogues using the heterologous yeast expression system. We combined the STT3 deletion with different deletions in the LLO biosynthesis pathway (ALG genes) in yeast. The Δstt3Δalg strains harboring the yeast STT3 (ScSTT3) URA3 plasmid and a second LEU2-marked plasmid, encoding either ScSTT3 or the different TbSTT3 paralogues, were subjected to plasmid shuffling using 5-FOA. In this approach, survival of the cells on 5-FOA depended on the ability of the different TbSTT3 genes, encoded on the LEU2 plasmids, to complement the yeast STT3 deletion. In the Δstt3Δalg3 double mutant strain (accumulation of the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide), only TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C complemented the STT3 deletion (Fig. 1A). This result is in accordance with the finding that TbSTT3A can utilize the Man5GlcNAc2 LLO substrates in T. brucei (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in both the Δstt3Δalg9 and the Δstt3Δalg12 strains, all three TbSTT3 paralogues complemented the deletion of endogenous OST activity (Fig. 1, B and C). In the Δstt3 strain, only TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C complement the STT3 deletion, whereas TbSTT3A-expressing cells did not survive plasmid shuffling (Fig. 1E) (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The inability of TbSTT3A to complement Δstt3 in the presence of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 LLOs was independent of the three terminal glucose residues on the LLO substrate because growth of Δstt3Δalg6 cells expressing TbSTT3A was also not rescued (Fig. 1D). Our data confirm that the complementary activity of the different T. brucei STT3 proteins depended on the oligosaccharide structures of the substrate LLO. TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C protein sequences are ∼95% identical, and sequence differences cluster, in contrast to the TbSTT3A, in three distinct regions located in lumenal part of the proteins (Fig. 2). These two OSTs differ significantly with respect to their LLO substrate specificity: TbSTT3B does not accept Man5GlcNAc2 LLOs, in contrast to TbSTT3C. We therefore reasoned that one or a combination of these regions would account for different LLO specificities of TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C and that chimeric TbSTT3B/C proteins will be fold properly. The differences in LLO specificity led to the inability of TbSTT3B to rescue the growth of the Δstt3Δalg3 strain, whereas TbSTT3C was able to complement the STT3 deletion of this strain. TbSTT3B-C chimeras were constructed by exchanging single regions of TbSTT3B by corresponding regions of TbSTT3C (TbSTT3B-1C, TbSTT3B-2C, and TbSTT3B-3C) or by combinations of two regions (TbSTT3B-1/2C, TbSTT3B-2/3C, and TbSTT3B-1/3C). To test the effect of the region exchange on LLO specificity, Δstt3Δalg3 cells harboring the chimeric TbSTT3B-C constructs were subjected to 5-FOA-induced plasmid shuffling, and growth of the cells was assessed (Fig. 3A). The exchange of region 1 in TbSTT3B did not rescue the cell growth in the Δstt3Δalg3 (Man5GlcNAc2), and the growth in the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 accumulating strain was reduced as well. In contrast, the exchange of region 2 (TbSTT3B-2C) allowed cell growth in both backgrounds comparable with TbSTT3C. Also, the exchange of region 3 (TbSTT3B-3C) supported growth of Δstt3Δalg3 cells albeit at a somewhat reduced level. These observations were further substantiated by the TbSTT3B-C chimeras with two regions exchanged. Both chimeras containing region 2 (TbSTT3B-1/2C and TbSTT3B-2/3C) promoted growth similar to TbSTT3C, whereas the chimera with regions 1 and 3 (TbSTT3B-1/3C) resulted in a severe growth phenotype in Δstt3Δalg3 cells, but not in cells with normal LLO biosynthesis (Fig. 3, A and B). We concluded that both regions 2 and 3 were required for optimal utilization of Man5GlcNAc2 LLO. However, region 2 seems to be more important in determining LLO substrate specificity of TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C describing an oligosaccharide recognition domain of this single subunit OST. Having established that region two is responsible for providing specificity toward the LLO donor substrate, we also sought to identify the region(s) of the TbSTT3 paralogues that provide(s) specificity toward polypeptide substrates. In the first step, differences in the glycosylation efficiencies of the three TbSTT3 paralogues for different glycosylation sites of yeast proteins were addressed. It was previously reported that TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C modified more efficiently the glycosylation sites that are located in a sequence context with acidic amino acids, whereas TbSTT3B did not display a particular preference for specific amino acids in the local environment of the glycosylation site (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry (MS)-based method (Fig. 4A) was used to determine the occupancy of glycosylation sites from different yeast membrane proteins, which represents the percentage of peptides modified with a glycan at a given glycosylation site compared with same peptide in wild-type cells. To monitor all three T. brucei OST proteins, we used the Δstt3Δalg9 yeast strain to compare the glycosylation efficiencies of TbSTT3A, TbSTT3B, and TbSTT3C. This strain generates an LLO substrate compatible with all T. brucei OSTs, and the N-linked glycan is susceptible to EndoH digestion. The stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled to the PRM MS-based technique (27Poljak K. Selevsek N. Ngwa E.M. Grossmann J. Losfeld M.E. Aebi M. Quantitative profiling of N-linked glycosylation machinery in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2017; (RA117.000096)PubMed Google Scholar) was used to analyze glycosylation occupancy at glycosylation sites on proteins in yeast microsomal membrane preparations. In short, a reference wild-type strain was grown in medium containing heavy isotope-labeled arginine and lysine, whereas the strains expressing TbSTT3s were grown in the corresponding medium using regular amino acids (light). Cells were mixed 1:1 and disrupted, and samples were enriched for the glycoprotein-rich membrane fraction. N-Linked glycans were cleaved by EndoH to maintain the first GlcNAc residue of the glycan on the protein. Proteins were digested enzymatically, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-MS/MS. Corresponding light and heavy peptides were paired, and site occupancies relative to the reference strain were calculated for TbSTT3-expressing cells based on light/heavy (L/H) ratios of the peak area values (supplemental Table 1). Site occupancy reflected the preference of the OST for a given glycosylation site and its local environment. Glycosylation sites that are favored by a given OST will be glycosylated more efficiently (i.e. higher site occupancy) as compared with sites not located in a favored peptide sequence context. Cluster analysis of the site occupancy data acquired for the TbSTT3 paralogues indicated that TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C glycosylation efficiency of the 55 analyzed sites were similar and the efficiency of glycosylation by TbSTT3B was distinct from TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C (Fig. 4B). This result confirmed previously reported differences in the glycosylation efficiency observed for the TbSTT3B and TbSTT3C (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We then examined the polypeptide substrate specificity of TbSTT3 paralogues in the context of sequence polarity. Sequence composition analysis was performed on glycosylation sequons themselves plus 10 residues downstream and upstream of the glycosylation sites. Amino acid residues were grouped based on their polarity into acidic (Asp and Glu), basic (Arg, Lys, and His), polar (Ser, Thr, Asn, Glu, Cys, and Tyr), and hydrophobic (Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Pro, and Gly) groups. Sequences were divided into “efficiently” and “poorly” glycosylated when the glycosylation occupancy calculated was more than 85% or less than the 25% compared with reference strains, respectively. The ratio of each amino acid group was calculated compared with total number. Percentage change in respective ratios of each amino acid group between efficiently and poorly glycosylated sequences downstream and upstream of the glycosylation sequon was calculated for each TbSTT3-expressing strain. The analysis of sequences downstream of the glycosylation sites showed no apparent difference in sequence specificity between different TbSTT3 paralogues (supplemental Table 2). All three enzymes showed preference for hydrophobic residues, whereas polar residues were not favored. The analysis of upstream sequences revealed that both TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C preferred acidic residues (Fig. 4C). Additionally, both paralogues showed disfavor toward basic residues. However, TbSTT3B showed no specific preference for any amino acid type. These results support a previously reported difference in the polypeptide acceptor substrate specificity, where TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C showed selectivity toward glycosylation sequons flanked by acidic residues, whereas TbSTT3B lacked any obvious preference (19Izquierdo L. Schulz B.L. Rodrigues J.A. Güther M.L. Procter J.B. Barton G.J. Aebi M. Ferguson M.A. Distinct donor and acceptor specificities of Trypanosoma brucei oligosaccharyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been confirmed that upstream amino acids play a dominant role in TbSTT3A acceptor peptide specificity (35Jinnelov A. Ali L. Tinti M. Güther M.L.S. Ferguson M.A.J. Single-subunit oligosaccharyltransferases of Trypanosoma brucei display different and predictable peptide acceptor specificities.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 20328-20341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Site occupancy data acquired for the TbSTT3 paralogues was further exploited to examine whether there is a particular preference for specific amino acids in the local environment of the glycosylation sites. To establish whether there are consensus sequences or patterns that control site-specific N-glycosylation, a two-sample logo analysis (30Vacic V. Iakoucheva L.M. Radivojac P. Two sample logo: a graphical representation of the differences between two sets of sequence alignments.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1536-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) was used to calculate and visualize statistically significant residues surrounding glycosylation sites (Fig. 4D). In agreement with sequence composition analysis, both TbSTT3A and TbSTT3C showed efficient glycosylation of sites containing aspartic acid. Sequences enriched in aspartic acid at the −2 position are more likely to be efficiently glycosylated by TbSTT3A, whereas TbSTT3C preferred sequences enriched in aspartic acid at the −9 position. Although the effect of distal residues on the glycosylation occupancy (e.g. aspartic acid at −9 position) needs to be confirmed by mutagenesis studies, the preference for an acidic residue at the −2 position has been demonstrated in vitro (31Ramírez A.S. Boilevin J. Biswas R. Gan B.H. Janser D. Aebi M. Darbre T. Reymond J.-L. Locher K.P.

Similar to previous data, TbSTT3B showed no specific preference. Preference for TbSTT3A for amino acids immediately adjacent to the glycosylation site is su"

https://openalex.org/W2766480562,"Mating-induced sexual inhibition has been studied extensively as an important facet of many insect mating systems but remains little understood in spiders. Once mated, females of many spider species become unreceptive and aggressive toward males, but the speed of onset and persistence of this effect are not known. Addressing this gap, the present study considers (1) mating tendency of virgins, latency to remating, and lifetime mating frequency and (2) how quickly sexual inhibition is expressed after the first mating in female Servaea incana jumping spiders. Encounters between males and females took place in two contexts that simulated locations where mating occurs in nature: in the light away from nests ('in the open') and in low light within the shelter of silken retreats ('at a retreat'). Virgin females exhibited high receptivity levels in both contexts but sexual inhibition was induced immediately after their first copulation. The most common tendency was for just one mating in a lifetime, and few females mated more than twice. Context also had an effect on female mating tendency, as virgin females in the open rejected more males before accepting their first mate than did virgin females in retreats. Considering only those females that did remate, females in the open tended to reject fewer males before remating. Given low levels of female remating, virgin females appear to be at a premium for male reproductive fitness in S. incana jumping spiders and this is a likely explanation for protandry found in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2766552418,"In Italy, at present, a well-known problem is inhomogeneous provision of rehabilitative services, as stressed by MoH, requiring appropriate criteria and parameters to plan rehabilitation actions. According to the Italian National Rehabilitation Plan, Comorbidity, Disability and Clinical Complexity should be assessed to define the patient's real needs. However, to date, clinical complexity is still difficult to measure with shared and validated tools. The study aims to psychometrically validate the Italian Rehabilitation Complexity Scale-Extended v13 (RCS-E v13), in order to meet the guidelines requirements. An observational multicentre prospective cohort study, involving 8 intensive rehabilitation facilities of the Emilia-Romagna Region and 1712 in-patients, [823 male (48%) and 889 female (52%), mean age 68.34 years (95% CI 67.69-69.00 years)] showing neurological, orthopaedic and cardiological problems, was carried out. The construct and concurrent validity of the RCS-E v13 was confirmed through its correlation to Barthel Index (disability) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (comorbidity) and appropriate admission criteria (not yet published), respectively. Furthermore, the factor analysis indicated two different components (""Basic Care or Risk-Equipment"" and ""Medical-Nursing Needs and Therapy Disciplines"") of the RCS-E v13. In conclusion, the Italian RCS-E v13 appears to be a useful tool to assess clinical complexity in the Italian rehab scenario case-mix and its psychometric validation may have an important clinical rehabilitation impact allowing the assessment of the rehabilitation needs considering all three dimensions (disability, comorbidity and clinical complexity) as required by the Guidelines and the inhomogeneity could be reduced."
