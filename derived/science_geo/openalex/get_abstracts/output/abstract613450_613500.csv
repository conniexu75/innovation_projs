https://openalex.org/W2810352317,"Adaptations and responses to stress conditions are fundamental processes that all cells must accomplish to maintain or restore cellular homeostasis. Cells have a plethora of response pathways to mitigate the effect of different environmental stressors. The transcriptional regulators transcription factor EB (TFEB) and transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3 (TFE3) play a key role in the control of these stress pathways. Therefore, understanding their regulation under different stress conditions is of great interest. Here, using a range of human and murine cells, we show that TFEB and TFE3 are activated upon induction of acute oxidative stress by sodium arsenite via an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-independent process. We found that the mechanism of arsenite-stimulated TFEB and TFE3 activation instead involves protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation at Ser-211 and Ser-321, respectively. Depletion of either the catalytic (PPP2CA+B) or regulatory (PPP2R2A/B55α) subunits of PP2A, as well as PP2A inactivation with the specific inhibitor okadaic acid, abolished TFEB and TFE3 activation in response to sodium arsenite. Conversely, PP2A activation by ceramide or the sphingosine-like compound FTY720 was sufficient to induce TFE3 nuclear translocation. MS analysis revealed that PP2A dephosphorylates TFEB at several residues, including Ser-109, Ser-114, Ser-122, and Ser-211, thus facilitating TFEB activation. Overall, this work identifies a critical mechanism that activates TFEB and TFE3 without turning off mTORC1 activity. We propose that this mechanism may enable some cell types such as immune or cancer cells that require simultaneous TFEB/TFE3 and mTORC1 signaling to survive and achieve robust cell growth in stressful environments."
https://openalex.org/W2810392725,"Approximately 15.5% of global forest is controlled by ~1 billion local people and the area under community control is increasing. However, there is limited empirical evidence as to whether community control is effective in providing critical global ecosystem services, such as biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. We assess the effectiveness of one example of community-controlled forest, Nepal’s Community Forestry Program (CFP), at providing biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. Using data from 620 randomly selected CFP and non-CFP forest plots, we apply a robust matching method based on covariates to estimate whether CFPs are associated with greater biodiversity conservation or carbon storage. Our results reveal a significant positive effect of CFP on biodiversity, which is robust against the influence of unobserved covariates. Our results also suggest a significant negative effect of the CFP on aboveground tree and sapling carbon (AGC) at the national scale (-15.11 Mg C ha-1). However, the CFP has a mixed effect on carbon across geographic and topographic regions and in forests with different canopy covers. Though there were no significant effects of the CFP on AGC at lower altitudes, in the Terai or hill regions, and under closed canopies, there were positive effects in open canopies (25.84 Mg C ha-1) at lower slopes (25.51 Mg C ha-1) and negative effects at higher altitudes (-22.81 Mg C ha-1) and higher slopes (-17.72 Mg C ha-1). Our sensitivity analysis revealed that the positive effects are robust to unobserved covariates, which is not true for the negative results. In aggregate, our results demonstrate that CFP can be an effective forest management strategy to contribute to global ecosystem services such as biodiversity, and to a lesser extent carbon."

This in vitro study was conducted to compare the biocompatibility and antibacterial activity of four different surfaces: uncoated Ti6Al4V, anodized, and coated with titanium nitride or zirconium nitride. Surface topography was investigated with a high-resolution system for measuring surface finishes. Human gingival fibroblast (HGF) adhesion and proliferation were examined using MTT assay, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging, immunofluorescence analysis and real-time PCR for selected target genes. The hemolysis and AMES tests were performed to assess the chemical compounds' blood compatibility and mutagenic potential, respectively. Antibacterial activity was tested against five bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavity (Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. oralis), and the percentage of dead bacteria was calculated. Roughness measurements confirmed a substantial similarity between the surfaces and their compatibility with clinical applications. MTT assay, SEM analysis and immunofluorescence staining showed adhesion and proliferation of HGFs cultured on all the examined surfaces. PCR confirmed that HGFs produced extracellular matrix components efficiently on all the surfaces. No hemolytic activity was detected, and the AMES test confirmed the surfaces' clinical safety. For all tested bacterial strains, biofilms grown on the zirconium nitride surface showed a higher percentage of dead bacteria than on the other disks. The titanium nitride surface inactivated bacterial biofilms, too, but to a lesser extent."
https://openalex.org/W2811338509,"Background Since the start of out-of-hours (OOH) primary care clinics, the number of patient consultations has been increasing. Triage plays an important role in patient selection for a consultation, and in providing reassurance and self-management advice. Objective We aimed to investigate whether the smartphone application “Should I see a doctor?” (in Dutch:”moet ik naar de dokter?”) could guide patients in appropriate consultation at OOH clinics by focusing on four topics: 1) app usage, 2) user satisfaction, 3) whether the app provides the correct advice, and 4) whether users intend to follow the advice. Design and setting A prospective, cross-sectional study amongst app users in a routine primary care setting. Methods The app is a self-triage tool for acute primary care. A built-in questionnaire asked users about the app’s clarity, their satisfaction and whether they intended to follow the app’s advice (n = 4456). A convenience sample of users was phoned by a triage nurse (reference standard) to evaluate whether the app’s advice corresponded with the outcome of the triage call (n = 126). Suggestions of phoned participants were listed. Results The app was used by patients of all ages, also by parents for their children, and mostly for abdominal pain, skin disorders and cough. 58% of users received the advice to contact the clinic, 34% a self-care advice and 8% to wait-and-see. 65% of users intended to follow the app’s advice. The app was rated as ‘neutral’ to ‘very clear’ by 87%, and 89% were ‘neutral’ to ‘very satisfied’. In 81% of participants the app’s advice corresponded to the triage call outcome, with sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive values of 84%, 74%, 88% and 67%, respectively. Conclusion The app “Should I see a doctor?” could be a valuable tool to guide patients in contacting the OOH primary care clinic for acute care. To further improve the app’s safety and efficiency, triaging multiple symptoms should be facilitated, and more information should be provided to patients receiving a wait-and-see advice."

Both NSD2 overexpression and point mutations that increase its catalytic activity are associated with several human cancers. Although NSD2 is an attractive therapeutic target, no potent, selective, and bioactive small molecule inhibitors of NSD2 have been reported to date, possibly due to the challenges of developing high-throughput assays for NSD2. Here, to establish a platform for the discovery and development of selective NSD2 inhibitors, we optimized and implemented multiple assays. We performed quantitative high-throughput screening with full-length WT NSD2 and a nucleosome substrate against a diverse collection of bioactive small molecules comprising 16,251 compounds. We further interrogated 174 inhibitory compounds identified in the primary screen with orthogonal and counter assays and with activity assays based on the clinically relevant NSD2 variants E1099K and T1150A. We selected five confirmed inhibitors for follow-up, which included a radiolabeled validation assay, surface plasmon resonance studies, methyltransferase profiling, and histone methylation in cells. We found that all five NSD2 inhibitors bind the catalytic SET domain and one exhibited apparent activity in cells, validating the workflow and providing a template for identifying selective NSD2 inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2811389806,"Background Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens are a serious problem of increasing importance facing the medical community. MDR bacteria typically infect the most immunologically vulnerable: patients in intensive care units, patients with extensive comorbidities, oncology patients, hemodialysis patients, and other immune suppressed individuals are likely to fall victim to these pathogens. One promising novel approach to treatment of MDR bacteria is immuno-adjuvant therapy to boost patient immunity. Success with this strategy would have the major benefit of providing protection against a number of MDR pathogens. Objectives This study had two main objectives. First, immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with sepsis associated with MDR bacteria was performed to examine for findings indicative of immunosuppression. Second, the ability of three immuno-adjuvants with distinct mechanisms of action to reverse CD4 and CD8 T cell dysfunction, a pathophysiological hallmark of sepsis, was evaluated. Results Septic patients with MDR bacteria had increased expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 and decreased monocyte HLA-DR expression compared to non-septic patients. All three immuno-adjuvants, IL-7, anti-PD-L1, and OX-40L, increased T cell production of IFN-γ in a subset of septic patients with MDR bacteria: IL-7 was most efficacious. There was a strong trend toward increased mortality in patients whose T cells failed to increase IFN-γ production in response to the three treatments. Conclusion Immuno-adjuvant therapy reversed T cell dysfunction, a key pathophysiological mechanism in septic patients with MDR bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2801288128,"Octopamine regulates feeding behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster, however the molecular and circuit mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of a subset of octopaminergic neurons, the OA-VPM4 cluster, in sucrose acceptance behavior. Thermogenetic activation of Gal4 lines containing OA-VPM4 promoted proboscis extension to sucrose, while optogenetic inactivation reduced extension. Anatomically, the presynaptic terminals of OA-VPM4 are in close proximity to the axons of sugar-responsive gustatory sensory neurons. Moreover, RNAi knockdown of a specific class of octopamine receptor, OAMB, selectively in sugar-sensing gustatory neurons decreased the behavioral response to sucrose. By calcium imaging experiments, we found that application of octopamine potentiates sensory responses to sucrose in satiated flies. Taken together, these findings suggest a model by which OA-VPM4 promotes feeding behavior by modulating the activity of sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2810715578,"The SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a heterotrimeric eukaryotic kinase that interacts with diverse proteins and regulates their activity in response to starvation and stress signals. Recently, the FCS-like zinc finger (FLZ) proteins were identified as a potential scaffold for SnRK1 in plants. However, the evolutionary and mechanistic aspect of this complex formation is currently unknown. Here, in silico analyses predicted that FLZ proteins possess conserved intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with a propensity for protein binding in the N and C termini across the plant lineage. We observed that the Arabidopsis FLZ proteins promiscuously interact with SnRK1 subunits, which formed different isoenzyme complexes. The FLZ domain was essential for mediating the interaction with SnRK1α subunits, whereas the IDRs in the N termini facilitated interactions with the β and βγ subunits of SnRK1. Furthermore, the IDRs in the N termini were important for mediating dimerization of different FLZ proteins. Of note, the interaction of FLZ with SnRK1 was confined to cytoplasmic foci, which colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. An evolutionary analysis revealed that in general, the IDR-rich regions are under more relaxed selection than the FLZ domain. In summary, the findings in our study reveal the structural details, origin, and evolution of a land plant–specific scaffold of SnRK1 formed by the coordinated actions of IDRs and structured regions in the FLZ proteins. We propose that the FLZ protein complex might be involved in providing flexibility, thus enhancing the binding repertoire of the SnRK1 hub in land plants.

https://openalex.org/W2810398110,"West Nile (WN) virus has been detected in Guadeloupe since 2002. Even if no WN human cases have been detected so far, mosquitoes from Culex genus especially Culex quinquefasciatus are recognized as potential WN vectors in Guadeloupe. To evaluate the impact of local vector control activities on this mosquito species we assessed the resistance levels of Cx. quinquefasciatus populations from three different sites from Guadeloupe (Abymes, Saint François and Gourbeyre) to malathion, temephos and deltamethrin. In addition, the frequencies of the L1014F kdr and the G119S ace-1 mutations were established in Cx. quinquefasciatus populations, as well as the constitutive expressions of five cytochrome P450 genes. Mosquito populations tested displayed high resistance to deltamethrin, moderate resistance to malathion (Abymes, Gourbeyre) and low resistance to temephos (Abymes et Gourbeyre). Molecular analyses revealed high frequencies of both L1014F kdr and G119S ace-1 mutations in Cx. quinquefasciatus populations, as well as overexpression of cytochrome P450 genes CYP9J45, CYP9J40 and CYP6AA7. Finally, deltamethrin resistance and knock-down rates were strongly correlated with the frequency of the resistant kdr and ace-1 alleles, as well as with CYP9J40 overexpression. These results should be taken into account to refine the current vector control strategies to prevent the appearance of Cx. quinquefasciatus-borne diseases in Guadeloupe."
https://openalex.org/W2811508782,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infects cells in the Central Nervous System (CNS), where the access of antiretrovirals and antibodies that can kill the virus may be challenging. As a result of the early HIV entry in the brain, infected individuals develop inflammation and neurological deficits at various levels, which are aggravated by drugs of abuse. In the non-human primate model of HIV, we have previously shown that drugs of abuse such as Methamphetamine (Meth) increase brain viral load in correlation with a higher number of CCR5-expressing myeloid cells. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that may be involved in increasing inflammation, but also, it is a co-receptor for viral entry into target cells. CCR5-expressing myeloid cells are the main targets of HIV in the CNS. Thus, the identification of factors and mechanisms that impact the expression of CCR5 in the brain is critical, as changes in CCR5 levels may affect the infection in the brain. Using a well-characterized in vitro system, with the THP1 human macrophage cell line, we have investigated the hypothesis that the expression of CCR5 is acutely affected by Meth, and examined pathways by which this effect could happen. We found that Meth plays a direct role by regulating the abundance and nuclear translocation of transcription factors with binding sites in the CCR5 promoter. However, we found that the main factor that modifies the CCR5 gene promoter at the epigenetic level towards transcription is Dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter that is produced primarily in brain regions that are rich in dopaminergic neurons. In THP1 cells, the effect of DA on innate immune CCR5 transcription was mediated by DA receptors (DRDs), mainly DRD4. We also identified a role for DRD1 in suppressing CCR5 expression in this myeloid cell system, with potential implications for therapy. The effect of DA on innate immune CCR5 expression was also detectable on the cell surface during acute time-points, using low doses. In addition, HIV Tat acted by enhancing the surface expression of CCR5, in spite of its poor effect on transcription. Overall, our data suggests that the exposure of myeloid cells to Meth in the context of presence of HIV peptides such as Tat, may affect the number of HIV targets by modulating CCR5 expression, through a combination of DA-dependent and–independent mechanisms. Other drugs that increase DA may affect similar mechanisms. The implications of these epigenetic and translational mechanisms in enhancing HIV infection in the brain and elsewhere are demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2810016523,"Objective To date, exhaustive gene expression analyses of chondrocytes in hip osteoarthritis (OA) have yielded specific gene expression patterns. No study has reported on the exhaustive transcriptome of secondary hip OA based on acetabular dysplasia in a Japanese population, while previous reports have focused on primary or idiopathic hip OA in Caucasian populations. This study aims to search for specific gene expression patterns of secondary hip OA chondrocytes by transcriptome analysis. Design Human articular cartilage was obtained from femoral heads following hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture (N = 8; non-OA) and total hip arthroplasty for secondary hip OA (N = 12). Total RNA was extracted from the articular cartilage and submitted for microarray analysis. The obtained data were used to perform gene expression analysis, GO enrichment analysis and pathway analysis and were compared with data from primary hip OA in Caucasian populations in the literature. Results We identified 888 upregulated (fold change: FC ≥ 2) and 732 downregulated (FC ≤ 0.5) genes in hip OA versus non-OA chondrocytes, respectively. Only 10% of upregulated genes were common between the secondary and primary OA. The newly found genes prominently overexpressed in the secondary hip OA chondrocytes were DPT, IGFBP7, and KLF2. Pathway analysis revealed extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction as an OA-related pathway, which was similar to previous reports in primary hip OA. Conclusions This is the first study to report the genome-wide transcriptome of secondary hip OA chondrocytes and demonstrates new potential OA-related genes. Gene expression patterns were different between secondary and primary hip OA, although the results of pathway and functional analysis were similar."
https://openalex.org/W2811162621,"Unresolved taxonomy of threatened species is problematic for conservation as the field relies on species being distinct taxonomic units. Differences in breeding habitat and results from a preliminary molecular analysis indicated that the New Zealand population of the South Georgian Diving Petrel (Pelecanoides georgicus) was a distinct, yet undescribed, species. We measured 11 biometric characters and scored eight plumage characters in 143 live birds and 64 study skins originating from most populations of P. georgicus, to assess their taxonomic relationships. We analysed differences with principal component analyses (PCA), factorial ANOVAs, and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. Results show that individuals from New Zealand differ significantly from P. georgicus from all other populations as following: 1) longer wings, 2) longer outer tail feathers, 3) deeper bills, 4) longer heads, 5) longer tarsi, 6) limited collar extent, 7) greater extent of contrasting scapulars, 8) larger contrasting markings on the secondaries, 9) paler ear coverts, 10) paler collars, and 11) paler flanks. Furthermore, we used a species delimitation test with quantitative phenotypic criteria; results reveal that the New Zealand population of P. georgicus indeed merits species status. We hereby name this new species Pelecanoides whenuahouensis sp. nov. Due to severe reductions in its range and the very low number of remaining birds (~150 individuals limited to a single breeding colony on Codfish Island/Whenua Hou) the species warrants listing as ‘Critically Endangered’.

https://openalex.org/W2811380413,"Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting in progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve degeneration, leading to blindness. New therapeutic approaches that better preserve the visual field by promoting survival and health of RGCs are highly needed since RGC death occurs despite good IOP control in glaucoma patients. We have developed a novel approach to reliably induce chronic IOP elevation in mouse using a photopolymerizable biomatrix, hyaluronic acid glycidyl methacrylate. This is achieved by rapid in vivo crosslinking of the biomatrix at the iridocorneal angle by a flash of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to impede the aqueous outflow pathway with a controllable manner. Sustained IOP elevation was induced after a single manipulation and was maintained at ~45% above baseline for >4 weeks. Significant thinning of the inner retina and ~35% reduction in RGCs and axons was noted within one month of IOP elevation. Optic nerve degeneration showed positive correlation with cumulative IOP elevation. Activation of astrocytes and microglia appeared to be an early event in response to IOP elevation preceding detectable RGC and axon loss. Attenuated glial reactivity was noted at later stage where significant RGC/axon loss had occurred suggesting astrocytes and microglia may play different roles over the course of glaucomatous degeneration. This novel murine glaucoma model is reproducible and displays cellular changes that recapitulate several pathophysiological features of glaucoma."

Pneumococcal colonization studies are traditionally done among healthy children in the community; however, VT colonization prevalence may differ between these children and those with pneumonia. We assessed overall and VT pneumococcal colonization and factors associated with colonization among children with and without pneumonia after Mozambique introduced 10-valent PCV (PCV10) in 2013.We used data from ongoing pneumonia surveillance in children aged <5 years and from cross-sectional nasopharyngeal colonization surveys conducted in October 2014 -April 2015 and October 2015 -May 2016. Pneumonia was defined using WHO standard criteria for radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Children with pneumonia enrolled from January 2014 -April 2016 were compared to children without pneumonia enrolled from the cross-sectional surveys. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from each child. NP specimens were cultured for pneumococci, and culture-negative specimens from children with pneumonia underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Of 778 and 927 children with and without pneumonia, 97.4% and 27.0% were exposed to antibiotics before swab collection, respectively. Based on culture, pneumococcal colonization was 45.1% for children with and 84.5% for children without pneumonia (P<0.001); VT pneumococcal colonization was 18.6% for children with and 23.4% for children without pneumonia (P = 0.02). The addition of PCR in children with pneumonia increased overall and VT-pneumococcal colonization to 79.2% and 31.1%, respectively. In multivariable analysis including PCR results, pneumonia was associated with VT pneumococcal colonization (adjusted OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.10-1.78).Vaccine-type pneumococcal colonization remains common among children with and without pneumonia post-PCV10 introduction in Mozambique. In a population of children with high antibiotic exposure, the use of PCR for culture-negative NP swabs can improve assessment of pneumococcal colonization and circulating serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2811414363,"Recent success with B cell depletion therapies has revitalized efforts to understand the pathogenic role of B cells in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Using the adoptive transfer system of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS, we have previously shown that mice in which B cells are the only MHCII-expressing antigen presenting cell (APC) are susceptible to EAE. However, a reproducible delay in the day of onset of disease driven by exclusive B cell antigen presentation suggests that B cells require optimal conditions to function as APCs in EAE. In this study, we utilize an in vivo genetic system to conditionally and temporally regulate expression of MHCII to test the hypothesis that B cell APCs mediate attenuated and delayed neuroinflammatory T cell responses during EAE. Remarkably, induction of MHCII on B cells following the transfer of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells induced a rapid and robust form of EAE, while no change in the time to disease onset occurred for recipient mice in which MHCII is induced on a normal complement of APC subsets. Changes in CD4 T cell activation over time did not account for more rapid onset of EAE symptoms in this new B cell-mediated EAE model. Our system represents a novel model to study how the timing of pathogenic cognate interactions between lymphocytes facilitates the development of autoimmune attacks within the CNS."

The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with cervical cancer screening and screening outcomes among incarcerated women.We applied a framework of predisposing factors, enabling factors and population-specific characteristics that could impact screening behaviors and outcomes for this population. We used bivariate chi-square tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to analyze data previously collected from 290 incarcerated women.Cervical cancer screening belief score, as a predisposing factor, was associated with women who had an up-to-date Pap test and who had a cervical cancer diagnosis ever in their life. Both a sexual history containing high-risk behaviors and a history of abuse, population-specific factors, were each associated with having had an abnormal pap; mental health, incarceration, and substance use histories were each associated with having a diagnosis of cervical cancer.The significant differences in outcomes for these population-specific factors suggest the need for a health services approach that addresses the challenges to the cervical cancer preventive health needs of incarcerated women.Providers working with vulnerable populations such as women who have been incarcerated should be aware that their risk histories have an influence on their follow-up behaviors. These women will need extra support for cervical cancer screening and follow-up care."

https://openalex.org/W2809984518,"Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a multi-facetted blended eHealth intervention, called SDM-Digital Intake (SDM-DI), in which patients and clinicians are supported in Shared Decision Making during the intake process. Methods The study is a two-arm matched-paired cluster Randomised Controlled Trial in a specialist mental health outpatient setting with two conditions: SDM-DI and Intake As Usual (IAU). Four intake teams were allocated to each arm. All patients who followed an intake, were asked to participate if they were capable to complete questionnaires. Decisional Conflict (DC), referring to patients’ engagement and satisfaction with clinical decisions, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were patient participation, applying Shared Decision Making (SDM), working alliance, treatment adherence and symptom severity. Effects were measured at two weeks (T1) and two months (T2) after intake. Multilevel regression and intention-to-treat analyses were used. Additionally, the influence of subgroups and intervention adherence on DC were explored. Results At T1, 200 patients participated (47% intervention, 53% control), and at T2 175 patients (47% intervention, 53% control). At T1 and T2, no differences were found between conditions on DC. Subgroup analyses showed that effects of SDM-DI on DC were not modified by primary diagnoses mood, anxiety and personality disorders. Compared to IAU, at T2, patients reported positive effects of SDM-DI on SDM (β 7.553, p = 0.038, 95%CI:0.403–14.703, d = 0.32) and reduction of symptoms (β -7.276, p = 0.0497, 95%CI:-14.544–-0.008, d = -0.43). No effects were found on patient participation, working alliance and treatment adherence. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that if SDM was applied well, patients reported less DC (β = -0.457, p = 0.000, 95%CI:-0.518–-0.396, d = -1.31), which was associated with better treatment outcomes. Conclusion Although, this trial fails to demonstrate that SDM-DI by itself is sufficient to reduce DC, the results are encouraging for further efforts in improving and implementing the SDM intervention."

The SIRPTs are predicted to contain Hsp90-like domains, suggesting a potential chaperone activity. In this work, we report the structures of the Hsp90-like Sr1 domain of SIRPT1 and the N-terminal Ubl domain determined at 1.55- and 2.1-Å resolutions, respectively. The Ubl domain crystallized as a swapped dimer that could be relevant in the context of full-length protein. The Sr1 domain displays the Bergerat protein fold with a characteristic nucleotide-binding pocket, although it binds nucleotides with very low affinity. The Sr1 structure reveals that ARSACS-causing missense mutations (R272H, R272C, and T201K) disrupt protein folding, most likely leading to sacsin degradation. This work lends structural support to the view of sacsin as a molecular chaperone and provides a framework for future studies of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2809979486,"The largest lake transgression event (LTE) associated with lake anoxic events (LAE) and periodic seawater incursion events (SWIE) in the Songliao Basin, northeastern China, occurred during deposition of the Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation. The Yaojia-Nenjiang Formation boundary (YNB) marks the beginning of the LTE, as well as LAE and SWIE. However, there is an absence of direct radioisotopic dating, and therefore the age of the YNB, as well as the beginning of LTE, together with their relationship with other geological events, is strongly debated. Here we present a new SIMS U-Pb zircon age from the lowermost Nenjiang Formation. The bentonite bed located 9.88 m above the YNB of the X1-4 borehole was analyzed. Twenty-five analyses of 25 zircons were conducted, which produced a weighted mean age of 85.5±0.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.87). Based on the average sediment accumulation rate, the age of the YNB is suggested to be 85.7 Ma, indicating that the LTE began in the Early Santonian. The new ages provide a precise chronostratigraphic framework for climatic and geological events. Our new results imply that the beginning of the LTE, LAE and SWIE occurred almost simultaneously with short-term sea level rise, and probably had a close relationship with OAE3."
https://openalex.org/W2810109073,"People perceive their recorded voice differently from their actively spoken voice. The uncanny valley theory proposes that as an object approaches humanlike characteristics, there is an increase in the sense of familiarity; however, eventually a point is reached where the object becomes strangely similar and makes us feel uneasy. The feeling of discomfort experienced when people hear their recorded voice may correspond to the floor of the proposed uncanny valley. To overcome the feeling of eeriness of own-voice recordings, previous studies have suggested equalization of the recorded voice with various types of filters, such as step, bandpass, and low-pass, yet the effectiveness of these filters has not been evaluated. To address this, the aim of experiment 1 was to identify what type of voice recording was the most representative of one's own voice. The voice recordings were presented in five different conditions: unadjusted recorded voice, step filtered voice, bandpass filtered voice, low-pass filtered voice, and a voice for which the participants freely adjusted the parameters. We found large individual differences in the most representative own-voice filter. In order to consider roles of sense of agency, experiment 2 investigated if lip-synching would influence the rating of own voice. The result suggested lip-synching did not affect own voice ratings. In experiment 3, based on the assumption that the voices used in previous experiments corresponded to continuous representations of non-own voice to own voice, the existence of an uncanny valley was examined. Familiarity, eeriness, and the sense of own voice were rated. The result did not support the existence of an uncanny valley. Taken together, the experiments led us to the following conclusions: there is no general filter that can represent own voice for everyone, sense of agency has no effect on own voice rating, and the uncanny valley does not exist for own voice, specifically."
https://openalex.org/W2810186469,"Ontogenetic growth functions provide basic information in biological and ecological studies. Various growth functions classified into the Pütter model have been used historically, regardless of controversies over their appropriateness. Here, we present a novel growth function for fish and aquatic organisms (generalised q-VBGF) by considering an allocation schedule of allometrically produced surplus energy between somatic growth and reproduction. The generalised q-VBGF can track growth trajectories in different life history strategies from determinate to indeterminate growth by adjusting the value of the ‘growth indeterminacy exponent’ q. The timing of maturation and attainable body size can be adjusted by the ‘maturation timing parameter’ τ while maintaining a common growth trajectory before maturation. The generalised q-VBGF is a comprehensive growth function in which exponentials in the traditional monomolecular, von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, logistic, and Richards functions are replaced with q-exponentials defined in the non-extensive Tsallis statistics, and it fits to actual data more adequately than these conventional functions. The relationship between the estimated parameter values τ and rq forms a unique hyperbola, which provides a new insight into the continuum of life history strategies of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2811055241,"Zebrafish are a preferred vertebrate model for delineating genotype-phenotype relationships. One of the most studied features of zebrafish is their exceptional swimming ability. By 7 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish spend over two-thirds of their time engaged in spontaneous swimming activity and several months later they are capable of attaining some of the fastest swimming velocities relative to body length ever recorded in the laboratory. However, laboratory-assembled flumes capable of achieving the slow flow velocities characteristics of larvae as well as the relatively fast maximal velocities of adults have not been described in sufficient detail to allow easy replication. Here we describe an easily assembled, open-source zebrafish-scaled flume for assessing swimming performance. The flume uses two independent spherical-impeller pumps modulated by a microcontroller to achieve flow velocities ranging from 1 to 70 cm s-1. The microcontroller also monitors water temperature and flow velocity and sends these data to a personal computer for real-time display and storage. Incremental protocols for assessing maximal swimming speed (Umax) were developed, stored in custom software, and then uploaded to the microcontroller in order to assess performance of larval (14, 21, 28 dpf), juvenile (35, 42 dpf), and adult (8, 22 month) zebrafish. The flume had sufficient range and sensitivity to detect developmental changes in Umax of larvae and juveniles, an 18-24% faster Umax of adult males vs. females, and a 14-20% age-related reduction in Umax for the oldest zebrafish. Detailed information is provided to assemble and operate this low-cost, versatile, and reliable tool for assessing zebrafish swimming performance."
https://openalex.org/W2952565338,"Background The CYD-TDV vaccine was unusual in that the recommended target population for vaccination was originally defined not only by age, but also by transmission setting as defined by seroprevalence. WHO originally recommended countries consider vaccination against dengue with CYD-TDV vaccine in geographic settings only where prior infection with any dengue serotype, as measured by seroprevalence, was >170% in the target age group. Vaccine was not recommended in settings where seroprevalence was <50%. Test-and-vaccinate strategies suggested following new analysis by Sanofi will still require age-stratified seroprevalence surveys to optimise age-group targeting. Here we address considerations for serosurvey design in the context of vaccination program planning. Methods To explore how the design of seroprevalence surveys affects estimates of transmission intensity, 100 age-specific seroprevalence surveys were simulated using a beta-binomial distribution and a simple catalytic model for different combinations of age-range, survey size, transmission setting, and test sensitivity/specificity. We then used a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm to estimate the force of infection from each simulated dataset. Results Sampling from a wide age-range led to more accurate estimates than merely increasing sample size in a narrow age-range. This finding was consistent across all transmission settings. The optimum test sensitivity and specificity given an imperfect test differed by setting with high sensitivity being important in high transmission settings and high specificity important in low transmission settings. Conclusions When assessing vaccination suitability by seroprevalence surveys, countries should ensure an appropriate age-range is sampled, considering epidemiological evidence about the local burden of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2810247387,"The purpose of this study was to analyze futsal players' organization on the court in different categories while attacking and defending, in interception and shot to goal situations. We obtained the trajectories of 89 players from the under-15 category, 102 players from the under-18 category, and 110 professional players, during official matches. The spread, surface area, and Euclidian distances between the teams' centroids were measured to represent the distribution of the futsal players on the court. The variables were analyzed during each offensive and defensive sequence, and during situations of shots to goal and interceptions, with and without the outfield goalkeeper player participation. While the players were attacking, all categories presented greater spread and surface area, compared to values when players were defending (P < 0.01). Among the categories, the results showed lower spread and area values for the younger players (P < 0.01). The results of spread, surface area, and distances between the teams' centroids showed different forms of organization for each of the categories in specific situations of shots to goal and interceptions. The study provided insights that allow coaches to better plan suitable tactical training according to the requirements of each category."
https://openalex.org/W2811138083,"Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV is challenging due to non-specific clinical presentations and inadequately sensitive diagnostic tests. The WHO recommends screening using a clinical algorithm followed by rapid diagnosis using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and more information is needed to evaluate these recommendations in different settings. Methods From August 2012 to September 2013, consecutive adults newly diagnosed with HIV in Bamenda, Cameroon, were screened for TB regardless of symptoms by smear microscopy and culture; the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was performed retrospectively. Time to treatment and patient outcomes were obtained from routine registers. Results Among 1,149 people enrolled, 940 (82%) produced sputum for lab testing; of these, 68% were women, the median age was 35 years (IQR, 28–42 years), the median CD4 count was 291cells/μL (IQR, 116–496 cells/μL), and 86% had one or more of current cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. In total, 131 people (14%, 95% CI, 12–16%) had sputum culture-positive TB. The WHO symptom screening algorithm had a sensitivity of 92% (95%CI, 86–96%) and specificity of 15% (95%CI, 12–17%) in this population. Compared to TB culture, the sensitivity of direct smear microscopy was 25% (95% CI, 18–34%), and the sensitivity of Xpert was 68% (95% CI, 58–76); the sensitivity of both was higher for people reporting more symptoms. Only one of 69 people with smear-negative/culture-positive TB was started on TB treatment prior to culture positivity. Of 71 people with bacteriologically-confirmed TB and known outcome after 6 months, 13 (17%) had died, including 11 people with smear-negative TB and 6 people with both smear and Xpert-negative TB. Conclusions Use of the most sensitive rapid diagnostic test available is critical in people newly diagnosed with HIV in this setting to maximize the detection of bacteriologically-confirmed TB. However, this intervention is not sufficient alone and should be combined with more comprehensive clinical diagnosis of TB to improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2809940418,"Introduction Daily self-weighing (DSW) and daily activity tracking (DAT) are useful strategies for preventing weight gain among African American breast cancer survivors. However, self-monitoring behaviors vary over time, increasing risk of weight gain. This study explored the association of nonadherence to DSW and DAT with corresponding weight fluctuations among African American breast cancer survivors. Methods Using data from a 6-month randomized controlled trial, we conducted a secondary data analysis among women randomized into a DSW group (n = 13) and a DSW+DAT group (n = 11). DSW and DAT were captured from wireless scale and activity tracker data. Nonadherence to DSW was defined as one or more days without a weight measurement, and nonadherence to DAT was defined as one or more days without activity tracking. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine weight fluctuations in relation to nonadherence to DSW and DAT. Data analysis occurred from September 2016-April 2017. Results Over the 6-month study period, women provided 119.2 ± 46.0 weight measurements and 121.9 ± 53.2 days of physical activity tracking. Nonadherence to DSW was associated with weight fluctuations. For every 1-day increase in nonadherence to DSW, weight increased by 0.031 kg (95% CI: 0.012, 0.050; p<0.01). Additionally, during periods of DSW and DAT weight decreased by 0.028 kg (95% CI: -0.042, -0.014; p<0.001) and 0.017 kg (95% CI: -0.030; -0.004) respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that nonadherence to DSW was associated with weight gain among breast cancer survivors. Weight loss was enhanced during periods of DSW and DAT."
https://openalex.org/W2811500281,"Size-selective mortality owing to lack of energy reserves during the first marine winter has been suggested to be a result of juvenile salmon failing to reach a critical size or condition by the end of their first marine summer and not surviving the following winter due to this presumed energy deficit. This hypothesis implies strong size dependency of mortality, and is subject to empirical data support for acceptance. Scale circulus spacing has been interpreted as an index for body size, and we reviewed the effect of size-selective mortality with a knife-edge mortality function on descriptive statistics for a scale circulus spacing index (SCSI). In order to invoke size selection as an important driver of mortality during the first year of ocean rearing, it is necessary to demonstrate not only that size-selective mortality is directed towards the smaller members of the population, but that the selective nature of the mortality can account for a substantial portion of the observed mortality. If the assumption is made that a random sample of a single juvenile population has been obtained, then studies that employ a SCSI to infer size-selective mortality coupled with a critical size limit must demonstrate a shift toward larger values of the SCSI, but also a concomitant reduction in the variance and range of the SCSI and an increase in the skewness and kurtosis of the SCSI values. Through simulation we found that the percentage of adults that displayed a SCSI value greater than the maximum observed in the juvenile sample was highly dependent on the initial juvenile sample size and size-selective mortality rate. Geographical distributions of juvenile Pacific salmon can be stratified by size, with larger individuals migrating earlier from local ocean entry locations than smaller individuals, and thus differential timing migration of juveniles based upon body size prior to the collection of the marine juvenile sample may be a more plausible explanation of published trends in the SCSI, rather than invoking substantial size-selective mortality and a critical size limit."
https://openalex.org/W2803338980,"Recently, several new materials for mattresses have been introduced. Although some of these, such as low rebound (pressure-absorbing/memory foam) and high rebound mattresses have fairly different characteristics, effects of these mattresses on sleep have never been scientifically evaluated. In the current study, we have evaluated effects of a high rebound mattress topper [HR] on sleep and its associated physiology, and the effects were compared to those of a low rebound mattress toppers (LR) in healthy young (n = 10) and old (n = 20) adult males with a randomized, single-blind, cross over design. We found that sleeping with HR compared to LR induced a larger decline in core body temperature (CBT) in the initial phase of nocturnal sleep both in young (minimum CBT: 36.05 vs 36.35°C) and old (minimum CBT: 36.47 vs. 36.55°C) subjects, and declines in the CBT were associated with increases in deep sleep/delta power (+27.8% in young and +24.7% in old subjects between 11:00–01:00). We also found significantly smaller muscle activities during roll over motions with HR (-53.0 to -66.1%, depending on the muscle) during a separate daytime testing. These results suggest that sleeping with HR in comparison to with LR, may facilitate restorative sleep at the initial phase of sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2810192430,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major risk factor for cervical cancer. Greater than 90% of these cancers originate in the cervical transformation zone (TZ), a narrow region of metaplastic squamous epithelium that develops at the squamocolumnar junction between the ectocervix and endocervix. It is unclear why the TZ has high susceptibility to malignant transformation and few studies have specifically examined cells from this region. We hypothesized that cells cultured from TZ are more susceptible to cellular immortalization, an alteration that contributes to malignant development. We cultured primary epithelial cells from each region of human cervix (ectocervix, endocervix and TZ) and measured susceptibility to immortalization after transfection with the complete HPV-16 genome or infection of HPV16 E6/E7 retroviruses. Cells cultured from each cervical region expressed keratin markers (keratin 14 and 18) that confirmed their region of origin. In contrast to our prediction, cells from TZ were equally susceptible to immortalization as cells from ectocervix or endocervix. Thus, increased susceptibility of the TZ to cervical carcinogenesis is not due to increased frequency of immortalization by HPV-16. We developed a series of HPV16-immortalized cell lines from ectocervix, endocervix and TZ that will enable comparisons of how these cells respond to factors that promote cervical carcinogenesis."

From the results obtained after 24 and 48 h of the growth test, the SHS-treated PHBHHx oligoesters were found to be nontoxic to the growth of mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell line with cell viability percentages of more than 95%. In order to serve as a potential resorbable medical suture, PHBHHx oligoesters were blended with poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) with a weight ratio of PHBHHx oligoester/PLLA = 20:80 (wt/wt) to improve mechanical properties of PHBHHx oligoesters. The PHBHHx oligoesters/PLLA blend films were evaluated for their thermal, mechanical, and surface wetting properties. Thermal properties of the blend films suggested a good compatibility between PHBHHx oligoesters and PLLA components. Mechanical properties of the blend films were determined to be close enough to a desirable strength range of medical sutures. Moreover, contact angle range of 65 < θ < 70° for the blend samples could provide desirable cell adhesion when used as biomaterials. Therefore, the blend of SHS-treated PHBHHx oligoesters and PLLA would be an ideal choice to be used as biomedical materials."
https://openalex.org/W2810877391,"Chile is experiencing a period of rapid aging, which increases the need of long-term care services in the country. Nursing homes have been the traditional alternative to deal with the increase of elderly population in the country, with services supplied by a mix of for-profit and nonprofit providers. Additionally, population exhibits a high degree of geographical concentration. The study aims to identify the determinants of the geographical location of nursing homes in Chile at municipality level. The analysis takes into account the different location criteria for different types of nursing homes as well as potential spatial effects. The paper uses spatial analysis tools to identify clusters of nursing homes and population characteristics and to estimate the determinants of nursing homes availability and coverage in the country. The analysis–based on spatial global and local tests, and spatial autoregressive models- show the existence of clusters of nursing homes as well as clusters of municipalities according to elderly population, income, poverty, population density, and public health insurance coverage. Residuals from ordinary least squares regressions were spatially autocorrelated, showing the need of using spatial models. Estimations show that availability and coverage of nursing homes are positively related with municipality income, and that for-profit and nonprofit facilities respond differently to different factors. A negative coefficient was found for poverty in nonprofit nursing homes, raising doubts about the effectiveness of giving public subsidies to incentive the installation of facilities in areas with high needs and low income."
https://openalex.org/W2811092997,"Background In the last decades an increasing number of West Nile Disease cases was observed in equines and humans in the Mediterranean basin and surveillance systems are set up in numerous countries to manage and control the disease. The collection, storage and distribution of information on the spread of the disease becomes important for a shared intervention and control strategy. To this end, a Web Geographic Information System has been developed and disease data, climatic and environmental remote sensed data, full genome sequences of selected isolated strains are made available. This paper describes the Disease Monitoring Dashboard (DMD) web system application, the tools available for the preliminary analysis on climatic and environmental factors and the other interactive tools for epidemiological analysis. Methods WNV occurrence data are collected from multiple official and unofficial sources. Whole genome sequences and metadata of WNV strains are retrieved from public databases or generated in the framework of the Italian surveillance activities. Climatic and environmental data are provided by NASA website. The Geographical Information System is composed by Oracle 10g Database and ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.03; the web mapping client application is developed with the ArcGIS API for Javascript and Phylocanvas library to facilitate and optimize the mash-up approach. ESRI ArcSDE 10.1 has been used to store spatial data. Results The DMD application is accessible through a generic web browser at https://netmed.izs.it/networkMediterraneo/. The system collects data through on-line forms and automated procedures and visualizes data as interactive graphs, maps and tables. The spatial and temporal dynamic visualization of disease events is managed by a time slider that returns results on both map and epidemiological curve. Climatic and environmental data can be associated to cases through python procedures and downloaded as Excel files. Conclusions The system compiles multiple datasets through user-friendly web tools; it integrates entomological, veterinary and human surveillance, molecular information on pathogens and environmental and climatic data. The principal result of the DMD development is the transfer and dissemination of knowledge and technologies to develop strategies for integrated prevention and control measures of animal and human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2811204305,"Purpose Diets high in saturated fat acids (SFA) have been linked with cardio-metabolic disease risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether only 1–2 weeks of a high SFA diet could impact disease risk factors in overweight adults who normally eat a relatively low proportion of SFA (i.e., <40% of dietary fat). Methods Twelve overweight (BMI: 27±1 kg/m2) young adults were studied before and after a 2-week diet that increased the proportion of SFA (<40% to 60% of dietary fat), while maintaining their daily intake of total fat, carbohydrate, protein, and calories. Insulin resistance, blood pressure, plasma markers of liver damage, total plasma cholesterol concentrations, and fatty acid profile within plasma and skeletal muscle lipid pools were assessed before and after the intervention. Results Total plasma cholesterol concentration increased (148±5 vs. 164±8 mg/dl; P<0.05) after only one week, due exclusively to an increase in LDL-cholesterol (78±4 vs. 95±7 mg/dl; P<0.05). After two weeks, plasma aspartate amino transferase (AST) concentration increased (P<0.05) but we found no change in insulin resistance, or resting blood pressure. The diet increase the proportion of SFA in plasma (35±1% vs. 39±2%; P<0.05) and the intramyocellular triglyceride pool (32±1% vs. 37±1%; P<0.05) suggesting the fatty acids in these pools may readily exchange. Conclusions Although blood lipids remain within normal clinical range, increasing saturated fat in diet for only 2 weeks raises plasma markers of cardiovascular risk (LDL-cholesterol) and liver damage (AST). In overweight, but healthy-young adults SFA accumulate in plasma and muscle after only 1–2 weeks of dietary increase."
https://openalex.org/W2809801872,"For most pathogens, vaccination reduces the spread of the infection and total number of cases; thus, public policy usually advocates maximizing vaccination coverage. We use simple mathematical models to explore how this may be different for pathogens, such as influenza, which exhibit strain variation. Our models predict that the total number of seasonal influenza infections is minimized at an intermediate (rather than maximal) level of vaccination, and, somewhat counter-intuitively, further increasing the level of the vaccination coverage may lead to higher number of influenza infections and be detrimental to the public interest. This arises due to the combined effects of: competition between multiple co-circulating strains; limited breadth of protection afforded by the vaccine; and short-term strain-transcending immunity following natural infection. The study highlights the need for better quantification of the components of vaccine efficacy and longevity of strain-transcending cross-immunity in order to generate nuanced recommendations for influenza vaccine coverage levels."

Our results suggest that behavioral characteristics such as intolerance of risk, curiosity, and trust can be used to predict individual ability to identify phishing interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2811013114,"Sensory suppression is a mechanism that attenuates selective information. As for long-latency suppression in auditory and somatosensory systems, paired-pulse suppression, observed as 2 identical stimuli spaced by approximately 500 ms, is widely known, though its mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between auditory and somatosensory long-latency suppression of change-related cortical responses using magnetoencephalography. Somatosensory change-related responses were evoked by an abrupt increase in stimulus strength in a train of current-constant square wave pulses at 100 Hz to the left median nerve at the wrist. Furthermore, auditory change-related responses were elicited by an increase in sound pressure by 15 dB in a continuous sound composed of a train of 25-ms pure tones. Binaural stimulation was used in Experiment 1, while monaural stimulation was used in Experiment 2. For both somatosensory and auditory stimuli, the conditioning and test stimuli were identical, and inserted at 2400 and 3000 ms, respectively. The results showed clear suppression of the test response in the bilateral parisylvian region, but not in the postcentral gyrus of the contralateral hemisphere in the somatosensory system. Similarly, the test response in the bilateral supratemporal plane (N100m) was suppressed in the auditory system. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between suppression of right N100m and right parisylvian activity, suggesting that similar mechanisms are involved in both. Finally, a high test-retest reliability for suppression was seen with both modalities. Suppression revealed in the present study is considered to reflect sensory inhibition ability in individual subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2811197936,"It is known that some groups of immigrants can have low health literacy and it may affect their health. Although the number of North Korean defectors in the Republic of Korea has increased, little is known about their health literacy and health behavior. Adult North Korean defectors (n = 399) in this study were surveyed on health literacy, using the Korean Health Literacy Scale, and on the use of preventive services. Those with better health literacy scores were more likely to have vaccination than the lower scoring group (adjusted OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.19–5.00). However, undergoing medical check-up may not be associated with health literacy. In subgroup analysis, among defectors who lived alone (P = 0.032) or who had longer time in other countries before entering (P = 0.007), the vaccination coverage was associated with their health literacy scores. This study provides evidence for an association between health literacy and influenza vaccination coverage among North Korean defectors even though they may have fewer language barriers than other immigrants. Further research is needed to develop interventions for improving health literacy and their preventive health behavior."

'Dongzao') to find biocontrol agents against jujube shrunken-fruit disease caused by Alternaria alternata. The strains were screened using A. alternata strain CN193 as the target pathogen. The nutrient competition for all isolates was studied using the dual culture, and their inhibitive capability was tested by measuring the inhibition width of filter paper disks with filtrate. Influence of filtrate from the selected strains with strong inhibition of mycelial growth on spore germination was studied with hanging drop method on concavity slides. Colonization in the jujube leaves was assayed using a rifampicin-resistant mutant of strain St-zn-34 as the screening marker. Strains were identified based on their morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, 16S rDNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 81 endophytic strains were isolated from the stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits of winter jujube. Among these isolates, 14 strains showed strong antagonism against A. alternata. Further study showed that the filtrate of strains St-zn-9 and St-zn-34 could inhibit the mycelial growth of A. alternata, and the widths of their inhibition zone reached 6.14±0.03 mm and 8.27±0.09 mm, respectively. However, strain St-zn-34 showed stronger inhibition on spore germination than strain St-zn-9. St-zn-34 could significantly reduce the spore germination rate of A. alternata, and the spore did not germinate at all or the germ tube was very short. A rifampicin resistant-derivative of wild-type strain St-zn-34, which was designated as St-zn-34r, was obtained by transferring the strains to media with stepwise-increased rifampicin. Colonization assays indicated that St-zn-34r could colonize in jujube leaves, and the population of St-zn-34r was 1.2×103 CFU/g FW after inoculation for 30 days. Except for its salt tolerance, St-zn-34 was the closest to those of Bacillus subtilis. Thus, the strain was identified as B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W2811508557,"To evaluate changes in colour vision following intravitreal injection of Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) in patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO). Both red-green (RG) and yellow-blue (YB) chromatic sensitivity were assessed using the Colour Assessment & Diagnosis (CAD) test which isolates the use of colour signals and provides age-corrected, statistical limits for normal trichromats. To determine whether colour changes and visual acuity (VA) post-treatment relate to central sub-field retinal thickness (CST).Fourteen patients with DMO who were undergoing treatment with Ozurdex were recruited for this study. RG and YB colour thresholds were measured using the CAD test, best corrected visual acuity was assessed using the ETDRS chart and CST was measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). All tests were performed monocularly at baseline and 24 weeks post injection.All patients (n = 14 eyes), had significant loss of RG and YB chromatic sensitivity at baseline (p<0.05). The mean age was 56 ± 9.5 years. The age specific, monocular, upper normal limits for a 56 year old subject are 2.66 for RG and 2.85 for YB. In this study, the measured, pre injection thresholds (mean±SD) were 22.6 ± 11.3 for RG and 16.2 ± 3.76 for YB. There was significant improvement in RG threshold post injection (i.e., 19.2 ± 10.8 (p<0.05)). No significant changes were found in the YB thresholds with corresponding mean and range values of: 15.8 ± 4.6 (p = 0.23). CST pre-treatment was 542 ±135 μm. After treatment and by week 24 the CST values decreased to 435 ±127 μm.RG colour thresholds provide a sensitive measure of functional change in diabetic subjects with macular oedema. The YB system is damaged severely in the DMO patients studied and shows little or no recovery post treatment. The improvement in VA and particularly in RG colour vision correlate well with the measured decrease in CST. The results suggest that the improvement in the RG chromatic sensitivity can provide a useful biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of treatment in DMO."
https://openalex.org/W2810093040,"Referring patients from specialist mental-health services (provided by multiple healthcare service providers and aimed at relieving symptoms of mental illness) to less intensive care (provided by a nurse or psychologist in cooperation with a general practitioner and aimed at improving quality of life) is feasible from the perspective of patients, service providers, and mental-health services. However, it is unclear which patients are most suitable for referral to less intensive care. In this study, we used concept mapping to identify factors that might determine whether a referral from specialist mental services to less intensive care might be successful. Participants (N = 34) were recruited from different parts of the Netherlands and included general practitioners, peer workers, community mental-health nurses, and social workers from several services who were based in different neighborhoods. The participants generated 54 statements (31 after clean-up), which were sorted into five clusters and rated on their expected ability to predict successful referral. Ordered from highest to lowest on expected predictive value, the clusters of factors were: Patient characteristics, patients' informal support system, patients' social situation, organization of services, and service provider related factors. The ordering was the same for all of the service providers, except that general practitioners expected the organization of services to be the most predictive. The ordering of the clusters is mostly consistent with existing knowledge about recovery during mental healthcare. In order to further improve the number of successful referrals from specialist mental-health services to less intensive care, a prospective prediction study is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2810993462,"Pestalopezia brunneopruinosa, the type species of Pestalopezia in Leotiomycetes, produces typical cup-shaped ascomata. Because its asexual morph has conidia comprised of five cells including apical and basal appendages and three pigmented median cells, it was first described as Pestalotia gibbosa, which belongs to Sordariomycetes. This contradiction has not been resolved due to the difficulty in isolating this fungus in culture. In this study, we isolated separate strains from the sexual morph and the asexual morph for molecular analysis. Phylogenetic trees of Sporocadaceae based on internal transcribed spacer, partial β-tubulin, and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha sequence datasets revealed that both strains fall into the same taxon, in a clade in Pestalotiopsis sensu stricto alongside P. gaultheriae and P. spathulata. We provide the first evidence that fungi producing cup-shaped ascomata in Pestalotiopsis belong to Sordariomycetes, and we have proposed the transfer of Pestalopezia brunneopruinosa to Pestalotiopsis gibbosa."
https://openalex.org/W2811173414,Objectives To investigate the levels of agreement between self-reported responses to the Adult Pre-exercise Screening System (APSS) questionnaire using online versus face-to-face (F2F) modalities. Design Convenience sample of adults completing a pre-exercise screening questionnaire using different modalities. Methods Adult volunteers (n = 94) were recruited to complete the APSS using both online and F2F modalities. Participants were provided a URL link to an online APSS questionnaire then followed-up the next day in a F2F interview. Objective health risk factors were also measured. Comparisons between responses were undertaken using kappa and correlation statistics to determine levels of agreement. Results The levels of agreement between online versus F2F responses for the seven compulsory Stage 1 questions (known diseases and signs and/or symptoms of disease) were >94% (kappa = 0.644–0.794). Response comparisons for Stage 2 questions on health risk factors were also generally high (>82% agreement) but there were larger differences between reported and measured risk factors in Stage 3. Conclusions Levels of agreement between the Stage 1 responses were substantial and support the use of this online option for pre-exercise screening. There were larger differences between self-reported and objectively measured health risk factors in Stages 2 and 3.
https://openalex.org/W2810765868,"Animal behaviour is increasingly seen as an important component in maintaining functional connectivity between patches in fragmented landscapes. However, models that explicitly incorporate behavioural trade-offs are rarely applied to landscape planning problems like connectivity. The aim of this study was to explore how state-dependent behaviour influenced functional connectivity between patches from a theoretical perspective. We investigated how inter-patch distances influenced functional connectivity using a dynamic state variable model framework. The decision making process of an individual ruminant facing fitness trade-offs in staying in its patch of origin or moving to another patch at various distances were explicitly modelled. We incorporated energetic costs and predation costs of feeding, ruminating, and resting while in the patch and for transit between patches based on inter-patch distance. Functional connectivity was maintained with isolated patches when they offered high intake and the inactivity of rumination associated with rapid gut fill resulted in reduced predation risk. Nevertheless, individuals in high energetic state often would forgo moving to another patch, whereas individuals in poor energetic states were forced to accept the cost of movement to best meet their requirements in the distant patch. The inclusion of state-dependent behavioural models provides important insights into functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes and helps integrate animal behaviour into landscape planning. We discuss the consequences of our findings for landscape planning to show how the approach provides a heuristic tool to assess alternative scenarios for restoring landscape functional connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2811084395,"To develop and validate a Taiwanese version of the Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile (HELP-T) for community-dwelling older Taiwanese adults (≥ 55 years).The original Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile (HELP) is a 56-item self-report questionnaire measuring various aspects of health-related lifestyles in older adults. The standard cultural-adaptation procedure was used for questionnaire translation and modification. A field test was conducted for culturally specific item selection, rating-scale analysis, and psychometric validation of the HELP-T in a sample of 274 community-dwelling older adults via classical test theory.The 59-item HELP-T is culturally adapted from the original 56-item HELP. The original 6-point rating scale was modified to a 3-point scale for easy use by Taiwanese older adults. The HELP-T had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82). The test-retest reliability for the total score was high (0.92), and moderate to high (range: 0.57-0.92) for subscales. The construct validity was supported by the significant correlations between each subscale and the total score (Spearman's rho = 0.41-0.67, p < 0.0001) and by the ability of the scores to significantly discriminate between participants with different levels of self-rated health (p = 0.0001).The HELP-T is a suitable clinical tool for assessing and monitoring lifestyle risk factors, establishing client-centered lifestyle intervention goals, and determining the outcomes of lifestyle interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2809706102,"Reaction times of Olympic sprinters provide insights into the most rapid of human response times. To determine whether minimum reaction times have changed as athlete training has become ever more specialized, we analyzed the results from the Olympic Games between 2004 and 2016. The results for the 100 m and 110 m hurdle events show that minimum reaction times have systematically decreased between 2004 and 2016 for both sexes, with women showing a marked decrease since 2008 that eliminated the sex difference in 2012. Because overall race times have not systematically decreased between 2004 and 2016, the most likely explanation for the apparent decrease in reaction times is a reduction in the proprietary force thresholds used to calculate the reaction times based on force sensors in starting blocks-and not the result of more specialized or effective training."

https://openalex.org/W2810220413,"Sensitive, probe-based detection of multiple DNA targets is limited by the competitive reannealing of the antiparallel duplex DNA helix with the complementary DNA strand. To address this, we developed Cliffhanger primers, which create single-stranded DNA overhangs on PCR amplicons while simultaneously increasing the multiplex PCR efficacy and allowing PCR amplification using crude lysates of human faecal samples. A multiplex PCR that targeted eight genes from diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli plus an internal control was performed and compared to a routine method that consisted of culture followed by multiplex PCR with fragment length separation. A total of 2515 clinical faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea were tested using both methods, and there was a significant increase in clinical sensitivity and negative predictive value with the Cliffhanger method for seven out of eight genes. All Cliffhanger-only positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicon. Notably, the Cliffhanger method reduced the total sample turn-around time in the laboratory from 20 hours to 6 hours. Hence, use of Cliffhanger primers increased assay robustness, decreased turn-around time and increased PCR efficacy. This increased the overall clinical sensitivity without the loss of specificity for a heavily multiplexed PCR assay."
