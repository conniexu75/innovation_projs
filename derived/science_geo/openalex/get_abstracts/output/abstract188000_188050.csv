https://openalex.org/W2130421043,"Stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers activation of a common MyD88-dependent signaling pathway as well as a MyD88-independent pathway that is unique to TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways leading to interferon (IFN)-β production. Here we disrupted the gene encoding a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor, TRIF. TRIF-deficient mice were defective in both TLR3- and TLR4-mediated expression of IFN-β and activation of IRF-3. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine production in response to the TLR4 ligand, but not to other TLR ligands, was severely impaired in TRIF-deficient macrophages. Mice deficient in both MyD88 and TRIF showed complete loss of nuclear factor kappa B activation in response to TLR4 stimulation. These findings demonstrate that TRIF is essential for TLR3- and TLR4-mediated signaling pathways facilitating mammalian antiviral host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2095370504,"Most mammalian cells do not divide indefinitely, owing to a process termed replicative senescence. In human cells, replicative senescence is caused by telomere shortening, but murine cells senesce despite having long stable telomeres1. Here, we show that the phenotypes of senescent human fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) differ under standard culture conditions, which include 20% oxygen. MEFs did not senesce in physiological (3%) oxygen levels, but underwent a spontaneous event that allowed indefinite proliferation in 20% oxygen. The proliferation and cytogenetic profiles of DNA repair-deficient MEFs suggested that DNA damage limits MEF proliferation in 20% oxygen. Indeed, MEFs accumulated more DNA damage in 20% oxygen than 3% oxygen, and more damage than human fibroblasts in 20% oxygen. Our results identify oxygen sensitivity as a critical difference between mouse and human cells, explaining their proliferative differences in culture, and possibly their different rates of cancer and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2038988941,"Foxo transcription factors have been implicated in diverse biological processes, including metabolism, cellular stress responses, and aging. Here, we show that Foxo3a-/- female mice exhibit a distinctive ovarian phenotype of global follicular activation leading to oocyte death, early depletion of functional ovarian follicles, and secondary infertility. Foxo3a thus functions at the earliest stages of follicular growth as a suppressor of follicular activation. In addition to providing a molecular entry point for studying the regulation of follicular growth, these results raise the possibility that accelerated follicular initiation plays a role in premature ovarian failure, a common cause of infertility and premature aging in women."
https://openalex.org/W1968895711,"We have observed both superluminal and ultraslow light propagation in an alexandrite crystal at room temperature. Group velocities as slow as 91 meters per second to as fast as -800 meters per second were measured and attributed to the influence of coherent population oscillations involving chromium ions in either mirror or inversion sites within the crystal lattice. Namely, ions in mirror sites are inversely saturable and cause superluminal light propagation, whereas ions in inversion sites experience conventional saturable absorption and produce slow light. This technique for producing large group indices is considerably easier than the existing methods to implement and is therefore suitable for diverse applications."
https://openalex.org/W2113561239,"Preclinical or clinical trials for muscular dystrophies have met with modest success, mainly because of inefficient delivery of viral vectors or donor cells to dystrophic muscles. We report here that intra-arterial delivery of wild-type mesoangioblasts, a class of vessel-associated stem cells, corrects morphologically and functionally the dystrophic phenotype of virtually all downstream muscles in adult immunocompetent α-sarcoglycan (α-SG) null mice, a model organism for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. When mesoangioblasts isolated from juvenile dystrophic mice and transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing α-SG were injected into the femoral artery of dystrophic mice, they reconstituted skeletal muscle in a manner similar to that seen in wild-type cells. The success of this protocol was mainly due to widespread distribution of donor stem cells through the capillary network, a distinct advantage of this strategy over previous approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2049314986,"We report electrical manipulation of magnetization processes in a ferromagnetic semiconductor, in which low-density carriers are responsible for the ferromagnetic interaction. The coercive force H C at which magnetization reversal occurs can be manipulated by modifying the carrier density through application of electric fields in a gated structure. Electrically assisted magnetization reversal, as well as electrical demagnetization, has been demonstrated through the effect. This electrical manipulation offers a functionality not previously accessible in magnetic materials and may become useful for reversing magnetization of nanoscale bits for ultrahigh-density information storage."
https://openalex.org/W2016354937,"Mammalian short TRP channels (TRPCs) are putative receptor- and store-operated cation channels that play a fundamental role in the regulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Assembly of the seven TRPC homologs (TRPC1-7) into homo- and heteromers can create a large variety of different channels. However, the compositions as well as the functional properties of native TRPC complexes are largely undefined. We performed a systematic biochemical study of TRPC interactions in mammalian brain and identified previously unrecognized channel heteromers composed of TRPC1, TRPC4, or TRPC5 and the diacylglycerol-activated TRPC3 or TRPC6 subunits. The novel TRPC heteromers were found exclusively in embryonic brain. In heterologous systems, we demonstrated that assembly of these novel heteromers required the combination of TRPC1 plus TRPC4 or TRPC5 subunits along with diacylglycerol-sensitive subunits in the channel complexes. Functional interaction of the TRPC subunits was verified using a dominant negative TRPC5 mutant (TRPC5DN). Co-expression of TRPC5DN suppressed currents through TRPC5- and TRPC4-containing complexes; TRPC3-associated currents were unaffected by TRPC5DN unless TRPC1 was also co-expressed. This complex assembly mechanism increases the diversity of TRPC channels in mammalian brain and may generate novel heteromers that have specific roles in the developing brain.

Cellular Ca2+ signaling is dependent on ubiquitously expressed receptor- and store-operated cation channels (ROCs 1The abbreviations used are: ROC, receptor-operated channel; SOC, store-operated channel; TRPC, TRP channel; PLC, phospholipase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; HEK, human embryonic kidney; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. and SOCs). These channels mediate Ca2+ influx in response to hormones and other stimuli that activate phospholipase C (PLC) isoenzymes (1Clapham D.E.

The widespread expression and functional diversity of ROCs and SOCs is reflected by the large variety of these channels with diverse biophysical properties and regulation mechanisms. There is growing evidence that members of the TRPC cation channel family can form ROCs and SOCs. Belonging to the larger superfamily of mammalian TRP channels, seven TRPCs (TRPC1-7) have been identified (4Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 5Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/90/re1.Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of the highly homologous TRPC3, 6, and 7 gave rise to diacylglycerol (DAG)-activated ROCs (6Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G.

Whereas TRPC4 and TRPC5 were activated by an unknown PLC-dependent mechanism (8Okada T. Shimizu S. Wakamori M. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Takada N. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol.

Other studies indicated that TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC5 might also contribute to SOCs activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (11Trebak M. Bird G.S. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Based on their structural similarity with voltage-dependent K+ channels, functional TRPC complexes are presumed to be tetramers. Many of the disparate results regarding TRPC function and regulation could be reconciled by assuming that TRPC subunits can assemble into heteromeric channels with diverse properties. Montell and co-workers demonstrated that TRPC1 and TPRC3 formed complexes based on co-immunoprecipitation studies of tagged proteins (15Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We reported that TRPC1 co-assembled with TRPC4 and TRPC5 in rat brain (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The biophysical properties of TRPC(1+4) and TRPC(1+5) heteromers are surprisingly distinct from those of the channel homomers. Whereas TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels expressed alone were doubly rectifying, TRPC(1+4) and TRPC(1+5) heteromers outwardly rectified, similar to native Gq-coupled receptor-activated cation currents in hippocampus and frontal cortex (17Congar P. Leinekugel X. Ben-Ari Y. Crepel V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5366-5379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Haj-Dahmane S. Andrade R. J.

An elegant study confirmed the interaction of TRPC1 with TRPC4 and TRPC5 using intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements in heterologous expression systems but found no interaction between members of the DAG-responsive TRPC subfamily (TRPC3 and TRPC6) and other TRPC subunits (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). A similar interaction pattern was recently reported for TRPC channel heteromers in rat brain synaptosomes (21Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Despite the progress in analyzing TRPC subunit interactions in heterologous expression systems, it is unclear whether the same principles apply to TRPC channel assembly in vivo. We used TRPC isoform-specific antibodies to identify heterotypic TRPC interactions in rat brain. Our findings demonstrate a developmentally regulated expression of TRPC subunits. In prenatal brain, various endogenous TRPC heteromers were detected, including complexes containing TRPC3 or TRPC6 and the DAG-insensitive TRPC1, TRPC4, or TRPC5. When expressed heterologously, the formation of these TRPC complexes was critically dependent on the presence of TRPC1 in conjunction with TRPC4 or TRPC5. Cell Culture, Cloning, and Transfection—HM1 cells, a HEK 293 line stably expressing the muscarinic M1 receptor (22Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and HEK293T cells were used in this study. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and a hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT) supplement (1:100) (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the HM1 growth medium. The cDNAs for hTRPC1 (accession number U31110), hTRPC3 (NM 003305), mTRPC4 (U50921), mTRPC5 (AF029983), hTRPC6 (AF080394), eGFP (pGreenLantern, Invitrogen), and DsRed2 (pDsRed2-N1, BD Clontech) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. In biochemical co-expression experiments 5 μg of cDNA of each TRPC isoform was transfected per 10-cm plate of confluent cells. The total amount of transfected cDNA was adjusted to 15 μg by supplementing with empty vector. For electrophysiological and imaging experiments, cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of cDNA in 35-mm dishes and plated onto coverslips 12-24 h after transfection. Cells were used 24-48 h after plating. If not indicated otherwise, 0.4 μg of eGFP was co-transfected as an expression marker for patch clamp experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—For immunoprecipitation experiments, combinations of TRPCs were expressed in HEK293T cells for 48 h. Rat brain microsome preparation, protein solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and Western blots were performed essentially as described (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Brain microsomes were isolated from embryos (embryonic days 16-18) or 6 week-old rats. Antibodies—TRPC1 and TRPC5 antibodies were characterized previously (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against rat TRPC4 C-terminal amino acids 956-977 (23Philipp S. Trost C. Warnat J. Rautmann J. Himmerkus N. Schroth G. Kretz O. Nastainczyk W. Cavalie A. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23965-23972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and affinity purified. TRPC3 and TRPC6 antibodies were purchased from Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel. All antibodies used were tested by Western blot using TRPC1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 proteins expressed in HEK293T cells. All antibodies specifically recognized their antigenic proteins and did not cross-react with any of the tested TRPCs (data not shown). In experiments with brain microsomes, the specificity of the protein recognition on Western blot was confirmed by antibody pre-absorption with antigenic peptide. TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. Construction of TRPC5DN-eGFP—The full-length mTRPC5 cDNA was cloned into pIRES-eGFP (Clontech). Replacement of the TRPC5 stop codon with a NotI site and deletion of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence yielded a TRPC5-eGFP fusion protein containing a 10-amino acid linker (AAAGDPPVAT). The nonfunctional, dominant negative TRPC5-eGFP (TRPC5DN-GFP) was constructed by alanine replacement of a conserved LFW motif (amino acids 575-577) within the TRPC5 pore region. An insert containing the mutated residues was constructed by two-step PCR. Mutated fragments were amplified with primers F1 (5′-CCAAGCTGAAGGTGGCAATCAAATATC-3′)/R1mut (5′-GGAGGCCAAAGACAGACGCGGCGGCCGACTGAAGGGTTTC-3′) and F2mut (5′-GAAACCCTTCAGTCGGCCGCCGCGTCTGTCTTTGGCCTCC-3′)/R2 (5′-CTGCGGCCGCGAGCCGAGTTGTAACTTGTTCTTCCTGTC-3′). The fragments were then used as templates, and full-length inserts were made by PCR with primers F1/R2. The insert was cut with NheI/NotI and ligated to a corresponding fragment of TRPC5-eGFP. The identity of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Electrophysiology, Ca2+ Imaging, and Confocal Microscopy—Whole cell currents were recorded from eGFP- or eGFP/DsRed2-positive cells at room temperature with an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Patch pipettes with resistances of 2-5 megaohms in standard extracellular buffer were pulled from borosilicate glass. The holding potential was set to -70 mV, and currents were continuously sampled at 220 Hz. Currents during 160-ms voltage ramps from -100 to +60 mV were sampled with 6.6 kHz. All recordings were filtered at 1 kHz. Standard external buffer contained 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The standard pipette buffer contained 120 mm CsOH, 120 mm gluconic acid, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Cs4-BAPTA, and 10 mm HEPES, and pH was adjusted to 7.3 with gluconic acid. Free [Ca2+] was calculated to be ∼200 nm using the CaBuf program (G. Droogmans, Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium). Receptor-activated currents were elicited in HM1 cells by the application of 10 μm carbachol. The phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC from Clostridium perfringens used to raise intracellular DAG levels was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All statistical data is expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data groups contained only results from matched experimental series that were measured on the same day. Results were pooled and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. The significance level was set to p < 0.05. TRPC5DN-eGFP was visualized by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 410 (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and emission light was collected through a 512-nm bandpass filter. For calcium imaging experiments, cells were transfected with 3 μg of TRPC5DN-eGFP, 0.8 μg of TRPC3, and 1.5 μg of TRPC1 or 1.5 μg of LacZ, respectively. Imaging was performed with a standard cooled CCD camera system. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence ratios (340/380 nm) were sampled at >510 nm. Differential Expression of TRPC Subunits in Embryonic and Adult Brains—Subunit interactions require spatial and temporal overlap of the expression of the potential interaction partners. Although mRNA for all TRPC isoforms can be found in brain (4Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), the temporal expression pattern of TRPC proteins has only begun to be examined. Rat brain TRPC3 protein was expressed only within a narrow temporal window between embryonic day 18 and postnatal day 20 (24Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), suggesting that TRPC channel subunit composition might also be developmentally regulated. Here we compare the expression of TRPC proteins in the brain of embryonic (embryonic day 18) and adult (postnatal days 40-45) rats. All proteins tested (TRPC1, 3-6) were recognized by Western blot in embryonic brain preparations. In adult brain TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5, proteins were detected only at significantly lower levels than in embryonic brain tissue (Fig. 1). We were not able to detect TRPC3 and TRPC6 in adult brain. Hence, membranes from embryonic tissue were used for further experiments. Identification of TRPC Heteromers in Embryonic Brain—To investigate possible interactions of TRPC isoforms between the TRPC1, 4, and 5 and the TRPC3, 6, and 7 subfamilies, we immunoprecipitated proteins from solubilized rat brain membranes with anti-TRPC1, anti-TRPC4, or anti-TRPC5 antibodies and probed the immunoprecipitates with anti-TRPC1 as well as anti-TRPC3 and anti-TRPC6 antibodies (Fig. 2A). In these experiments, TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 were consistently detected in TRPC4 and TRPC5 immunoprecipitates from embryonic brain. Immunoprecipitates from adult brain did not contain detectable TRPC3 or TRPC6 (Fig. 2A). Notably, this lack of TRPC3 and TRPC6 was not due to low expression levels of the immunoprecipitated subunits, because comparable amounts of TRPC1, 4, and 5 were precipitated from embryonic and adult brain (Fig. 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation of the TRPC subunits was not the result of nonspecific binding, because TRPC3 and TRPC6 were not detected in anti-TRPC1, anti-TRPC4, or anti-TRPC5 precipitates from cells expressing TRPC3 or TRPC6 (Fig. 3). These interactions suggest that TRPC3 and TRPC6 form molecular complexes with TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 in embryonic brain.Fig. 3Combination of TRPC1 with TRPC4 or TRPC5 enables assembly with TRPC3 and TRPC6. TRPC4 or TRPC5 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells with TRPC3 (A) or TRPC6 (B) with or without additional co-expression of TRPC1. Protein expression was labeled as “+” below the respective column. Cell lysates were precipitated with TRPC4 or TRPC5 antibody, and immunoprecipitates (IP) were probed on Western blots (WB) with anti-TRPC1, anti-TRPC3, or anti-TRPC6. Immunoprecipitates were also probed with anti-TRPC4 or anti-TRPC5 to demonstrate equal precipitation of TRPC4 or TRPC5 from TRPC1-expressing and -nonexpressing cells. Cell lysate samples contained 1/12 of the lysate used for immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reconstitution of Inter-subfamily Subunit Interactions in Vitro—This finding was somewhat surprising, because previous work in heterologous systems has demonstrated that only TRPC subunits from the same subfamily (i.e. TRPC1, 4, and 5 or TRPC3, 6, and 7) form molecular complexes with each other (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested the interaction of recombinant TRPC isoforms expressed in HEK293T cells and found that, in agreement with this previous work, TRPC3 did not co-immunoprecipitate with TRPC4 or TRPC5 (Fig. 3A). TRPC6 interacted very weakly with TRPC4 and not at all with TRPC5 (Fig. 3B). We hypothesized that an additional protein(s) missing in the heterologous system linked TRPC4 and TRPC5 with TRPC3 and TRPC6 subunits in neurons. A candidate for this function was TRPC1. We have shown earlier that TRPC1 co-assembled with TRPC4 and TRPC5 in rat brain as well as in expression systems (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). TRPC1 had also been reported to bind to TRPC3 subunits in vitro (15Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 25Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the latter interaction was not confirmed by other studies (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 21Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether TRPC1 was able to tether DAG-sensitive and -insensitive TRPC subunits in heteromeric complexes. When TRPC1 was co-expressed in addition to combinations of TRPC4 or 5 and TRPC3 or 6, we observed the formation of mixed heteromers containing DAG-sensitive and -insensitive subunits (Fig. 3). The weak interaction of TRPC6 and TRPC4 was significantly enhanced by TRPC1 co-expression (Fig. 3). Therefore, TRPC1 could reconstitute the subunit interactions found in rat brain in heterologous cells. In light of the contradictory reports on the ability of TRPC1 to bind DAG-sensitive TRPCs, we next examined the hypothesis that TRPC1 acts as a universal mediator of TRPC subunit interactions. Therefore, TRPC1 was transfected with either TRPC3 or TRPC6 in HEK293T cells, and the formation of heteromeric complexes was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. TRPC3 or TRPC6 were not detected in TRPC1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4), making it unlikely that TRPC1 represents a simple linker with binding affinity to TRPC4 and 5 as well as to TRPC3 and 6 isoforms. Functional Assessment of TRPC Interactions—Physical interactions between TRPC subunits can result in the formation of channel pores with novel properties. To test this possibility, we studied whole cell currents in HM1 cells co-transfected with different combination of TRPC subunits. Channels of the TRPC1, 4, and 5 and also the TRPC3, 6, and 7 subfamily respond to activation of PLCβ (6Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G.

In cells co-expressing TRPC1, 3, and 5, stimulation of PLCβ by the muscarinic agonist carbachol elicited outwardly rectifying currents that were almost identical to TRPC(1+5) (Fig. 5A). However, current rectification in triple (TRPC1, 3, and 5) transfected cells was less pronounced than in TRPC(1+5), allowing significantly larger currents in the inward direction (Fig. 5B). To test whether the TRPC3 subunit could confer DAG sensitivity to channel heteromers in TRPC1-, 3-, and 5-transfected cells, we raised the intracellular DAG concentration by application of bacterial phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (10 units/ml) (26Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This procedure robustly activated TRPC3 and TRPC6 homomeric channels in HM1 cells. 2C. Strübing, unpublished data. Unlike the effect of carbachol, stimulation of triple transfected cells with phosphatidylcholine-PLC did not produce outwardly rectifying currents but rather activated small currents reminiscent of TRPC3 (27Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strübing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We assumed that the phosphatidylcholine-PLC-induced current was due to a fraction of TRPC3 subunits that still assembled into TRPC3 homomeric channels under our conditions. This notion is supported by the incomplete suppression of TRPC3 activity in the presence of TRPC1 and a dominant negative TRPC5 (see below). To further test the hypothesis that TRPC3 subunits form heteromeric pores with TRPC1 and 5, we studied the effect of a dominant negative TRPC5 subunit on channel formation. This approach relies on the finding that integration of one TRPC subunit with a mutated pore region renders the resulting heteromer nonfunctional (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). A dominant negative TRPC6 protein was generated by Hofmann et al. (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) by the mutation of three conserved amino acids in the TRPC6 pore domain. We introduced analogous mutations in TRPC5 that was tagged at the C terminus with eGFP to generate TRPC5DN-eGFP. Whereas TRPC5-eGFP yielded currents indistinguishable from wild type TRPC5, no significant currents were elicited after the expression of TRPC5DN-eGFP (Fig. 6). The pore mutations did not affect membrane targeting of TRPC5DN-eGFP (Fig. 6, inset). When TRPC5DN-eGFP was co-expressed with TRPC5 or TRPC4, current densities of wild-type currents were reduced significantly (Fig. 7A). This demonstrates that TRPC5DN-eGFP formed multimers with TRPC5 as well as TRPC4 and conferred a dominant negative effect on TRPC4 and TRPC5 channel function. In contrast, co-expression of TRPC5DN-eGFP with TRPC3 had no significant effect on TRPC3 currents (Fig. 7A). An effect of TRPC5DN-eGFP on TRPC1 could not be tested because TRPC1, as shown previously (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), did not give rise to detectable receptor or store-operated currents in HM1 cells.Fig. 7Functional effect of TRPC5DN-eGFP on TRPC channel isoforms. A, co-expression of TRPC5DN-eGFP decreased whole cell TRPC5 and TRPC4 but not TRPC3 currents. TRPC5DN-eGFP (3 μg) was co-transfected with 0.8 μg of TRPC5, TRPC4, or TRPC3. Densities of carbachol-induced whole cell currents were measured at -70 mV and normalized to the current densities in control cells transfected with 0.8 μg of TRPC5, TRPC4, or TRPC3 and 3 μg of eGFP. TRPC5DN-eGFP significantly decreased the current density in TRPC5- (**, p < 0.01) and TRPC4-expressing (*, p < 0.05) HM1 cells. The number of cells measured in each group for control and TRPC5DN-eGFP transfected cells is given in parentheses. B, reduction of carbachol-induced currents in TRPC1 and TRPC3 co-expressing cells by TRPC5DN-eGFP. Densities of carbachol-stimulated whole cell currents were measured in HM1 cells at -70 mV. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of TRPC5DN-eGFP, 0.8 μg of TRPC3, and 1.5 μg of TRPC1 in the given combinations plus 0.3 μg of DsRed2 as a transfection marker. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 5.6 μg with eGFP. Current densities of the control groups (open bars) were normalized to 100%. In cells expressing the combination TRPC5DN-eGFP/TRPC1/TRPC3, current densities were significantly smaller (*, p < 0.05) than in cells expressing TRPC5DN-eGFP and TRPC3. The number of cells measured in each group is noted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although TRPC5DN-eGFP alone did not reduce TRPC3 currents, concomitant overexpression of TRPC1 and TRPC5DN-eGFP led to reduced TRPC3 currents (Fig. 7B). TRPC1 had no inhibitory effect per se, as TRPC3 current densities were not different in cells co-transfected with either TRPC1 or eGFP (Fig. 7B). TRPC1-mediated suppression by TRPC5DN was not the result of decreased expression or mislocalization of TRPC3 protein. When a TRPC3-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein was co-transfected with non-fluorescent TRPC5DN and TRPC1 or an equal amount of LacZ, cDNA membrane localization (determined as ratio of intracellular versus peripheral mean pixel intensity values) as well as total mean fluorescence intensities were unchanged (p > 0.05; n, >30 for each group; Supplemental Fig. 1, which is available in the on-line version of this article). To further control for nonspecific effects of differential TRPC subunit expression on PLC-mediated signaling, we measured carbachol-induced Ca2+ release in Fura-2/AM-loaded HM1 cells. Changes in fluorescence ratios (ΔR/R 0) were not significantly different between cells co-transfected with TRPC3, TRPC5DN-eGFP plus LacZ (ΔR/R 0 = 158% ± 12%; n = 31), and cells transfected with TRPC1 instead of LacZ (ΔR/R 0 = 173% ± 10%; n = 28). Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that TRPC1 linked TRPC5DN-eGFP and TRPC3 in a molecular complex. In this study we identified novel heterotypic TRPC channel oligomers in rat embryonic brain and delineated a new principle of TRPC channel assembly in vivo. Evidence suggests that all TRPCs can form functional homomeric channels. These channels, however, may represent only a minority of endogenous TRPC complexes, considering the number of channels that can arise from the combination of different TRPC subunits. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements with fluorescently labeled TRPC subunits overexpressed in heterologous cells showed that TRPCs assemble only within their structural subfamilies, i.e. TRPC1, 4, and 5 versus TRPC3, 6, and 7. Mouse TRPC2 was unable to form complexes with any of the other TRPCs (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although there is little data on co-expression of native TRPC proteins in single cells, partially overlapping expression of TRPC subunits was detected in various brain areas; e.g. high levels of TRPC1, 3, and 5 mRNA were found in cerebellum (28Riccio A. Medhurst A.D. Mattei C. Kelsell R.E. Calver A.R. Randall A.D. Benham C.D. Pangalos M.N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Moreover, cultured hippocampal neurons express TRPC1 (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), TRPC5 (29Greka A. Navarro B. Oancea E. Duggan A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and TRPC6 3G. Krapivinsky, unpublished data. proteins. Thus, selective co-assembly of TRPC subunits may occur in discrete brain regions. Using microsomes from whole embryonic brain, we showed that complexes containing one of the DAG-responsive TRPCs (TRPC3 or 6) along with TRPC1, 4, or 5 exist in mammalian brain. The formation of mixed heteromers is likely to require additional cofactors, because co-immunoprecipitation studies with various combinations of pairwise co-expressed TRPC isoforms confirmed that only intra-subfamily interactions occur under these conditions. Our experiments revealed that combining three different subunits, including TRPC1, TRPC4, or TRPC5 and TRPC3 or TRPC6 led to the co-assembly of DAG-sensitive and -insensitive TRPCs. Thus, we were able to reconstitute subunit interactions that were also detected in brain. Although Hofmann et al. (20Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) did not study TRPC complexes in brain, they showed that TRPC6 is excluded from TRPC(1+4) assemblies based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments with tagged TRPC1A (a TRPC1 splice variant), TRPC4, and TRPC6. We expressed unspliced TRPC1 and used antibodies against native TRPC proteins for in vitro co-immunoprecipitations. Hence, different detection sensitivities or variant-dependent protein interactions may account for the conflicting experimental observations. Functional co-expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC5 in HM1 cells gave rise to M1-receptor-activated currents that were similar but not identical to currents through heteromeric TRPC(1+5) channels. Most importantly currents in triple-transfected cells were significantly less outwardly rectifying than TRPC(1+5) currents. The unique current-voltage relation of the mixed TRPC heteromers will specifically modulate the activation threshold and, thus, the firing pattern of neurons expressing these channels. The TRPC(1+5) current-voltage relation exhibits a negative slope at hyperpolarized potentials. Depolarization over this range leads to further increases in inward (depolarizing) current, similar to the behavior of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel. The TRPC(1+5) channel will be excitatory preferentially at depolarized potentials and may play a role as a coincidence detector, preferentially enhancing depolarizing inputs. The TRPC(1+3+5) channel, on the other hand, provides inward current even at very hyperpolarized potentials. We hypothesize that mixed channel heteromers containing all three TRPC subunits assembled in HM1 cells. This assumption is supported by the finding that suppression of TRPC3 currents by TRPC5DN required co-expression of TRPC1. Moreover, the presence of TRPC1 as well as TRPC4 or TRPC5 was necessary for the association with TRPC3 or TRPC6. Because neither TRPC1 nor TRPC4 or 5 alone associated with TRPC3 or 6, we propose two potential models for heteromer formation. First, the TRPC1 + TRPC4/TRPC1 + TRPC5 interaction allosterically modifies TRPC(1+4)/TRPC(1+5) heteromers to produce a binding site for TRPC3 or TRPC6. Alternatively, the formation of TRPC(1+4/5+3/6) heteromers requires simultaneous binding of a DAG-sensitive subunit to TRPC1 and TRPC4 or 5. Based on the assumption that TRPC are tetramers, sequential or concurrent interaction with a fourth subunit will be required to form a functional channel complex. Elucidation of the exact subunit stoichiometry of the mixed TRPC heteromers will involve further biochemical analysis of native channel complexes. The finding that synaptosomes from adult rat brain did not contain mixed TRPC heteromers (21Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) raises further interesting questions, namely whether various sets of TRPCs exist in different cellular compartments and how the channel complexes are sorted and localized. At present there is little information about the subcellular distribution of TRPC channels in neurons. The only subunit examined in this regard is TRPC1 that was detected in cell bodies as well as processes of primary hippocampal neurons (16Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It is an exciting possibility that particular TRPC1-containing heteromers may localize to synapses whereas others do not. Preliminary experiments revealed TRPC6 immunoreactivity in the cell bodies and processes of embryonic hippocampal neurons, 3G. Krapivinsky, unpublished data. further supporting the notion that TRPCs subunits are not restricted to synapses in immature neurons. The developmental control of TRP channel assembly and localization is only beginning to be examined. Although their expression levels are generally lower in adult versus embryonic brain, TRPC proteins can still be detected in mature neuronal tissue and might be enriched at synapses (21Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mixed TRPC heteromers, however, are not present or expressed only at undetectable levels in adult brain. This developmental regulation may reflect specialized functions of these TRP channels subtypes, e.g. in neuronal growth, pathfinding, and differentiation. Our findings provide new details on the assembly and composition of native TRPC complexes. Such information is essential for the reconstitution of these channels in expression systems and for a better understanding of TRPC function and regulation in vivo. We thank Drs. Lutz Birnbaumer, Thomas Gudermann, Yasuo Mori, Michael Schäfer, and Günter Schultz for kindly providing TRPC1 and 3, TRPC3-YFP, TRPC5, and TRPC4 cDNAs, respectively.

We investigated neural mechanisms of such goal-based action selection. We trained monkeys on a task in which the relation between visual cues, action types, and reward conditions changed regularly, such that the monkeys selected their actions based on anticipated reward conditions. A significant number of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex were activated, after cue presentation and before motor execution, only by particular action-reward combinations.

As the sepsis syndrome results from the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, we postulated that heme oxygenase-1 and its enzymatic product CO would protect against lethality in a murine model of sepsis. Mice treated with a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequently exposed to inhaled CO had significantly better survival and lower serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β levels than their untreated counterparts. In vitro, mouse macrophages exposed to LPS and CO had significantly attenuated IL-6 production; this effect was concentration-dependent and occurred at a transcriptional level.

Electrophoretic mobility supershift assay indicated that the JunB, JunD, and c-Fos components of AP-1 were particularly affected. Upstream of AP-1, CO decreased JNK phosphorylation in murine macrophages and lung endothelial cells. Mice deficient in the JNK pathway had decreased serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in response to LPS compared with control mice, and no effect of CO on these cytokine levels was seen in Jnk1 or Jnk2 genedeleted mice.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; AP-1, activator protein-1; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. is a microsomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of heme, generating biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). Induction of HO-1 has been reported in response to a wide variety of oxidant stimuli, and this enzyme is a vital component of cellular adaptation to stress. There is growing interest in the role of CO in the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective function of HO-1. It has recently been demonstrated that the administration of exogenous CO inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α while increasing interleukin (IL)-10 production both in vitro and in vivo (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). This effect is independent of the guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway, and at least in the case of tumor necrosis factor-α, the effect is post-transcriptional. More recently, Fujita et al. (2Fujita T. Toda K. Karimova A. Yan S.F. Naka Y. Yet S.F. Pinsky D.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhaled CO can rescue HO-1-deficient mice from lethal ischemic lung injury, further strengthening the paradigm of CO as a direct mediator of cellular protection. The sepsis syndrome is the leading cause of death in intensive care units in the United States, and its incidence continues to rise. Despite an increasing incidence, little impact on associated mortality rates has been made over the past several decades (3Friedman G. Silva E. Vincent J.L. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 26: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that invading microorganisms induce the release of a large number of humoral and cellular pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (4Wenzel R.P. Pinsky M.R. Ulevitch R.J. Young L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 22: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Elevated plasma concentrations of a variety of cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, and IL-6 have been described in septic patients (5Arnalich F. Garcia-Palomero E.

Am. 1999; 13: 413-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). IL-6 is one of the most reliably elevated markers in sepsis (7Selberg O. Hecker H. Martin M. Klos A. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: 2793-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and one of the few serum markers that has a demonstrable correlation with mortality rates in humans (8Spittler A. Razenberger M. Kupper H. Kaul M. Hackl W. Boltz-Nitulescu G. Fugger R. Roth E. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: 1338-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Knowing the anti-inflammatory effects of CO, we hypothesized that CO would protect against lethality in an animal model of sepsis. We further postulated that modulation of IL-6 production may contribute to the salutary effects of CO. We tested these hypotheses using a model of LPS-induced sepsis syndrome. Animals—Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME); male Jnk1 –/– and Jnk2 –/– mice and the corresponding control mice were generated as previously described (9Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Mice were allowed to acclimate for 1 week with rodent chow and water ad libitum. Cell Culture Experiments—RAW 264.7 mouse peritoneal macrophages and MH-S mouse alveolar macrophages were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Both cell types were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air with or without additional CO as described below. Cell culture experiments were conducted in triplicate. Stable Cell Transfection—RAW 264.7 cells were stably transfected with a pSFFV/HO-1 plasmid construct as previously described (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). IL-6 Promoter Constructs—The IL-6 promoter constructs were kindly provided by Drs. Alaina J. Ammit (Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia) and Oliver Eikelberg (Giessen University School of Medicine, Giessen, Germany). The 651-bp fragment of the human IL-6 promoter was subcloned (5′-KpnI, 3′-XhoI) into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter gene vector plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to give the parental pIL6-luc651 construct. Within pIL6-luc651, consensus transcription factor-binding sites were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, including AP-1, C/EBP-β, and NF-κB as previously described (10Ammit A.J. Lazaar A.L.

Transient Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfection of RAW 264.7 cells was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated onto 12-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/plate for 18 h and then transfected with 600 ng of IL-6 construct as well as 30 ng of pRL-TK control vector (Promega) to normalize transfection efficiencies. Following transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h and then treated with 1 μg/ml LPS. Cells were harvested after 8 h, and luciferase activity was assessed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Carbon Monoxide Exposures—Mice or macrophages were exposed to compressed air with varying concentrations of CO (0–500 ppm). For cell culture experiments, the atmosphere included 5% CO2 for adjustment of pH. Details of CO administration have been previously described (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Animal Experiments—Mice were exposed to 250 ppm CO or room air for 1 h prior to intraperitoneal administration of LPS, Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8 (Sigma). In lethality experiments, a dose of 40 mg/kg LPS was administered, and animals were returned to the exposure chamber until 48 h had elapsed or until death had ensued; the time of death was recorded. In cytokine experiments, 1 mg/kg LPS was administered by intraperitoneal injection, and blood was collected after 5 h; the animals were killed at this time. Cytokine Analysis—Serum and media samples were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 macrophages using TRIzol lysis buffer (Invitrogen), followed by chloroform extraction. The details of this technique have been previously described (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to LPS (1 mg/ml) alone or ambient CO (250 ppm) as described above. Nuclei were extracted as previously described (12Camhi S.L. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Chin B.Y. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus transcription factor-binding site for AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) was purchased from Promega. Labeling and DNA binding reactions were performed as previously described (12Camhi S.L. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Chin B.Y. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the supershift assay, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against c-Jun (sc-44 and sc-1694), JunB, JunD, and c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated with samples after the initial binding reaction between nuclear protein extracts and the consensus oligonucleotide. Western Analysis of JNK Phosphorylation—Assay kits were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used following the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences in measured variables between the experimental and control groups were assessed with Student's t test, except for the analysis of dose response, which was done using analysis of variance and Bonferroni's correction. Statistical difference was accepted at p < 0.05. CO Protects against Lethality in a Mouse Model of the Sepsis Syndrome—We used a murine LPS model to assess the effect of inhaled low dose CO on survival. C57BL/6 mice were treated with a lethal dose of intraperitoneal LPS and subsequently exposed to 250 ppm CO or ambient air. As shown in Fig. 1, the CO-treated animals had significantly better survival than their untreated counterparts. A low dose of CO is thus able to rescue animals from lethality due to LPS. CO Modulates Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Levels in Vivo—As inflammatory cytokines are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of the sepsis syndrome, we chose to study the effects of CO on cytokine production in our murine model. It has previously been demonstrated by our laboratory (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar) that CO attenuates LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α and augments the production of IL-10 in vivo. To assess whether the effect of CO extends to IL-6 and IL-1β, we administered a sublethal dose of LPS (1 mg/kg) to mice in the presence or absence of inhaled CO (250 ppm). Mice treated with CO had lower serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1β 5 h after LPS injection than control mice as measured by ELISA (Fig. 2). HO-1 and CO Decrease IL-6 Expression in Vitro—To confirm the effect of CO on IL-6 in vitro, we exposed two cell lines of mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 and MH-S) to 1 μg/ml LPS in the presence or absence of CO and assessed IL-6 production by ELISA. No IL-6 was detectable in the cell medium from untreated macrophages or from macrophages treated with CO alone. Cells exposed to LPS had an elevated level of IL-6 in the medium after 5 h, but this increase in IL-6 was significantly attenuated by exposure to CO (Fig. 3, A and B). The effect of CO was dose-dependent over a range of 50–500 ppm (Fig. 3C). To determine whether increased intracellular CO production would have the same effect as exogenously administered CO, we exposed a macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) overexpressing HO-1 to 1 μg/ml LPS and assayed for IL-6 by ELISA. The control cells were transfected with the neomycin gene. The control cells exhibited a much greater increase in IL-6 levels than did the HO-1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that augmented intracellular CO production has an effect similar to that of exogenous administration of CO. CO Suppresses IL-6 mRNA Expression in RAW 264.7 Macrophages—We assessed the expression of IL-6 mRNA in RAW 264.7 macrophages exposed to 1 μg/ml LPS in the presence or absence of CO. Cells were harvested 5 h after LPS treatment for RNA extraction and analysis by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, the untreated cells and those treated with CO alone did not have detectable IL-6 mRNA by Northern blotting. LPS caused a large increase in IL-6 mRNA production, and this was abrogated by treatment with CO. This demonstrates that CO affects IL-6 production in RAW 264.7 cells at a transcriptional level. CO Exerts Its Greatest Effect via AP-1—Regulation of IL-6 gene expression is controlled by the binding of transcription factors to known consensus sequences within the promoter region, including binding sites for AP-1, NF-κB, or C/EBP-β (10Ammit A.J. Lazaar A.L. Irani C. O'Neill G.M. Gordon N.D. Amrani Y. Penn R.B. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To identify which cis-regulatory sequences might be responsible for down-regulation of IL-6 by CO, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant constructs of the human IL-6 promoter bound to a luciferase reporter. Four promoter constructs were used, three with site-directed mutations in the AP-1-, NF-κB-, or C/EBP-β-binding sequence and a parental construct. Luciferase activity was induced by LPS treatment of cells transfected with all mutant constructs to at least the same level as the parental construct. CO treatment decreased luciferase activity to a significant degree in all constructs except the AP-1 mutant construct (Fig. 5). CO Attenuates AP-1 Binding in Vitro—To confirm that CO can inhibit the activation of AP-1, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with LPS alone or with LPS and CO (250 ppm). Cells were harvested 30 min after LPS treatment. As shown in Fig. 6, this concentration of CO was capable of attenuating LPS-stimulated AP-1 binding in macrophages. To assess the specificity of the AP-1 complex and to identify the contributing family members, supershift experiments were carried out by adding antibodies against c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and c-Fos to the nuclear extracts before EMSA. Protein-antibody recognition can be visualized by a decrease in the mobility of the DNA-protein complex and a diminution of the AP-1 complex. Fig. 7 indicates that the AP-1 complex consists mainly of c-Fos and, to a lesser extent, JunB and JunD. Correspondingly, treatment of cells with CO appears to affect c-Fos to the greatest extent and JunB and JunD to a lesser extent. CO Inhibits JNK Phosphorylation after Stimulation with LPS—The involvement of AP-1 in the inhibition of IL-6 production prompted us to ask whether the JNK pathway might also be involved. To test this hypothesis, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and exposed to either CO (250 ppm) or ambient air as described above. Cells were collected at times from 0 min to 3 h for Western blot analysis of JNK phosphorylation. JNK phosphorylation was increased by stimulation with LPS; this effect was maximum at 15 min and declined thereafter. JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by CO treatment (Fig. 8) at early time points (5 and 15 min), but this effect was lost by 30 min. The 1- and 3-h time points are not shown, but CO had no effect on JNK phosphorylation at these times. Deletion of the Jnk1 or Jnk2 Gene Inhibits IL-1 and IL-6 Production in Vivo—To investigate whether the JNK pathway may mediate the effect of CO on LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-1 production, we used mice deficient in either the Jnk1 or Jnk2 gene. Each gene is capable of making various isoforms of JNK, which are produced through alternate splicing, but the effect of single gene deletion is a decrease in total JNK activity (13Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The effect of Jnk1 deletion on overall JNK function has been shown to be greater than that of Jnk2 deletion (14Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). The control, Jnk1 –/–, and Jnk2 –/– mice were injected with a non-lethal dose of LPS, and cytokine levels were measured at time 0, 1 h, and 5 h in the presence or absence of CO. IL-1β levels were significantly higher in the control mice than in either the Jnk1 –/– or Jnk2 –/– mice at 1 h, but by 5 h, this difference no longer existed. At the 5-h time point, however, the CO-treated wild-type mice had significantly lower levels of IL-1β than the control mice (as previously described), but CO had no effect on IL-β levels in the Jnk1 –/– and Jnk2 –/– mice (Fig. 9A). Similarly, IL-6 (which is slower to increase after LPS injection compared with IL-1β) was significantly less in the Jnk1 –/– and Jnk2 –/– mice than in the control mice at 5 h, and there was no effect of CO on the levels of IL-6 in the Jnk1 –/– and Jnk2 –/– mice (Fig. 9B). This indicates not only that the JNK pathway is involved in the production of IL-1β and IL-6 in response to LPS, but that the attenuation of this pathway diminishes or abrogates the effect of CO. Deletion of the Jnk1 Gene Abrogates the Survival Effect of CO in Response to a Lethal Dose of LPS—To determine whether deletion of the Jnk1 gene affects survival in response to LPS, these mice were injected with a lethal dose of LPS and subsequently exposed to room air or CO (250 ppm). At 24 h, the average length of survival was 28–29 h in both groups (Fig. 10), indicating that CO had no effect on survival. Interestingly, the Jnk1 –/– mice had a longer survival than the wild-type mice shown in Fig. 1. The sepsis syndrome remains the leading cause of death in intensive care units in the United States, and efforts to impact mortality have been largely unsuccessful (3Friedman G. Silva E. Vincent J.L. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 26: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Evidence from human and animal studies demonstrates that HO-1 is induced by sepsis, and this induction confers a survival advantage. Both increased carboxyhemoglobin concentration and increased breath CO excretion have been observed in patients with sepsis (15Moncure M. Brathwaite C.E.M. Samaha E. Marburger R. Ross S.E. J. Trauma. 1999; 46: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Zegdi R. Perrin D. Burdin M. Boiteau R. Tenaillon A. Int. Care Med. 2002; 28: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Bacterial LPS administration to rats induces HO-1 expression (17Otani K. Shimizu S. Chijiiwa K. Morisaki T. Yamaguchi T. Yamaguchi K. Kuroki S. Tanaka M. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2000; 45: 2313-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock, induction of HO-1 has been shown to be protective and inhibition of HO-1 deleterious (18Tamion F. Richard V. Bonmarchand G. Leroy J. Lebreton J.P. Thuillez C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, in a murine cecal ligation model, inhibition of HO-1 leads to increased mortality (19Downard P.J. Wilson M.A. Spain D.A. Matheson P.J. Siow Y. Garrison R.N. J. Surg. Res. 1997; 71: 7-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HO-1 provides cellular protection remains a subject of avid investigation; all of the products of heme catabolism have been implicated, including bilirubin, ferritin (stimulated by the release of iron), and CO (20Oberle S. Schwartz P. Abate A. Schroder H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Yesilkaya A. Altinayak R. Korgun D.K. Gen.

Here, we have examined the effect of exogenously administered CO in a murine LPS model of septic shock and have shown that CO reduces mortality. There is a well described correlation between serum IL-6 levels and poor outcome in sepsis (8Spittler A. Razenberger M. Kupper H. Kaul M. Hackl W. Boltz-Nitulescu G. Fugger R. Roth E. Clin. Infect.

Care Med. 2001; 27: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and increased IL-6 is an independent predictor of survival in human sepsis (27Rodriguez-Gaspar M. Santolaria F. Jarque-Lopez A. Gonzalez-Reimers E. Milena A. de la Vega M.J. Rodriguez-Rodriguez E. Gomez-Sirvent J.L. Cytokine. 2001; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In our mouse model, serum IL-6 and IL-1β were markedly attenuated by exogenous CO administration. The low cytokine levels could result from any indirect action of CO that improves the pathophysiology of sepsis, but our in vitro data suggest that CO has a direct effect on cytokine production. The attenuation of IL-6 production by exogenous CO in vitro occurred even at very low concentrations of CO (50 ppm). For comparison, this concentration of CO is close to the levels that can routinely be measured in the exhaled breath of healthy individuals who smoke (30 ppm) (28Haustein K.O. Krause J. Haustein H. Rasmussen T. Cort N. J. Int. Med. 2002; 252: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using Northern blotting, we have shown that the in vitro attenuation of LPS-induced IL-6 production occurs at a transcriptional level. Our study using IL-6 promoter constructs with mutations at each of three transcription factor-binding sites (NF-κB, AP-1, and C/EBP) suggests that the primary action of CO may be through modulation of AP-1. This interpretation must be made cautiously, however, as mutation of any single binding site had no effect on the overall level of promoter stimulation by LPS, implying that no single transcription factor is absolutely required for IL-6 induction in response to LPS. Also, there was a trend toward decreased IL-6 promoter activity after treatment with CO even in the AP-1 mutant construct, suggesting that inhibition of AP-1 binding may not wholly account for the effect of CO. Inhibition of NF-κB binding by CO has previously been reported (29Sarady J.K. Otterbein S.L. Liu F. Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but our IL-6 promoter data suggest that this is not a major factor in our particular model. We have shown that the particular AP-1 components affected by CO include JunB, JunD, and c-Fos. Other investigators have shown that IL-10 inhibits IL-6 transcription in human monocytes via inhibition of AP-1-binding activity and reduced expression of c-Fos (30Dokter W.H. Koopmans S.B. Vellenga F. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1996; 10: 1308-1316PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of the results of that study to our findings is intriguing given the recent report that HO-1 mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 in mice (31Lee T.S. Chau L.Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is activated by cellular stress and is intimately linked with the regulation of AP-1 transcription activity. Ventura et al. (32Ventura J.-J. Kennedy N.J. Lamb J.A. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) recently reported that the JNK pathway is required for the regulation of AP-1 activity by tumor necrosis factor. Activated JNK is capable of binding the NH2-terminal activation domain of c-Jun, activating AP-1 by phosphorylating its component c-Jun. AP-1 can then translocate into the nucleus to promote transcription of downstream genes (33Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The association of JNK with AP-1, along with the previous implication of the JNK pathway in the down-regulation of macrophage cytokines by heat shock (34Wang Y. Li C. Wang X. Zhang J. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 269: 742-748Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), made the JNK signaling cascade an attractive candidate as a target for CO. We have shown that, in a mouse macrophage cell line, CO can inhibit LPS-stimulated JNK activation at early time points. JNK activation began to decline between 15 and 30 min after LPS stimulation, implying that, in our in vitro system, cellular events mediated by JNK result from an early and non-sustained activation of this pathway. Our studies using Jnk gene-deleted mice suggest that the effect of CO on the JNK pathway is functionally significant, even if it is not sustained over time in vitro. The mice we used are deficient in either the Jnk1 or Jnk2 gene; deletion of both genes is embryonically lethal (14Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Although JNK activity is not completely abolished in these mice, it is considerably diminished, and the Jnk1 deletion has been shown to have a more profound effect on total JNK activity than the Jnk2 deletion (14Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Both Jnk1 –/– and Jnk2 –/– mice exhibited low levels of IL-1β in response to LPS stimulation at 1 h, but the levels rose to those of the control mice after 5 h. The rise in IL-1β to more normal levels may be due to the fact that JNK activity is not completely absent, and other stress-induced signaling pathways are intact in these mice. The IL-6 levels were not elevated in either the control or gene-deleted mice at 1 h, but at 5 h, the wild-type mice had higher levels of IL-6 than either the Jnk1 –/– or Jnk2 –/– mice. More interestingly, the Jnk1 –/– and Jnk2 –/– mice did not respond to exogenous CO in the same way as the wild-type mice; the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were not affected by CO in these mice. The effect of CO in prolonging survival was not seen in the Jnk1 –/– mice either, and their length of survival at base line was increased compared with C57BL/6 mice. The results of these experiments with Jnk-deficient mice suggest that CO involves the JNK pathway in the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production. There have been no previous studies linking CO to the JNK pathway. Prior publications have demonstrated an in vitro effect of CO on the p38 MAPK pathway (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar, 35Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M. Soares M.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). (Importantly, these studies did not examine time points as early as 15 or 30 min after cell stimulation.) It is likely that CO has effects on multiple signaling pathways in various models, and as noted above, our results do not eliminate the possible involvement of alternative transcription factors and signaling pathways. Our data implicating the JNK pathway do, however, represent a novel insight into the mechanism of CO effects in biological systems. In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time a protective role for low concentration inspired CO in a murine model of sepsis and have shown that this is associated with decreased production of IL-1β and IL-6 in vivo and in vitro. We have also presented evidence that the effect of CO involves the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway. We speculate that decreased LPS-mediated activation of JNK/AP-1 in the presence of CO leads to a dampening effect on inflammatory cytokine production and protection against sepsis. We thank Drs. Oliver Eikelberg and Alaina J. Ammit for generously donating the IL-6 promoter constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2125481927,"Forkhead transcription factors of the FoxO-group are associated with cellular processes like cell cycle progression and DNA-repair. FoxO function is regulated by protein kinase B (PKB) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB survival pathway. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in specific PKB phosphorylation motifs leads to exclusion of FoxO-proteins from the nucleus, which excludes them from exerting transactivating activity. Members of the FoxO-group have three highly conserved regions containing a PKB phosphorylation motif. This study describes the cloning and characterization of a novel forkhead domain gene from mouse that appeared to be highly related to the FoxO group of transcription factors and was therefore designated FoxO6. The FoxO6 gene was mapped in region D1 on mouse chromosome 4. In humans, FOXO6 is located on chromosomal region 1p34.1. Embryonic expression of FoxO6 is most apparent in the developing brain, and FoxO6 is expressed in a specific temporal and spatial pattern. Therefore it is probably involved in regulation of specific cellular differentiation. In the adult animal FoxO6 expression is maintained in areas of the nucleus accumbens, cingulate cortex, parts of the amygdala, and in the hippocampus. Structure function analysis of FoxO6 compared with its group members shows that the overall homology is high, but surprisingly a highly conserved region containing multiple phosphorylation sites is lacking. In transfection studies, FoxO6 coupled to GFP showed an unexpected high nuclear localization after stimulation with growth factors, in contrast to the predominant cytosolic localization of FoxO1 and FoxO3. We also show that nuclear export of FoxO6 is mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB pathway. Furthermore, we show using a chimeric approach that we can fully restore the ability of FoxO6 to shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. In conclusion, the data presented here gives a new view on regulation of FoxO-function through multiple phosphorylation events and other mechanisms involved in the nuclear exclusion of FoxO-proteins.

Transcription factors of the forkhead family have an important role in development and function of an organism (1Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of the winged helix structure (forkhead domain) in Drosophila, more than 90 genes containing the forkhead domain have been identified, in species ranging from yeast to humans (1Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Daf-16, a forkhead transcription factor in Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively studied for its role in controlling longevity and dauer formation (2Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity is negatively regulated via an insulin-like signal transduction cascade. In humans Daf-16 has four described orthologues, FOXO1 (FKHR), FOXO2, (AF6q21), FOXO3a (FKHRL1), and FOXO4 (AFX). Together, these proteins form the FOXO-class of forkhead transcription factors in humans. Also in mice, Daf-16 orthologues are identified and are designated FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 (3Biggs III, W.H. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A subset of FOXO genes has been associated with disorders like tumorogenesis and rhabdomyosarcomas. Genetic analysis of a type of acute lymphocytic leukemia revealed that the cause of the disorder is a translocation between chromosome 11 and chromosome X [t(X,11)]. This translocation involves fusion of the general transcription factor HTRX1 with the forkhead gene FOXO4 on the X chromosome (4Parry P. Wei Y. Evans G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994; 11: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A form of rabdomyosarcoma is caused by a translocation between chromosome 2 or chromosome 1 and chromosome 13 [t (1Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 39: 333-338Crossref Scopus (550) Google Scholar)], which leads to fusion of the PAX7 or PAX3 gene with the forkhead FOXO1 (5Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S.

The fusion product turned out to be a stronger activator compared with PAX3 or PAX7, which function as inhibitors of myogenic differentiation of migrating limb myoblasts (7Epstein J.A. Lam P. Jepeal L. Maas R.L. Shapiro D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11719-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Blockage of this terminal differentiation pathway by the PAX-FOXO1 fusion product is the direct cause of this disorder. Since their discovery, FOXO-members have been subject of intensive investigation, especially their place in the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3, phosphatidylinositol 3; PKB, protein kinase B; hiFCS, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor; DBE, DAF-16 binding elements; HEK, human embryonic kidney-cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NES, nuclear export signal; EST, expressed sequence tag.-kinase/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway and the identification of the transcriptional targets. Binding of insulin-like substrates to the insulin receptor leads via PI3-kinase to phosphorylation and activation of PKB. As demonstrated in mammalian cell-lines, PKB phosphorylates specific motifs within FOXO proteins, inducing translocation to the cytosol, thereby preventing their transcriptional activity (8Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. De Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). To elucidate cellular functions of FOXO proteins, many studies focused on identification of their transcriptional targets. FOXO3a has been demonstrated to play an important part in cell cycle progression of fibroblast cells by regulating expression of the mitotic genes cyclin B and polo-like-kinase. Interference with FOXO3a transcriptional activity induces defective cytokinesis, a delayed transition from M to G1, and finally accumulation of cells in the G2/M stage (10Alvarez B. Martinez A.C. Burgering B.M. Carrera A.C. Nature. 2001; 413: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). FOXO3a triggers DNA repair through the Gadd45 protein, which was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of this forkhead protein (11Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Recently FOXO3a has been shown to protect quiescent cells from oxidative stress by inducing transcription of manganese superoxide dismutase (12Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that FOXO proteins are of crucial importance for the ability of a cell to respond to environmental changes. Processes of proliferation, differentiation, and responsiveness to extracellular changes are highly relevant in the nervous system. The properties of FoxO proteins render them candidates to play an important role in neuronal regulatory processes. For this reason we eluded on the identification of FoxO proteins in the central nervous system. In this study we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the FoxO class and detail structural and functional properties related to gene regulation. This novel protein, FoxO6, clearly differs from FoxO1 and FoxO3 in its shuttling properties. Through mutation analysis and the generation of chimeric proteins this difference is identified as a domain absent in FoxO6 located just behind the forkhead domain in FoxO3 and FoxO1. PCR, Cloning, and Sequencing—From adult C57/Bl6 mouse brain, we dissected the tissue in the ventral midbrain. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR for cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase Superscript II and both oligo(dt) and random hexamer primers. Degenerate primers (forward, 5′-MGGCTSAMHYTSKCBCAGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGTGVCGRTAKGARTYCTTCCA-3′) were designed to identify (novel) members of a subset of the forkhead family of transcription factors. This set of primers amplifies part of the forkhead domain of members of the FoxO group. The annealing temperature was 45 °C, and PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel by gel electrophoresis. Fragments of the expected length of 110 bp were purified (Qiagen PCR Purification kit), ligated in pGemT Easy (Promega), and transformed to Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Resulting colonies were subjected to colony PCR. Fragments of appropriate length were purified (Qiagen PCR-Purification kit) and sequenced on a Beckman Coulter CEQ 2000 sequencer under standard conditions. In all other PCR reactions we used the Long Range PCR kit (Roche) with the following modifications: denaturation and extension temperature were 98 and 68 °C, respectively. RNA Probe Synthesis—For the generation of a specific FoxO6 RNA probe, EST clone IMAGp998p163044q2 was subjected to PCR, and the amplified fragment was purified and sequenced. The fragment of 900 bp in length (200 bp coding sequence upstream the stopcodon and 700 bp 3′ untranslated region) did not contain the forkhead domain. T3-and T7-RNA polymerase were used in combination with a DIG RNA Labeling kit (Roche) to synthesize a sense and antisense DIG-labeled cRNA probe. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as follows. Cryostat sections cut at 16 μm were thaw-mounted onto Super-frost+ slides, dried, and fixed for 10 min in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were acetylated for 10 min in a solution containing 245 ml H2O, 3.3 ml triethanolamine, 438 μl HCl (37%), and 625 μl acetic anhydride. Sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and prehybridized for 2 h in a prehybridization solution (50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml baker's yeast, and 500 μg/ml sonificated salmon sperm DNA). Hybridization was performed overnight at 72 °C with 400 ng/ml DIG-labeled probe added to 150 μl hybridization solution each slide, covered with nescofilm. The nescofilm was removed in 2× SSC, and sections were placed in 0.2× SSC for 2 h and washed in a solution containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (buffer 1). Preincubation with 1.5 ml of buffer 1 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (hiFCS) was performed for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with alkaline phosphatase-conjungated mouse anti-DIG Fab fragment (Roche), 1:5000 diluted in buffer 1 with 1% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Sections were washed the next day in buffer 1 and equilibrated with a solution containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl. Subsequently 200 μl NBT/BCIP solution (Roche) and 2.4 mg/10 ml final volume levamisole was added to a 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl solution, and the color reaction was performed in the dark for about 8 h. The color reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm Tris/HCL, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and slides were dehydrated with ethanol and mounted using entellan (Merck). FoxO6-GFP Translational Fusion—Primers were designed to amplify the coding sequence of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO6, introducing restriction sites, leaving the methionine intact and removing the stop-codon. Both PCR products and the EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) were cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and purified. After 1 h ligation of the FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO6 cDNA fragments into the EGFP-N1 vector, the resulting constructs were transformed to E. coli DH5α. Colonies were subjected to colony PCR, and products were sequenced. A colony carrying the correct construct was selected and grown and plasmids were purified (Qiagen). The final construct encoded FoxO1, FoxO3, or FoxO6, immediately followed by EGFP. Mutations of either Thr-26 or Ser-184 to alanine residues were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. Resulting mutant DNA fragments were ligated in EGFP-N1 and sequenced. For the construction of the chimeric FoxO6[4Ser] we undertook a PCR-based strategy using the FoxO6-GFP construct in which we replaced FoxO6 amino acids 243–259 for FoxO3 amino acids 303–327. In a similar way we constructed FoxO6[NES2], in which we replaced FoxO6 amino acids 314–355 for FoxO3 amino acids 381–433. For the PCRs we used FoxO6 sequence-based primers with FoxO3 sequence overhang, and vice versa. Both constructs were sequenced. Cell Culture and Transfection of HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) hiFCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and grown for 24 h on glass coverslips. Cells were transfected with calcium phosphate precipitates containing 1.9 μg/well plasmid DNA. (0.12 μg target construct/1.78 μg pBlueScript carrier DNA). Forkhead Translocation Protocol—Twenty hours after transfection cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Translocation was induced by replacing the serum-free medium with medium supplemented with hiFCS (10% (v/v)), insulin (100 nm), or IGF-1 (1 ng/ml). After 2 h of incubation cells were fixed using 4% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were embedded in Dabco-Mowiol and analyzed by fluorescent-microscopy. In experiments using inhibitors, cells were preincubated with either PD98059 (25 μm), LY294002 (25 μm) (TOCRIS), or leptomycin B (2 ng/ml) for 1 h. Subsequent stimuli were in the presence of inhibitors. Luciferase Assays—Cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA/well, including 1 μg 6× DBE-Luc (kindly provided by B. M. Burgering), with or without 0.3 μg FoxO-GFP or empty vector and the appropriate amount of carrier plasmid. After transfection, cells were lysed and total GFP fluorescence was measured in 96-well plates using a FujiFilm FLA-5000 image reader to normalize the samples for transfection efficiency. Linearity of the measurements was checked with an EGFP standard curve. Luciferase activity of each sample was measured and corrected for total FoxO-GFP. Each experiment was at least performed in triplicate. Isolation and Characterization of FoxO6 mRNA—We used a degenerate PCR strategy to screen for (novel) members of the FoxO group of forkhead transcription factors expressed in the mouse ventral midbrain. Primers were designed to amplify part of the forkhead domain, a region with high sequence homology. Using this strategy we cloned PCR fragments encoding FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4. Interestingly, we cloned a PCR fragment that showed high similarity with these genes, but differed in 10 of 110 bp compared with its closest family member. Data base analysis of this sequence in mouse genomic DNA databases led to characterization of the putative 3′ and 5′ part of a novel gene of the FoxO-group of transcription factors. Initially 7 mouse-derived ESTs from mouse tissue were identified, originating from the 3′ region (BI686281, AA656491, BF581745, AI593097, D21486, AI425281, and BF461725), and only recently a mouse brain-derived EST was released originating from the 5′ region (CA316065). Based on genomic DNA-sequence information, primers (forward; gcgggaccatggctgcgaagc, reverse; acttcaaccatccctcccagac) were designed to amplify the total coding region from mouse ventral midbrain cDNA. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned and sequenced. Primary sequence analysis revealed that the amplified cDNA contained a large open reading frame predicted to encode a 559 amino acid protein. The presence of a forkhead domain and overall similarity to FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4, identified the protein as a novel member of the FoxO class of forkhead transcription factors (Fig. 1). Because FoxO5 is already designated in zebrafish (3Biggs III, W.H. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we named this gene FoxO6. Noteworthy are the recently submitted “genome scan” gene predictions (XM284000 and XM143959) based on genomic and EST sequence data. These predictions are incomplete and incorrect for the fact that part of the genomic sequence of FoxO6 is not yet present in the databases. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of FoxO6, FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4, demonstrated that FoxO6 is 34% identical to FoxO1, 38% identical to FoxO3, and 36% identical to FoxO4 over their shared lengths. Within the forkhead domain this identity is increased to 90% for FoxO1, 89% for FoxO3, and 90% for FoxO4 (Fig. 1). Chromosomal Structure and Localization—In the murine genome FoxO6 is located on chromosome 4, region D1 between chromosomal markers 1283756 and X59556 (within 20 kb of marker 1283756), according to the MGSC v3 data base of the Sanger Institute. Mouse genomic data base analysis revealed that the open reading frame of FoxO6 is divided by a large intron of ∼18 kb long, resulting in 2 putative exons of 414 and 1266 bp in length. A polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is found 818 bp downstream from the stopcodon. This 3′ end corresponds to 3′ EST sequences, which indicates that the FoxO6 mRNA contains a 3′ untranslated region of at least 818 bp long and that this is in fact the last exon of the FoxO6 gene. The startcodon (GGCGGGACCATG G) of the mapped FoxO6 amino acid sequences lies within a proper Kozak sequence. In addition, the 5′ EST contains no upstream startcodons in either frame. These facts and the homology to FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 indicate that the mapped methionine is the correct startcodon. Based on the 5′ EST, FoxO6 contains a 5′ untranslated region of at least 98 bp. Comparison of mouse FoxO6 to human genomic databases revealed that the human FoxO6 orthologue is located at chromosomal region 1p34.1. Within this regions several diseases have been mapped, but no clear indication for FoxO6 dysfunction related disease could be identified. In the human EST data base four different 3′ ESTs were found, originating from brain tissue and tumor-cell lines (AI361654, AI341823, M85901, and AA927741). All human ESTs showed ∼95% sequence identity to mouse FoxO6. Expression Pattern of FoxO6 in Murine Tissue—To elucidate the possible function of FoxO6 we examined the spatial and temporal expression pattern in murine tissues. In situ hybridizations using DIG-labeled probes specific for FoxO6 transcripts were performed in adult mouse brain (Fig. 2). In rostral sections the FoxO6 transcript was detected in the ependyma, the medial part of the anterior olfactory nucleus, and diffuse in the cingulate cortex (Fig. 2A). More caudal, expression was detected in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, the claustrum, the dorsal endopiriform nucleus, and the cingulate cortex (Fig. 2B). The transcript was dominantly present in the hippocampus, especially CA1 and CA3 areas, and to a lesser extent in the dentate gyrus and CA2 area (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, the transcript was detected in the posteroventral part of the medial amygdaloid nucleus, portions of the amygdalo-hippocampal area, and dorsal and ventral endopiriform nuclei. In E12.5 embryos, a high level of expression of FoxO6 was detected in the trigeminal ganglion and tissue surrounding the lateral portion of the fourth ventricle that forms the cerebellum (Fig. 3A). The olfactory epithelium showed high amounts of the transcript, as well as the dorsal root ganglia along the embryo's spine (Fig. 3B). Lower amounts of the transcript were found in striatal areas and in the neopallial cortex, which forms the cerebral cortex. The level of expression in the olfactory epithelium and the dorsal root ganglions was sustained in embryos of E14.5 and E18.5, whereas expression in the trigeminal ganglion and developing cerebellum was diminished and expression in the striatal area was slightly increased. In addition, embryos of E14.5 showed a markedly increased expression in the neopallial cortex (Fig. 3C). Expression in the neopallial cortex was most apparent in the outermost layer, which represents the layer of cells that migrated most recently (Fig. 3D). In the cerebral cortex of E18.5 mouse, the transcript was still abundantly detected. This was also the case in the developing hippocampal areas (Fig. 3E), especially the inner layer that also contains the most recently migrated cells. In the periphery, the FoxO6 transcript was detected in the thymus (Fig. 3F), the cortical region of the kidney (Fig. 3G), the whiskers and dents (data not shown). These data show that the FoxO6 gene is dominantly present in the developing and adult murine brain, indicative for a function of FoxO6 during development and in the adult functional central nervous system. FoxO6 Lacks a Region Containing a PKB, CK1, and DYRK1A Phosphorylation Motif—In FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4, three PKB phosphorylation motifs (13Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 39: 333-338Crossref Scopus (550) Google Scholar) have been reported (8Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The first PKB phosphorylation motif is located in the region just downstream the startcondon, a second in the forkhead domain, and a third in a region just downstream the forkhead domain. (Fig. 4A). The first and second regions containing a PKB phosphorylation motif are present in FoxO6 as well. Strikingly, the third region containing a motif for PKB catalyzed phosphorylation is absent in FoxO6. Besides a PKB phosphorylation motif, this region contains a stretch of 3 additional serine residues, present in the other members of the FoxO group (Fig. 4B). In FOXO1, Ser-319 is substrate for PKB, Ser-322 and Ser-325 are phosphorylated by CK1 (14Rena G. Woods Y.L. Prescott A.R. Peggie M. Unterman T.G. Williams M.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and Ser-329 is phosphorylated by DYRK1A (15Woods Y.L. Rena G. Morrice N. Barthel A. Becker W. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although homology of FoxO6 to FoxO3 and FoxO1 is high just upstream of this region, the conserved PKB site including the stretch of serine residues is not conserved. Noteworthy is the fact that a third Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Thr motif is found in the far C terminus of FoxO6, in a region that shows no similarity to the other FoxO proteins and Daf16. In addition, no CK1 or DYRK1A motifs are found in this region. Therefore it is not certain whether the threonine residue in this region is a natural substrate for PKB. Translocation of FoxO6 Is Dramatically Decreased Compared with FoxO1 and FoxO3—Previous studies (8Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) in mammalian cell lines have shown that in response to stimulation with insulin-like growth factors, PKB phosphorylates FOXO-proteins. This results in translocation of the forkhead protein from the nucleus to the cytosol (8Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To test whether FoxO6 responds in a similar manner to growth factor stimulation, we transfected HEK-293 cells with FoxO1-, FoxO3-, and FoxO6-GFP constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection FoxO1 and FoxO3 displayed a predominant cytosolic localization in virtually 100% of transfected cells for FoxO1 and ∼80% for FoxO3. In strong contrast to FoxO1/FoxO3, FoxO6 was fully localized in the nucleus 24 h after transfection (Fig. 5, 1st column). Subsequent serum starvation for 20 h resulted in a predominant nuclear localization for FoxO1 and FoxO3, although some cytoplasmic fluorescence was still apparent. FoxO6 however had an exclusive nuclear localization (Fig. 5, 2nd column). When stimulated with serum, IGF-1, or insulin, FoxO1 and FoxO3 were excluded from the nucleus and showed a predominant cytosolic localization (Fig. 5, 3–5th columns). Under these conditions FoxO6 displayed a predominant nuclear localization. Although translocation of FoxO6 was significantly less as compared with FoxO1 and FoxO3, a general increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence was detected. This indicates that some protein export from the nucleus had occurred. Translocation of FoxO6 Is Mediated by a PI3-kinase-dependent Mechanism—To assess whether nuclear export of FoxO6 is regulated in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner, we preincubated cells with LY294002, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, before treatment with either IGF-1 or insulin. PI3-kinase inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in cytosolic localization of FoxO6 in cells treated with either IGF-1 or insulin (Fig. 6). Besides the PI3-kinase pathway, IGF-1 and insulin can activate the MAPK pathway as well. Cells preincubated with PD98059, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway, displayed no difference in IGF-1/insulin-induced translocation. These findings clearly indicate that translocation of FoxO6 upon IGF-1 or insulin stimulation is mediated by the PI3-kinase pathway. These results are in perfect agreement with results from similar studies done with other FoxO proteins (16Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1999; 24: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr-26 or Ser-184 Blocks Nuclear Exclusion of FoxO6 —Mutation analysis in FOXO1 has shown that substitution of Thr-24 or Ser-256 by alanine residues (mimicking a non-phosphorylated state) results in a blocked nuclear exclusion (16Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 19Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As stated before, the regions containing Thr-24 and Ser-256 in FOXO1 are highly conserved in all members. Thr-26 and Ser-184 are the equivalent residues in FoxO6 and are therefore potentially phosphorylated by PKB as well, resulting in nuclear export. To verify this possibility, we constructed mutant FoxO6 proteins, where either the Thr-26 or the Ser-184 residue was substituted by an alanine. Both mutan"
https://openalex.org/W2085023145,"There is growing evidence that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species within mitochondria as unwanted byproducts that can damage OXPHOS enzymes with subsequent enhancement of free radical production. The accumulation of this oxidative damage to mitochondria in brain is thought to lead to neuronal cell death resulting in neurodegeneration. The predominant reactive nitrogen species in mitochondria are nitric oxide and peroxynitrite. Here we show that peroxynitrite reacts with mitochondrial membranes from bovine heart to significantly inhibit the activities of complexes I, II, and V (50–80%) but with less effect upon complex IV and no significant inhibition of complex III. Because inhibition of complex I activity has been a reported feature of Parkinson's disease, we undertook a detailed analysis of peroxynitrite-induced modifications to proteins from an enriched complex I preparation. Immunological and mass spectrometric approaches coupled with two-dimensional PAGE have been used to show that peroxynitrite modification resulting in a 3-nitrotyrosine signature is predominantly associated with the complex I subunits, 49-kDa subunit (NDUFS2), TYKY (NDUFS8), B17.2 (17.2-kDa differentiation associated protein), B15 (NDUFB4), and B14 (NDUFA6). Nitration sites and estimates of modification yields were deduced from MS/MS fragmentograms and extracted ion chromatograms, respectively, for the last three of these subunits as well as for two co-purifying proteins, the β and the d subunits of the F1F0-ATP synthase. Subunits B15 (NDUFB4) and B14 (NDUFA6) contained the highest degree of nitration. The most reactive site in subunit B14 was Tyr122, while the most reactive region in B15 contained 3 closely spaced tyrosines Tyr46, Tyr50, and Tyr51. In addition, a site of oxidation of tryptophan was detected in subunit B17.2 adding to the number of post-translationally modified tryptophans we have detected in complex I subunits (Taylor, S. W., Fahy, E., Murray, J., Capaldi, R. A., and Ghosh, S. S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 19587–19590). These sites of oxidation and nitration may be useful biomarkers for assessing oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders.

There is growing evidence that mitochondrial damage, particularly to respiratory chain complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), underlies the pathology of this and other neurological disorders. In rodent model systems, Parkinsonian symptoms have been observed as a result of the inhibition of complex I by the specific inhibitors rotenone (1Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (2Heikkila R.E. Manzino L. Cabbat F.S. Duvoisin R.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Moreover, a 30% decrease in complex I activity has been detected in studies on post-mortem brain tissue from PD patients (3Schapira A.H. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Clark J.B. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), and evidence of complex I subunit depletion has also been reported (4Mizuno Y. Ohta S. Tanaka M. Takamiya S. Suzuki K. Sato T. Oya H. Ozawa T. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The extent of damage to complex I and other key enzymes of energy metabolism that triggers the onset of neurodegeneration and the characteristic symptoms of Parkinson's disease is not known. However, it is pertinent to note that the threshold for complex I activity in brain is the highest of any tissue, such that it requires only a modest degree of inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation to cause cellular dysfunction (5Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12753-12757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Increasingly, the evidence points to oxidative stress as the major cause of age-related mitochondrial damage. In line with the free radical hypothesis of neurodegeneration, depletion of glutathione, a critical antioxidant in cellular defenses against free radical damage, has been observed to precede mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis of the neurons of the substantia nigra in presymptomatic PD patients (6Sian J.

Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 142: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In accord with the above studies, glutathione depletion has been found to lead to complex I inhibition and reduced ATP production in a dopaminergic neuronal cell line (8Jha N. Jurma O. Lalli G.

It has been known for 30 years that complexes I, II, and III of the respiratory chain produce superoxide (O2·¯) as an unwanted byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, when partially reduced electron carriers such as flavins, non-heme iron centers and ubisemiquinone persist long enough to react with molecular oxygen (9Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 10Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (ONOO–), formed by the reaction of O2·¯ with nitric oxide (NO·), is implicated as one of the major oxidants responsible for mitochondrial damage (11Jenner P. Ann.

Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar), and proteins within the organelle. Protein modification can occur by oxidation to produce for example N-formylkynurenine residues from tryptophans (19Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Murray J. Capaldi R.A. Ghosh S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19587-19590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), by nitration of tyrosines to generate 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and by S-nitrosylation of cysteines (20Viner R.I.

Recently the formation of 3NT has been observed in the MPTP-induced PD animal model (21Ferrante R.J. Hantraye P. Brouillet E. Beal M.F.

Furthermore, 3NT α-synuclein has been detected in the Lewy body inclusions found in the substantia nigra cells of PD patients (23Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The effect of ONOO– on mitochondrial function has been studied in vitro mainly by exposure of cultured cells to NO·. Complex I inhibition was observed in all cases but there is no consensus on whether reversible S-nitrosylation via thiols (24Borutaite V. Budriunaite A. Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Here we have used direct addition of ONOO– to examine the oxidative damage induced in beef heart mitochondrial membranes by this reagent. The effect of exposure to ONOO– was assessed by activity measurements on all of the complexes of the OXPHOS system, and the sites of modification of complex I by the reagent were examined using mass spectrometry. The reactive tyrosines identified here may serve as candidates for early biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. Preparation of Bovine and Human Mitochondria—Bovine heart mitochondria were prepared according to Smith (29Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricles were homogenized, and particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. Mitochondria were collected from the supernatant by spinning down at 12,000 × g and resuspended in the isotonic buffer, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Human heart mitochondria, prepared from a 47-year-old male who died of brain cancer, were obtained from Analytical Biological Services. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Peroxynitrite Modification of Mitochondrial Proteins—ONOO– (77 mm) and degraded ONOO– (Upstate) were diluted in 0.3 m sodium hydroxide. The concentration of ONOO– was determined prior to titration by absorbance at 302 nm (extinction coefficient 1670 m–1 cm–1). For ONOO– modification, mitochondria at 5 mg/ml in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2 were placed on ice. ONOO– was deposited on the side of the tube above the mitochondria; vortexing results in rapid mixing of the mitochondrial membranes and ONOO– that then decays in a few seconds in the neutral pH of the buffer. The ONOO–-induced 3NT subunit modification (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) and inhibition of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1) were highly reproducible, suggesting that thorough mixing was achieved before ONOO– decay.Fig. 2Sucrose gradient separation of 3NT-modified mitochondrial complexes. After reaction with ONOO–, bovine heart mitochondria were solubilized, and the complexes were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. After one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels were blotted and probed with an anti-3NT polyclonal antibody (A) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained (B). C, fraction 2 is highly enriched in complex I, and this fraction contains five complex I subunits that are 3NT-modified, labeled 1–5, and three non-complex I proteins, labeled a–c. Their relative abundance of modification is estimated by blot densitometry. D, ONOO– modification and separation of complexes in human heart mitochondria. Note the similar patterns of 3NT incorporation into the bovine and human respiratory chain complexes and ATP synthase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of Enzymatic Activity of Each of the Respiratory Chain Complexes I–V—The mitochondrial preparation had been frozen and thawed once. The activity of complex I was determined by monitoring the reduction of NADH at 340 nm and at 30 °C according to the procedure by Birch-Machin and Turnbull (30Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using ubiquinone2 as an electron acceptor. This activity was 99% inhibited by rotenone. Complex II activity was measured by succinate-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The reaction was monitored at 600 nm and at 30 °C using ubiquinone2 as an electron acceptor (30Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex III activity was measured by reduction of cytochrome c (III) at 550 nm and at 30 °C using ubiquinol2 as an electron donor, essentially as described by Birch-Machin and Turnbull (30Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but in the absence of dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, which was found to be inhibitory. Activity was determined as the initial rate of reduction of cytochrome c above the slower background rate of reduction of cytochrome c. This rate was inhibited by 99% using antimycin A. The activity of complex IV was determined by monitoring the oxidation of cytochrome c (II) at 550 nm and at 30 °C according to Birch-Machin and Turnbull (30Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This rate was greater than 90% inhibited by KCN. The ATP hydrolysis rate was performed according to Lotscher et al. (31Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) at 37 °C and was 98% inhibited by oligomycin. Finally, the activity of citrate synthase was performed according to Maneiro et al. (32Maneiro E. Martin M.A. de Andres M.C. Lopez-Armada M.J. FernandezSueiro J.L. del Hoyo P. Galdo F. Arenas J. Blanco F.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) following the cleavage of acetyl coenzyme A in the presence of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), monitored at 420 nm and at 30 °C. Sucrose Gradient Subfractionation of Mitochondrial Complexes and Electrophoresis—Subfractionation of mitochondria was performed by sucrose gradient density centrifugation according to Hanson et al. (33Hanson B.J. Schulenberg B. Patton W.F. Capaldi R.A. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of NADH Dehydrogenase Complex—For one-dimensional electrophoresis, 5 μl of the sucrose gradient samples were separated on 10–22% acrylamide gels containing 0.05% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. One-dimensional gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma). For two-dimensional electrophoresis, 100-μl sucrose gradient samples were denatured in 350 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 0.8% pH 3–10 ampholyte (Fluka), or 0.5% pH 6–11 IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 2% CHAPS (Sigma), 1% Zwittergent 310 (Sigma), 0.1% SDS) for 15 min at room temperature. Each sample was used to hydrate 18 cm of immobiline pH gradient strips with pH ranges of 3–10 or 6–11 (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h. Isoelectric focusing was performed in three stages of applied potential difference; 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V for up to 10 h, until 60,000 Vh were achieved. Focused strips were soaked in SDS-PAGE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 15 min at room temperature and then applied to 15% acrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional gels were stained with silver nitrate by the method of Schevchenko et al. (34Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Immunological Detection of Proteins Containing 3NT—One-dimensional or two-dimensional gels were transferred in CAPS buffer from gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45-μm pore size) according to Triepels (35Triepels R.H. Hanson B.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Sundell L. Marusich M.F. Smeitink J.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8892-8897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteins containing 3NT were detected by an anti-3NT polyclonal antibody (Upstate), followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (two-dimensional) or horseradish peroxidase (one-dimensional), then detected by the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad) or ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences) detection methods, respectively. Sample Preparation for Analysis by Mass Spectrometry—Gel bands and spots, corresponding to areas of 3NT immunoreactivity on blots, were manually excised from gels with a razor. Destaining of silver-stained samples and digestions were performed as described previously (36Murray J. Zhang B. Taylor S.W. Oglesbee D. Fahy E. Marusich M.F. Ghosh S.S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13619-13622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) but without reduction and alkylation to avoid the possibility of any partial reduction of the 3NT moieties. Digests were prepared for MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting, and spectra were automatically acquired on a Voyager DE-STR™ as reported previously (36Murray J. Zhang B. Taylor S.W. Oglesbee D.

Peptide mass fingerprints from baseline-corrected, noise-filtered, and de-isotoped peaks were then analyzed using the program Protein Prospector, MS-Fit (37Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) with and without the Intellical algorithm from Applied Biosystems as described previously (37Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 38Taylor S.W. Warnock D.E. Glenn G.M. Zhang B. Fahy E. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Identification of Proteins by LC/MS/MS—The digests (5 μl) were directly loaded onto a 10- to 15-cm 75 μC-18 packed Picofrit column (New Objectives Inc.) by means of a helium pressure cell (Mass Evolution Inc.). The column had been previously equilibrated with solvent A (99% water, 1% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid). The column was reconnected to the liquid junction of a simple nanospray source based on that described in the literature (39Gatlin C.L. Kleemann G.R. Hays L.G. Link A.J. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (constructed by the University of California, San Diego Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry fabrication facility) and an Ultra-Plus II capillary LC (Micro-Tech Scientific, Inc.) by means of an zero dead volume PEEK MicroTee (Upchurch). This configuration allows protein identification at the low femtomole level from silver-stained gels (39Gatlin C.L. Kleemann G.R. Hays L.G. Link A.J. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The flow rate was set to 200–500 nl/min, and, after a 5-min wash, a gradient of solvent A to solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 20% water, 0.5% acetic acid) 1% to 60% over 80 min, followed by a 10-min wash with 100% solvent B, was used to elute peptides through and directly into the heated capillary orifice of a Finnigan LCQ-DECA™ Ion Trap Mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired in the m/z 400–1400 range under the following conditions: positive polarity, capillary temperature 150 °C, source voltage 2.2 kV, source current 80 μA, capillary voltage 43 V, and tube lens offset 50 V. After one full scan, MS of the column effluent was recorded, and two MS/MS spectra of the most intense and second most intense MS peaks were recorded over the m/z 100–2000 range with an isolation width of 2.5 and normalized collision energy 35. Dynamic exclusion was employed to select the maximum number of unique peptide peaks from the chromatograms. After replicate MS/MS spectra were acquired for a precursor ion, the m/z value of ion was placed on an exclusion list with a ±1.5-unit window for 1 min. Each chromatogram was subsequently analyzed with the program SEQUEST (40Ducret A. Van Oostveen I. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) using either the bovine or human subsets of the non-redundant data base (January 22, 2003) that had been “indexed for speed” with methionine oxidation (+16 atomic mass units) and either tyrosine nitration (+45) or tryptophan dioxidation (+32) specified as differential modifications using Turbo-SEQUEST™ (ThermoFinnigan) software. The requirement for a protein assignment was at least 1 peptide for a particular protein having an X corr of >1.7 for a +1 ion, X corr of >2.0 for a +2 ion, or X corr of >3 for a +3 ion. In all cases Δcorr must be greater than 0.1. Peptides assigned as being nitrated had to satisfy the following requirements irrespective of their SEQUEST scores based upon a comparison with their unmodified counterparts: 1) they should be more hydrophobic (41Sharov V.S. Galeva N.A. Knyushko T.V. Bigelow D.J. Williams T.D. Schoneich C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 2) their MS/MS fragmentograms should be comparable differing mainly by +45 atomic mass unit additions of mass to the corresponding a, y, and b series. Requirement 1 was checked by comparing the single ion chromatograms for the peptides (m/z ± 0.5 atomic mass unit) (Figs. 4, 5, 6), and requirement 2 was checked by manual inspection of the MS/MS spectra for the unmodified and modified peptides, respectively.Fig. 5Extracted ion chromatograms and MS/MS spectra for the most nitrated peptide corresponding to subunit B14. A, extracted ion chromatogram for the un-nitrated peptide (MH2)2+ (m/z 418.3 ± 0.5 atomic mass units); B, extracted ion chromatogram for the nitrated peptide (MH2)2+ (m/z 440.8 ± 0.5 atomic mass units). Some contribution to the area under the curve for 440.8 resulted from the isotope envelope of a major co-eluting contaminant peptide m/z 436.6 (unidentified). In addition a trypsin autolytic product (m/z 422.2 for a (MH2)2+ ion) of ∼100-fold higher signal intensity than m/z 418.3 and 440.8 contributed to the baseline noise and is indicated by an asterisk. C, MS/MS for the un-nitrated peptide; D, MS/MS for the nitrated peptide. The b and y ion nomenclature conforms to that proposed by Biemann (58Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 455-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In this case y6, a2, and all b ions exhibit a +45 mass shift in the MS/MS spectrum of the nitrated peptide relative to that of the un-nitrated confirming that the tyrosine in the second position is the site of ONOO– attack.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Extracted ion chromatograms and MS/MS spectra for a peptide containing two tyrosine residues corresponding to subunit B17.2. A, extracted ion chromatogram for the un-nitrated peptide (MH2)2+ (m/z 416.7 ± 0.5 atomic mass unit); B, extracted ion chromatogram for the nitrated peptide (MH2)2+ (m/z 438.8 ± 0.5 atomic mass unit); C, MS/MS for the un-nitrated peptide; and D, MS/MS for the nitrated peptide. In this case a2 and all b ions exhibit a +45 mass shift in the MS/MS spectrum of the nitrated peptide relative to that of the un-nitrated. Because y5 for the peptide with the second tyrosine residue nitrated is indistinguishable from b5-H2O for the peptide with the first tyrosine residue nitrated (both m/z calc. = 713.3), the two sites are indistinguishable based on this fragmentogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Estimates of Levels of Nitration—Extracted ion LC/MS/MS chromatograms for nitrated peptides and the corresponding un-nitrated peptides were subjected to 15-point Gaussian smoothing using the Qual Brower program of the Finnigan Xcalibur 1.3 software and integrated after manually choosing peak areas corresponding to the eluting peptides. Comparison of the peak areas of the nitrated versus un-nitrated peptides for relative quantitation assumes that the species have identical ionization efficiencies. This assumption was felt to be justified based upon the fact that nitration imparts no additional charge on the peptides and accounts for a relatively small increase (2–6%) in the molecular masses of the peptides. Furthermore, Smallwood et al. (42Smallwood H.S. Galeva N.A. Bartlett R.K. Urbauer R.J. Williams T.D. Urbauer J.L. Squier T.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that approximate abundances estimated from relative MS currents for a nitrated and un-nitrated 16-residue tryptic peptide from calmodulin were confirmed using absorbance at 381 nm (43Richman P.G. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter method is independent of ionization efficiency. Inhibition of the Respiratory Chain Complexes I–V by ONOO – Modification—Bovine heart mitochondrial preparations were variously incubated with 0, 50, 200, 800, 1600, and 2400 μm ONOO– (Fig. 1A). When 2400 μm ONOO– was used, disruption of the lipid bilayer was evident from the reduced light scattering of the sample. Complexes I, II, and V (the ATP synthase) were each inhibited between 40 and 50% at 800 μm ONOO–, whereas complex IV was inhibited close to 20% and complex III was unaffected at this reagent concentration. Levels of inhibition were higher for complexes I, II, and V at 1600 μm ONOO–, and each of these complexes was fully inhibited at 2400 μm ONOO–. Upon treatment with 2400 μm ONOO–, complex IV act"

SVE is maintained by the subsequent rephosphorylation of the dephosphins by unidentified protein kinases. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates dynamin I on Ser 774 and Ser 778 in vitro, which are identical to its endogenous phosphorylation sites in vivo. Cdk5 antagonists and expression of dominant-negative Cdk5 block phosphorylation of dynamin I, but not of amphiphysin or AP180, in nerve terminals and inhibit SVE. Thus Cdk5 has an essential role in SVE and is the first dephosphin kinase identified in nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2103625610,"Protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) is a newly described form of PKC that is necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and the persistence of memory in Drosophila. PKMζ is the independent catalytic domain of the atypical PKCζ isoform and produces long term effects at synapses because it is persistently active, lacking autoinhibition from the regulatory domain of PKCζ. PKM has been thought of as a proteolytic fragment of PKC. Here we report that brain PKMζ is a new PKC isoform, synthesized from a PKMζ mRNA encoding a PKCζ catalytic domain without a regulatory domain. Multiple ζ-specific antisera show that PKMζ is expressed in rat forebrain as the major form of ζ in the near absence of full-length PKCζ. A PKCζ knockout mouse, in which the regulatory domain was disrupted and catalytic domain spared, still expresses brain PKMζ, indicating that this form of PKM is not a PKCζ proteolytic fragment. Furthermore, the distribution of brain PKMζ does not correlate with PKCζ mRNA but instead with an alternate ζ RNA transcript thought incapable of producing protein. In vitro translation of this RNA, however, generates PKMζ of the same molecular weight as that in brain. Metabolic labeling of hippocampal slices shows increased de novo synthesis of PKMζ in LTP. Because PKMζ is a kinase synthesized in an autonomously active form and is necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP, it serves as an example of a link coupling gene expression directly to synaptic plasticity.

Grimwood P.D. Morris R.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 649-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). LTP can be divided into two phases: induction, which triggers the potentiation, and maintenance, which sustains it over time. Many molecules have been implicated in LTP induction, which is initiated by the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and involves several protein kinases (2Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of maintenance. Recently, however, a specific, autonomously active form of the atypical PKCζ isozyme (3Zhou G. Wooten M.W. Coleman E.S. Exp.

Overexpression of PKMζ also prolongs memory in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting it is part of an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism for memory storage (8Drier E.A. Tello M.K. Cowan M. Wu P. Blace N. Sacktor T.C. Yin J.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The unique role of PKMζ in LTP maintenance is due, in part, to its unusual structural and enzymatic properties as an autonomously active kinase. PKMζ consists of the independent catalytic domain of a PKC isoform (5Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The regulatory domain contains binding sites for second messengers and an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence, which interacts with and blocks the active site of the catalytic domain. Second messengers stimulate PKC by binding to the regulatory domain, translocating the enzyme from cytosol to membrane, and producing a conformational change that releases the autoinhibition. In vitro studies have shown that PKC may then be cleaved at its hinge, permanently removing the regulatory domain to form the independent catalytic domain, PKM (Fig. 1A, left) (12Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Inoue M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lacking autoinhibition from a regulatory domain, PKM can persistently phosphorylate substrates in the absence of second messengers. Indeed, once formed in LTP, the autonomous activity of PKMζ maintains synaptic potentiation for at least several hours (7Ling D.S. Benardo L.S. Serrano P.A. Blace N. Kelly M.T. Crary J.F. Sacktor T.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Because PKM is usually thought of as a proteolytic fragment of PKC (12Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Inoue M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our early work had assumed that PKMζ was formed from PKCζ by calpains (5Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), Ca2+-dependent proteases that become active during LTP (14Vanderklish P. Saido T.C. Gall C. Arai A. Lynch G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and can generate PKM in vitro (12Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies showed, however, that the increase of PKMζ in LTP, like the persistence of synaptic potentiation, requires new protein synthesis (6Osten P. Valsamis L. Harris A. Sacktor T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results, together with the observation that PKCζ is the only PKC isozyme with a stable PKM form in hippocampus (5Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 15Naik M.U. Benedikz E. Hernandez I. Libien J. Hrabe J. Valsamis M. Dow-Edwards D. Osman M. Sacktor T.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 426: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggested that PKMζ may be generated by a molecular mechanism unique to ζ. One possible mechanism for generating PKMζ might be that a product of protein synthesis regulates PKCζ proteolysis. To characterize this mechanism the amount of PKCζ, the putative precursor, needs to be established. Vertebrates, however, express two atypical PKCs, ζ and ι/λ; traditional antisera to the C terminus of PKCζ recognize proteins from both genes (16Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (PKCι (16Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and -λ (17Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are human and mouse orthologues, respectively.) Thus the relative amounts of PKCζ and PKCι/λ in brain have not been determined. Alternatively, PKMζ could be formed by a novel mechanism as a ζ gene product distinct from PKCζ. A ζ RNA containing a partial C-terminal PKCζ sequence has been identified (18Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6927-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. Mischak H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is produced by an internal promoter active in certain rat prostate tumor cell lines and in rat brain (20Marshall B.S. Price G. Powell C.T. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This alternate ζ RNA, however, is thought not to produce a protein and has been referred to as an untranslatable “ζ pseudogene” RNA (21Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we show PKMζ synthesis from this alternate ζ RNA, which we now call PKMζ mRNA. Because it is a gene product distinct from PKCζ, PKMζ is a new atypical PKC isoform, and the protein synthesis-dependent mechanism for generating PKMζ in brain may be a core molecular mechanism for the maintenance of LTP. Experimental animals were used in accordance with the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center Institutional Animal Use Committee. Antisera Production—Peptides were synthesized by Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA) and correspond to N-terminal, hinge, catalytic, and C-terminal regions of PKCζ (see Fig. 1A for sequences). The peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin (Pierce), mixed with Titermax Gold (CytRx Corp., Norcross, GA), and injected intramuscularly into female New Zealand rabbits. After 1-3 boosts at 4-week intervals, the antisera were affinity-purified on peptide conjugated Sulfolink gel columns (Pierce). The C-terminal antibody used for immunoprecipitation was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The ι monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Tissue Preparation for Immunoblotting—Sprague-Dawley rats (age 4-5 weeks) were anesthetized with halothane. The tissue was rapidly dissected, frozen on dry ice, and washed 3 times with homogenization buffer at 4 °C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 17 kallikrein units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 4.83 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The tissue was homogenized with a motorized pestle in a Teflon glass Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. For total sample, the homogenate was immediately boiled (4:1 v/v) in 5× sample buffer (312.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 12.5% w/v SDS, 25% v/v β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol) for 5 min at 95 °C. For cytosolic fractions the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was combined with 5× sample buffer. Total protein was estimated by Bradford assay, as described previously (5Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Ten μg/cm lane of total protein from tissue samples and 5 ng/cm lane of baculovirus Sf9 overexpressed PKCζ were loaded on the gels. The SDS-PAGE was transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% hemoglobin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The nitrocellulose was incubated for 1 h in primary antibody (1:2000 for ζ N-terminal, aPKC C-terminal, and ι/λ monoclonal antibody; 1:500 for ζ catalytic antiserum), and then for 1 h in secondary antibody coupled to alkaline-phosphatase (1:2000, Promega, Madison, WI). Development was with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega, Madison, WI), except for Fig. 1D, which was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Rat cytosolic hippocampal extract (100 μg, 400 μg/ml) was added to 150 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% aprotinin, 1% each of phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma)) and precleared with 10 μl of normal goat IgG-agarose conjugate for 1 h at 4 °C with nutation. The samples were then centrifuged at 2300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with 1.6 μg of goat C-terminal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 1.6 μg of normal goat serum overnight. For peptide competition, the precipitating antibody was preincubated with 8 μg of immunizing peptide for 2 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-plus agarose for 6 h, followed by centrifugation, as above. The pellet was washed 3 times with 400 μl of IP buffer without aprotinin and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min with 40 μl of 5× sample buffer. Calpain Cleavage—A mixture (200 μl) containing calpain (1.25 units of either porcine calpain I or II, Calbiochem), baculovirus-Sf9 expressed PKCζ (1 μg), prepared as previously described (7Ling D.S. Benardo L.S. Serrano P.A. Blace N. Kelly M.T. Crary J.F. Sacktor T.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 2 mm dithiothreitol was prewarmed for 2 min at 20 °C, and the proteolytic reaction was started with the addition of 20 μl of CaCl2 (7.5 mm final concentration). After 1 h, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 12.5 μl of 25 mm EDTA and placed on ice. Proteolytic fragments were analyzed with C-terminal antiserum by Western blot, as described above. Total mRNA Isolation—For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, 60 mg of various tissues were used for the single-step method of total RNA isolation by guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA sample for RT was treated with DNase I and repurified by the same method. The quality of the total RNA was measured by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. For RNase protection, Northern blotting, and 5′-RACE with oligo-capping, the cesium chloride RNA isolation method was used. Briefly, 200 mg of tissues from a 3-month old male Sprague-Dawley rat was homogenized in 2 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate homogenization buffer (4.0 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine) for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a cushion of 2 ml of 5.7 m CsCl and 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 16 h at 81,000 × g. The pellet containing total RNA was resuspended in 300 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water by heating to 70 °C for 10 min, 33 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and 825 μl of 100% ETOH was added, and the sample was stored at -80 °C. RT-PCR—Total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with the SuperScript Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Two hundred ng of cDNA was used in a 100-μl final volume PCR. Amplification was for 34 cycles with 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min as cycle parameters, with a final step of 72 °C for 10 min. For amplification of PKCζ and PKMζ cDNAs, specific forward primers were F 5′-CCATGCCCAGCAGGACCACC-3′ and F 5′-CCTTCTATTAGATGCCTGCTCTCC-3′, respectively, and R 5′-TGAAGGAAGGTCTACACCATCGTTC-3′ was the reverse primer for both. As a control we used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers, F 5′-ACATGGTCTACATGTTCC-3′ and R 5′-CAGATCCACAACGGAATAC-3′. RNase Protection—RNase protection was performed using the RPAIII Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The probes for PKCζ, PKMζ, and RARP were gifts from T. Powell (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) (23Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot—Total RNA (30 μg) was electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose, rinsed, and UV cross-linked. Digestion with EcoRI-SphI and KpnI-EcoRI gave a 457- and 227-bp specific fragment for PKCζ and PKMζ, respectively. The fragments were radiolabeled with 32P using a Stratagene random octamer protocol (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization conditions were performed according to instructions for Stratagene QuickHyb hybridization. Blots were developed overnight by film exposure at -70 °C or by PhosphorImager (Storm 860 gel and blot imaging system, Amersham Biosciences). Oligo-capping and 5′-RACE—Oligo-capping and 5′-RACE (24Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) were performed with a GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen), using rat hippocampus and kidney RNA as templates, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GeneRacer Kit 5′ primer was used as a forward primer and 5′-CGCCCAGCCATCATCTCAAACATAAG-3′ as a reverse primer specific for PKMζ. For screening of oligo-capping 5′-RACE clones, PCR was performed using the GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and 5′-CTCTGCCTCTTCAGCACG-3′, as a reverse PKMζ-specific nested primer. The PCR conditions were 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with an initial step of 94 °C for 3 min and a final step of 72 °C for 10 min. 5′-RACE without tobacco alkaline phosphatase yielded no clones. GenBank™ accession numbers of the published human and mouse PKMζ cDNAs obtained by oligo-capping and 5′-RACE are as follows: AL514298, AL534124, AL535166, AL535303, AL538613, AL538626, and AL539647 (human), and AU051559, AU067133, AU078878, and BB585441 (mouse). Throughout the text, the first nucleotide in the longest rat PKMζ mRNA, shown in Fig. 4D, is referred to as the first nucleotide of PKMζ mRNA. In Vitro Transcription-Translation—In vitro transcription-translation was performed with the TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). For the T7-PKMζ clone (sequence 48-1982), we used a PKMζ clone (gift from T. Powell, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH). Briefly, PKMζ was digested with AatII and XbaI and the pBlueScript SK(-) vector with HindIII and XbaI. The XbaI sites were ligated, and the HindIII site of the vector was filled in and ligated with a polished AatII site from the PKMζ. The T7-PKMζ-(347-1982) clone was created by digesting PKMζ-(48-1982) with EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega, Madison, WI). The SP6-PKMζ-(587-1982) clone was created by digesting PKMζ-(48-1982) with PstI and XbaI, and subcloning into pGEM-3Z (Promega, Madison, WI). The experiment with the T7 clone was performed with linearized plasmid digested with XbaI. The experiment with the SP6 clone was performed both with and without linearization at the XbaI site with identical results. Hippocampal Slice Electrophysiology—Transverse hippocampal slices (450 μm) were prepared with a McIlwain tissue slicer from 16- to 25-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Slices were placed in an interface chamber infused initially with a saline solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4), equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 32 °C. After 30 min, the divalent ion concentrations were changed to 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 1.7 mm CaCl2 (resting buffer) (5Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Test stimuli (duration 100 μs) were delivered every 15 s through bipolar tungsten electrodes placed across the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers. Field EPSPs were recorded using glass microelectrodes filled with the saline solution (resistance 2.5-5.0 megohms) and placed in CA1 stratum radiatum. The current intensity of test stimuli (25-50 μA) was set to produce one-third maximal EPSPs. Analysis of the initial 10-50% of the field EPSP slope was performed with Superscope (GW Instruments, Somerville, MA). Following 15 min of stable recordings, LTP was induced with two 100-Hz 1-s tetanic trains, 20 s apart. Control slices received test stimulation for equivalent periods of time as LTP recordings. Metabolic Labeling of Hippocampal Slices—Following stimulation, hippocampal slices were transferred to a 6-well culture dish in a 32.5 °C water bath. Each slice was submerged in a well containing 8 ml of resting buffer, continuously perfused with 95% O2, 5% CO2, and supplemented with 350 μCi of 35S-labeled amino acids (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation for 30 min, slices were quickly frozen by contact with a metal rod cooled to -55 °C. In some experiments, cold methionine (300 μm) was added prior to freezing; the results with and without the addition were equivalent. The frozen slices were placed on powdered dry ice and stored at -80 °C. Each radiolabeled hippocampal slice was then homogenized in 250 μl of homogenization buffer (described above) with 0.5% SDS in order to solubilize total protein and centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove unhomogenized tissue. Samples containing 50 μg of protein and 90 μl of IP buffer in a final volume of 290 μl were precleared with 15 μl of protein G-plus agarose and immunoprecipitated with C-terminal aPKC antiserum, as described above. Following immunoprecipitation and washing, pellets were homogenized and boiled in 40 μl of sample buffer, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 3 months. The images were analyzed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software for the Macintosh platform, and the intensity of radiolabeled bands was determined by subtracting background values. PKMζ Is Expressed Exclusively in Brain—Vertebrates express two atypical isoforms, PKCζ and PKCι/λ (16Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PKCι/λ is nearly identical to ζ in its C terminus, antisera raised against this region of PKCζ recognize both atypical isozymes (16Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, right). We used this antiserum to screen a panel of tissues by Western blot to determine the overall distribution of atypical PKC and PKM forms (Fig. 1B, left). Whereas full-length aPKC (mass of 72 kDa) was found in many tissues, notably lung, liver, kidney, testis, and brain, atypical PKM (55 kDa) was expressed only in brain. The relative abundance of PKM in neocortex and hippocampus, two forebrain regions, compared with cerebellum, a hindbrain region, is consistent with our previous observation of the preferential rostral to caudal distribution of PKMζ in brain (15Naik M.U. Benedikz E. Hernandez I. Libien J. Hrabe J. Valsamis M. Dow-Edwards D. Osman M. Sacktor T.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 426: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We next examined the distribution of PKCι/λ with an antiserum raised against its catalytic domain (Fig. 1B, right), which does not cross-react with PKCζ (see Fig. 1C, left). Full-length PKCι/λ was expressed in lung, liver, kidney, testis, and brain, similar to the distribution of total aPKC recognized by the C-terminal antiserum, but only a trace amount of PKMι/λ was detectable in brain. These results suggest that the major form of atypical PKM in brain is PKMζ. To confirm that the 55-kDa protein recognized by the C-terminal PKCζ antiserum is PKMζ and to determine the level of expression of PKCζ, we developed a battery of antisera raised against different isozyme-specific epitopes in the N-terminal, hinge, and catalytic domains of PKCζ (Fig. 1A, right). By Western blot, all the antisera to ζ, but not that to PKCι/λ, recognized baculovirus-overexpressed PKCζ in Sf9 cells (Fig. 1C, left). In kidney, antisera to both ζ and ι/λ detected a 72-kDa band (Fig. 1C, center), indicating the expression of both full-length aPKCs. In hippocampus, however, the PKCι/λ and the aPKC C-terminal antisera both recognized a 72-kDa band, but none of the ζ-specific antisera detected full-length PKCζ (Fig. 1C, right). Overdevelopment of Western blots with the ζ-specific antisera showed only trace amounts of PKCζ in hippocampus (data not shown). The full-length aPKC recognized by the aPKC C-terminal antisera in hippocampus is thus predominantly PKCι/λ, and the expression of PKCζ is very low. In contrast, PKMζ was abundantly expressed in hippocampus (Fig. 1C,right). The antisera to the ζ hinge, ζ catalytic, and aPKC C-terminal all recognized PKMζ in the hippocampus, but, as expected, the ζ N-terminal antiserum did not. We confirmed that the protein detected by the aPKC C-terminal antiserum was PKMζ, by showing that this antiserum immunoprecipitated a 55-kDa protein from hippocampal extracts that was recognized by the ζ-specific catalytic domain antiserum on Western blot (Fig. 1D). We next determined whether the relative abundance of PKMζ and the paucity of PKCζ that we observed in hippocampus was found in other brain regions (Fig. 1E). The ζ N-terminal and ζ catalytic domain antisera (Fig. 1E, left and middle) showed PKCζ expression in kidney and cerebellum but did not detect PKCζ in either neocortex or hippocampus. In contrast, the ζ catalytic and aPKC C-terminal antisera (Fig. 1E,middle and right) demonstrated PKMζ expression in all brain regions. Therefore, PKMζ and PKCζ show differential regional expression in brain, with both PKMζ and PKCζ in cerebellum, but only PKMζ in hippocampus and neocortex. Brain PKMζ Is Not a Proteolytic Fragment of PKCζ—The expression of PKMζ in the near absence of PKCζ in hippocampus and neocortex suggests that PKMζ may not be produced by PKCζ proteolysis. It is possible, however, that the cleavage of PKCζ in these regions was complete. As our original hypothesis for the formation of PKMζ was proteolysis by calpain (5Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), we compared the size of brain PKMζ with the PKMζ fragment generated by calpain proteolysis of recombinantly expressed PKCζ. Both calpains I and II produced PKMζ fragments that appeared smaller than endogenous brain PKMζ (Fig. 2A). Although these results suggest that calpain proteolysis does not produce PKMζ of the appropriate size, other proteases might cleave PKCζ at alternative sites (25Frutos S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10765-10770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether brain PKMζ is a proteolytic fragment of PKCζ, we examined mice in which PKCζ was eliminated by genetic disruption of its regulatory domain (PKCζ-reg -/-) (26Leitges M.

In mouse, PKCζ is a single copy locus at chromosome 4, 83.0 centimorgans. In the PKCζ knockout characterized by Leitges et al. (26Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. Garcia J.F. Camacho F.

https://openalex.org/W2022131604,"Opiates are widely used analgesics in anesthesiology, but they have serious adverse effects such as depression of breathing. This is caused by direct inhibition of rhythm-generating respiratory neurons in the Pre-Boetzinger complex (PBC) of the brainstem. We report that serotonin 4(a) [5-HT4(a)] receptors are strongly expressed in respiratory PBC neurons and that their selective activation protects spontaneous respiratory activity. Treatment of rats with a 5-HT4 receptor-specific agonist overcame fentanyl-induced respiratory depression and reestablished stable respiratory rhythm without loss of fentanyl's analgesic effect. These findings imply the prospect of a fine-tuned recovery from opioid-induced respiratory depression, through adjustment of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels through the convergent signaling pathways in neurons."

We detected the stellar companion with the use of Hubble Space Telescope observations. The color and magnitude of the stellar companion indicate that it is an undermassive white dwarf (0.34 +/- 0.04 solar mass) of age 480 x 10(6) +/- 140 x 10(6) years. This places a constraint on the recent history of this triple system and supports a scenario in which the current configuration arose through a dynamical exchange interaction in the cluster core. This implies that planets may be relatively common in low-metallicity globular clusters and that planet formation is more widespread and has happened earlier than previously believed."

Binding of di-C8-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 (PI(4,5)P2) to PTEN enhances phosphatase activity for monodispersed substrates, PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. PI(5)P also is an activator, but PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,5)P2 do not activate PTEN. Activation by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 is more apparent with PI(3,4)P2 as a substrate than with PI(3,4,5)P3, probably because hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P2 yields PI(4)P, which is not an activator. In contrast, hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3 yields a potent activator, PI(4,5)P2, creating a positive feedback loop. In addition, neither di-C4-PI(4,5)P2 nor inositol trisphosphate-activated PTEN. Hence, the interaction between PI(4,5)P2 and PTEN requires specific, ionic interactions with the phosphate groups on the inositol ring as well as hydrophobic interactions with the fatty acid chains, likely mimicking the physiological interactions that PTEN has with the polar surface head groups and the hydrophobic core of phospholipid membranes.

By lowering levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 (PI(3,4,5)P3), PTEN inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and decreases cell motility (6Furnari F.B. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K.

These results demonstrate that cells are highly quantitatively dependent on PTEN levels, and hence, understanding regulation of PTEN activity is critical. Here we report a novel mechanism of PTEN regulation in which binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 (PI(4,5)P2) to PTEN activates the phosphatase for monodispersed substrates, PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, likely by an allosteric conformational change. Phosphatidylinositols and Inositol Phosphates—All phosphatidylinositols were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). Unless noted otherwise, the synthetic lipids used in these experiments have di-C8, saturated fatty acid chains. Measurements of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) are not available in the literature for C8-PIPs and would be cost prohibitive to determine. However, the CMCs for these multiply charged PIPs can be estimated by comparison with the CMC for C8-PI, which is 60 μm (11Rebecchi M.J. Eberhardt R. Delaney T. Ali S. Bittman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1735-1741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of phosphates to the inositol ring would increase head group size and charge and, thereby, increase the CMC (12Rosen M.J. Structure-Performance Relationships in Surfactants, American Cancer Society Symposium Series 23. ACS, Washington, D. C.1984Google Scholar). For example, the CMC of di-C8-phosphatidylserine is 2.28 mm (13Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 994-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the PIP concentrations in these experiments are much less than the predicted CMCs, these PIPs must be monodispersed and do not form micelles or membranes. This prediction is confirmed by the lack of turbidity observed for all of the PIP solutions used in these experiments. Finally, d-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was purchased from Sigma. Preparation of PTEN Proteins—Recombinant human PTEN was prepared using the expression vector, pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-PTEN fusion protein was expressed in DH5α bacteria, and the cells were lysed with a French press. The GST-PTEN protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 100 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, concentrations of GST-PTEN proteins were determined by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards. Aliquots of the purified proteins were stored at –20 °C for up to 2 weeks. PTEN mutants were prepared with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Lipid Phosphatase Assay—The PIP phosphatase assay of Maehama et al. (14Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was adapted to a 96-well format. PIPs were dissolved in the dialysis buffer described above. GST-PTEN (0.3 μg per assay) was added to initiate the reaction (total volume of 22.5 μl per well of 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplates (model 3369) from Corning Inc.). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C and terminated with 195 μl per well of BIOMOL GREEN (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), which is a malachite green solution that shows increased absorbance in the presence of free phosphate. The green color was allowed to develop for 30 min, and the absorbances for the phosphatase products as well as phosphate standards were measured at 595 nm with a microplate reader. Each data point was assayed in duplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. To better understand the mechanism by which PTEN hydrolyzes monodispersed PIPs, we measured reaction rates for varying concentrations of PI(3,4,5)P3. As seen in Fig. 1, release of free phosphate was more rapid for higher concentrations of PI(3,4,5)P3. However, the kinetic curves did not follow the typical Michaelis-Menten form, especially at higher PI(3,4,5)P3 levels. These kinetic curves were sigmodial, indicating that the enzymatic activity increases as the reaction progresses, and suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of PTEN. One possible explanation is that the PTEN product, PI(4,5)P2, is a positive regulator of PTEN activity. In fact, binding of PI(4,5)P2 is known to regulate a number of other membrane-associated proteins (15McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we added varying concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 in addition to a constant amount of PI(3,4,5)P3. Addition of 22.5 or 45 μm PI(4,5)P2 increased the reaction rate (Fig. 2A). In parallel experiments using PI(3,4)P2 as the substrate, addition of the PI(4,5)P2 had a more dramatic effect on the reaction rate (Fig. 2B). In the absence of PI(4,5)P2, there was little hydrolysis of the PI(3,4)P2, consistent with an earlier report that PI(3,4)P2 is a poor substrate compared with PI(3,4,5)P3 (16Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Hence, the apparent lack of PI(3,4)P2 hydrolysis by PTEN probably reflects the absence of the PI(4,5)P2 activator rather than the poor capacity of PI(3,4)P2 to serve as a substrate. We next measured PTEN activation as a function of PI(4,5)P2 concentration (Fig. 2C). PI(4,5)P2 increased the initial rates of PI(3,4)P2 hydrolysis in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. PTEN activation was half-maximal at 20.2 ± 3.8 μm PI(4,5)P2. In these assays, the total concentration of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4,5)P2 was substantially below the predicted CMC (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that activation of PTEN was not induced by or dependent upon formation of a membrane or mixed micelle with PI(3,4)P2. These data suggest that activation was initiated by binding of PI(4,5)P2 to a specific site on PTEN and not by anchoring PTEN to an artificial membrane or micelle. Given the prediction of a specific binding site for PI(4,5)P2, we tested other PIPs for PTEN activation. PI(5)P was not a substrate for PTEN but did promote the hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PI(4)P did not activate PTEN phosphatase activity. Neither PI(4)P nor PI(5)P changed the end point for the reaction, further indicating that they are not substrates for PTEN and do not alter the specificity of PTEN for phosphates on 3-position of the inositol ring. We also found that PI(3,5)P2 is a poor substrate for PTEN (Fig. 3B). Addition of PI(4,5)P2 increased the enzymatic activity, but even in the presence of PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,5)P2 is a relatively poor substrate compared with PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(3,4)P2. Since PI(4,5)P2 enhances PTEN hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4,5)P3 cannot be a strong activator. However, because the product of PI(3,4,5)P3 hydrolysis is a strong activator, we cannot say whether PI(3,4,5)P3 is a weak activator. These results show that PI(4,5)P2 and PI(5)P are potent activators, but PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,5)P2 have little or no activating capacity at 45 μm. Hence, PTEN is activated by a subset of PIPs, consistent with binding of activators to a specific site on PTEN. We next tested whether the glycerol backbone and fatty acid chains of PI(4,5)P2 are required for PTEN activation. As noted, PI(4,5)P2 with eight-carbon (C8) fatty acid chains increased PTEN hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PI(4,5)P2 with four-carbon (C4) fatty acid chains did not appreciably activate PTEN. In addition, IP3, which is the soluble headgroup from PI(4,5)P2, did not increase the phosphatase reaction. Hence, the interaction between PI(4,5)P2 and PTEN requires specific, ionic interactions with the phosphate groups on the inositol ring as well as hydrophobic interactions with the fatty acid chains, likely mimicking the physiological interactions that PTEN has with the polar surface headgroups and the hydrophobic core of phospholipid membranes. Since PI(4,5)P2 likely binds to an exclusive site on PTEN, the next goal was to identify residues critical for activation and phosphatase action. The two most obvious candidates are the known lipid-binding sites, which include the proposed N-terminal domain and the C2 lipid-binding domain (17Lee J.-O. Yang H. Georgescu M.-M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Studies of other PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins have led to a consensus sequence for PIP binding (18Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and two groups have proposed a PI(4,5)P2-binding site at the PTEN N terminus that is distinct from the phosphatase active site (16Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 247-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 19Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Finally, there is a C2 lipid-binding domain in the C terminus that binds a variety of lipid types (17Lee J.-O. Yang H. Georgescu M.-M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Phospholipid binding to the C2 domain is dependent upon a series of positively charged residues in the CBR3 loop, and M-CBR3, a mutant C2 domain with four alanines substituted for four lysines (Fig. 5A), completely lacked phospholipid membrane binding (17Lee J.-O. Yang H. Georgescu M.-M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). We first tested mutations in the N terminus. Mutations of lysine 13 or arginine 14, which are part of the consensus sequence for the PI(4,5)P2-binding motif, reduced the rates of hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 in both the absence and presence of PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5, B and C). In addition, mutation of arginine 15 to alanine occurs in human cancers and is reported to reduce PTEN activity (3Steck P.A. Pershouse M.A. Jasser S.A. Yung W.K.A. Lin H. Ligon A.H. Langford L.A. Baumgard M.L. Hattier T. Davis T. Frye C. Hu R. Swedlund B. Teng D.H.F. Tavtigian S.V. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 6Furnari F.B. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5002-5008PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement, we found that the R15A mutant PTEN completely lacked activity in both the presence and absence of the PI(4,5)P2 activator (data not shown). Finally, the M-CBR3 mutant PTEN showed activation by PI(4,5)P2, but activity was somewhat diminished (Fig. 5D). These data confirm the critical role of the N terminus in PTEN activity and show that the C2 phospholipid-binding site is not required for activation by PI(4,5)P2. In this study, we propose that PI(4,5)P2 binds to a site distinct from the phosphatase active site, induces an allosteric conformational change, and, thereby, activates PTEN, leading to a positive feedback loop for PTEN activity. The activator- and substrate-binding sites must be distinct, because the active site is not large enough to bind PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 simultaneously (17Lee J.-O. Yang H. Georgescu M.-M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), and if PI(4,5)P2 did bind to the active site, it would be a competitive inhibitor, which is obviously not the case. Finally, activation of PTEN was half-maximal at 20.2 ± 3.8 μm PI(4,5)P2. Since this value is close to the effective concentration of PI(4,5)P2 in cells, about 10 μm (15McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), PTEN activation is a likely mechanism for PIP regulation in cells. Our model predicts that PTEN would be preferentially activated at the PI(4,5)P2-bearing plasma membrane or at PI(4,5)P2-rich membrane domains. There are some similarities between our model for PTEN activation and that already proposed for protein kinase C. Both require membrane binding through two distinct sites, thereby insuring that activation occurs only at a membrane surface (20Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The activation of PTEN is specific for particular PIPs. PI(5)P and PI(4,5)P2 activate the PTEN phosphatase. However, PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,5)P2 do not show apparent activation. This specificity helps us to understand why activation is more apparent with PI(3,4)P2 as a substrate than with PI(3,4,5)P3 as a substrate. Hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P2 yields PI(4)P, which is not an activator. In contrast, hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3 yields a potent activator, PI(4,5)P2. Hence, the reaction accelerates as PI(3,4,5)P3 is hydrolyzed to PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1), forming a positive feedback loop. The analysis of PTEN mutants leads us to three conclusions concerning the mechanism of PTEN activation. First, because the N terminus has an apparent PI(4,5)P2-binding motif (Fig. 5A) and is required for association of Dictyostelium PTEN with the plasma membrane (19Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), the N terminus has been suggested as a PI(4,5)P2-binding site. We found that activation of PTEN by PI(4,5)P2 is consistent with a single binding site with K act = 20.2 ± 3.8 μm (Fig. 2C), and mutations in the N terminus severely decrease PTEN activity (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, the N terminus is the best candidate for the PI(4,5)P2-binding site. Second, the previous assignment (3Steck P.A. Pershouse M.A. Jasser S.A. Yung W.K.A. Lin H. Ligon A.H. Langford L.A. Baumgard M.L. Hattier T. Davis T. Frye C. Hu R. Swedlund B. Teng D.H.F. Tavtigian S.V. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar, 6Furnari F.B. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5002-5008PubMed Google Scholar) of arginine 15 as an essential residue for PTEN phosphatase activity is correct. Even in the presence of 45 μm PI(4,5)P2, which is nearly five times the effective concentration of this activator in cells, the R15A PTEN mutant shows no phosphatase activity. Third, because activation is observed for the M-CBR3 mutant PTEN (Fig. 5D), which lacks phospholipid binding to the C2 domain (17Lee J.-O. Yang H. Georgescu M.-M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), activation is not through the nonspecific C2 phospholipidbinding site. There are two caveats in this interpretation. First, even though the PTEN N terminus matches the PI(4,5)P2-binding motif exactly, PI(4,5)P2 binding for these motifs is dependent on the three-dimensional protein fold (15McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the first 13 residues of the N terminus are not included in the current PTEN crystal structure; further structural studies are needed to resolve this issue. Second, the N-terminal mutations might affect the folding of the PTEN phosphatase domain rather than altering PI(4,5)P2 binding. We believe that this is not likely, because the PI(4,5)P2-binding motif is distinct from the phosphatase active site. Furthermore, this region of PTEN is poorly ordered (17Lee J.-O. Yang H. Georgescu M.-M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), implying that the N terminus is flexible and, therefore, unlikely to affect the integrity of the phosphatase active site. While these data were being prepared for publication, two related publications appeared. First, Schaletzky et al. (21Schaletzky J. Dove S.K. Short B. Lorenzo O. Clague M.J. Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 504-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported that myotubularin, which hydrolyzes PI(3,5)P2 to PI(5)P, is activated by its PI(5)P product. It is intriguing that this PIP phosphatase is activated in a similar manner as PTEN, suggesting that positive feedback loops are a common mechanism for regulating PIP phosphatases. Second, McConnachie et al. (22McConnachie G. Pass I. Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found, using membrane-bound substrates, that PI(4,5)P2 activates PTEN. Although the mechanism was not certain, these authors suggested that the activation was due to increased binding of PTEN to the membrane, thereby increasing local concentration of the PI(3,4,5)P3 substrate. In this study, we used synthetic lipids with di-C8 fatty acid chains, and in all cases, these lipids were used at concentrations below the predicted CMC (see “Experimental Procedures”). Hence, at the concentrations used in these experiments, the PIPs do not form micelles or membranes. Therefore, there are no local concentration effects and we propose that activation occurs by a PI(4,5)P2-induced allosteric conformational change. The models presented in this study and McConnachie et al. (22McConnachie G. Pass I. Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) are not mutually exclusive, and our view is that both mechanisms are important for the regulation of PTEN. We thank P. Mitra for the GST-PTEN expression vector. We are grateful to C. Schiffer, D. Lambright, J. Gross, and W. Kobertz for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2036659707,"Thrombin bound to platelets contributes to stop bleeding and, in pathological conditions, may cause vascular thrombosis. We have determined the structure of platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha (GpIbalpha) bound to thrombin at 2.3 angstrom resolution and defined two sites in GpIbalpha that bind to exosite II and exosite I of two distinct alpha-thrombin molecules, respectively. GpIbalpha occupancy may be sequential, as the site binding to alpha-thrombin exosite I appears to be cryptic in the unoccupied receptor but exposed when a first thrombin molecule is bound through exosite II. These interactions may modulate alpha-thrombin function by mediating GpIbalpha clustering and cleavage of protease-activated receptors, which promote platelet activation, while limiting fibrinogen clotting through blockade of exosite I."

Evidence is presented here that CH3Cl is produced in many terrestrial environments by a common mechanism. Abiotic conversion of chloride to CH3Cl occurs readily in plant material, with the widespread plant component pectin acting as a methyl donor. Significant CH3Cl emissions from senescent and dead leaves were observed at ambient temperatures; those emissions rose dramatically when temperatures increased. This ubiquitous process acting in terrestrial ecosystems and during biomass burning could contribute the bulk of atmospheric CH3Cl."

We have determined the 1.45-Å resolution crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of EB1, which is essential for microtubule binding, and show that it forms a calponin homology (CH) domain fold that is found in many proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton. The functional CH domain for actin binding is a tandem pair, whereas EB1 is the first example of a single CH domain that can associate with the microtubule filament. Although our biochemical study shows that microtubule binding of EB1 is electrostatic in part, our mutational analysis suggests that the hydrophobic network, which is partially exposed in our crystal structure, is also important for the association. We propose that, like other actin-binding CH domains, EB1 employs the hydrophobic interaction to bind to microtubules.

The organization and dynamics of MT polymers are highly regulated, and numerous proteins including MT-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors have been proposed as possible regulatory factors (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar).MTs have an intrinsic structural polarity, consisting of a highly dynamic plus-end toward the cell periphery and a centrosome-associated minus-end. Their dynamics involve alternating phases of growth and shortening, known as dynamic instability (2Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Dynamic instability is modulated by various MAPs and motor proteins, some of which act to promote MT assembly and stability, whereas others induce their depolymerization (3Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Two groups of proteins that specifically bind to the MT plus-ends, termed “plus-end-tracking proteins” or +TIPs (4Schuyler S. Pellman D. Cell. 2001; 105: 421-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) have been identified: the CAP-Gly proteins (e.g. CLIP-170, p150glued of dynactin) and the EB1 family proteins (5Perez F.

Although they can bind to MTs independently, evidence for interactions among them have led to the hypothesis of a “plus-end complex” (8Schroer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Ligon L.A. Shelly S.S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1405-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The main function of a plus-end complex may be the regulation of MT dynamics, but the mechanisms are poorly understood.EB1 was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen by its binding to the carboxyl terminus of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein (10Su L.K. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Wiltshire R. Trent J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2972-2977PubMed Google Scholar), which may be essential for the tumor-suppressing function of APC (11Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). Proteins homologous to EB1 have been identified in many organisms from yeast to human and have been shown to interact with MT plus-ends (6Vaughan K.T. Tynan S.H. Faulkner N.E. Echeverri C.J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 865-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition, the APC carboxyl terminus cooperates with EB1 functionally to stabilize MTs (18Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1062-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Recent biological studies have revealed that EB1 consists of an amino-terminal MT-binding (En) domain and a carboxyl-terminal APC-binding domain (19Barth A.I. Siemers K.A. Nelson W.J.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1583-1590PubMed Google Scholar, 20Askham J.M. Vaughan K.T. Goodson H.V. Morrison E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3627-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To understand the structural basis of EB1 function in MT binding, we have determined the crystal structure of human En (residues Met-1— Arg-130). The unexpected structural similarity with the calponin homology domain led us to test the MT binding of En with mutagenesis, showing that the interaction is both hydrophobic and electrostatic in nature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The human EB1 amino-terminal MT-binding domain (residues 1–130) was generated by PCR from a human adult brain cDNA library and cloned into pET15b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The recombinant protein with His6 tag was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cell lysate was applied to a nickel-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The eluted protein was digested with thrombin protease (Sigma) to remove the His6 tag and purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein fractions were pooled, concentrated to 15 mg/ml in the same buffer as in gel filtration, and used for crystallization. SeMet-substituted proteins were expressed as described previously (21Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C.M. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and purified as for the wild type protein.Single amino acid mutations were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The correct sequences of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. En mutants were expressed in E. coli cells and purified as described for the wild type.Crystallography—Crystals were grown at room temperature by a sitting drop vapor diffusion method, mixing 2 μl of protein solution with an equal volume of reservoir solution. The crystals of the P21 space group were grown over a reservoir with 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0. Another crystal form (P43212) was grown over a reservoir containing 3 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5. Both crystal forms contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. All crystals were transferred to a cryosolvent containing 20% glycerol in their mother liquors and frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K.All diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) on X8C and X12C beamlines using Quantum-4 CCD detectors (ADSC). Data sets were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 227: 366-396Google Scholar). SOLVE was used to find selenium sites in the P21 crystal form and to generate the initial phases at 1.8 Å resolution. The initial phases were extended to 1.45 Å and improved by DM (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). A molecular mask was built using a solvent content of 55% in the unit cell. Initial model was built automatically with the ARP-wARP program (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The tracing was completed using XTALVIEW (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). The model was refined by maximum-likelihood method using REFMAC5 (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The structure of another crystal form was solved by molecular replacement with the program CNS (25Brünger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) using the P21 crystal structure as a search model.Microtubule Pelleting Assay—Purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was polymerized in PEM-G (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm GTP) with 10 μm taxol (Sigma) at a concentration of 50 μm for 30 min at 30 °C. Tubulin was diluted to 10 μm with PEM-G, 10 μm taxol and incubated for another 10 min. 100 μl of tubulin solution was mixed with 10 μg of En or its mutants and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. En bound to polymerized tubulin was precipitated by centrifugation through a 50% sucrose cushion for 30 min at room temperature at 90,000 rpm in an MLA-130 rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure of En—Attempts to crystallize the human full-length EB1 protein (268 amino acids) were unsuccessful. Trypsin cleavage generated a proteolytically resistant domain, amino-terminal residues 1–130, that includes the MT-binding domain as previously reported (19Barth A.I. Siemers K.A. Nelson W.J.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1583-1590PubMed Google Scholar, 20Askham J.M. Vaughan K.T. Goodson H.V. Morrison E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3627-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This fragment formed crystals under two sets of conditions, both of which diffracted X-rays to high resolution. The initial crystals diffracted to 1.45 Å resolution, and the structure was determined by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction (Table I) from a selenomethionine derivative. Interpretable electron density was observed for all residues. The structure of a second crystal form was determined to 2.4 Å by molecular replacement using the first structure as a search model. We could not observe ordered electron density for two loop regions located in the amino and carboxyl termini (residues 8–13 and 123–126).Table ICrystallographic statisticsSpace groupP21P43212Unit cell dimensionsa = 31.9 Å, b = 48.5 Å, c = 45.0 Å, β = 103.4°a = 48.6 Å, c = 90.3 ÅData setNativePeakEdgeRemoteX-ray sourceX8cX8cX8cX8cX12cWavelength (Å)0.98000.97920.97940.91840.9790Data range (Å)20.0-1.4520.0-1.820.0-1.820.0-1.850-2.4Unique reflections237981193612052151834615Completeness (%)aNumbers in parentheses refer to statistics for the highest shell of data.99.0 (97.8)99.8 (99.3)99.6 (97.9)99.5 (96.8)98.1 (98.2)I/σ(I)aNumbers in parentheses refer to statistics for the highest shell of data.21.1 (6.99)26.1 (13.4)27.3 (16.5)26.5 (12.7)26.4 (0.7)R mergeaNumbers in parentheses refer to statistics for the highest shell of data.,bR merge = Σ |I obs - 〈I〉|/ΣI obs, where I obs is the intensity measurement and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity for multiply recorded reflections (22).0.042 (0.192)0.041 (0.150)0.033 (0.088)0.035 (0.126)0.109 (0.282)Overall figure of meritSOLVE 0.85DM 0.94RefinementResolution range (Å)20.0-1.4510.0-2.4No. of reflections in working set210934481R cryst (R free)cR cryst and R free = Σ ∥F obs| - |F calc∥/|F obs| for reflections in the working and test sets, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The En structure (Fig. 1a), which is globular with dimensions of 25 × 30 × 30 Å, comprises six α-helices. The architecture of the domain is dominated by four major α-helices (α1, α3, α4, and α6). The first helix (α1) forms an angle of ∼75° with the central helices α3 and α4. Three helices, α3, α4, and α6, form a parallel three-helix bundle, giving rise to a hydrophobic core. α4 and α6 are partially exposed to the solvent, creating a conserved hydrophobic cleft that provides a potential protein interaction surface (Fig. 2). Another potential MT-binding surface consists of a basic cluster (59KKVK62) located in the loop between α3 and α4 together with conserved Lys-76 in α4, because many MAPs possess a basic patch and are proposed to bind to the acidic tail of tubulin (26Nogales, E., Whittaker, M., Milligan, R. A., and Downing, K. H. Cell, 96, 79–88Google Scholar). The backbone atoms of Lys-62 form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of invariant Asn-74 in α4 (Fig. 3), representing a rigid basic loop structure.Fig. 2Surface properties of En.

Residues mutated in this study (Lys-59, Lys-60, and Lys-89) are boxed in blue.

Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we found that the En structure has a calponin homology (CH) domain fold as seen in many actin-binding proteins (Fig. 4). The most closely related proteins are spectrin (Protein Data Bank code 1BKR; Z-score = 10.6; root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) = 2.3 Å over 97 Cα atoms; Ref. 28Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D.

The core structure is conserved among all the CH domains, except En has extra residues at its amino and carboxyl termini.Fig. 4Structural comparisons of En. En structure is compared with domains of spectrin, fimbrin, and calponin. Protein Data Bank codes are shown in parentheses. Orientations are the same as in Fig. 1a. Helices are colored from the amino terminus: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A tandem pair of CH domains, each consisting of about 100 amino acids, has been suggested to confer actin binding on a variety of cytoskeletal and signaling events (31Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although a BLAST search against EB1 failed to find sequence similarity with other CH domains, some of the aromatic residues in the En core region are conserved throughout the CH domain family (Fig. 3), suggesting that they are essential for maintaining the tertiary structure. In particular, Trp-23 in EB1 is identical within the CH domain family (30Bramham J. Hodgkinson J.L. Smith B.O. Uhrin D. Barlow P.N. Winder S.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The aromatic ring of Trp-23 forms nonpolar interactions with the aliphatic side chain of Lys-112 and the aromatic ring of Phe-115 (Fig. 1b). Lys-112 and Phe-115 are mostly conserved as the hydrophobic residues in the EB1 family.Potential Phosphorylation Sites—In our crystal structure, we found that Ser-16 and Thr-33 are exposed to solvent (Fig. 1a). Ser-16 locates to the entrance of α1 and is found in all species studied except for Arabidopsis thaliana. Ser-16 resides within the recognition sequence of protein kinase CKI/II, such that Ser-16 could be one of the determinants to regulate MT movement by phosphorylation. Thr-33, which lies in the loop region between α1 and α2, is conserved as Thr or Ser in many species. However, this residue does not belong to any known kinase recognition sequence predicted from NetPhos2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/). The remaining Ser and Thr residues are mostly buried in the molecule and vary among the species. Thus far phosphorylation sites of EB1 have not been reported, and the kinase regulation of EB1 still remains in question.Microtubule Binding—MT-binding motifs have a net positive charge that is thought to be important for binding to the acidic carboxyl-terminal region of tubulin. This acidic region is located on the outer surface of microtubules, providing an accessible site for MAPs (26Nogales, E., Whittaker, M., Milligan, R. A., and Downing, K. H. Cell, 96, 79–88Google Scholar). On the other hand, the actin-binding sites in many CH domains are predominantly hydrophobic in nature (29Goldsmith S.C. Pokala N. Shen W. Fedorov A.A. Matsudaira P. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which correspond to α1 of the first CH domain of the tandem repeat and α5 and α6 of the second repeat (Fig. 3). From our crystal structure, we predict two potential MT-binding sites: one involving the loop region with the basic cluster between α3 and α4 and another within the conserved hydrophobic cleft encompassed by α5 and α6.To investigate whether the interaction between EB1 and MTs is electrostatic, we tested MT-binding ability with various salt concentrations (Fig. 5a). En co-sedimented with MTs at physiological ionic strength (NaCl = 150 mm). On increasing the salt concentration above 200 mm, En could not bind MTs. This observation suggests that the binding affinity is, at least in part, electrostatic.Fig. 5Interaction of En with MTs. a, co-sedimentation of En with MTs in various salt concentrations. Over the range of physiological salt concentration (≥0.2 m NaCl), En cannot co-sediment with MTs. b, mutational analysis of the interaction between En and MTs. En bound to MTs is shown in the upper section, whereas the lower section shows the supernatant of the co-sedimentation assay. c, stereo view of the environment of Lys-89. Lys-89 is colored in blue, and the surrounding hydrophobic residues are in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To define the MT-binding site on En, we made double and single mutants (K59E/K60E and K89E) to give a strong electrostatic effect on En. Lys-59 and Lys-60 are located in the basic cluster, whereas Lys-89 is close to the hydrophobic cleft described above. Mutants were correctly folded as judged by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Wild type and K59E/K60E co-sedimented with MTs, whereas K89E abolished binding (Fig. 5b). Our crystal structure shows that the surrounding environment of highly conserved Lys-89 is identical and hydrophobic in EB1 (Fig. 5c); its aliphatic side chain is located in the middle of the aromatic stack of Phe-107, Trp-110, and Phe-114. Phe-107 forms a further nonpolar interaction with Phe-44. In addition, the mutation of invariant Trp-110 causes a destabilization of En structure, resulting in the loss of expression in E. coli cells. Taken together, we propose that En utilizes the hydrophobic network for MT binding as well as for the maintenance of the CH domain structure.A yeast genetic study of the EB1 homolog BIM1 suggested that the locus of the interaction is near the carboxyl terminus of α-tubulin (13Schwartz K. Richards K. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our data show that En binding is electrostatic but also suggest that the solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch may be the main binding site for MTs. The sequence of the α-tubulin tail (399EEEGEEY405) has a conserved aromatic residue at the carboxyl terminus, which may serve as a potential anchor for the hydrophobic interaction.A recent crystal structure of another MT plus-end-binding motif, the CAP-Gly domain, revealed no structural similarity with En (33Li S. Finley J. Liu Z.J. Qiu S.H. Chen H. Luan C.H. Carson M. Tsao J. Johnson D. Lin G. Zhao J. Thomas W. Nagy L.A. Sha B. DeLucas L.J. Wang B.C. Luo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48596-48601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the CAP-Gly domain structure, an invariable sequence is located in a groove surrounded by β-sheets, which is proposed to mediate MT binding. It should be noted that there is a conserved hydrophobic cluster within the groove. Further mutagenesis or structural analysis is required to determine a common mechanism of plus-end binding.The CH domain architecture is emerging as a filamentous protein interaction module in a number of cytoskeletal proteins. In previous reports, the functional CH domain for actin binding is suggested to be a tandem pair, whereas the actin-binding ability of the single CH domain is still ambiguous (30Bramham J. Hodgkinson J.L. Smith B.O. Uhrin D. Barlow P.N. Winder S.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K.

We propose that, similar to actin-binding CH domains, En employs predominantly hydrophobic interactions to bind to MTs.

The organization and dynamics of MT polymers are highly regulated, and numerous proteins including MT-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors have been proposed as possible regulatory factors (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). MTs have an intrinsic structural polarity, consisting of a highly dynamic plus-end toward the cell periphery and a centrosome-associated minus-end. Their dynamics involve alternating phases of growth and shortening, known as dynamic instability (2Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Dynamic instability is modulated by various MAPs and motor proteins, some of which act to promote MT assembly and stability, whereas others induce their depolymerization (3Desai A. Verma S.

Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The contribution of translational control in FGF-2 gene expression has been particularly well documented. First, a process of alternative initiation of translation occurs on the unique FGF-2 mRNA and leads to the production of five FGF-2 protein isoforms with extended NH2-terminal ends (2Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3978-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 3Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P.

Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Second, translation of four of these isoforms is initiated at non-canonical CUG codons (2Florkiewicz R.Z.

Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Third, the use of alternative initiation codons is controlled in transformed and stressed cells (5Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fourth, protein synthesis on the FGF-2 mRNA can occur by internal ribosome entry (6Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Whereas the usual mechanism of translation in eukaryotes involves the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the 5′-cap structure of the mRNA, a restricted but growing number of viral and cellular mRNA initiate their translation through the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to internal sequences of the mRNA called IRES (7Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 8Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 9Bonnal S. Boutonnet C. Prado-Lourenco L. Vagner S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As regards the FGF-2 mRNA, this process is active in vivo in transgenic mice (10Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the FGF-2 IRES is able to contribute to the choice of initiation codons because translation at the cap-proximal CUG codon occurs by a cap-dependent process, whereas translation at the other four codons occurs by an IRES-based mechanism (4Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To understand translation initiation codon selection in the FGF-2 mRNA, it is therefore important to define the cis-elements required for FGF-2 IRES function. The RNA sequences and structural features of cellular IRESs remain largely unknown. Various attempts to define the cis-acting elements required for the function of cellular IRES have failed to find a common RNA sequence. Cellular IRES seem to be very diverse in nature, without stringent sequence similarity. Because IRES elements in viral RNA genomes contain higher order structures whose integrities are essential for IRES activity, it was proposed that eukaryotic IRESs could also share some common RNA structural determinants. A Y-shaped double hairpin RNA secondary structure was found in various cellular IRESs (11Le S.Y. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although its functional role has never been clearly demonstrated. The only experimentally determined RNA secondary structure model of a cellular IRES revealed that the c-myc IRES contains a number of structural motifs, including a pseudoknot helix, but not the predicted Y-shaped structure (12Le Quesne J.P. Stoneley M. Fraser G.A. Willis A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, our goal was to determine the secondary structure of the FGF-2 5′-ATR with chemical and enzymatic probing experiments and to precisely define the RNA sequences and structural determinants required for internal entry of ribosomes at each of the four IRES-dependent translation initiation codons. Our initial expectation, because of the reported modular nature of IRES, was that each of the initiation codons would be controlled by a distinct IRES element. A mutation and deletion study led us to show that a single IRES was able to control translation initiations at four downstream initiation codons in the FGF-2 mRNA. The FGF-2 IRES is 176 nucleotides long, is highly structured, and contains two RNA stem-loops and a G quartet motif, each of which contributes to IRES activity.

DNA Transfection and Luciferase Activities—The SK-Hep 1 human hepatoma cell line was transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 60-mm tissue culture dish with the Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were prepared 24 to 36 h after transfection and analyzed for luciferase activities by using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described in Ref. 13Huez I.

Structural-probing Reactions on in Vitro-synthesized RNA—In vitro-transcribed RNA (4 pmol) was denatured for 1 min at 95 °C and chilled on ice for 5 min. Incubation was continued for 10 min at 25 °C after addition of the various reaction buffers (10 mm HEPES-Na+, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 for RNases T1 (Invitrogen) and V1 (Kemotex); 50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 for CMCT; 25 mm cacodylate-Na+, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 for DMS and kethoxal). Chemical modifications with DMS, CMCT, and kethoxal were done during 5, 20, and 15 min, respectively, in a 25-μl final volume as described previously (14Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestions were done with 0.05 units of RNase T1 or 0.0002 units of RNase V1 for 10 min at 25 °C. For primer extensions, the five different primers (RT75, 5′-CCCACCAGCCTCCCGCGC-3′; RT205, 5′-CGCCGCCTGGGGAGAGCC-3′; RT285, 5′-CGCTCTTCTGTCCGCCGGC-3′; RT365, 5′-CCCGGCCCCGGCCCCCC-3′; and RT445, 5′-GGATCCCCGAGCCGCTGGA-3′) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and combined with 2 pmol of synthetic RNA. Hybridization and reverse transcription with the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were carried out as described previously (14Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 8 m urea. Secondary Structure of the FGF-2 5′-ATR—The secondary structure of the FGF-2 5′ ATR RNA was determined by analyzing its enzymatic cleavage and chemical modification pattern obtained in native conditions in solution. The probing experiments were performed using an unlabeled in vitro-transcribed RNA corresponding to the first 539 nucleotides of the human FGF-2 mRNA. We subjected this RNA to partial RNase digestions with RNases T1 or V1. RNase T1 is known to cut in the 3′ direction from G residues present in single-stranded regions, whereas RNase V1 cuts indicate doubled-stranded or stacked bases. We also used limited chemical modifications with three chemical probing agents, DMS, CMCT, and kethoxal, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sites of cleavage or modification were then identified by primer extension with reverse transcriptase, using various radiolabeled oligonucleotides complementary to five FGF-2 ATR sequences. Analysis of the resulting cDNAs was performed on sequencing polyacrylamide gels that were run together with the corresponding RNA sequencing ladder to allow identification of the modified residues. A typical example of the results is shown in Fig. 1. A secondary structural model, presented in Fig. 2, was further derived by combining experimental data and free energy data calculated using the mFOLD program (15Zuker M. Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2707-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The overall secondary structure of FGF-2 5′-ATR appears as a succession of six independent stem-loop structures (labeled I to VI) (Fig. 2). The stem-loops are separated by short regions, most of which are single stranded (I–IV), or are directly adjacent (IV–VI). Because of the length and high GC content of their stems, these stem-loops are probably very stable, which is also indicated by the absence of reactivity toward the single strand-specific probes and the numerous V1 cleavages within the stems. Some irregularities are present in the stems because of some bulged residues and internal loops. Some of these internal loops do possess some degree of order, as indicated by the presence of RNase V1 cuts concomitant with single strand-specific probes. This reflects the possible dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformation in these regions (e.g. regions 194/216 and 305/348). Within the FGF-2 5′ ATR reactivity pattern, one region (involving nt 57–108) was particularly remarkable. Thus, this region was poorly reactive to probing and prediction structure programs failed to predict any structure involving it. The presence of strong pauses of reverse transcriptase progression immediately before this purine-rich region led us to test for the presence of an intramolecular purine-quartet. In a G quartet, the guanines are hydrogen-bonded via Hoogsteen base pairs in a square-planar symmetric array, and the quadruplex is stabilized by coordination of a monovalent K+ ion within the planes of the guanine tetrads (16Laughlan G. Murchie A.I. Norman D.G. Moore M.H. Moody P.C. Lilley D.M. Luisi B. Science. 1994; 265: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The formation and stability of G quartets is cation-dependent, with a preference for K+ over Na+ or Li+ (17Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We therefore performed reverse transcriptase reactions with either KCl, NaCl, or LiCl in the reaction buffer and found that stops of reverse transcriptase progression at positions U94, G101–102, U103, G104, and A106 in KCl-containing buffer disappeared in NaCl- or LiCl-containing buffers (Fig. 3A). Because the guanines in between positions 57 to 102 are accessible to neither RNase T1 digestion nor DMS modification (position N1), we propose the presence of a G quartet in this region (Fig. 3B). Stem-loop II Is Critical for IRES Activity at the CUG1 Codon—To analyze the elements of the FGF-2 5′-ATR required for IRES activity, we used the bicistronic vector assay in which translation of the first cistron is cap-dependent and translation of the second cistron is IRES-dependent (7Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 8Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Sachs A.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 243-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bicistronic mRNAs containing an upstream Renilla reniformis luciferase open reading frame and a downstream firefly luciferase (LucF) open reading frame were expressed from plasmid vectors transfected into the SK-Hep1 human liver adenocarcinoma cell line, which was previously shown to harbor FGF-2 IRES activity (10Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine the elements required for IRES activity at each of the initiation codons, we used constructs in which the downstream LucF open reading frame was inserted either at the CUG1/320 (pCRFL1), CUG2/347 (pCRFL2), CUG3/362 (pCRFL3), or AUG/485 (pCRFL4) positions (Fig. 4). Moreover, to avoid LucF activity coming from upstream in-frame translation initiations, an in-frame UAG termination codon was inserted just upstream of AUG485 in the pCRFL4 plasmid and the CUG1 and/or CUG2 codons were mutated to non-initiating UUA codons in the pCRFL2 and pCRFL3 plasmids. Because in these vectors the R. reniformis luciferase activity reflects capdependent translation and is expected to be proportional to the amount of RNA produced, whereas LucF activity measures the IRES activity, the firefly/R. reniformis luciferase ratio gives the IRES activity normalized to the amount of RNA produced (10Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Compared with the entire FGF-2 5′-ATR, in which the relative luciferase activity was set to an arbitrary value of 100% (pCRFL/100%), a control bicistronic vector that contains a short hairpin structure between the two cistrons functioned more than 10 times less efficiently in mediating second cistron translation (pCRHL/8%) (Fig. 4). The luciferase activity for plasmids pCRFL1 to pCRLF4 was between 59 and 69%, showing that an IRES activity can be measured at each of these four initiation codons. We therefore confirmed our previous observations (6Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) that four translation initiation codons on the FGF-2 mRNA can be selected by an internal ribosome entry process. To localize the element(s) required for IRES activity at the CUG1 codon, we measured the relative luciferase efficiencies of a set of plasmid constructs containing various ATR deletions in the intercistronic space in the pCRFL1 background (Fig. 5A). The IRES activity at the CUG1 position was strongly reduced when the first 294 nucleotides of the FGF-2 5′ATR were deleted, indicating that the IRES is within this sequence. The IRES activity decreased slightly after deletion of domain III (Δ177/221) (Fig. 5A). However, deletion of domain I (Δ1/49), G4 (Δ56/104), or of the single-stranded region between domains G4 and II (Δ105/126) decreased IRES activity at the CUG1 position (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, deletions of domains II and III together (Δ127/221), domain II alone (Δ127/176), or part of domain II (Δ128/144) strongly decreased IRES activity at CUG1 (Fig. 5A). We therefore concluded that various elements in domains I, G4, and II, but not in domain III, contribute to IRES activity and that a 17-nucleotide region located within domain II, at positions 128–144 of the FGF-2 5′-ATR, is the main element required for IRES activity at CUG1. The Same 17-Nucleotide Region in Domain II Is Required for IRES-mediated Translation at Four Downstream Translation Initiation Codons—We next sought to determine whether nucleotides 128–144 of domain II would also be responsible for IRES activity at the CUG2 and CUG3 codons. To address this point, we deleted nucleotides 128 to 144 in the pCRFL2 and pCRFL3 background (Fig. 5, B and C). The results showed that this deletion affected IRES activity at the CUG2 and CUG3 positions (Fig. 5, B and C). The same strategy was used to localize the element(s) required for IRES activity at the AUG/485 codon, and various deletion constructs were made in the pCRFL4 background. As shown in Fig. 5D, deletions of the first 314, 338, or 377 nucleotides of the FGF-2 ATR strongly affected the IRES activity at the AUG, showing that the elements required for IRES activity at this codon were not located in its close vicinity and might be present in the first 314 nucleotides of the FGF-2 ATR. Indeed, deletion of part of domain II (Δ128/144) strongly decreased IRES activity at the AUG (Fig. 5D). Because the overall structure of the FGF-2 ATR, as determined by structural probing experiments, is not affected by deletion of stem-loop II (data not shown), we concluded that stem-loop II, located 308 nucleotides upstream of the AUG, is required for IRES activity at the AUG. Moreover, these data demonstrate that the same features are necessary for IRES-mediated translation at four downstream initiation codons. The ability of the FGF-2 IRES to control translation initiation at four downstream codons was also observed in the Saos-2 osteosarcoma and SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cell lines that harbor strong FGF-2 IRES activity (10Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of nucleotides 128–144 led to a 3–4-fold reduction in IRES activity in these cell lines (data not shown). The Integrity of Stem-loop II Is Required for IRES Activity— To test the structure of stem-loop II more thoroughly, we generated deletions and mutations in this region in the context of bicistronic luciferase construct pCRFL1. We first mutagenized the loop structure of stem-loop II. Deletion (Δ141/152) or mutation (M142/150) of loop II led to a strong reduction in IRES activity (Fig. 6). We next mutagenized a nine-nucleotide sequence (position 132–140) that was identical to a region present in the Gtx 5′-untranslated region shown to mediate an interaction with the 18 S ribosomal RNA (19Hu M.C. Tranque P. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and internal entry of ribosomes (20Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, mutation of this sequence in the FGF-2 context (M132/140) did not affect IRES activity (Fig. 6). Mutation of the other side of the stem (M156/160) had no consequences on IRES activity (Fig. 6). Overall, these data show that the loop sequence in stem-loop II is required for IRES activity. A 176-Nucleotide RNA Module Is Sufficient to Confer IRES Activity—To determine whether stem-loop II was sufficient to mediate internal entry of ribosomes, we tested the IRES activity of a construct that contained domain II from positions 126 to 176 (pCRFL1 126/176). Because this activity was very weak compared with the pCRFL1 parental construct (Fig. 7), we concluded that stem-loop II cannot function on its own as an IRES. Surrounding sequences were then progressively added to find the minimal FGF-2 IRES sequence. The IRES activity of a construct that contained sequences normally located downstream of stem-loop II (pCRFL1 Δ1/126) was still very weak, showing that sequences downstream of residue 176 are dispensable for IRES function. However, we found that constructs containing sequences normally located upstream of stem-loop II (pCRFL1 1/176 or pCRFL4 1/176) gave strong IRES activities that were very close to those of the parental constructs (pCRFL1 or pCRFL4) (Fig. 7, A and B). Deletion of stem-loop I alone (pCRFL1 50/176), stem-loop I and half of the G4 domain together (pCRFL1 76/176 or pCRFL4 76/176), or stem-loop II alone (pCRFL1 1/126 or pCRFL4 1/126) in this 176-nt fragment reduced IRES activity. We therefore concluded that a 176-nt sequence is necessary and sufficient for IRES activity. We report here the RNA sequence and structural determinants of the FGF-2 IRES. Compared with other cellular IRES, in which the IRES has been localized and shown to function in a modular fashion, with each module able to contribute singly to IRES activity (12Le Quesne J.P. Stoneley M. Fraser G.A. Willis A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Yang Q. Sarnow P.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5429-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the FGF-2 IRES contains a single module. This module is 176 nt long and is composed of two stem-loops and a G quartet motif. Studying the process of internal entry of ribosomes on the alternatively translated FGF-2 mRNA therefore allowed us to define novel structural determinants of IRES function. Strikingly, none of the known RNA features involved in IRES function are present in the FGF-2 IRES module. For instance, the FGF-2 IRES lacks the polypyrimidine tract required for IRES function of several cellular IRESs (23Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 24Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34586-34591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 IRES contains a nine-nt sequence that is also present in the Gtx IRES and that functions on its own as an IRES (20Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, mutation of these nine nucleotides in the FGF-2 context did not impair internal entry of ribosomes. Several higher-order structures are also involved in IRES function. For instance, pseudoknot structures were shown to be required in various IRES (12Le Quesne J.P. Stoneley M. Fraser G.A. Willis A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Wang C. Le S.Y. Ali N. Siddiqui A. RNA. 1995; 1: 526-537PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wilson J.E. Powell M.J. Hoover S.E.

Furthermore, stem-loop structures containing a GNRA motif are shared by several picornavirus IRESs (29Robertson M.E. Seamons R.A. Belsham G.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Martinez-Salas E. Quinto S.L. Ramos R. Fernandez-Miragall O. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and could be involved in RNA-RNA tertiary interactions. We could find no evidence of the existence of such structures in loops I and II of the FGF-2 IRES. The lack of similarities between the FGF-2 IRES and other cellular or viral IRES could therefore reflect its unique property of being regulated at given physiological conditions by specific IRES trans-acting factors. Indeed, we have recently shown that the FGF-2 IRES does not require some of the classic IRES trans-acting factors, such as hnRNP I/PTB and La autoantigen; instead, we have demonstrated the role of hnRNP A1 as a novel IRES trans-acting factor for FGF-2-mediated translation. 2S. Bonnal, C. Orsini, F. Parker, A. C. Prats, and S. Vagner, submitted. More generally, because a wide variety of nucleotide sequences seem to function as IRES and several proteins were identified as IRES trans-acting factor, the mechanisms by which translation preinitiation complexes are recruited to IRES-containing mRNA are likely to be different and should provide several targets for translational regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, we have also found in this study that the FGF-2 IRES contains an intramolecular G quartet motif. Such a motif has never been described in IRES sequences. It was found in several mRNAs that are bound by the fragile X mental retardation protein (31Darnell J.C. Jensen K.B. Jin P. Brown V. Warren S.T. Darnell R.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 32Schaeffer C. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Moine H.

Eberwine J. Neuron. 2003; 37: 417-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 G quartet motif contributes to IRES activity and may therefore behave as a positive translational element. This is surprising given the reported role of purine-quartet motifs in translation repression (34Oliver A.W. Bogdarina I. Schroeder E. Taylor I.A. Kneale G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inefficient translation initiation at the cap-proximal CUG0 codon (4Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) may be explained by its localization within the G quartet. The binding of the fragile X mental retardation protein or other proteins to the FGF-2 G quartet motif and the role of these interactions in IRES-mediated translation await investigation. Finally, we report here the relative position of an IRES and of alternative translation start sites. Although IRESs have been shown to be present in many mRNAs that contain a single translation initiation codon, their existence has been demonstrated on several mRNAs containing alternative initiation codons. The logical expectation is that IRESs present in alternative translation initiation systems contribute to the selection of the cap-distal internal codon, whereas the cap-proximal codon is selected by a cap-dependent mechanism. This is indeed the case for the FGF-2 mRNA, in which translation initiation at the 5′-end proximal CUG codon occurs by a cap-dependent mechanism, whereas translation at the four downstream initiation codons occurs by an internal ribosome entry process (4Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We provide evidence in this study that the position of the IRES (i.e. overlapping the cap-proximal codon but upstream of the internal codons) may explain this fact. This situation has also been found in the Moloney murine leukemia virus gag mRNA, the human vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA, or the human PITSLRE protein kinases mRNA, in which an IRES is present between two translation initiation codons and leads to the selection of the internal codon, thereby contributing to the control of alternative initiation of translation (13Huez I.

Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Conversely, IRESs can also be found upstream from several translation initiation codons without an apparent contribution to the selection of the alternative initiation codon. This situation is encountered in foot-and-mouth disease virus (37Belsham G.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), c-myc (38Nanbru C. Lafon I. Audigier S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and FGF-2 mRNAs. Regarding the FGF-2 mRNA, a single IRES controls initiations at four downstream translation initiation codons located in a 308-nt RNA segment. After the first step of internal entry of ribosomes, which is determined by sequences present in the first 176 nt of the FGF-2 mRNA, the molecular events that will contribute to the selection of the four downstream initiation codons remain to be determined. Because the FGF-2 5′-leader is highly structured, a “leaky scanning” mechanism is very unlikely (41Kozak M. Gene. 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Although a ribosomal shunt mechanism (42Ryabova L.A. Pooggin M.M. Hohn T. Prog Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 1-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may account for selection of the four IRES-dependent translation initiation codons present in the human FGF-2 mRNA, we favor a model in which the choice of alternative initiation codons depending on a single IRES will result from alternative RNA conformations, controlled by trans-acting factors, that will in turn favor ribosome recruitment at each of the alternative initiation codon."

To probe this effect, we have measured the current fluctuations at high frequency (5 to 90 gigahertz) using a superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junction as an on-chip spectrum analyzer. By coupling this frequency-resolved noise detector to a quantum device, we can measure the high-frequency, nonsymmetrized noise as demonstrated for a Josephson junction. The same scheme is used to detect the current fluctuations arising from coherent charge oscillations in a two-level system, a superconducting charge qubit. A narrow band peak is observed in the spectral noise density at the frequency of the coherent charge oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2051992027,"Escape from the host erythrocyte by the invasive stage of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is a fundamental step in the pathogenesis of malaria of which little is known. Upon merozoite invasion of the host cell, the parasite becomes enclosed within a parasitophorous vacuole, the compartment in which the parasite undergoes growth followed by asexual division to produce 16–32 daughter merozoites. These daughter cells are released upon parasitophorous vacuole and erythrocyte membrane rupture. To examine the process of merozoite release, we used <i>P. falciparum</i> lines expressing green fluorescent protein-chimeric proteins targeted to the compartments from which merozoites must exit: the parasitophorous vacuole and the host erythrocyte cytosol. This allowed visualization of merozoite release in live parasites. Herein we provide the first evidence in live, untreated cells that merozoite release involves a primary rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane followed by a secondary rupture of the erythrocyte plasma membrane. We have confirmed, with the use of immunoelectron microscopy, that parasitophorous vacuole membrane rupture occurs before erythrocyte plasma membrane rupture in untransfected wild-type parasites. We have also demonstrated selective inhibition of each step in this two-step process of exit using different protease inhibitors, implicating the involvement of distinct proteases in each of these steps. This will facilitate the identification of the parasite and host molecules involved in merozoite release."

https://openalex.org/W2087314695,"WNT factors represent key mediators of many processes in animal development and homeostasis and act through a receptor complex comprised of members of the Frizzled and low density lipoprotein-related receptors (LRP). In mammals, 19 genes encoding Wingless and Int-related factor (WNTs), 10 encoding Frizzled, and 2 encoding LRP proteins have been identified, but little is known of the identities of individual Frizzled-LRP combinations mediating the effects of specific WNT factors. Additionally, several secreted modulators of WNT signaling have been identified, including at least three members of the Dickkopf family. WNT7A is a WNT family member expressed in the vertebrate central nervous system capable of modulating aspects of neuronal plasticity. Gene knock-out models in the mouse have revealed that WNT7A plays a role in cerebellar maturation, although its function in the development of distal limb structures and of the reproductive tract have been more intensely studied. To identify a receptor complex for this WNT family member, we have analyzed the response of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 to WNT7A. We find that PC12 cells are capable of responding to WNT7A as measured by increased beta-catenin stability and activation of a T-cell factor-based luciferase reporter construct and that these cells express three members of the Frizzled family (Frizzled-2, -5, and -7) and LRP6. Our functional analysis indicates that WNT7A can specifically act via a Frizzled-5.LRP6 receptor complex in PC12 cells and that this activity can be antagonized by Dickkopf-1 and Dickkopf-3."
https://openalex.org/W2008979272,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family members are transcription factors involved in important physiological processes, such as cellular proliferation and differentiation, regulation of energy homeostasis, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. Transcriptional activation by C/EBPα and C/EBPβ involves the coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which promote transcription by acetylating histones and recruiting basal transcription factors. In this study, we show that C/EBPδ is also using CBP as a coactivator. Based on sequence homology with C/EBPα and -β, we identify in C/EBPδ two conserved amino acid segments that are necessary for the physical interaction with CBP. Using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that mutation of these residues prevents CBP recruitment and diminishes the transactivating potential of C/EBPδ. In addition, our results indicate that C/EBP family members not only recruit CBP but specifically induce its phosphorylation. We provide evidence that CBP phosphorylation depends on its interaction with C/EBPδ and define point mutations within one of the two conserved amino acid segments of C/EBPδ that abolish CBP phosphorylation as well as transcriptional activation, suggesting that this new mechanism could be important for C/EBP-mediated transcription."

In this study, we investigated the role of the pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins (SP) A and D, in the clearance of Hc yeast from the lung. Exposure of yeast to either collectin induced a dose-dependent decrease in [3H]leucine incorporation by several strains of Hc. This decrement was attributed to killing of the collectin-exposed yeast since it failed to grow on agar medium. Exposure to SP-A or -D resulted in increased yeast permeability based on a leak of protein from the organism and enhanced access of an impermeant substrate to intracellular alkaline phosphatase. Inbred and outbred SP-A null (-/-) mice were modestly more susceptible to pulmonary infection with Hc than strain and age-matched SP-A (+/+) control mice. The increase in susceptibility was associated with a decrement in the number of CD8+ cells in the lungs of SP-A-/- mice. Neither SP-A nor SP-D inhibited the growth of macrophage-internalized Hc. We conclude that the SP-A and SP-D are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the growth of Hc by increasing permeability of the organism and that Hc gains asylum from collectin-mediated killing by rapid entry into pulmonary macrophages.

Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) 1The abbreviations used are: Hc, H. capsulatum; CFU, colony-forming units; SP-A, surfactant protein A; SP-D, surfactant protein D; APP, alveolar proteinosis protein. is a dimorphic fungal pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of human disease. The organism is endemic to the midwestern and southeastern United States and is the most common cause of pulmonary fungal infection in the country. Inhalation of Hc usually results in a self-limited flu-like illness that is associated with inflammatory pulmonary infiltrates. In a smaller proportion of individuals, Hc can cause a more serious pneumonitis or a chronic cavitary pulmonary infection. The organism also can act as an opportunistic pathogen and can cause progressive, disseminated disease in immunosuppressed patients (1Deepe G.S.J. Mandell G. Bennett J. Dolin R. Principles and Practices in Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. Churchill Livingston, Philadelphia1999: 2718-2734Google Scholar). After inhalation into the distal airspaces, Hc is internalized into alveolar macrophages, where it persists and proliferates as a facultative intracellular pathogen. Rapid access to this intracellular niche also allows Hc to escape the immune defenses of the alveolar lining fluid, which include the antimicrobial proteins lactoferrin, lysozyme, and defensins (2Newman S.L. Gootee L. Gabay J.E. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5668-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pulmonary surfactant lines the air-liquid interface of the lung and constitutes the first line of defense against inhaled pathogens (3McCormack F.X. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Surfactant is composed of saturated and unsaturated phospholipids and four proteins, surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D (4Goerke J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). SP-B and SP-C are extremely hydrophobic proteins that are thought to play critical roles in the biophysical activity of surfactant. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic, oligomeric glycoproteins that are highly homologous to the serum innate immune opsonin, mannose-binding protein A. Together, these three proteins form the human collectin family, so named because they each contain a collagen-like region, which is important for trimeric assembly, and a C-type lectin domain, which binds to complex carbohydrates that decorate the surface of microorganisms. The collectins have been reported to aggregate and opsonize a variety of microorganisms, to modulate macrophage oxidant and cytokine production, and to enhance the intracellular killing of mycobacteria and other microbes (5Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Recently, van Rozendaal et al. (6van Rozendaal B.A. van Spriel A.B. van De Winkel J.G. Haagsman H.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that SP-D down-regulated protein synthesis and hyphal outgrowth of Candida albicans. Although this effect was attributed to the influence of SP-D-mediated aggregation on microbial access to the radiolabeled precursor, an alternative hypothesis is that the collectins directly influence microbial physiology. In this study, we investigated the potential of SP-A and SP-D to modulate the growth and viability of Hc in the presence and absence of alveolar macrophages. Both collectins caused a dose-dependent decrement in yeast viability, which was associated with an increase in the permeability of the yeast. Mice lacking the genes encoding SP-A manifested a modestly higher fungal burden in lungs than wild-type littermates. SP-A and SP-D failed to inhibit the growth of yeast that had been internalized by macrophages. Hence, these two collectins demonstrate potent antifungal properties, but entry of Hc into macrophages provides a haven from the inimical effects of SP-A and SP-D. Mice—Swiss Black SP-A-/- mice (a gift of J. Whitsett and T. Korfhagen) were developed from embryonic stem cells after disruption of the mouse SP-A gene by homologous recombination and maintained by breeding with Swiss Black mice, as previously described (7Korfhagen T.R. Bruno M.D. Ross G.F. Huelsman K.M. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Wert S.E. Stripp B.R. Morris R.E. Glasser S.W. Bachurski C.J. Iwamoto H.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9594-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The SP-A null allele was bred into the C3H/HeN background through nine generations using a PCR-based genotyping strategy to track the neomycin locus of the gene-targeting cassette (8Wu H. Kuzmenko A. Wan S. Schaffer L. Weiss A. Fisher J.H. Kim K.S. McCormack F.X. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1589-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). All animals were housed in positively ventilated microisolator cages with automatic recirculating water located in a room with laminar, high efficiency particulate-filtered air. The animals received autoclaved food, water, and bedding. Mice used were handled in accordance with approved protocols through the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Cincinnati School of Medicine. Preparation of Hc Yeast and Infection of Mice—Four strains of yeast were used in these studies: G217B, 186R, and 186S, and an isolate from an human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient from Panama. Yeast were grown as described (9Allendoerfer R. Deepe Jr., G.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 6072-6082PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, they were seeded in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 18.2 g/liter glucose, 1 g/liter glutamic acid, 6 g/liter HEPES, and 0.084 g/liter cysteine at a concentration of 3 × 106/ml and grown for 60 h (10Worsham P.L. Goldman W.E. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1988; 26: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) at 37 °C. The yeast were collected and washed three times with Hepes-buffered saline solution. Mice were inoculated with 2 × 106 yeast intranasally after anesthesia with isoflurane. Synthesis and Purification of Native and Recombinant SP-A and SP-D—Surfactant was isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage of Sprague-Dawley rats that had been treated 1 month earlier with intratracheal silica to enhance the collectin yield (11Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After removal of cells by centrifugation of the bronchoalveolar lavage at 300 × g, the surfactant pellet was sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and floated on NaBr gradients, as described (12Hawgood S. Benson B. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Rat SP-A was isolated and purified from the NaBr gradient pellicle by delipidation with butanol and mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography (13Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Rat SP-D was purified from the bronchoalveolar lavage of silica-pretreated rats by calcium-dependent adsorption of the 72,000 × g supernatant to maltose-Sepharose columns. Human SP-A isolated from patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a lung disease associated with the accumulation of surfactant, is referred to as alveolar proteinosis protein (APP). Briefly, APP was purified by the method of Suwabe (14Suwabe A. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) from the cell-free surfactant pellet of bronchoalveolar lavage by serial sedimentation and resuspension in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Ca2+, release by incubation with 2 mm EDTA, and adsorption of the recalcified supernatant to mannose-Sepharose affinity columns. In all cases, SP-A and SP-D were eluted from the carbohydrate affinity column using 2 mm EDTA. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl for SP-A and SP-D, respectively, and stored at -20 °C. The EDTA content of all protein samples used was measured by the method of Kratochvil and White (15Kratochvil B. White M.C. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The average final EDTA concentration was 5 μm and was less than 25 μm in all cases (15Kratochvil B. White M.C. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Vitro Assays of Hc Growth—Yeast suspended in HMM were added to each well of a microtiter plate in 190 μl and mixed with 10 μl of SP-A, SP-D, or collectin filtrate. In some experiments as indicated, myoinositol (Sigma) was added to SP-D-containing wells in concentrations of up to 20 mm. The yeast were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 24 h of incubation, the plates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was gently removed. Fifty μl of [3H]leucine (1 μCi) (specific activity, 153 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 5 μl of 10× yeast nitrogen broth was added to each well. After an additional 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 50 μl of l-leucine and 50 μl of sodium hypochlorite were dispensed into each well. The contents were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and cpm were determined by scintillation counting (16Newman S.L. Gootee L. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4593-4597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the assays employing macrophages, alveolar or peritoneal macrophages were harvested from C3H/HeN mice. Alveolar cells were isolated using Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and resident peritoneal macrophages were harvested with RPMI 1640. Cells were washed 3 times in Hepes-buffered saline solution and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine and 10 μg/ml gentamicin; 105 cells in 0.1 ml of medium were dispensed into each well of a microtiter plate in the presence of 5 × 103 yeast in 0.1 ml of RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin for 4 h at 37 °Cin5%CO2 to allow phagocytosis of yeast. The wells were washed gently to remove extracellular yeast, and 0.2 ml of fresh medium containing surfactant protein was added. The plates were incubated or 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, then handled as above. Assessment of Fungal Colony-forming Units (CFU)—Recovery of Hc was performed as described (9Allendoerfer R. Deepe Jr., G.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 6072-6082PubMed Google Scholar). The fungal burden was expressed as mean CFU ± S.E. Preparation of Lung Leukocytes—To isolate lung leukocytes, mice were sacrificed, and the lung vasculature was flushed with 20 ml of Hepes-buffered saline solution by inserting a catheter into the right heart. The lungs were excised, teased apart with forceps, and homogenized by sequential passage through 16-, 18-, and 20-gauge needles. Mononuclear cells were isolated by separation on a 40–70% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient (17Cain J.A. Deepe Jr., G.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Lung cells were adjusted to 5 × 105/200 μl in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% sodium azide and stained with 0.5 g of one of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibodies (Pharmingen), anti-CD4 (clone RM4–5), anti-CD8 (clone 53–6.7), anti-Ly-6G (Gr-1) (clone RB6–8C5, which recognizes polymorphonuclear cells), and Mac-3 (clone M3/84, detects tissue macrophages), or isotype-matched rat IgG monoclonal antibody. The samples were washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde until analyzed on a flow cytometer. Protein Assays—Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic protein assay kit (BCA) (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assays of Hc Permeability—Protein release from Hc exposed to the collectins was measured using the thiol-specific fluorophore ThiGlo1 (Molecular Probes) (18Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hc (5 × 107 organisms/ml) in 100 μl of Hepes-buffered saline solution were exposed to rat SP-A or rat SP-D at various concentrations for 15 min at 37 °C and then sedimented by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μm ThioGlo1 in the presence and absence of the protein denaturing agent SDS, and thiol-containing proteins were detected using a fluorescent plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 and 535 nm, respectively. Thiol-containing proteins were quantified by subtracting fluorescence due to released glutathione (i.e. signal obtained in the absence of SDS) from total fluorescence. The effect of the pulmonary collectins on Hc cell wall integrity was also assessed by determining permeability to an alkaline phosphatase substrate, ELF97 (Molecular Probes) (19Weiss J. Muello K. Victor M. Elsbach P. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3109-3115PubMed Google Scholar). The collectins were incubated with 3.5 × 108 Hc/ml in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl for 15 min at 37 °C, and 100 μm ELF97 phosphatase substrate was added. Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 535 nm, respectively, for a period of 40 min. Statistics—Differences between groups were analyzed by the Student's t test. If the data were not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was employed. The Pulmonary Collectins Inhibit Protein Synthesis in Hc—To determine the consequences of the interaction between collectins and Hc, we attempted to determine if purified SP-A and SP-D altered protein synthesis of Hc. Both rat SP-A and rat SP-D markedly suppressed [3H]leucine incorporation into G217B, 186R, 186S, and a clinical Hc isolate in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). At higher concentrations of each collectin, the reduction in leucine incorporation approached 95–99%. Nonspecific killing of the yeast by low molecular weight copurifying substances did not contribute to the antimicrobial effect since the 10,000 M r cutoff ultrafiltrate of the highest SP-A and SP-D (not shown) concentrations used did not alter [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the structural integrity of SP-A and SP-D was critically important for function since boiling of either molecule abolished its antimicrobial activity (Fig. 2A). Myoinositol, which competes for binding of SP-D to other microbial membranes (20Chiba H. Pattanajitvilai S. Evans A.J. Harbeck R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20379-20385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), had no effect on SP-D-mediated inhibition of Hc protein synthesis at carbohydrate concentrations as high as 20 mm (data not shown). To assess if the effect of the surfactant proteins was species-specific, we incubated Hc with human SP-A (APP) and determined [3H]leucine incorporation. As was demonstrated for rat SP-A, APP inhibited growth of Hc in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Collectin-mediated growth inhibition is heat-sensitive and SP-A species-independent. Panel A, the effect of collectin boiling on SP-A- and SP-D-mediated inhibition of [3H]leucine incorporation into G217B Hc was tested at various collectin concentrations. The 10,000 M r ultrafiltrate of 200 μg/ml SP-A was also assessed for antimicrobial activity. Panel B, effect of human SP-A isolated from patients with APP on [3H]leucine incorporation into G217B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Subsequently, we sought to ascertain if the measurements of altered protein synthesis correlated with a true decrement in CFU. Yeast from G217B were exposed to SP-A or SP-D for 24 h and then cultured on brain heart infusion/blood agar plates. The recovery of Hc on plates was markedly inhibited by both SP-A and SP-D (Fig. 3A). It is important to note that neither SP-A nor SP-D aggregated Hc, based on light microscopic inspection of Hc cultured with collectins for 1 h (Fig. 3B) or overnight (not shown). These data indicate that SP-A and SP-D exert fungicidal activity. Next, we assessed the effect of the Hc inoculum size on the antimicrobial effects of SP-A and SP-D (Fig. 4). Increasing numbers of yeast from strain G217B were exposed to 25 μg/ml SP-A or SP-D and [3H]leucine incorporation determined. SP-A and SP-D inhibited the growth of yeast ranging in numbers from 5 × 103 to 5 × 105 in vitro. Reduced Pulmonary Clearance of Hc in SP-A Null Mouse Models—The role of SP-A in the pulmonary clearance of Hc was tested in genetically engineered mice using outbred (Swiss Black) and inbred (C3H/HeN) SP-A null (SP-A-/-) lines. Hc CFU in lung homogenates were compared 1, 2, and 3 weeks after intranasal inoculation with 2 × 106 yeast. The lungs of Swiss Black SP-A-/- mice contained significantly higher numbers (p < 0.05) of CFU compared with SP-A+/+ mice at 1 and 2 weeks, whereas the spleen CFUs were higher only at week 2 (Fig. 5). Likewise, the lungs of C3H/HeN SP-A-/- exhibited increased CFU (p < 0.05) as compared with wild-type animals at 1 week (Fig. 5). Thus, the absence of SP-A impairs the efficiency of clearance of this fungus. Is the Impaired Elimination Associated with Changes in the Inflammatory Response?—Experiments were performed to determine whether the absence of SP-A influences the pulmonary inflammatory cell profile after Hc infection, and the results are shown in Table I. At week 1, the number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages was diminished in the SP-A-/- mice, although only the CD8+ cell population achieved statistical significance (p < 0.05). By 2 weeks of infection in the wild-type and null mice, there were no substantial differences in the composition of the inflammatory response.Table IPulmonary inflammatory cell profile after intranasal Hc inoculation in C3H/HeN miceMouseWeeks of infectionMean cell No. ± S.E.CD4+CD8+Gr-1Mac-3×10 6Wild type12.8 ± 0.73.6 ± 0.93.9 ± 1.02.3 ± 0.3SPA(-/-)11.2 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.2ap < 0.051.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.2Wild type23.9 ± 0.91.0 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.4SPA(-/-)23.4 ± .51.7 ± 0.50.4 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.1a p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab The Pulmonary Collectins Increase Fungal Cell Wall Permeability—To explore the mechanism by which the collectins kill Hc, we assessed if the integrity of the cell wall and cell membrane was perturbed by these molecules. One approach used was to examine protein efflux from the organism upon exposure to the collectins (Fig. 6). The ThioGlo reagents are a group of maleimide naphthopyranones that rapidly react with accessible cysteines to yield a fluorescent product with a detection limit as low as 10 nm protein thiol (18Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because neither rat SP-A and rat SP-D nor the control proteins melittin or IgG contain free cysteines, this method can be used to assess release of thiol-containing proteins from antimicrobial peptide-treated organisms. Melittin, which is known to permeabilize Gram-negative bacteria, resulted in release of protein from Hc, but a nonspecific IgG had no effect. Exposure of Hc to rat SP-A at 25 or 50 μg/ml or SP-D at 5 or 10 μg/ml for 15 min resulted in a significant increase in the content of thiol-containing proteins in the extracellular space compared with unexposed Hc, but the ultrafiltrate from the most concentrated collectins tested did not induce protein release. The effect of collectins on permeability of Hc was also assessed using ELF97, an alkaline phosphatase substrate that does not readily cross cell membranes and which fluoresces when cleaved by the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 7A, melittin at 3 μg/ml resulted in a rapid increase in cellular permeability, as did 10 μg/ml rat SP-A, 4 μg/ml rat SP-D, and 10 μg/ml human SP-A (APP). Boiling of APP destroyed the permeabilizing effect of the protein, and the fluorescence from organisms exposed to the ultrafiltrates from the highest collectin concentrations tested was not different from Hc exposed to a nonspecific IgG or to Hc alone (no added protein). The initial rate of permeabilization by the collectins and melittin were similar and significantly different from a nonspecific IgG (Fig. 7A , inset). The effect of SP-A and SP-D on membrane integrity was calcium-dependent (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that the pulmonary collectins kill Hc by disrupting the integrity of the surface.Fig. 7SP-A and SP-D increase the permeability of the Hc cell wall in a calcium dependent manner. Panel A, Hc was exposed to 10 μg/ml rat SP-A (open squares), 4 μg/ml rat SP-D (open circles), 10 μg/ml APP (open triangles), 10 μg/ml boiled APP (closed triangles), SP-A ultrafiltrate (×), SP-D ultrafiltrate (+), 100 μg/ml nonspecific IgG (Ab) (closed squares), 3 μg/ml melittin (closed circles), or no protein (–) in the presence of the alkaline phosphate substrate ELF97. Fluorescence was measured for 40 min using a fluorimeter and expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.). Data are the mean, n = 4–6. Inset, the initial rate of permeabilization is shown for 10 μg/ml rat SP-A, 4 μg/ml rat SP-D, 10 μg/ml APP, 100 μg/ml IgG (Ab), and 3 μg/ml melittin (Mel).

Panel B, the maximal fluorescence intensity induced by incubation of 100 μg/ml rat SP-A, 32 μg/ml rat SP-D, 100 μg/ml APP, or no added protein (-) with Hc in the presence of ELF97 and 200 μm Ca2+ (Ca) or 2 mm EDTA (Ed) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Internalization by Macrophages Protects Hc from the Fungicidal Effects of the Pulmonary Collectins—Hc yeast demonstrates a strong avidity for macrophages. In vitro they are rapidly internalized and initiate replication. We attempted to determine if the intracellular milieu altered the ability of SP-A and SP-D to express fungicidal activity, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. Alveolar macrophages were harvested and exposed to yeast. Extracellular organisms were removed, and [3H]leucine incorporation was assessed. As a control, we analyzed the effect of SP-A and SP-D on killing extracellularly. Both SP-A and SP-D inhibited the growth of yeast grown in the absence of macrophages. Conversely, they did not alter Hc growth within alveolar macrophages. To determine whether this effect was specific to alveolar macrophages, we performed the identical experiment in peritoneal macrophages with SP-A. This collectin inhibited growth of Hc in the absence of macrophages, whereas this effect was not observed in Hc that had been ingested by peritoneal cells. These data indicate that the intracellular environment serves as a haven from the inimical effects of the collectins. The ability of Hc yeast to cause infection within the lung environment requires evasion of the cellular and molecular mediators of protection. Host cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages and cytokines including interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor are key protective factors of the immune system (21Deepe Jr., G.S. Seder R.A. Res. Immunol. 1998; 149: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that the surfactant proteins A and D exert potent, macrophage-independent fungicidal activity against the yeast phase of Hc. Death of the yeast was measured by two assays, [3H]leucine incorporation that correlates highly with viability and the more traditional growth on agar plates. In both assays incubation with the surfactant proteins caused a marked decrement in viability. This alteration was associated with a calcium-dependent, collectin-mediated increase in the permeability of the Hc cell wall. Moreover, we demonstrated that SP-A-deficient mice were more susceptible to Hc infection than strain-matched wild-type controls, establishing that the absence of SP-A is accompanied by an in vivo effect. Estimates of the concentrations of surfactant proteins in the alveolar lining fluid range from 300 to 1800 μg/ml for SP-A and from 36 to 216 μg/ml for SP-D, manyfold higher than levels that were found to be required to kill Hc in this study. Hence, the direct antimicrobial properties of SP-A and SP-D appear to play a physiologically relevant role in innate immune defense against Hc. The yeast phase of Hc is the element that is responsible for nearly all of the clinicopathological manifestations of histoplasmosis (1Deepe G.S.J. Mandell G. Bennett J. Dolin R. Principles and Practices in Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. Churchill Livingston, Philadelphia1999: 2718-2734Google Scholar). Although microconidia are initially deposited within the distal airspaces, they rapidly convert to yeast either within alveolar macrophages or in the extracellular environment. Intracellular yeast can multiply unrestricted until macrophages are destroyed by a massive burden of fungal elements. Thus, survival of yeast forms is the critical step in the establishment of infection. Yeast that are released from lysed macrophages would be exposed to the extracellular constituents of the lung including the collectins. In this context, the host can exert partial control over the replicative capacity of the yeast cell before the onset of cellular immunity, which occurs usually between 1 to 2 weeks after infection (17Cain J.A. Deepe Jr., G.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data indicate that SP-A and SP-D inhibit the biosynthetic capacity of Hc. The collectin-mediated reduction in protein synthesis by Hc was associated with the loss of the capacity to replicate, consistent with cell death. The Hc inoculum size did not affect the fungicidal properties of the collectins through the range of Hc numbers (Fig. 4), but at lower collectin-to-Hc ratios the killing effect is titrated and submaximal (Fig. 1). Four separate strains were susceptible to killing, indicating that the cidal effect of the collectins was not merely restricted to laboratory isolates or avirulent strains. The effect of the collectins on viability of Hc is not universal for all pathogenic fungi; however, since these molecules failed to kill the yeast phase of Blastomyces dermatitidis, another pathogenic soil-based fungus (data not shown). This fungus exists in the extracellular space more commonly than Hc and, thus, has most likely evolved to combat the activity of the collectins. The antimicrobial activity of the collectins was destroyed by boiling, indicating that conformational integrity of the proteins is required. There was no killing activity detected in the 10,000 M r cutoff ultrafiltrate of any of the protein reagents used. Pulmonary surfactant proteins derived from diverse sources and purified by different methods, including native collectins purified from the alveolar lavage of rats and humans, all exhibited direct antimicrobial activity. Down-regulation of synthetic function induced by agglutination of the organism did not contribute to growth inhibition in the Hc assays in this study, since neither SP-A or SP-D aggregated the organism. These findings indicate that fungicidal effects of the pulmonary collectins are an intrinsic property of the proteins. Two separate strains of mice lacking the gene for SP-A manifested impaired clearance of Hc. However, the defect in clearance was not dramatic. One explanation for this modest effect is that SP-A-/- mice still possess SP-D, which also exhibits potent anti-Hc activity. Thus, the isolated absence of SP-A did not cause a major failure in innate immunity against Hc. A second explanation is that Hc rapidly enters host phagocytes, in particular, alveolar macrophages. The reasons for this predilection for intracellular parasitism have not been fully defined, but the results herein strongly indicate that the intracellular niche provides an escape from the lethal effects of the surfactant proteins. Exposure of Hc within alveolar macrophages to concentrations of SP-A or SP-D that killed yeast directly failed to inhibit the growth of Hc. Hc were also protected from SP-A-mediated killing by internalization into mouse peritoneal macrophages, which are naïve to the collectins. Although it is true that surfactant proteins enter alveolar macrophages by endocytosis, it is likely that endosomal levels are only a fraction of the concentration in the alveolar lining fluid. SP-D-/- mice have been derived, but we did not test the course of Hc in these animals because they exhibit time-dependent accumulation of surfactant within macrophages and the alveolar spaces. We believed this altered physiology would cloud the interpretation of infection experiments spanning several weeks. The ability of Hc to invade macrophages and thrive within them permits this fungus to evade the extracellular collectin levels that would otherwise be lethal. Although surfactant proteins are crucial for optimal gas exchange in the alveolar space, they possess several immunoregulatory properties that make them a key contributor to lung host defenses. They have been shown to exert opsonic activity, to modulate production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α release (22Borron P. McIntosh J.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Taylor J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 278: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to down-regulate T cell function (23Borron P. Veldhuizen R.A.W. Lewis J.F. Possmayer F. Caveney A. Inchley K. McFadden R.G. Fraher L.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this regard, we analyzed the inflammatory response to Hc in SP-A-/- mice to determine whether there was a correlation between the fungal burden and the inflammatory response. At 1 week of infection, the number of phagocytes and T cells in the lungs of SP-A-/- mice was depressed compared with wild-type infected controls, but only the CD8+ population was statistically less than controls. Because CD8+ are necessary for optimal expression of protective immunity in primary infection (24Deepe Jr., G.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3491-3500PubMed Google Scholar, 25Allendorfer R. Brunner G.D. Deepe Jr., G.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7389-7396PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhou P. Seder R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the decrement in this cell subpopulation may contribute to the elevated CFUs found in the lungs of SP-A-/- mice. Several lines of evidence suggest that the collectins increase the permeability of the surface of Hc, as we have recently demonstrated for some but not all strains of Escherichia coli (8Wu H. Kuzmenko A. Wan S. Schaffer L. Weiss A. Fisher J.H. Kim K.S. McCormack F.X. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1589-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Incubation of yeast with both collectins increased protein leak from the organism and enhanced the access of a hydrolysis-activated fluorescent substrate to intracellular alkaline phosphatase. The membrane permeability defect occurs rapidly, with a clear increase in the slope of fluorescence within 15 min. The mechanism by which SP-A and SP-D increase permeability is unknown, but as with most collectin functions, the effect is calcium-dependent. Calcium binding produces conformational shifts in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which may expose charged or hydrophobic protein moieties capable of perturbing the cell surface. Alternatively, calcium may form the bridge for collectin binding to the membrane interface. It is interesting to note that the crystal structure of SP-D reveals large charged domains on the membrane face of the CRDs that could conceivably interact with membrane phospholipids or with other surface molecules (27Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and disrupt membrane function. The first point of contact between inhaled Hc and the distal airspaces is the alveolar lining fluid. The intimate association of SP-A and SP-D with surfactant positions the proteins at the air-liquid interface in an ideal presentation for interaction with inhaled pathogens. The affinity of SP-A and perhaps SP-D for specific phospholipid components of surfactant may also significantly alter collectin function and availability, however, and further experiments will be required to define their antifungal effects in the presence of lipids. The Hc uses phagocytosis to gain access to its intracellular niche. Macrophages lack the ability to kill Hc through oxidant or proteolytic mechanisms (28Wolf J.E. Kerchberger V. Kobayashi G.S.

The ability to enter into phagocytes provides a haven from the potentially destructive extracellular environment and suggests a new strategy for host evasion by Hc. In summary, the data in this study indicate that SP-A and SP-D are fungicidal. This newly identified collectin function provides a mechanism for control of Hc proliferation in the preinflammation phase of the host/pathogen interaction. We thank Drs.

In the present study, we established MTH1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts that were highly susceptible to cell dysfunction and death caused by exposure to H2O2, with morphological features of pyknosis and electron-dense deposits accumulated in mitochondria.

Cellular DNA, RNA, and their precursor nucleotides are at a high risk of being oxidized by reactive oxygen species, which are inevitably generated by normal metabolic functions such as mitochondrial respiration or by environmental exposure to ionizing radiation and chemicals. The oxidation of nucleic acids appears to result in either spontaneous mutagenesis or cell death, thus being implicated in various age-related diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration (1Ames B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 8-Oxo-dGTP can be incorporated into the nascent strand opposite adenine and cytosine in the template with almost equal efficiency, thus resulting in an A:T to C:G transversion mutation (3Tajiri T.

The loss of the mutT gene increases the spontaneous occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion to a level 1,000-fold greater than the wild type level and also further increases the transcriptional errors (5Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M. Cirinesi A. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Homologs of MutT were identified in human and rodent cells, and they suppressed the elevated spontaneous mutation rates of mutT mutants to an almost normal level, thus designated as MTH1 (MutT homolog-1) (6Sakumi K.

In addition to the sanitizing mechanism of 8-oxo-dGTP, the base excision repair enzymes for 8-oxo-G in DNA, such as MutM (FPG)/OGG1 and MutY/MUTYH (MYH), are conserved among various organisms from E. coli to mammals (10Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Nishioka K. Ohtsubo T. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Kang D. Sugimachi K. Nakabeppu Y. Mol. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the genotoxicity of 8-oxo-G in DNA is universal throughout all living organisms.Previously, we also showed that hMTH1, but not E. coli MutT, has an ability to efficiently hydrolyze oxidized dATP and ATP, such as 2-OH-dATP and 2-OH-ATP, as well as 8-oxo-dGTP (13Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18201-18205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 14Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and thus, designated MTH1 as an oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase (15Nakabeppu Y. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 2-OH-dATP can be incorporated into the nascent strand of DNA opposite guanine as well as thymine, thus causing a G:C to T:A transversion mutation (2Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Kamiya H. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most parts of 2-hydroxyadenine (2-OH-A) in DNA are considered to be derived from a misincorporation of 2-OH-dATP but not from a direct oxidation of adenine in DNA (2Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Mice lacking the Mth1 gene exhibit an increased occurrence of spontaneous carcinogenesis especially in the liver, and to a lesser extent, in the lung and stomach (17Tsuzuki T. Egashira A. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Nakatsuru Y. Tominaga Y. Kawate H. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Ide F. Kura S. Nakabeppu Y. Katsuki M. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the accumulation of oxidized purine nucleotides triggers such malignant transformation in vivo. Furthermore, the increased accumulation of 8-oxo-G in DNA along with the increased expression of hMTH1 is observed not only in human cancer tissue (18Kennedy C.H. Cueto R. Belinsky S.A. Lechner J.F. Pryor W.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Iida T. Furuta A. Kawashima M. Nishida J. Nakabeppu Y. Iwaki T. Neuro-oncology. 2001; 3: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar) but also in degenerating neurons (20Shimura-Miura H. Hattori N. Kang D. Miyako K. Nakabeppu Y. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Furuta A. Iida T. Nakabeppu Y. Iwaki T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2895-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MTH1 may thus possibly protect cells from undergoing dysfunction or death as well as carcinogenesis due to oxidative stress.To understand the biological significance of such oxidized purine nucleotides in mammals, it is essential to unveil the mechanism by which they cause cell dysfunction as well as mutagenesis that may thereby result in both degenerative diseases and cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated that hMTH1 protects cells from the cytotoxicity of H2O2 by hydrolyzing oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEstablishment of Mouse Embryo Fibroblast Cell Line—By means of gene targeting, we previously established Mth1 gene knockout mice (17Tsuzuki T. Egashira A. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Nakatsuru Y. Tominaga Y. Kawate H. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Ide F. Kura S. Nakabeppu Y. Katsuki M. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and heterozygous mice (Mth1+/-) backcrossed to C57BL6/J for more than 12 generations were maintained. MEFs were isolated from embryos (13.5 days postcoital) obtained by mating the Mth1+/- mice. MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were routinely maintained by a standard 3T3 protocol, and spontaneously immortalized cell lines were thus established. Their genotypes were determined by genomic PCR (see Fig. 1A) as described previously (22Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Furuichi M. Xu P. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 902-905PubMed Google Scholar), and Mth1+/+ (T3, T7, T9) and Mth1-/- (T2, T5, T8) MEF cell lines were independently established.Plasmids, Transfection, and Establishment of Stable Transfectants—We used pcDEBΔ-MTH1 as an expression vector for wild type hMTH1 (23Kang D.

Expression vectors for mutant hMTH1 (W117Y or D119A) were constructed by inserting the NcoI-BamHI fragment of pET8c: hMTH1(W117Y or D119A) (24Sakai Y. Furuichi M. Takahashi M. Mishima M. Iwai S. Shirakawa M. Nakabeppu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8579-8587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) into the HindIII-BamHI region of pcDEBΔ (25Nakabeppu Y. Oda S. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4157-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two cell lines of Mth1-/- MEFs (T2 and T5) were transfected with plasmid DNA by the aid of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. Established stable transfectants were designated T2v with pcDEBΔ, T2MTH1 (numbers 1 and 2) with pcDEBΔ-MTH1, T5v with pcDEBΔ, T5MTH1 with pcDEBΔ-MTH1, T5W117Y with pcDEBΔ-MTH1(W117Y), T5D119A with pcDEBΔ-MTH1(D119A), respectively, and they were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B.Quantitative Western Blotting and Measurement of 8-Oxo-dGTPase and 2-OH-dATPase Activities of hMTH1—MEFs were treated with trypsin/EDTA and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets (1 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol with protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque), and then sonicated at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,360 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was collected as whole cell extract. Appropriate amounts of whole cell extract and purified hMTH1 (26Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F.

Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25942-25948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), according to the previously described method (24Sakai Y. Furuichi M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8579-8587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy—T5v and T5MTH1 cells were cultured on slides and incubated with 2 μm MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min prior to fixation. MTH1 protein was detected using anti-MTH1 in combination with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were counterstained with TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes). Slides were observed under Eclipse TE300 (Nikon) equipped with the Radiance 2100 laser scanning fluorescence microscope system (Bio-Rad).Morphological Examinations of Cells—MEFs cultured to ∼70% confluence were exposed to medium containing 500 μm H2O2 for 24 h and then observed under a phase-contrast microscope. To detect the nuclear morphology, cells were additionally incubated with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) with or without 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min and examined under a fluorescence microscope. At least 1200 cells were counted and classified as follows: (i) live cells with a normal nucleus and an organized structure stained only with Hoechst 33342, (ii) pyknotic live cells with a highly condensed nucleus stained only with Hoechst 33342, and (iii) pyknotic dead cells with a highly condensed nucleus stained both with Hoechst 33342 and PI. For electron microscopic observations, MEFs cultured to 80% confluence were exposed to medium containing 500 μm H2O2 for 4 or 24 h and processed as described previously (11Nishioka K. Ohtsubo T. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Kang D. Sugimachi K. Nakabeppu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1637-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 12Ohtsubo T. Nishioka K. Imaiso Y. Iwai S. Shimokawa H. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).Quantitation of 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine in Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA—To quantify the nuclear content of 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), MEFs cultured to ∼80% confluence in a 14-cm dish were exposed to medium containing 500 μm H2O2 for 1, 4, 8, or 24 h and then harvested. The nuclear DNA was prepared and subjected to an HPLC-MS/MS analysis of 8-oxo-dG, according to the method described previously (28Tsuruya K. Furuichi M. Tominaga Y. Shinozaki M. Tokumoto M. Yoshimitsu T. Fukuda K. Kanai H. Hirakata H. Iida M. Nakabeppu Y. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The detection of 8-oxo-dG immunoreactivity in mitochondrial DNA was performed as follows. MEFs cultured on glass slides were exposed to medium containing 300 μm H2O2 for 1, 4, or 8 h at 37 °C prior to fixation. The slides were incubated with 5 mg/ml RNase A for 2 h at 37 °C and then with 50% ethanol containing 50 mm NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. 8-Oxo-dG in DNA was detected with an anti-8-oxo-dG mouse monoclonal antibody (MOG-020; Japan Institute for the Control of Aging) in combination with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). The nuclei were counterstained with 2 μg/ml PI. Digitized images for 8-oxo-dG immunoreactivity and nuclear PI staining were separately captured from identical fields using a laser scanning fluorescence microscope system, LSM-510 Meta (Carl Zeiss). To quantify the immunoreactivity of 8-oxo-dG in mitochondrial DNA, a previously described method (28Tsuruya K. Furuichi M. Tominaga Y. Shinozaki M. Tokumoto M. Yoshimitsu T. Fukuda K. Kanai H. Hirakata H. Iida M. Nakabeppu Y. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used with some modifications. Briefly, images of 8-oxo-dG immunoreactivity were converted to 256-level gray-scale images, whereas those of nuclear PI staining were converted to binary monochromes by Adobe PhotoShop 5.0J (Adobe Systems). From the gray-scale images of 8-oxo-dG immunoreactivity, the signals residing in areas corresponding to nuclei represented by the monochrome PI images were deleted, and then the cytoplasmic signals for 8-oxo-dG were measured using NIH Image 1.61. The area for a single cell was manually defined, and an integrated pixel density for each cell was determined after setting a uniform threshold. At least 50 cells were analyzed, and an average value of the integrated pixel density per cell was calculated as the 8-oxo-dG index for each sample.Assay of Cell Viability—After exposure to H2O2, the cell viability was measured by 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8) using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). In brief, MEFs were cultured in 96-well plates to ∼70% confluence and incubated with medium containing various concentrations of H2O2 followed by incubation with WST-8. Absorbance of WST-8 formazan dye at 450 nm was measured, and relative cell viability was determined by comparing the ratio of absorbance for each experiment to that for the control experiments.Colony Formation Assay—Exponentially growing MEFs were plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 1000 or 5000 cells/dish. The cells attached to dishes by incubation for 6 h were incubated in a medium containing various concentrations of H2O2 supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate for 24 h followed by incubation with fresh medium for 2 weeks to allow for colony formation. The colonies were fixed and stained in 25% ethanol containing 0.3% crystal violet. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The average value of plating efficiency was determined for each experiment, and the relative plating efficiency was determined as a ratio of the average value of the plating efficiency to that for the control experiment.RESULTSEstablishment and Characterization of MTH1-null MEF Cell Lines—MEFs were isolated from embryos obtained by the mating of Mth1+/- mice, and spontaneously immortalized cell lines were established. The genotype of each cell line was determined by genomic PCR (Fig. 1, A and B). A Western blot analysis of mouse MTH1 (mMTH1) proteins in wild type and Mth1-/- MEFs demonstrated that there was no detectable mMTH1 protein in each Mth1-/- MEFs (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, none of the Mth1-/- MEFs were able to hydrolyze either 8-oxo-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP, thus demonstrating that the Mth1-/- MEFs were indeed MTH1-null mutants (data not shown). The expression levels of mMTH1 in wild type MEFs were considerably lower than those in the liver from wild type mice (Fig. 1C). In our experiments, no significant difference was observed between wild type and MTH1-null MEFs regarding their sensitivity to H2O2, sodium nitroprusside, and rotenone (data not shown).Expression of Human MTH1 Protein in MTH1-null MEFs— The expression vectors for wild type and two mutant hMTH1 (W117Y and D119A) were introduced to the MTH1-null MEF cell lines (T2 and T5), and stable transfectants were thus established. By quantitative Western blotting, the expression level of hMTH1 protein was determined in each established cell line (Fig. 2A). The hydrolyzing activities of 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP were also examined using whole cell extracts prepared from each cell line. MEFs expressing wild type hMTH1 exhibited substantial levels of an enzymatic capacity to hydrolyze both 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP, whereas those of W117Y or D119A mutant showed a selective loss of 8-oxo-dGTPase or 2-OH-dATPase activity, respectively (Fig. 2B). In MTH1-null MEFs that received pcDEBΔ itself, no enzyme activity was detected in reactions with up to 20 μg of whole cell extract (data not shown). The specific activities of hMTH1 protein in each cell line were determined based on the data obtained by quantitative Western blotting (Table I). The specific activities of wild type hMTH1 in whole cell extracts prepared from T2MTH1-1, -2, and T5MTH1 cells were close to those determined with purified hMTH1, 336.2 × 102 units of 2-OH-dATPase/μg of protein and 296.6 × 102 units of 8-oxo-dGTPase/μg of protein, respectively, and those of W117Y and D119A mutant hMTH1 also correlated with those described in our previous report (24Sakai Y.

The results thus indicate that hMTH1 also localizes in the mitochondria as we reported previously (23Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). From these results, it is concluded that hMTH1 maintains its function and subcellular localization in MTH1-null MEFs.Fig. 3Subcellular localization of hMTH1 expressed in MEFs. Confocal images of immunoreactivity for MTH1 (green: a and e), Mito-Tracker Red CM-H2Ros (red: b and f), and TOPRO-3 (purple: d and h) were obtained from T5MTH1 (a–d) and T5v (e–h) cells. In overlaid images (c and g), the co-localized signals are shown in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hMTH1 Suppresses H 2 O 2 -induced Cell Death and Ultrastructural Alteration of Mitochondria in MTH1-null MEFs—To investigate the cytoprotective function of MTH1 against oxidative stress, we examined the sensitivity of MTH1-null T5v cells to H2O2. After exposure to 500 μm H2O2 for 24 h, most cells died and thereafter became detached from the culture dish, and most of the attached cells showed a marked condensation of the cell bodies (Fig. 4A). An examination of the nuclear morphology using Hoechst 33342/PI staining by fluorescence microscopy showed most of the Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei to be highly condensed, and many of them were also stained with PI, thus representing dead cells (Fig. 4B). The dead cells were not accompanied with the classical morphological features of apoptosis, namely nuclear fragmentation, but their nuclei were much smaller than those of necrotic cells; we thus referred to this cell death as pyknosis (29Lee Y.J. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). On the other hand, T5MTH1 cells expressing wild type hMTH1 exhibited little of these morphological features after exposure to H2O2. As summarized in Fig. 4C, about 50% of T5v cells died by pyknosis, and 25% of them were alive but pyknotic, whereas more than 95% of T5MTH1 cells exhibited a normal morphology after exposure to H2O2.Fig. 4hMTH1 suppressed the H2O2-induced cell death of MTH1-null MEFs accompanied with pyknosis. In A, T5MTH1 (right panels) or T5v (left panels) cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy either with or without (control) exposure to 500 μm H2O2 for 24 h. Experiments with another MTH1-null MEFs (T2) showed similar results (data not shown). In B, T5MTH1 (right) and T5v (left) cells exposed to H2O2 as shown in A were stained with Hoechst 33342 (upper panels) or Hoechst 33342 and PI (lower panels), and then cells were examined by a fluorescence microscope. In C, nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342 and PI were counted and classified morphologically under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentages of pyknotic dead cells in T5v (gray columns) and T5MTH1 (white columns) cells were statistically compared using Fisher's exact probability test (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Downlo"
https://openalex.org/W2089560975,"The p62 protein (also known as SQSTM1) mediates diverse cellular functions including control of NFκB signaling and transcriptional activation. p62 binds non-covalently to ubiquitin and co-localizes with ubiquitylated inclusions in a number of human protein aggregation diseases. Mutations in the gene encoding p62 cause Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a common disorder of the elderly characterized by excessive bone resorption and formation. All of the p62 PDB mutations identified to date cluster within the C-terminal region of the protein, which shows low sequence identity to previously characterized ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. We report the first NMR structure of a recombinant polypeptide that contains the C-terminal UBA domain of the human p62 protein (residues 387–436). This sequence, which confers multiubiquitin chain binding, forms a compact three-helix bundle with a structure analogous to the UBA domains of HHR23A but with differences in the loop regions connecting helices that may be involved in binding accessory proteins. We show that the Pro392 → Leu PDB substitution mutation modifies the structure of the UBA domain by extending the N terminus of helix 1. In contrast to the p62 PDB deletion mutations that remove the UBA domain and ablate multiubiquitin chain binding, the Pro392 → Leu substitution does not affect interaction of the UBA domain with multiubiquitin chains. Thus, phenotypically identical substitution and deletion mutations do not appear to predispose to PDB through a mechanism dependent on a common loss of ubiquitin chain binding by p62.

This sequence, which confers multiubiquitin chain binding, forms a compact three-helix bundle with a structure analogous to the UBA domains of HHR23A but with differences in the loop regions connecting helices that may be involved in binding accessory proteins. We show that the Pro392 → Leu PDB substitution mutation modifies the structure of the UBA domain by extending the N terminus of helix 1. In contrast to the p62 PDB deletion mutations that remove the UBA domain and ablate multiubiquitin chain binding, the Pro392 → Leu substitution does not affect interaction of the UBA domain with multiubiquitin chains. Thus, phenotypically identical substitution and deletion mutations do not appear to predispose to PDB through a mechanism dependent on a common loss of ubiquitin chain binding by p62. The ubiquitin-binding protein p62 (SQSTM1) functions as a scaffold in a range of signaling pathways associated with cell stress, survival, and inflammation and also controls transcriptional activation and protein recruitment to endosomes (1Geetha T. Wooten M.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). p62 co-localizes with ubiquitin-containing inclusions in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's, Pick's, and Parkinson's disease patients, suggesting a possible role in the formation of these lesions (2Kuusisto E.

All of the p62 mutations identified to date (Pro392 → Leu, Glu396 → Stop, and an intron 7 splice donor site mutation predicted to generate a frameshift 390Stop protein) cluster within the C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 1a). This region shows low sequence identity to previously characterized ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains (6Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

We report the first structure of a recombinant polypeptide containing the UBA domain of the human p62 protein (residues 387–436; Fig. 1b) and NMR investigations of the Pro392 → Leu mutant (the most common p62 PDB mutation). This structural model allows us to rationalize the differential effects on ubiquitin binding of p62 PDB deletion and substitution mutations detected in parallel in vitro ubiquitin chain binding assays. Expression and Isolation of p62 UBA and Mutants—The cDNA containing the UBA domain of human p62 was amplified from IMAGE clone 2906264 by PCR and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The Pro392 → Leu PDB mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Quick-Change Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene), and constructs were verified by sequencing. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in XL-10 Gold Escherichia coli (Stratagene). Protein purification involved growing transformed cells at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6 to 0.7, and induction of overexpression was achieved by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 200 μm. Cleavage of purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins retained on glutathione-Sepharose beads with thrombin released polypeptides equivalent to residues 387–436 of human p62 with an additional Gly-Ser dipeptide at the N terminus. The cleaved proteins were subjected to a final purification step with a Superdex-200 gel filtration column and dialyzed to remove excess salt. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—NMR data were collected on 2-mm samples of the wild-type p62-UBA domain and the Pro392 → Leu mutant at pH 5.8. Two-dimensional TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and 30-, 50-, 100-, 250-, and 300-ms two-dimensional NOESY experiments were performed at 25 and 35 °C on a Bruker Avance-600 instrument equipped with a triple-resonance probe with solvent suppression achieved using the WATERGATE sequence (15Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar). Data were processed using Bruker XWINNMR (version 2.5) and ANSIG software (16Kraulis P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 24: 627-633Google Scholar). NOE restraints from NOESY spectra at 25 and 35 °C were classified as weak (1.8–5.0 Å), medium (1.8–4.0 Å), or strong (1.8–3.0 Å) on the basis of cross-peak intensities. A family of 100 structures was calculated using the simulated annealing protocol starting from the template coordinates as implemented in XPLOR version 3.1 (17Brunger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using 732 NOE restraints and 56 dihedral angle restraints derived from Hα chemical shift data and from Hα-Hβ splittings in TOCSY and DQF-COSY for residues Asp408, Asn421, and Asp423. The NOE-derived distances were treated as r –6 summation averages (sum) using a soft potential function with a force constant of 50 kcal mol–1 Å–2. The simulated annealing procedure started from extended coordinates and consisted of 35 ps of high temperature dynamics at 2000 K followed by a slow cooling to 100 K in 35 ps (18Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). For the final minimization, the structures were subjected to a 500 steps of restrained Powell energy minimization, and 27 final structures were selected, which exhibit good geometry with no NOE violations >0.5 Å and no dihedral violations >5°. Analysis of the ϕ,ψ distribution within the structured region of the ensemble (residues 392–431) showed 97% of residues to lie in favored and additionally allowed regions and none in disallowed regions of Ramachandran space. The RMSD from the mean structure (residues 392–431) is 0.51 Å (backbone heavy atoms) and 0.95 Å over all heavy atoms. The coordinates have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (code 1Q02). The quality of the structures was assessed using the programs PROCHECK and AQUA (19Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-292Crossref Google Scholar). Ubiquitin Chain Binding Assay—UBA polypeptides (wild-type and Pro392 → Leu, 1 mg/ml) were immobilized on CNBr-activated thiol-Sepharose 4B and incubated with a Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chain mixture (Affiniti Research Products Ltd.). Ubiquitin chains (1 μg in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) were mixed with 20 μl of beads for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, bound proteins retained on beads or in the unbound fraction were detected by Western blotting (rabbit anti-ubiquitin, 1:1000). Control beads contained no immobilized UBA polypeptide. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the p62-UBA recombinant polypeptide (residues 387–436) has a widely dispersed amide and methyl region consistent with a compact folded structure which CD spectra indicate has a high helical content (∼55%). NMR resonance assignments and secondary structure were determined from homonuclear 1H NMR TOCSY and NOESY experiments following well established procedures (20Wüthrich K. NMR of Nucleic Acids and Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, NY1986Crossref Google Scholar). The pattern and intensity of sequential NOEs and TOCSY cross-peak intensities establish that the p62-UBA domain is helix-rich. Structure calculations based on 735 NOE and 56 dihedral angle restraints show that the structure is well defined between residues Pro392 and Ile431 (see Table I); however, the short N- and C-terminal regions are much more dynamic and show no signs of stable secondary structure (Fig. 2).Table ISummary of structural statistics for 27 NMR models of p62-UBANOE restraints (no.)Total732Short range134Medium range336Long range262Dihedral angle restraints (no.)φ53χ13Statistics for 27 XPLOR structuresNOE violations >0.5 Å0Dihedral angle violations >5°0ϕ/φ distribution (percent)aData from PROCHECK on residues 392-431; numbers in parentheses are the data including all residues.Favored72.9% (65.7)Allowed24.4% (28.4)Generous2.6% (5.8)Disallowed0% (0.1)Mean RMSD from mean structure (Å)Backbone heavy atoms (residues 392-431)0.51 ÅAll heavy atoms, residues (residues 392-431)0.95 Åa Data from PROCHECK on residues 392-431; numbers in parentheses are the data including all residues. Open table in a new tab The polypeptide forms a compact three-helix bundle (Fig. 3a), with a helical alignment analogous to that found for the UBA domains of HHR23A (21Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Withers-Ward E.S. Mueller T.D. Chen I.S.Y. Feigon J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14103-14112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3b), a highly conserved protein that functions in nucleotide excision repair. The RMSD between the α-helical backbone Cα atoms of the UBA (2Kuusisto E. Salminen A. Alafuzoff I. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) domain of HHR23A and that of p62 is 1.7 Å indicating a common helical alignment. Although the residues forming the hydrophobic core are mostly conserved, the major differences between the p62-UBA and HHR23A UBA (2Kuusisto E. Salminen A. Alafuzoff I. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) domain are in the loops (L1 and L2) connecting the helices (Fig. 3b). In the p62-UBA, Glu409 and Gly410 extend loop 1 by 2 residues forming a turn partially stabilized by interactions between the side chains of Asp408/Glu409 and residues in helix 2, as clearly evident from the NOE data. The conserved Gly-Phe-Xaa sequence in loop 1 (Gly-Phe-Pro in HHR23A-UBA (2Kuusisto E. Salminen A. Alafuzoff I. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and Gly-Phe-Ser in the p62-UBA), which binds HIV-1 Vpr in HHR23A (23Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.-F. Chen I.S.Y. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is still present in the p62-UBA domain suggesting a possible role for this region in binding accessory proteins. The side chain of Phe406 within loop 1 is, however, partially buried in the hydrophobic core suggesting that it may have a conserved role in structure stabilization and presentation of the GFX motif. The UBA domain of p62, like the UBAs of HHR23A, is stabilized by a well defined hydrophobic core. Despite the low sequence homology between the two UBA domains (Fig. 1b), both have a conserved hydrophobic surface patch previously implicated in ubiquitin binding (21Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on our structural model, it is evident that the Glu396 → Stop and 390Stop PDB mutations cause deletion of most, or loss of all, of the UBA domain, respectively. The structure also un-equivocally places Pro392 at a key position within the UBA domain acting as the N-terminal capping residue of helix 1 (Fig. 3a). To investigate the structural consequences of the Pro392 → Leu mutation, we have characterized by NMR the p62-UBA domain containing this substitution. Analysis of deviations of Hα chemical shifts (Fig. 4a) and intensities of NH-NH sequential NOEs shows that the Pro392 → Leu mutation suggests an extension of the N terminus of helix 1 moving the N-cap backward toward Pro388. By using an in vitro ubiquitin chain binding assay with immobilized recombinant polypeptides, we have confirmed that residues 387–436 of the p62 protein (identical to those used in our structural analysis) confer multiubiquitin chain binding (Fig. 4b). In these experiments we found that the p62-UBA domain binds Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains containing a minimum of two ubiquitins, but we did not detect an interaction with monomeric ubiquitin. Additionally, we did not detect binding of monomeric ubiquitin to the p62-UBA domain in the absence of multiubiquitin chains. We attribute our failure to detect monomeric ubiquitin binding, despite previous reports that p62 binds to (monomeric) ubiquitin-Sepharose (14Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20235-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), to either the relatively low affinity of UBA domains for the monomer (10Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) or the presence of a second uncharacterized monomeric ubiquitin-binding site in the p62 holoprotein (14Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20235-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because the Glu396 → Stop PDB mutation that deletes most of the UBA domain ablates multiubiquitin chain binding in the holoprotein (not shown), a similar effect is predicted for the 390Stop mutation. To determine whether the Pro392 → Leu mutation similarly causes loss of multiubiquitin chain binding, we assessed the functional consequences of this substitution in the p62-UBA domain. In contrast to the PDB deletion mutations, the Pro392 → Leu substitution did not affect either multiubiquitin chain binding in the isolated UBA (Fig. 4) or p62 holoprotein (not shown), suggesting that neither Pro392 nor residues immediately preceding are critical for multiubiquitin chain binding per se. Consistent with the above findings, analysis of our structural model shows that Pro392 does not form part of the hydrophobic surface patch previously implicated in ubiquitin binding in other UBA domains (21Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Additionally, residues that are involved in the modification of secondary structure induced by the Pro392 → Leu substitution (Glu389, Ala390, and Asp391) are not included in this proposed ubiquitin-interacting surface. We have determined the first NMR structure of the p62-UBA domain and shown that the Pro392 → Leu substitution mutation, which causes PDB, modifies secondary structure by extending the N terminus of helix 1. The functional significance of the UBA domain in the p62 protein is currently not known; however, it is able to bind unanchored Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains (13Shin J. Arch. Pharm. Res. 1998; 21: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and as evident in Fig. 4b, which when attached to target proteins, are proteasomal degradation signals (24Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Additionally, p62 binds to multiubiquitinated proteins that accumulate when proteasome degradative function is impaired (13Shin J. Arch. Pharm. Res. 1998; 21: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Stumptner C. Fuchsbichler A. Heid H. Zatloukal K. Denk H. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) further suggesting a role for p62 in the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis as is the case for other UBA domain proteins (26Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We find that in contrast to the loss of multiubiquitin chain binding that results from PDB deletion mutations, modification of secondary structure by the Pro392 → Leu substitution does not affect interaction of the UBA domain with Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains. The observation that deletion and substitution mutations are phenotypically identical is therefore strongly suggestive that UBA domain mutations do not predispose to PDB through a mechanism related to loss of regulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis dependent on a common loss of ubiquitin chain binding by p62. We cannot however discount the possibility that the modification of secondary structure in the N-terminal portion of helix 1 induced by the Pro392 → Leu mutation causes a selective loss of binding of a key ubiquitylated p62 substrate (as opposed to a generalized loss of ubiquitylated p62 substrate binding by the deletion mutations), because our binding analyses were conducted using only unanchored multiubiquitin chains. It will also be of interest to determine the ubiquitin chain specificity of p62 (ubiquitin chains may also be linked via Lys29 and Lys63 (27Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar)) and investigate the effects of the Pro392 → Leu substitution on p62-UBA binding to these species. Additionally, it is also possible that like the UBA (2Kuusisto E. Salminen A. Alafuzoff I. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) of HHR23A which binds directly to HIV-1 Vpr (23Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.-F. Chen I.S.Y. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the p62-UBA domain also interacts with non-ubiquitylated substrates, and PDB deletion and substitution mutations in the UBA domain cause a common loss of interaction with such proteins leading to altered osteoclast activity. Finally, the lack of well defined secondary structure in the N-terminal sequence preceding helix 1 (residues 387–391; Fig. 1b) might suggest that this portion of the polypeptide chain constitutes a flexible linker between the PEST and UBA domains in p62. In this context, it is possible that PDB mutations affect the half-life of p62, for example by exposing PEST sequences that render the protein more susceptible to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (28Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise molecular mechanism by which p62-UBA domain mutations contribute to PDB pathogenesis, it is tempting to speculate that functionally these mutations result in activation of NFκB signaling. Such a proposal is based on the observation that signal peptide mutations in receptor activator of NFκB, which lead to an increase in NFκB signaling, cause the PDB-like condition familial expansile osteolysis (29Hughes A.E. Ralston S.H. Marken J. Bell C. MacPherson H. Wallace R.G. van Hul W. Whyte M.P. Nakatsuka K. Hovy L. Anderson D.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Establishing the precise in vivo function of the p62 protein in bone metabolism, and in particular the identification of ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated UBA domain-interacting proteins, should provide further insights into the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic forms of PDB. We are grateful to the School of Chemistry and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for supporting and funding the NMR facilities and to Prof. S. H. Ralston and Dr. L. J. Hocking (University of Aberdeen) for useful insights and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2079270430,"Diaphanous related formins (DRFs) are part of the formin protein family that control morphogenesis, embryonic differentiation, cytokinesis, and cell polarity. DRFs organize the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells via the interaction with specific members of the Rho family of small GTPases including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. This is best understood for Rho, which transmits signals to the actin cytoskeleton through the cooperation of its DRF effector mDia with ROCK (Rho-associated kinase). Here, we show that a constitutive active form of the Rac-interacting DRF FHOD1 (formin homology 2 domain containing 1) associates with F-actin in NIH3T3 cells, resulting in the formation of thick actin fibers. Cytoskeletal changes induced by FHOD1 correlated with the induction of serum response element transcription and were mediated by formin homology domains 1 and 2 of FHOD1. FHOD1-induced effects required the activity of the Rho-ROCK cascade that is targeted at a level downstream of Rho by the DRF. However, when the functional interaction of FHOD1 with individual GTPases was addressed, Rac but not Rho or Cdc42 bound to FHOD1 in cells and induced its recruitment to actin filaments and lamellipodia/membrane ruffles. Furthermore, activated FHOD1 interfered with lamellipodia formation. These results indicate that FHOD1 acts as an effector of Rac in actin rearrangements and transcriptional regulation and may provide a link for the Rac-dependent activation of the Rho cascade.

These results indicate that FHOD1 acts as an effector of Rac in actin rearrangements and transcriptional regulation and may provide a link for the Rac-dependent activation of the Rho cascade. The dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for central mechanisms of eukaryotic cells including polarization, division, motility, and adhesion. The overall polymerization status of cellular actin is regulated by multiple mechanisms including actin nucleation via Arp2/3 complex and inhibition of ADF-cofilin-induced depolymerization of actin filaments (1Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Additionally, stabilization and/or bundling of actin filaments alter the turnover of actin, thereby affecting the balance between G- and F-actin pools (2Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3-4PubMed Google Scholar). These events are primarily regulated by the small GTPases of the Rho family, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, which are key regulators of the transmission of exogenous stimulation to the inside of the cell. The activities of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases are well understood because an array of distinct effector functions has been delineated, and specific reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton upon individual activation of the GTPases have been established (3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 4Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Whereas activation of Rho induces the formation of actin stress fibers, Rac and Cdc42 polymerize actin at the cell periphery, resulting in the formation of lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and filopodia, respectively (5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that actin reorganizations by Rac and Rho antagonize each other (6Kozma R Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 7Van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E.T. van de Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.C. J.

In a model for cell motility, Rac-induced membrane ruffles create new contact sites that are subsequently matured by the action of Rho, thereby preventing the formation of new contacts by Rac. First evidence for this cross-talk between Rac and Rho was provided by the observation that the formation of lamellipodia upon activation of Rac is proceeded by the appearance of actin stress fibers (10Ridley A.J.

More recently, an opposing pathway leading to the activation of Rac by Rho was described (11Tsuji T. Ishizaki T. Okamoto M. Higashida C. Kimura K. Furuyashiki T. Arakawa Y. Birge R.B. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, specific mediators for the control of Rho activity by Rac are missing, and the molecular mechanisms that allow transmission of GTPase signals to the actin cytoskeleton remain incompletely understood. The diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) 1The abbreviations used are: DRF, diaphanous-related formin; FH, formin homology; SRE, serum response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; wt, wild type; GMP-PNP, guanylamide diphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: DRF, diaphanous-related formin; FH, formin homology; SRE, serum response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; wt, wild type; GMP-PNP, guanylamide diphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin. have recently emerged as a group of proteins with the potential to bridge between G-protein signals and the cytoskeleton via their ability to bind activated small GTPases and to subsequently remodel the cytoskeleton (12Wasserman S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DRFs are part of the formin protein family that control morphogenesis, embryonic differentiation, cytokinesis, and cell polarity (14Frazier J.A. Field C.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R414-R417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formins are large modular molecules containing characteristic sequence motifs termed formin homology domains FH1, FH2, and FH3. Although the function of the FH2 and FH3 domains has remained elusive, the polyproline FH1 domain of some DRFs interacts with the actin-monomer-binding protein profilin and may thus provide a direct link to the actin cytoskeleton (15Watanabe N Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Importantly, DRF-induced changes of actin polymerization correlate with transcriptional activation of certain cellular promotors such as the serum response element (SRE) (16Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 17Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for the interaction of activated mDia1 and mDia2 with Src, the FH1 domain also interacts with SH3 domains to regulate their effects on both the cytoskeleton and transcription (16Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The activity of DRFs is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain and the C-terminal Dia-autoregulatory domain that maintains the protein in an inactive form. Upon binding of an active GTPase to the GTPase-binding domain, autoinhibition is released (18Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Important insight into DRF function came from the characterization of the two yeast DRFs, Bni1p and Bnr1p, that synergize to assemble actin filaments resulting in cell polarization (19Kohno H. Tanaka K. Mino A. Umikawa M. Imamura H. Fujiwara T. Fujita Y. Hotta K. Qadota H. Watanabe T. Ohya Y. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6060-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20Imamura H.

Similar findings were made for the function of the mammalian DRFs mDia 1-3, because cooperative activation of the Rho effectors mDia1 and ROCK results in the formation of actin stress fibers (24Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 25Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Despite this overlap of functions of DRFs in yeast and mammals, recent work suggests that DRFs are not all functionally homologous. Individual specificity of DRFs for distinct GTPases likely regulates their activity. Originally, DRFs, such as mDia1, mDia2, and Bni1p, were defined as binding partners and downstream effectors of Rho, but mDia2 and Bni1p were found to interact also with Cdc42 to facilitate filopodia formation (15Watanabe N Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 16Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P.

Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 534-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that specific GTPase-DRF pairs exist for distinct effects on actin remodeling, such as the regulation of endosome motility by RhoD via the Dia2C splice variant (27Gasman S. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The DRF Daam represents another variation of this theme by acting as upstream activator of Rho in the Wnt signaling cascade (28Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). For the Rac1 GTPase, the interaction with two formins, FRL and FHOD1 (previously known as FHOS (formin homologue overexpressed in spleen)) has been described, but their functional characterization awaits further characterization. FRL plays an as yet undefined role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton specifically in macrophages (29Yayoshi-Yamamoto S Taniuchi I. Watanabe T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6872-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FHOD1 was initially identified as an interaction partner of the AML-1B transcription factor (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subsequently, FHOD1 was shown to interact specifically with Rac1 in vitro and was implied in the activation of the SRE (31Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46453-464539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that FHOD1 is a specific interaction partner of Rac and mediates rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton that correlate with activation of SRE transcription. A constitutive active form of FHOD1, lacking the C-terminal Dia-autoregulatory domain, associated with actin filaments to induce the formation of thick actin fibers in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and also interfered with lamellipodia formation by Rac. The association of FHOD1 with actin filaments correlated with the formation of actin fibers and an increase in cellular F-actin levels in an Arp2/3-independent manner. Because we found that FHOD1-actin fiber formation requires the activity of the Rho-ROCK cascade downstream of Rho, our data suggest FHOD1 as a cytoskeletal effector in the Rac-dependent activation of the Rho pathway that might play a role in lamellipodia formation and transcriptional regulation. Cells and Reagents—NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were maintained in standard low or high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, complemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, glutamin, penicillin, and streptomycin. All medium components were purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse (F-7) or rabbit (Y-11) anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (B-5-1-2) as well as fluorescently labeled phalloidin were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa488 or Alexa568) and Alexa660-conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes. Expression Plasmids and GST Purification—Expression plasmids for GFP-tagged GTPases as well as the Arp2/3-interfering fragment of WASP were generous gifts of Michael Way (32Moreau V. Frischknecht; F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for Arp3·GFP, C3 transferase, 5×SRE-Luc, ROCKΔ3, and RhoA-Myc were kindly provided by Dorothy Schafer (33Schafer D.A. Welch M.D. Machesky L.M. Bridgman P.C. Meyer S.M. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1919-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), Art Alberts (16Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and Stefan Offermans, respectively. pTk-Renilla was purchased from Clontech. The pCMV5-HA-FHOD1 full-length and HA-FHOD1(ΔC) expression plasmids were kindly provided by Jennifer Westendorf (30Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The GST-RacL61 expression plasmid was a kind gift by Olivier Dorseuil, and the GST fusion constructs for the wild type GTPases were provided by Jean de Gunzberg. The respective fusion proteins were purified from BL21 Escherichia coli cells in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. All of the proteins prepared for binding analysis were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining analysis. Deletions of the FH1 and FH2 domains in the full-length and ΔC constructs were introduced by ligating the AflIII/EcoRI-digested PCR amplicons into the NcoI/EcoRI sites of the EF-HA plink vector (34Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All of the PCR products were generated using gene-specific oligonucleotides (MWG Biotech AG) and high fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and the correctness of the respective deletions was verified by sequencing in all clones. Transfections and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For transfection, NIH3T3 cells were kept in 10% FCS and plated onto glass coverslips overnight, subsequently transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and further processed 24-30 h post-transfection. For immunofluorescence, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (15 min at room temperature), except cells expressing GFP·GTPase fusion proteins, which were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. After permeabilization with PBS/0.1% Triton-X100 for 2 min, cells were blocked with PBS/1% BSA for 30 min. For indirect immunofluorescence, primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in PBS, 1% BSA and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After four washing steps with PBS, the secondary antibodies were diluted 1: 1000 in PBS, 1% BSA and incubated for 45 min. Following extensive washing, the cells were mounted with Histogel (Linaris). For F-actin staining, paraformaldehyde fixed cells were treated with fluorescent phalloidin for 5 min and washed with PBS. The indirect fluorescence images were monitored with an Olympus 1 × 70 microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop. Quantification of F-actin levels was achieved using Soft Imaging System Analysis (SIS) software. Pixel intensities of cells were determined from multiple representative cytoplasmic areas of FHOD1 expressing and directly neighboring control cells after subtraction of unspecific background. Average values from at least 75% of the entire cytoplasmic area of these cells were used to calculate the ratio of pixel intensity between transfected and control cells and used as measure for the relative F-actin levels of FHOD1-expressing cells. Statistical verification of the observed differences was ascertained with the Student's t test. For confocal analysis, the stained cells were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS-NT system, Leica) attached to a DM IRB inverted microscope with a PLAPO 63×1.32 oil immersion objective. Confocal images were collected as 512 × 512 pixel files and subsequently processed. GTPase Binding Assay—24 h post-transfection, 4 × 106 wtFHOD1-expressing HeLa cells were lyzed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The cytoplasmic lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of GST or GST-RacL61 proteins immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA (interaction buffer), respectively. For preloading of the GTPases, purified GST-Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 proteins (250 μm) were incubated with GMP-PNP (Roche Applied Science; 250 μm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at 30 °C, before the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. Binding assays using preloaded GMP-PNP GST-Rac1, -RhoA, and -Cdc42 proteins (10 μg) were carried out in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. The beads were washed three times in interaction buffer, and the bound cellular proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody. Drug Treatment—For the inhibition of ROCK, NIH3T3 cells were incubated for 30 min with 30 μm of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Calbiochem) 24 h post-transfection, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. For exogenous Rho stimulation, the cells were incubated with lysophosphatidic acid (Sigma) (20 min, 5 μm). Microinjection—Microinjection was performed with modifications as described (35Fackler O.T. Luo W Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips were cultivated in the presence of 0.1% FCS for 24 h prior to transfer to CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) and subsequent injection. Plasmids (10 μg/ml in 0.5× PBS) were injected with a microinjecton apparatus (AIS2 Microinjector, Cell Biology Trading) by using pulled borsolicate glass capillaries. At least 100 individual cells were injected per coverslip for each experiment. Unless specified otherwise, the cells were cultivated in the presence of 0.1% FCS for 6 h following injection prior to fixation and microscopic analysis. Western Blotting—For Western blot analysis, transfected cells were lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl for 1 h, 4 °C), and cleared lysates (10,000 × g, 10 min) corresponding to 5 × 105 cells/lane were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein detection was performed following incubation with appropriate first and secondary antibodies using the Super Signal detection kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SRE Transcription Assay—To quantify activation of the SRE by FHOD1, 2 × 104 NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 1.3 μg of FHOD1 expression vector, 0.2 μg of pTK-Renilla encoding for Renilla luciferase to normalize for transfection efficiency, and 0.5 μg of the 5×SRE-Luc reporter plasmid. 24 h post-transfection, cell culture medium was changed to starve cells at 0.1% FCS, and the cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system kit (Promega) with a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems). SRE firefly luciferase counts were normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase internal control and calculated as fold transactivation with the counts for FHOD1wt arbitrarily set to 1. GTPase Activation Assay—Rho activity was quantified by measuring the amounts of Rho precipitated in a pull-down reaction from cell lysates with the GTPase-binding domain of Rhotekin as GST bait using the Rho activation assay biochemistry kit (Cytoskeleton) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 24 h post-transfection, 2 × 107 HeLa cells transiently co-expressing RhoA and FHOD1wt or FHOD1ΔC were serum-starved for 12 h, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and collected. Following lysis, the cleared lysates were split into three equal aliquots. As negative and positive controls for the pull down, two aliquots were adjusted to 200 μm GDP or GTPγS, respectively, and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C to deplete or enrich Rho-GTP, whereas one aliquot remained untreated. Following the pull-down reaction and extensive washing, the precipitates and whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the amounts of Rho. Activated FHOD1 Induces the Formation of and Associates with Thick Actin Fibers—Given that formins are generally thought of as cytoskeletal organizers, we investigated whether the Rac-binding partner FHOD1 can affect cytoskeletal architecture. Like other formins, the C terminus of FHOD1 contains a Dia-autoregulatory domain autoinhibitory domain, and deletion of this domain results in a constitutive active molecule (31Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46453-464539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were therefore transfected with constructs directing the expression of the HA epitope-tagged wild type FHOD1 protein (FHOD1wt) or a FHOD1 mutant lacking the last 156 amino acids (FHOD1ΔC), and their subcellular localization and the F-actin organization were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the subcellular localization and effects on the actin cytoskeleton of FHOD1wt and FHOD1ΔC proteins were found to be significantly different. FHOD1wt showed a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (panel 3). In cells with pronounced membrane ruffles, FHODwt was also found at the cell periphery (data not shown). Similarly to nontransfected cells, the cells expressing FHOD1wt displayed only low amounts of thin actin filaments without particular orientation and co-localization with the DRF (panel 4). In contrast, FHOD1ΔC was exclusively localized to thick filamentous structures reminiscent of actin stress fibers that were aligned in parallel alongside the long axis of transfected cells (panel 1). In contrast to nontransfected control cells, prominent actin stress fibers were observed in the presence of FHOD1ΔC (panel 2). To verify that active FHOD1 associates with filamentous actin, confocal microscopy analysis was performed on FHOD1ΔC-expressing cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, strong co-localization of FHOD1ΔC with actin fibers was observed. Together, these results indicate that activation of FHOD1 caused the formation of thick actin fibers. In agreement with these findings, FHOD1ΔC was mostly associated with the detergent-insoluble cell fraction, whereas FHOD1wt was strictly detergent-soluble (data not shown). The formation of stress fibers can result from bundling of pre-existing actin filament or from de novo formation of actin fibers. To assay for an involvement of actin polymerization in FHOD1-actin fiber formation, the fluorescence intensity of F-actin stains from FHOD1ΔC-expressing cells were compared with that of neighboring cells (i.e. as in Fig. 1A, panels 2 and 4), and the ratio of the two values was used to plot the changes in relative F-actin levels (Fig. 1C). Although expression of FHOD1wt did not markedly affect the amounts of F-actin levels as compared with control cells transfected with an empty plasmid (average, 100 ± 16.5%; n = 30), relative amounts of F-actin were significantly increased by the presence of FHOD1ΔC (average, 251 ± 64.1; n = 30). Thus, the formation of stress fibers by active FHOD1 involves the elevation of actin polymerization in cells. FHOD1-Actin Fiber Formation Coincides with Actin Association of the DRF—To gain further insights into FHOD1-actin fiber formation, we compared the kinetics of fiber formation and actin association of FHOD1ΔC in cells. Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were microinjected with the FHOD1ΔC expression plasmid, stained for F-actin and FHOD1, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). When the distribution of FHOD1ΔC was monitored over time after microinjection, we found that in the early phase of expression (2 h post-injection), the majority of the protein was not associated with actin filaments but rather diffusely localized in the cytoplasm (upper panels). Importantly, only a few thickened actin fibers, already decorated by FHOD1ΔC, were detectable 2 h post-injection. Over time, the distribution changed toward the exclusive association of FHOD1ΔC with polymerized actin (lower panels). Formation of thick actin fibers occurred solely upon decoration of actin filaments by FHOD1ΔC. Quantification of the kinetics of the association of FHOD1 with F-actin and stress fiber formation in three independent experiments revealed that only about 5% of all cells displayed significant stress fiber formation and F-actin association of FHOD1ΔC 2 h post-injection. In contrast, at 6 h post-injection, FHOD1ΔC was exclusively found associated with thick actin fibers in more than 75% of all injected cells. These results indicate that the association of FHOD1 with F-actin occurs simultaneously with the formation of marked actin fibers, suggesting that FHOD1 actively causes the formation of these structures. Arp2/3 Is Not Involved in the Formation of FHOD1-Actin Fibers—Yeast DRFs cause the formation of actin cables without de novo actin nucleation via Arp2/3 complex (22Evangelista M. Pruyne D. Amberg D.C. Boone C. Bretscher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the formation of FHOD1-actin fibers also occurred independently of Arp2/3. First, we used an Arp3·GFP fusion protein to test whether Arp2/3 complex is recruited to sites of FHOD1-actin fiber formation (Fig. 3A). No effect on the cellular distribution of Arp3·GFP by the expression of FHOD1ΔC could be detected (compare panels 2 and 3). Furthermore, Arp3·GFP did not localize to FHOD1-induced actin fibers (panels 1 and 2). Second, we sought to interfere with the activation of Arp2/3 by Wasp-like proteins. Arp2/3 activation can be inhibited by overexpression of the C-terminal effector domain (WA) of Wasp (32Moreau V. Frischknecht; F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When we co-expressed the WA·GFP fusion protein with active FHOD1, actin fiber formation and association of FHOD1ΔC were not affected (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 2). In control cells, expression of WA·GFP alone did not cause the formation of stress fibers and significantly reduced lamellipodia formation induced by the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (11Tsuji T. Ishizaki"
https://openalex.org/W2124428893,"Recent studies have suggested that the NF-Y transcription factor is involved in transcription repression of the cell cycle regulatory genes in a response to p53 induction or DNA damage. Here we demonstrate the cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of NF-Y and its involvement in transcription repression by the p53-p21 signaling pathway. Cdk2 phosphorylates two serine residues near the DNA-binding domain of the YA subunit of NF-Y. Cyclin A-cdk2 appears to associate with NF-Y both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, YA protein is phosphorylated in parallel with a cell cycle-dependent activation of cdk2 kinase and cyclin A expression. YA phosphorylation is unnecessary for heterotrimer formation with the YB-YC dimer. However, NF-Y containing a phosphorylation-deficient mutant form of YA, YA-aa, has its DNA binding activity impaired. Consistently, YA-aa inhibits transcription activation of a NF-Y target promoter, cdc2, by cdk2. These results facilitate the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle progression involving the p21-cdk2-NF-Y signaling pathway.

Sequential activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; pcdc2-luc, cdc2 promoter-luciferase. ensure an orderly progress through the cell cycle (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). CDK activities are regulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as a periodic cyclin accumulation and degradation, nuclear localization, phosphorylation of CDKs, and association with a number of different CDK inhibitors (2Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar, 4Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The cyclin-CDK complexes are thought to control the cell cycle by phosphorylating key regulatory proteins at specific points of the cell cycle. There is therefore a great deal of interest in identifying specific substrates for these cyclin-CDK complexes at each cell cycle phase. NF-Y, also known as CBF (CCAAT-binding factor), was first identified as a protein that binds to the Y box of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II Eα promoters (5Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Unlike other CCAAT-binding proteins, NF-Y has an absolute requirement for the CCAAT pentanucleotide as well as a strong preference for specific flanking sequences (5Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Unique among transcription factors, NF-Y is comprised of three different subunits, YA, YB, and YC, which are collectively required to bind the CCAAT motif (6Sinha S. Kim I.S. Sohn K.Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis showed that YB and YC interact with each other to form a stable heterodimer and that YA only interacts with the YB-YC heterodimer to form a heterotrimeric NF-Y (6Sinha S. Kim I.S. Sohn K.Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The YB and YC subunits associate through an evolutionarily well conserved domain that contains the histone-fold “hand shake” motif, which resembles the α-helical structure in histone H2B/H2A (7Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of YA contains a glutamine-rich domain (8Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the C-terminal half is essential for DNA binding and interaction with the YB-YC heterodimer (9Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Initial studies led to the identification of NF-Y in almost all cell types, suggesting that it represents a prototypic example of an immutable, constitutive transcription factor. However, several later reports demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of NF-Y changes during different stages of B-cell development (10Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18220-18229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), senescence (11Pang J.H. Chen K.Y. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2818-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). With regard to the cell cycle, it has been shown that NF-Y binds to and activates the promoters of G1/S genes, a family of genes whose expression is induced at G1/S. These G1/S genes can be further subdivided into two different groups, S- and G2-specific genes, depending on the cell cycle phases at which they are needed. G2-specific genes, whose expression is induced at G1/S and reaches maximum levels at G2/M phase, such as cdc2, cyclin B, and cdc25C, play a key role at G2/M transition (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 16Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We previously found that p53 inhibits cell cycle-dependent transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes, such as cdc2 and cyclin B genes, which, in turn, results in inactivation of cdc2 and G2 checkpoint arrest (17Park M. Chae H.D. Yun J. Jung M. Kim Y.S. Kim S.H. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 542-545PubMed Google Scholar). Also, NF-Y is involved in transcription repression of G2-specific genes after p53 induction and DNA damage (18Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Manni J. Mazzaro G. Gurtner A. Mantovani R. Haugwitz U. Krause K. Engeland K. Sacchi A. Soddu S. Piaggio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5570-5576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DNA binding activity of NF-Y is decreased by p53 (12Jung M.S. Yun J. Chae H.D. Kim J.M. Kim S.C. Choi T.S. Shin D.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5818-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These studies suggested a possibility that inhibition of cdk2 by p21 is involved in the repression of DNA binding activity of NF-Y by p53 and led us to investigate a mechanism for regulation of NF-Y by cdk2-dependent phosphorylation. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human HEK293, EJ, and HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfections were performed using the CaPO4 coprecipitation procedure (20Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We differentially used three independent cell lines: HEK293 for transient expression of target genes, EJ for stable expression, and HCT116 for cell cycle analysis. In transient transfection experiments, pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid was used to monitor and to normalize the transfection efficiency (18Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Plasmids and Recombinant Adenovirus—To generate FLAG epitope-tagged NF-Y expression plasmids, we cloned the coding sequences of YA, YB, and YC from Δ4YA13, Δ4YB, and Δ4YC (21Mantovani R. Li X.Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huisjduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). Point mutations at phosphorylation sites were generated using the overlapping extension PCR method (22Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. Dieftenbach C. PCR Primer: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Woodbury, NY1995Google Scholar). All substitutions were verified by DNA sequencing. The DNA fragments obtained by PCR were cloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector, resulting in plasmids pFLAG-YA-aa, pFLAG-YA-as, and pFLAG-YA-sa. Cloning of wild type and mutant YA into pGEX-KG generated pGST-YA, -YA-aa, -YA-as, and -YA-sa constructs. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear lysates were prepared and NF-Y binding reactions were performed as described earlier (18Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear lysates (5 μg) were incubated with an end-labeled DNA probe containing the distal CCAAT motif of the cdc2 promoter (-88 to -64). The resulting DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE at 15 mA for 2 h. For antibody supershift assay, 1 μg of anti-NF-YA antibody (Accurate) or an anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) was added into the preincubation mixture. The radioactivity of the desired band was measured, using a phosphorimaging analyzer (Fuji). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cell extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer and then subjected to Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (23Park S.P. Kim E.J. Park T.C. Kim E.J. Kim J. Lee J.M. Namgoong S.E. Um S.J. Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 33: 236-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated mixture or 20 μg of total protein was separated on a 12% SDS gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mouse and rabbit antibodies for immunoprecipitation used are as follows: anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-cdk2 (SC-163; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cdc2 (SC-54), anti-cdk4 (SC-260), anti-cyclin A (SC-596), anti-cyclin B (SC-752), and anti-cyclin E (AB-1; Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) antibodies. Antibodies against each subunit of NF-Y (YA, SC-7712; YB, SC-7711; YC, SC-7715; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), cyclin A (SC-596; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and cyclin E (AB-1; Neomarkers) were used for Western blotting of immunoprecipitates. GST Pull-down Experiments—Cells were prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm benzamidine). The lysates were precleared by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were added to the GST-YA proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In vivo Phosphorylation Analysis—Cells were washed twice with TBS (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl), followed by4hof labeling in 3 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. The labeled cells were treated with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 m NaF, 10 μm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged to produce clear lysates. Labeled lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). After rigorous washes, samples were boiled and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoretic separation. Phosphorylated protein species were visualized by autoradiography. In vitro Kinase Assay—Specific activities of CDK-cyclin complexes were determined by 32P incorporation into substrates. For immunoprecipitation kinase assay, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 1 μm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 μm NaF, 10 μm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,1 mm dithiothreitol). Extracts (200 μg) were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-cdk2 (SC-163; Santa Cruz), anti-cdc2 (SC-54; Santa Cruz), or anti-cdk4 (SC-260; Santa Cruz) antibody. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized on protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol for cdk2 and cdc2 assays; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol for cdk4 assay). Following the final wash, the immune complexes were suspended in 50 μl of the corresponding kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of substrate, specifically, histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) for the cdk2 and cdc2 assays and Rb C-terminal fragment (New England Biolabs) for the cdk4 assay. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. In vitro Phosphorylation Analyses of NF-Y—An in vitro kinase assay was performed, using purified GST-YA fusion protein as substrate. The cdk2 complex was obtained by immunoprecipitation of HEK293 or EJ cell lysates with antibodies against cyclins and CDKs, as described above. GST protein, purified GST-YA, GST-YA-aa, GST-YA-sa, or GSTYA-as fusion protein (2 μg) were incubated with the immunoprecipitated cdk2 complex in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize substrates, dried, and subsequently exposed to film for autoradiography. Phosphorylation of the YA Subunit in the NF-Y Transcription Factor in Vivo—To verify the hypothesis that p53 inhibits DNA binding activity of NF-Y through the p21-cdk2 pathway, we examined the possibility that CDK phosphorylates NF-Y. HEK293 cells were transfected with each of the NF-Y subunits, YA, YB, and YC, in conjunction with the FLAG tag. Following transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Only two subunits, YA and YB, were ascertained as phosphoproteins in vivo (Fig. 1A). To further examine whether these subunits are phosphorylated by CDKs, we treated EJ cells stably expressing FLAG-YA or FLAG-YB with roscovitine, a particularly potent inhibitor of cdc2 and cdk2, but a weak inhibitor for cdk4 (24De Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 25Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of YA was significantly reduced by roscovitine treatment, whereas that of YB remained unaffected (Fig. 1B). We next examined the effects of p21 to verify CDK-dependent phosphorylation of NF-Y. p21 is a major transcriptional target of p53 and has been shown to be one of the principal mediators of p53-induced cell cycle arrest by binding of cyclin-CDK complexes (26Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 27Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar, 28Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). Cells were additionally infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding the p21 gene. Results showed that while YB phosphorylation remained unperturbed, the phosphorylation level of YA was significantly reduced upon p21 expression (Fig. 1C). Therefore, YA is likely to be the only NF-Y subunit that gets phosphorylated by CDKs in vivo. Cell Cycle-dependent Phosphorylation of YA—To obtain evidence for YA phosphorylation by G1-specific CDKs, we examined whether YA is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, because activation of CDKs is cell cycle-dependent. NIH3T3 cells were synchronized at G0 phase by serum depletion. After serum addition, cells synchronously progressed through the G1, S, and G2 phases (Fig. 2A). Cyclin A, B, and E expressions were, respectively, induced from 12, 16, and 8 h after serum addition (Fig. 2B). These results coincide with previous studies in which cyclin E, A, and B are sequentially expressed in late G1, G1/S boundary, and late S and G2 phase, respectively (29Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cdk2 activity was detectable from 8 h and became prominent at 12 h after serum addition, when cells entered the S phase (Fig. 2B). Although the protein level of YA was not affected, YA phosphorylation was cell cycle-dependent; YA became phosphorylated from 12 h after serum addition (Fig. 2B). Therefore, YA protein is phosphorylated in parallel with a periodic activation of cdk2 kinase and cyclin A expression. Cdk2 Phosphorylates and Physically Associates with NF-Y— We next examined effects of dominant negative mutants of cdc2, cdk2, and cdk4. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a FLAG-YA plasmid and a dominant negative mutant of cdc2 (cdc2D146N), cdk2 (cdk2D145N), or cdk4 (cdk4D158N) (30van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). YA phosphorylation decreased in cells expressing the cdk2 mutant, but not in those expressing either the cdc2 or the cdk4 mutant (Fig. 3B), supporting the theory that cdk2 is responsible for YA phosphorylation in vivo. To confirm that cdk2 directly phosphorylates YA, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified GST-fused YA protein. Although immunoprecipitates with anti-cdk2, anti-cyclin A, and anti-cyclin E antibodies phosphorylated GST-YA protein, that formed with an anti-cyclin B antibody did not (Fig. 3A). Although both cdk2 complexes phosphorylate YA protein in vitro (Fig. 3), YA phosphorylation paralleled cyclin A expression throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2B). Based on this, we examined which of the cdk2 complexes physically associates with NF-Y. Bacterially produced GST-YA proteins were mixed with extract of EJ cells in GST binding assay (Fig. 4A). The YA protein was found to bind cyclin A and cdk2, but not cyclin E (Fig. 4A). We further examined interactions between endogenous cdk2 and each subunit of NF-Y, using cell extracts from EJ cells stably expressing FLAG-YB to immunoprecipitate endogenous cdk2, YA, and YC. Western blotting analysis showed that the anti-cdk2 antibody immunoprecipitated endogenous YA and YC and FLAG-YB proteins (Fig. 4B). Reciprocally, an anti-FLAG antibody was shown to immunoprecipitate cdk2 and cyclin A, but not cyclin E (Fig. 4B). These results provide further evidence for preferential in vivo association of cyclin A-cdk2 with NF-Y. Phosphorylation of Two Serine Residues near the DNA-binding Domain of YA—From sequence analyses, we identified two possible phosphorylation sites near the DNA-binding domain encompassing residues 280-318 (Fig. 5A). To examine whether cdk2 phosphorylates the two serine residues at positions 320 and 326 in YA, we replaced either or both with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 5A). In a kinase assay using purified GST fusion proteins in vitro, cdk2 phosphorylated the wild type and both of the single-mutant proteins (YA-as and -sa), but not the double-mutant protein (YA-aa) (Fig. 5B). Further examination of the phosphorylation state of wild type and mutant YA in vivo revealed that both of the single-mutant forms were phosphorylated, whereas the double-mutant protein remained exclusively in the non-phosphorylated form (Fig. 5C). From these data, we conclude that cdk2 phosphorylates both of the serine residues in YA in vivo. Role of YA Phosphorylation in the DNA Binding Activity of NF-Y—We subsequently investigated the physiological role of the cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of YA. Fig. 6A shows that both wild type YA and its phosphorylation-deficient mutant (YA-aa) co-immunoprecipitated with the YB and YC proteins to a similar extent (Fig. 6A), indicating that phosphorylation of YA is unnecessary for its interaction with the YB-YC heterodimer. However, a gel shift assay demonstrated that NF-Y containing YA-aa has its DNA binding activity impaired (Fig. 6B). The concentration of the DNA-NF-Y complex in cells transfected with the vector control and FLAG-tagged wild type YA was not significantly altered (Fig. 6C), indicating that an excess amount of FLAG-tagged YA protein does not affect the DNA binding activity of NF-Y. These results also suggest that the YB-YC dimer is a rate-limiting factor for the formation of the NF-Y ternary complex. A supershift assay showed that the NF-Y-DNA complex with FLAG-tagged YA is present at ∼9-fold excess over that with endogenous YA (Fig. 6C). In support of this observation, protein blot data (Fig. 6D) showed that total YA protein was increased ∼11-fold by transfection with YA. Thus, the FLAG-tagged YA protein competes with endogenous YA with similar affinity to the YB-YC dimer. However, the NF-Y-DNA complex significantly decreased in cells transfected with YA-aa, becoming 12% of those in cells with wild type YA (Fig. 6C). Whereas DNA-bound NF-Y with endogenous YA was present at similar levels in cells transfected with wild type YA and YA-aa, those with YA-aa decreased ∼10-fold as compared with those with wild type YA (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the NF-Y complex containing YA-aa has a defect in DNA binding ability, although YA and YA-aa appear to bind the YB-YC heterodimer with similar affinity. To support that YA phosphorylation is necessary for DNA binding activity of NF-Y, we examined the effects of cdk2 inhibitors in the DNA binding activity of NF-Y. Fig. 7 shows that the DNA binding activity of NF-Y decreased as cdk2 was inactivated in cells expressing p21 or treated with roscovitine (Fig. 7). These results explain the observation of our previous study that p53 decreases the DNA binding activity of NF-Y without altering the protein levels of the three subunits of NF-Y (15Farina A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Tiainen M. Cenciarelli C. Bellorini M. Mantovani R. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2818-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). YA Phosphorylation Is Required for NF-Y-dependent Transcription—We next performed a transient transfection assay to support that cdk2-dependent YA phosphorylation is required for transcription of the NF-Y target genes. To examine whether cdk2 activates the NF-Y target promoters, we co-transfected the cdc2 promoter-luciferase reporter (pcdc2-luc) with a cyclin A expression plasmid. Fig. 8A shows that cyclin A activated the cdc2 promoter, but not the mutant promoter with the NF-Y-binding CCAAT box deleted (ΔCCAAT), indicating that NF-Y is necessary for cdk2-dependent activation of the cdc2 promoter. This activation, however, can be blocked by p21 expression (Fig. 8A). We next examined whether YA phosphorylation is required for cdk2-dependent activation of the cdc2 promoter. Fig. 8B showed that YA-aa blocked the activation of the cdc2 promoter by cyclin A expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B), implying that YA phosphorylation is essential for cdk2-dependent cdc2 transcription. These results support that YA-aa phosphorylation is necessary for transcription activation of the NF-Y target promoters by cdk2. We further examined whether the inhibitory function of YA-aa can be suppressed by wild type YA. YA-aa repressed the cdc2 promoter, but wild type YA did not (Fig. 8C). These results concur with Fig 6B. However, repression of the cdc2 promoter by YA-aa was suppressed by overexpression of wild type YA (Fig. 8C), implying that YA-aa represses the cdc2 promoter by inhibiting wild type YA functions. In this study, we have presented a set of evidence that the YA subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor is a physiological substrate of cyclin A-cdk2. YA phosphorylation is affected by cell cycle phases (Fig. 2) and decreased by p21 expression and roscovitine treatment (Fig. 1). Although both cyclin A- and E-associated cdk2 recognize Ser/Thr-Pro-X basic amino acid as a phosphorylation site in vitro, the substrate specificity of cdk2-bound cyclin E and A has been demonstrated by in vivo affinity between cdk2 complexes and their substrates (31Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22296-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Fojas de Borja P. Collins N.K. Du P. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Mudryj M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5737-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We showed that cyclin A-cdk2 physically associates with NF-Y both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3). Furthermore, YA phosphorylation is parallel with a periodic cyclin A expression (Fig. 2). Although YA phosphorylation had no effect on heterotrimer formation with the YB-YC dimer, it is necessary for efficient DNA binding of NF-Y (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with the localization of the two phosphorylated residues near the DNA binding domain of YA (Fig. 4). The role of YA phosphorylation was further supported by the fact that DNA binding activity of NF-Y decreased as cdk2 was inactivated in cells expressing p21 and treated with roscovitine (Fig. 7). Because NF-Y consists of three different subunits that are all required to bind DNA and because YA-aa competes with endogenous YA with similar affinity to the YB-YC dimer (Fig. 6), YA-aa could inhibit NF-Y functions in a dominant negative manner. A transient transfection assay further supported the dominant negative function of YA-aa (Fig. 8C). Moreover, the assay showed that YA phosphorylation is essential for cdk2-dependent transcription activation of the cdc2 promoter (Fig. 8). It has been reported that the Rb-E2F repressor complex also regulates transcription of a part of NF-Y target genes, including cdc2 (9Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 16Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The cdc2 promoter contains both the NF-Y binding site and Rb-E2F complex binding site, termed CDE/CHR, at about -20 from the transcription initiation site (16Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that deletion of the CDE/CHR repressor element results in increased activity of the cdc2 promoter (34Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we previously reported that the cdc2 promoter with deletion of CDE/CHR could be further activated by loss of p53 function (18Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), indicating that the CDE/CHR repressor element is not the only way to regulate transcription of the promoter. Because cdk2 phosphorylates Rb protein and inactivates the repressor function of Rb-E2F, it is important to determine whether the NF-Y-binding CCAAT box is required for cdk2-dependent transcription activation. Fig. 8A showed that overexpression of cyclin A failed to activate the mutant cdc2 promoter with CCAAT box deletion. Taken together with previous studies, it can be concluded that transcription of those genes might be regulated by at least two different signaling pathways, repression by the Rb-E2F complex and activation by NF-Y. Recent reports suggested that the transcriptional repression function of p53 is important in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (35Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Maheswaran S. Englert C. Bennett P. Heinrich G. Haber D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Initially, transcriptional repression by p53 was thought to be achieved by direct interactions of p53 with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) or TBP-associated factors, resulting in inhibition of basic transcription machinery (38Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Horikoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12028-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, a number of groups reported that the p53-dependent repression of certain genes is dependent on the existence of binding sites of specific transcription factors, for which detailed molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. We previously reported that the transcription activation domain of p53 is essential for its ability to repress the cdc2 promoter (18Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Taking these and current results together, we propose that p21 expression by p53 leads to NF-Y inactivation through inhibition of cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of the YA subunit. Recent studies informed us that the DNA binding activity of NF-Y is down-regulated in differentiated and senescent cells, hinting that NF-Y target genes are repressed not only during cell cycle arrest but also at the onset of differentiation and senescence (15Farina A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Tiainen M. Cenciarelli C. Bellorini M. Mantovani R. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2818-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because the CCAAT motif, which is specific for NF-Y, is present in the promoters of tissue-specific, housekeeping, and cell cycle-regulatory genes (9Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 40Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we propose that the cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of NF-Y is a general mechanism for transcription regulation of selected classes of cell proliferation-related genes in response to various growth regulatory signals.

A major problem associated with these treatments, however, is the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Thus, there is a compelling need to find drugs against other viral targets. One such target is the interaction between Tat, an HIV-1 regulatory protein essential for viral replication, and trans-activation-responsive (TAR) RNA. Here we describe the design and synthesis of an encoded combinatorial library containing 39,304 unnatural small molecules. Using a rapid high through-put screening technology, we identified 59 compounds. Structure-activity relationship studies led to the synthesis of 19 compounds that bind TAR RNA with high affinities. In the presence of a representative Tat-TAR inhibitor (5 μm TR87), we observed potent and sustained suppression of HIV replication in cultured cells over 24 days. The same concentration of this inhibitor did not exhibit any toxicity in cell cultures or in mice. TR87 was also shown to specifically disrupt Tat-TAR binding in vitro and inhibit Tat-mediated transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo, providing a strong correlation between its activities and inhibition of HIV-1 replication. These results provide a structural scaffold for further development of new drugs, alone or in combination with other drugs, for treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals. Our results also suggest a general strategy for discovering pharmacophores targeting RNA structures that are essential in progression of other infectious, inflammatory, and genetic diseases.

To date the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved only 16 anti-HIV 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TAR, trans-activation-responsive; MTT, 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan; RT, reverse transcriptase; LTR, long terminal repeat; Fmoc, N-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; DCM, dichloromethane; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; HOBT, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; DIPDCI, N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide; HP, Hewlett-Packard; TAK, Tat-associated kinase; GC/ECD, electron capture gas chromatography; μ-ECD, microelectron capture detector; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. drugs. These anti-HIV agents fall into three broad categories: 1) nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, 2) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 3) protease inhibitors. Although the use of multidrug cocktails has significantly reduced age-adjusted death rates from AIDS in developed countries, AIDS therapies still face many constraints, including some inadequate therapeutic responses and frequent intolerable drug toxicity. Another serious drawback of these therapies is that all of the current drugs induce single-drug- or multidrug-resistant mutant viruses. In view of these realities, there is a compelling need to find new drugs and/or treatment strategies that are not limited to targeting HIV reverse transcriptase and protease. HIV-1 is a complex retrovirus that encodes six regulatory proteins, including Tat and Rev, essential for viral replication. Inhibition of Tat and Rev functions provides attractive targets for new antiviral therapies. Both Tat and Rev are RNA-binding proteins that require specific interactions with RNA structures called TAR (for trans-activation-responsive) and RRE (for Rev response element), respectively, for their functions. After the integration step in the HIV life cycle, the HIV proviral genome is transcribed by human cellular machinery, including RNA polymerase II and other transcription accessory factors. Transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter is a complex process and is elegantly regulated at the elongation stage of transcription (Fig. 1). HIV-1 encodes a transcriptional activator protein, Tat, which is expressed early in the viral life cycle and is essential for viral gene expression, replication, and pathogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Jones K.A.

Tat enhances the processivity of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that initiate in the HIV LTR region (Fig. 1). Mutational analysis of HIV-1 Tat protein has identified two important functional domains: an arginine-rich region that is required for binding to TAR RNA, and an activation domain that mediates its interactions with cellular machinery (7Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3551-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3703-3711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that Tat transactivation function is mediated by a nuclear Tat-associated kinase (TAK) (1Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4Taube R. Fujinaga K. Wimmer J. Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 1999; 264: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of Tat interacts with TAK (9Herrmann C. Rice A. Virology. 1993; 197: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was recently shown to be identical to the kinase subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor complex, P-TEFb (11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 12Mancebo H.S.Y. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Tat interacts with the cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit of P-TEFb and recruits the kinase complex to TAR RNA. Recruitment of P-TEFb to TAR has been proposed to be both necessary and sufficient to activate transcription elongation from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter (13Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies, using fluorescein-labeled TAR RNA and a rhodamine-labeled Tat protein, showed that CycT1 remodels the structure of Tat to enhance its affinity for TAR RNA, and that TAR RNA further enhances interaction between Tat and CycT1 (14Zhang J. Tamilarasu N. Hwang S. Garber M.E. Huq I. Jones K.A. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34314-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Tat protein acts by binding to the TAR RNA element, a 59-base stem-loop structure located at the 5′ ends of all nascent HIV-1 transcripts (15Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). TAR RNA contains a 6-nucleotide (nt) loop and a 3-nt pyrimidine bulge that separates two helical stem regions (16Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5501-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TAR RNA was originally localized to nucleotides 1-80 within the viral LTR region (17Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Subsequent deletion studies have established that the region from nucleotide 19 to 42 incorporates the minimal domain that is both necessary and sufficient for Tat responsiveness in vivo (18Jakobovits A. Smith D.H. Jakobovits E.B. Capon D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA-protein interactions are involved in many cellular functions including transcription, RNA splicing, and translation. In addition to its primary structure, RNA has the ability to fold into complex tertiary structures consisting of such local motifs as loops, bulges, pseudoknots, and turns (19Chastain M. Tinoco Jr., I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 131-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Chow C.S. Bogdan F.M. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1489-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interactions can be important in viral and microbial disease progression, it would be advantageous to have a general method for rapidly identifying synthetic compounds that target specific RNA structures (for recent reviews, see Refs. 21Hermann T. Westhof E. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1998; 9: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Sucheck S.J. Wong C.H. Curr. Opin. Chem.

A particular protein-binding RNA structure can be considered as a molecular receptor not only for the protein with which it interacts but also for synthetic compounds, which may prove to be antagonists of the protein-RNA interaction. Tat-TAR interactions provide an ideal target to test this concept of developing drugs that target specific RNA structures. Consequently, a number of innovative strategies including synthetic, computational, and structural design methods have been successfully employed in identifying Tat-TAR inhibitors (24Li K.

Here we have used an encoded combinatorial library approach to discover small molecules that target TAR RNA in vitro and inhibit HIV-1 replication. We synthesized an encoded unnatural small molecule combinatorial library of 39,304 possible members by using solid-phase chemistry. Using on-bead screening technology, we identified 59 ligands that bind TAR RNA. Based on structural analysis, two parallel libraries were synthesized and the binding affinities of these unique molecules for TAR RNA were determined. Finally, 19 compounds (K D less than 200 nm for TAR RNA) were synthesized on a large scale and tested for inhibition of HIV-1 replication. We have identified a set of molecules that are effective inhibitors of HIV-1 replication by disrupting Tat-TAR interactions, providing a new scaffold for further development of antiviral drugs. Photocleavable tags were synthesized as previously described by Still and colleagues (35Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Swanson R.N. Dillard L.W. Reader J.C. Asouline G. Kobayashi R. Wigler M. Still W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10922-10926Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). RNA phosphoramidite was purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). TentaGel S-NH2 (90 μm, 0.18 - 0.22 mmol/g) was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). All other reagents were obtained from Aldrich. Structures and labels of the 34 monomers used to synthesize the library are shown in Fig. 2. Carbamate monomers, 31-34, were synthesized from N-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acids, which were reduced to their corresponding amino alcohols (N-methyl morpholine, isobutyl chloroformate, NaBH4, -15 °C) as previously described (36Wang X. Huq I. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6444-6445Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fmoc-amino alcohols were activated to their nitrophenyloxycarbonyl derivatives (4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, Py, CH2Cl2, 0 °C). These monomers were used for solid phase oligomer synthesis. Peptoid monomers 21-27 were prepared in situ on the solid support according to the submonomer coupling procedure of Zuckermann and co-workers (37Zuckermann R. Kerr J. Kent S. Moos W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10646-10647Crossref Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Encoding Step—TentaGel S-NH2 resin (34 g) was divided into 34 equal portions, and each reaction vessel was individually reacted with specific binary tags. The resin was swelled in dichloromethane (DCM; 6 ml) for 20 min at room temperature. After solvent filtration, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT; 2.5 mg, 500 μmol) and the corresponding six binary tag compounds (440 μl of 2 mm solution in DCM) were added to the swelled resin in 5% N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/DCM (6 ml) and stirred for 20 min at room temperature. N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPDCI; 2.8 μl, 44 μmol) was added to this reaction suspension and stirred overnight at room temperature. Unnatural Amino Acid Coupling—The encoding step was monitored by electron capture gas chromatography (GC/ECD). A Hewlett-Packard (HP) 6890 series gas chromatography system, equipped with a microelectron capture detector (μ-ECD), and a HP Chemstation operating system were used for all decoding analyses. The GC was operated in splitless inlet mode, using helium as carrier gas. A HP Ultra 1 column (35 m × 0.2 mm (inner diameter) × 0.33 μm film thickness) was used with a temperature program of 1 min isothermal at 200 °C, followed by heating at 20 °C/min to 320 °C. The μ-ECD make-up gas was nitrogen. If a GC/ECD test was positive for encoding, the encoded resin was suspended in 5% DMF/DCM (6 ml), stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and HOBT (30 mg, 550 μmol) and the corresponding monomer (550 μmol) were added. After stirring the resulting reaction mixture for 20 min at room temperature, 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (86 μl, 550 μmol) was added, and the mixture stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction resin was washed with DMF (10 ml × 5 min × 3) and DCM (10 ml × 5 min × 2), and one or two beads were placed in a test tube to monitor free amino groups by Kaiser test. Carbamate Coupling—The encoded resin was suspended in 5% DMF/DCM (6 ml), stirred for 20 min at room temperature, HOBT and the corresponding carbamate monomer were added, and the resulting mixture stirred for 20 min at room temperature. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (250 μl) was added, and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Peptoid Coupling—The encoded resin was suspended in 5% DMF/DCM (6 ml), stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and bromoacetic acid (1 ml, 2.2 m in DMF) and 1 m HOBT (1 ml) were added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and DIPDCI (200 μ l) was added, and the mixture stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was washed with DCM (10 ml × 2), and 1 or 2 beads were placed in a test tube for Kaiser test. The bromoacetylated resin was suspended in DMF (4 ml), the corresponding primary amine (3 ml, 1 m solution in DMF) was added, and the resulting mixture stirred overnight at room temperature. Fmoc Deprotection—After the first coupling cycle, the individual reaction products were combined and treated with 5% piperidine/DMF for 10 min at room temperature, the solvent drained, and the resin was retreated with 5% piperidine/DMF for another 20 min at room temperature. The resin was extensively washed (with DMF, MeOH, and DCM), dried under reduced pressure, and split into 34 portions by weight. Another set of six binary tags was used to encode the 34 reactions. The 34 reaction vessels were reacted with the corresponding monomers as described above, and pooled for Fmoc deprotection. After deprotection, the combined resin was washed extensively (with DMF, MeOH, and DCM), and a third split synthesis was carried out. Deprotection of Side Chain Functional Groups—The trimer resin (3 g) was treated with methylene chloride (10 ml), thioanisole (2 ml), ethanedithiol (0.5 μl), and trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After stirring, the reaction beads were filtrated and washed with DMF (10 ml × 2), 2-isopropyl alcohol (10 ml × 2), and DCM (10 ml × 5). The swelled resin was dried under reduced pressure overnight and stored at -20 °C. RNAs were prepared by chemical and enzymatic methods. Modified TAR RNA was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer using 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramite chemistry (Scheme I). All monomers of 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramite were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Red dye-conjugated 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite was synthesized from 2-cyanoethyl diisoproylchorophosphoramite (1 g, 4.23 mmol) using the dye, disperse red 1 (1.1 g, 3.52 mmol), and diisopropylethylamine (2.5 ml, 14.08 mmol). Cleavage and deprotection of red dye-labeled RNA was carried out in methanolic ammonia (1 ml) for 16 h at room temperature. After cleavage from the resin, the methanolic supernatant was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The red pellet was desilylated in 50% triethylamine trihydrofluoride in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.5 ml) for 16 h at room temperature. The crude red dye-labeled RNA was precipitated by adding isopropyl alcohol (1 ml) at -78 °C for 1 h. The desired RNA was purified on 20% acrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gels. A suspension of trimer unnatural peptide library (60 mg, ∼4 copies of library) in TK buffer (400 μl; 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) was incubated with bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. The aqueous phase was removed, the resin washed with TK buffer (500 μl × 3), and TK buffer (600 μl) and M1 RNA (2.5 μm) were added. The resulting suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h, and the buffer drained. To the beads were added TK buffer (600 μl), red dye-labeled-TAR RNA (3.0 μm), and M1 RNA (2.5 μm). After 2 days of stirring at 4 °C, the supernatant was drained, and the remaining beads were washed with water. Red beads were picked and individually placed in capillary tubes. Each bead was washed with DMF (4 μl × 3), and DMF (2 μl) was added. Capillary tubes were UV-irradiated (366 nm) for 4 h to cleave tags, and 1.5 μl of DMF solution was silylated with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (0.1 μl) in a microsyringe. The trimethylsilyl derivatives of tag alcohols were analyzed by GC/ECD. An encoded bead was placed in a 25-μl microcapillary tube with DMF (2 μl) and washed with DMF (5 μl × 4). After draining the solvent, the bead was resuspended in DMF (2 μl), and the microcapillary was centrifuged for 4 min and sealed by flame. The capillary containing a bead was UV-irradiated (366 nm) for 4 h and then centrifuged for 5 min. After opening the capillary, the cleaved tag alcohols were silylated with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide in a microsyringe. The trimethylsilyl derivatives were analyzed by GC/ECD. Based on structures selected from the colorimetric screening assay, a parallel library was designed and synthesized as shown in Tables II and III. Each compound was synthesized on TentaGel S-NH2 (4.6 μmol). All ligands were manually synthesized according to standard solid-phase synthesis methods previously described (36Wang X. Huq I. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6444-6445Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After side chain deprotection, the ligand attached to the resin (10 beads) was placed in an Eppendorf tube and washed with TK buffer (200 μl × 3). The beads were resuspended in TK buffer (300 μl) and incubated with TAR RNA (1.11 μm) overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged, and the equilibrium concentration of unbound RNA in the supernatant was determined by measuring its absorbance at 260 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrometer. Knowing the initial concentrations of ligand and RNA, and assuming simple bimolecular receptor/substrate binding, the dissociation constant (K D) was calculated from straightforward equations as described previously (29Hwang S.

HIV NL4-3 virus stocks were prepared and quantified by reverse transcriptase (RT) assays. For our experiments, Jurkat cells were infected at either 1 × 105 or 1 × 104 tissue culture infectious units/ml, and MT4 cells at 1000 infectious units/ml. Test inhibitors were used at a concentration of 5 μm and zidovudine (control) was used at 1 μm. Following incubation with HIV-1 for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were pelleted, washed in medium to remove free virus, and resuspended in 5 ml of complete medium with or without inhibitor. At various times after infection, aliquots (2 ml each) were removed from each flask and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium plus or minus inhibitor to maintain a final inhibitor concentration of 5 μm. Aliquots (100 μl) of the collected supernatants were stored at -20 °C for RT assay. RT assays were performed as previously described (38Huang L.M. Joshi A. Willey R. Orenstein J. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of supernatant was added to 50 μl of assay mixture (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 63 mm KCl, 4.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.08% EDTA, 4.2 μg/ml poly(A), 0.13 μg/ml oligo(dT), 4 μm dithiothreitol, and 40 μCi/ml [32P]TTP) and incubated for 1 h (MT4 cells) or 2 h (Jurkat cells) at 37 °C. After incubation, 5 μl of each reaction was spotted onto DE-81 paper (Whatman), washed twice for 5 min each in 2× SSC (0.3 m sodium chloride, 0.03 m sodium citrate (pH 7.0)) to remove unincorporated counts, rinsed once in methanol, and air-dried. Visualization (Fujifilm Image Reader) and quantitation (Fujifilm Image Gauge) of RT incorporation were performed by phosphorimaging. Cytotoxicity of inhibitors in cultured cells was tested using a standard microscopic visualization of their ability to exclude 0.1% trypan blue in phosphate buffered saline. In vivo toxicity of inhibitors was investigated in mice under an animal study protocol approved by the NIAID animal use committee. FRET from fluorescein to rhodamine was measured on a Photon Technology International fluorescence spectrophotometer. The emission spectrum was recorded from 500 to 650 nm for each scan. The slits were set to 4 nm for both excitation and emission lights. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Samples were placed into a plastic microcuvette with a starting volume of 300 μl. The initial concentration of F-TAR was 13 nm, and an equal amount of Rh-Tat-(47-58) was added to form 1:1 Tat-TAR complexes. Each addition of TR87 to solutions was followed by a 5-min equilibration before the fluorescence spectrum was recorded. The stock concentration of TR87 for titration was 100 μm. The fluorescence intensities were calibrated for the background of TKT buffer (TKT: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, and 0.02% (w/w) Tween 20). The pWT2 plasmid derived from p10SLT containing HIV-1 5′-LTR was used in the cell-free transcription experiment (39Keen N.J. Gait M.J. Karn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Template DNAs were linearized with BamHI to generate 530-nucleotide runoff transcripts. Transcription reactions containing 0.5 μg of template DNA, 12 μl of HeLa nuclear extract, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 6 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 200 μm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 200 μm UTP, 20 μm CTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol, ICN; final concentration 0.5 μm) were carried out at 30 °C for 60 min with 35 ng of Tat. Increasing amounts of TR87 (ranging from 0.1 to 400 μm) was added to the transcription reaction mixture. After incubation, 200 μl of stop solution (0.3 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, and 2 mm EDTA) was added. RNA transcripts were isolated by phenol extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Efficiencies of transactivation were determined by a phosphorimage analysis (Image Gauge version 3.4, Fuji).

https://openalex.org/W2161174294,"β-Lactoglobulins, belonging to the lipocalin family, are a widely studied group of proteins, characterized by the ability to solubilize and transport hydrophobic ligands, especially fatty acids. Despite many reports, the mechanism of ligand binding and the functional role of these proteins is still unclear, and many contradicting concepts are often encountered in the literature. In the present paper the comparative analysis of the binding properties of β-lactoglobulins has been performed using sequence-derived information, structure-based electrostatic calculations, docking simulations, and NMR experiments. Our results reveal for the first time the mechanism of β-lactoglobulin ligand binding, which is completely determined by the opening-closing of EF loop, triggered by Glu89 protonation. The alkaline shift observed for Glu89 pK a in porcine β-lactoglobulin (pK a 9.7) with respect to the bovine species (pK a 5.5) depends upon the interplay of electrostatic effects of few nearby key residues. Porcine protein is therefore able to bind fatty acids provided that the appropriate pH solution conditions are met (pH > 8.6), where the EF loop conformational change can take place. The unusually high pH of binding detected for porcine β-lactoglobulin seems to be functional to lipases activity. Theoretical pK a calculations extended to representative β-lactoglobulins allowed the identification of key residues involved in structurally and functionally important electrostatic interactions. The results presented here provide a strong indication that the described conformational change is a common feature of all β-lactoglobulins. β-Lactoglobulins, belonging to the lipocalin family, are a widely studied group of proteins, characterized by the ability to solubilize and transport hydrophobic ligands, especially fatty acids.

The results presented here provide a strong indication that the described conformational change is a common feature of all β-lactoglobulins. The physicochemical and biological characteristics of β-lactoglobulins, which belong to the lipocalin family, have been extensively studied in the last 30 years, but despite the wealth of data, the biological function of these extracellular proteins is still undefined (Ref. 1Sawyer L. Kontopidis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar and references therein). β-Lactoglobulins isolated from cow, goat, and sheep milk samples, under nondenaturing conditions, showed endogenously bound fatty acids (2Pérez M.D. de Villegas C.D. Sanchez L. Aranda P. Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 1094-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Many authors have suggested that bovine β-lactoglobulin (BLG) 1The abbreviations used are: BLG, bovine β-lactoglobulin; PLG, porcine β-lactoglobulin; PA, palmitic acid; 13C1 PA, singly enriched palmitic acid; 13C PA, fully enriched palmitic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; MIF, molecular interaction field; PDB, Protein Data Bank.1The abbreviations used are: BLG, bovine β-lactoglobulin; PLG, porcine β-lactoglobulin; PA, palmitic acid; 13C1 PA, singly enriched palmitic acid; 13C PA, fully enriched palmitic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; MIF, molecular interaction field; PDB, Protein Data Bank. has a transport and/or protective role toward bound ligands in the stomach (3Uhrinova S. Smith M. Jameson G.B. Uhrin D. Sawyer L. Barlow P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3567-3574Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, we have previously shown (4Ragona L. Zetta L. Fogolari F. Perez D.M. Pujol P. De Kruif K. Lohr F. Ruterjans H. Molinari H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that BLG, despite its high stability at acidic pH, is unable to bind fatty acids at low pH, thus indicating that it could not be employed “as is” as a transporter through the human gastric tract. Retinoids and fatty acids have been reported to bind to BLG in vitro in the pH range of 6.5-8.5, with dissociation constants on the order of 65 nm and 0.6 μm, respectively (5Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Specifically, titration experiments of BLG with palmitic acid (PA) (4Ragona L. Zetta L. Fogolari F. Perez D.M. Pujol P. De Kruif K. Lohr F. Ruterjans H. Molinari H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that: (i) at neutral pH the primary site for palmitic acid binding is within the protein calyx; (ii) the amount of bound PA is drastically reduced upon decreasing pH and the ligand is completely released at pH 2; (iii) in the pH range 7.3-6.4, a conformational equilibrium was observed for the bound ligand reflecting the dynamics of EF loop (region 85-90) (Fig. 1), triggered by the titration of Glu89 at anomalously high pK a (∼6.5) (6Tanford C. Nozaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2874-2876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, it was shown that the highly similar porcine (PLG) (62% identity, 83% similarity) and equine (58% identity, 74% similarity) β-lactoglobulins had neither fatty acids physiologically bound nor the ability to bind them in vitro at neutral pH (7Pérez M.D. Puyol P. Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have previously reported PLG interaction studies with palmitic acid in the pH range 2-8, aimed at clarifying whether dimer formation could possibly have a role in binding (8Ugolini R. Ragona L. Silletti E. Fogolari F. Visschers R.W. Alting A.C. Molinari H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4477-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed PLG exhibits a pH dependence of the monomer-dimer equilibrium opposite to that observed for BLG. NMR interaction studies demonstrated that PLG is unable to bind palmitic acid in this pH range. These results were rationalized by us and others (8Ugolini R. Ragona L. Silletti E. Fogolari F. Visschers R.W. Alting A.C. Molinari H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4477-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Frapin D. Dufour E. Haertlè T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) hypothesizing that Lys60 and Lys69, forming a superficial positively charged patch at the open end of the BLG calyx, could be responsible for electrostatic interactions with palmitic acid carboxylate, thus driving the binding. Both PLG and equine β-lactoglobulin, which did not show endogenously bound fatty acids, exhibited the K69E mutation. However, tear lipocalin, a protein closely related to BLG, was shown to bind 16-doxyl stearic acid despite the absence of any charged side chain at positions 60 (Met) and 69 (Val) (BLG numbering) (10Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14754-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The importance of clarifying the binding mechanism and, hence, the functional role of β-lactoglobulins has prompted us to extend our previous investigations to all members of this family. In the present paper the comparative analysis of β-lactoglobulin binding properties has been performed using sequence-derived information, structure-based electrostatic calculations, docking simulations, and NMR experiments. Our results reveal for the first time the mechanism of β-lactoglobulin ligand binding, which is fully determined by the conformational change involving the opening-closing of the EF loop (11Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Materials—PLG was purified from milk at NIZO Food Research (The Netherlands) as previously described (8Ugolini R. Ragona L. Silletti E. Fogolari F. Visschers R.W. Alting A.C. Molinari H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4477-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Palmitic acid was purchased from Sigma. Palmitic acid-protein complexes were prepared as described previously (4Ragona L. Zetta L. Fogolari F. Perez D.M. Pujol P. De Kruif K. Lohr F. Ruterjans H. Molinari H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 1.5 mm protein solutions were prepared in 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 solution at pH 7.0, and a molar excess of PA (4:1 molar ratio) was employed for complex preparation. NMR titrations at different pH levels were performed adding a few microliters of 0.25 n H3PO4 or 1 m NaOH to the PA-protein complex prepared at pH 7.0. 10 mm phosphate buffer solution, at different pH levels (7Pérez M.D. Puyol P. Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Ugolini R. Ragona L. Silletti E. Fogolari F. Visschers R.W. Alting A.C. Molinari H. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14754-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was added to the tube containing PA, and NMR experiments were acquired to check the solubility of the fatty acid. A solution of 50 mm KOH at pH 12.5 was necessary to dissolve a uniformly 13C-labeled PA, 5 mm, for NMR analysis. NMR Characterization—NMR spectra were acquired on an Avance Bruker 500 MHz spectrometers at 27 °C. 1H chemical shifts were referred to 3-trimethylsilylpropionate, and 13C chemical shifts were referenced as described previously (4Ragona L. Zetta L. Fogolari F. Perez D.M. Pujol P. De Kruif K. Lohr F. Ruterjans H. Molinari H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 1H one-dimensional NMR spectra of apo- and holo-PLG were run at each pH to check protein stability. One-dimensional proton decoupled 13C spectra were recorded on the complex prepared with carboxyl-enriched PA (13C1 PA) in the pH range 7.0-10.0. The carboxyl region was acquired with a sweep width of 2,520 Hz, 2,000 time domain points, and 20,000 scans. The aliphatic PA signals were observed through one-dimensional proton decoupled 13C spectra of completely enriched PA (13C-PA) in complex with PLG, in the pH range 7.0-10.0 and with BLG, in the pH range 2.5-7.3. A sweep width of 5,040 Hz, 16,000 time domain points, and 3,584 scans were employed. Two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC experiments were recorded on 13C-PA and on PLG·13C-PA complex with 512 and 2048 data points in the t 1 and t 2 dimensions, respectively, and a spectral width of 7002 (t 2) and 5040 (t 1) Hz. The spectra were processed and analyzed with the programs XWINNMR (Bruker) and XEASY (12Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Docking Simulations—Docking simulations were performed using the program GRID, version 21 (Molecular Discovery Ltd.) (13Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar, 14Kastenholz M.A. Pastor M. Cruciani G. Haaksma E.E. Fox T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All available BLG structures deposited in the PDB and the PLG x-ray structure (PDB code 1exs) were employed as targets. Crystallographic water molecules were removed. The coordinates of palmitic (C16) and caprylic (C8) acids were derived from the coordinates of palmitic acid bound to BLG (PDB code 1b0o). The fatty acid carboxyl group was considered deprotonated, bearing a net negative charge of -1. The target proteins were considered rigid, and hydrogens were added with the program GRIN (part of the GRID package). The docking search was performed on the whole protein. All GRID input parameters were employed with their default values. The calculated molecular interaction fields (MIF) were inspected with Gview (part of the GRID package). The docking results were visualized with Gview, InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), and Swiss-PdbViewer (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9550) Google Scholar). Modeling and pK a Calculations—Models for lactoglobulins have been built based on the x-ray structures of BLG with the EF loop in the open (PDB code 2blg) and closed (PDB code 3blg) conformations (11Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) using the Swiss-PdbViewer program (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9550) Google Scholar). Gaps and insertions were shifted out of secondary structure elements, where this was possible, and built using the scan loop data-base module of Swiss-PdbViewer. The anchor residues were chosen such as to make possible the closure of the loop. Hydrogens have been added using the program Gromacs (17Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The University of Houston Brownian Dynamics (UHBD) program, version 5.1 (18Madura J.D. Briggs J.M. Wade R. Davis M.E. Luty B.A. Ilin A. Antosiewicz J. Gilson M.K. Bagheri B. Scott L.R. McCammon J.A. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 57-95Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar), was used for the electrostatic and pK a calculations. We employed the single-site titration model (19Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), which includes partial atomic charges of each ionizable group and models the ionization by adding a +1 or -1 point charge to one central atom of the ionizing group. We used a dielectric constant of 20 to represent protein interior. Partial atomic charges and radii for the protein were taken from the pK a files provided by UHBD. The electrostatic potential computed by UHBD has been used for generating an ensemble of protonation states at different pHs using a Montecarlo procedure as described previously (20Fogolari F. Ragona L. Licciardi S. Romagnoli S. Michelutti R. Ugolini R. Molinari H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A straightforward application of this procedure led to few but very large pK a shifts, which were associated with atoms (and therefore with charges) too close to each other. The bumps were then removed using the program WHATIF (21Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar), and pK a values were computed again. The solvent was assigned a dielectric constant of 80 and ionic strength of 100 mm, and the ion exclusion radius was set to 2.0 Å. The ionic strength was chosen based on the observation that the pK a values are fairly insensitive to ionic concentrations over 100 mm. A probe with a radius of 1.4 Å was used to define the boundary between the protein and solvent dielectric regions. Electrostatic potentials were calculated by focusing on one titrable residue at a time. The last focusing run employed a grid spacing of 0.25 Å. The temperature was set at 25 °C. Docking Experiments—To evaluate the role of the EF loop conformational change on binding, different chain length fatty acids were docked within BLG and PLG employing the GRID docking program. The GRID method has been developed for determining energetically favorable binding sites for small chemical groups (probes) on a target molecule (protein) (13Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar, 14Kastenholz M.A. Pastor M. Cruciani G. Haaksma E.E. Fox T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The probe groups are small chemical entities that are moved through a regular grid of points around the target molecule in order to calculate, at each point of the grid, an interaction energy, thus generating MIFs. The ligand molecule is represented as a collection of GRID probes, and MIFs calculated for each probe are used to define the ligand position with respect to the target and to estimate the binding energy of the ligand at its binding site. Palmitic acid, the most abundant BLG endogenous ligand, was docked to all available BLG structures. GRID generated a docking solution for PA within the protein calyx only when the target BLG presented the EF loop in the open conformation. A very good agreement was observed for the positioning of both the aliphatic chain and the carboxyl tail of the docked and experimentally determined PA (PDB code 1b0o) (Fig. 2A). The inspection of MIFs, generated for hydrophobic and carboxyl oxygen probes, indicates that PA docking solution maximizes both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Docking experiments performed with the available PLG x-ray structure (PDB code 1exs), obtained at pH 3.2 with the EF loop in the closed conformation, were never successful in locating PA within the protein cavity. A model of PLG structure with the EF loop in the open conformation was obtained with the Swiss-PdbViewer program, and GRID simulations showed fatty acids located within the hydrophobic pocket of the protein (Fig. 2B). Interestingly the opening of the EF loop appeared to be a requisite for binding even when the shorter caprylic acid (C8) was used in docking experiments. Electrostatics and pK a Calculations on β-Lactoglobulins— The opening of the EF loop-(85-90) in BLG has been shown to be triggered by the titration of Glu89 (11Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). EF loop closed conformation is stabilized in BLG by a pattern of hydrogen bonds involving Asp88, Glu89, Asn90, Asn109, Ser110, and Ser116 residues. The titration of the Glu89 side chain at unusually high pH (∼6.5) is due to the loss of this H-bond pattern and causes the fold-back of the EF loop with a consequent solvent exposure of the glutamic acid side chain (Fig. 1). If the conformational change of the EF loop determines the binding ability, it is clear that all factors affecting Glu89 pK a, such as the nature and charge of close residues, will modulate the pH of binding. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the EF loop region of all β-lactoglobulins, (Fig. 3) revealed that although Glu89 is always conserved, its flanking residues (88 and 90) differ both in side chain length and charge. Charged residues close in space to Glu89 influence its titration as well. To study the pH dependence of the EF loop conformational change and correlate the sequence mutations with the binding ability, pK a calculations were performed on the BLG and PLG experimentally determined structures and on the modeled structures of a few lactoglobulins (lacc_felca, laca_canfa, lacb_horse, laca_ horse, lacb_macgi) selected on the basis of their clustering in the phylogenetic tree (built with the ClustalW program (22Thompson J.D.

Most of these residues never display any charge in different β-lactoglobulins; however, a small subset, consisting of residues 88, 90, 107, 108, and 116, shows a charge change along the different species; lacb_macgi was excluded from this analysis because its low sequence identity with BLG (34%), localized mainly at the level of the EF loop, made its model less reliable. Moreover, residue 116 is close to an insertion making it impossible to reliably discuss any result on Glu89 pK a. It is worth noting that on going from BLG to PLG, Glu89 pK a increases by nearly two pH units, thus suggesting that PLG binding should indeed occur but at pH higher than 8.0. NMR Titration Experiments—PLG interaction studies with 13C1 and 13C PA were performed in the pH range 8.0-10.0, i.e. at pH values higher than the calculated Glu89 pK a. The increase in PA resonance intensities was used to monitor the uptake of ligand by the protein, because PA is solubilized only through protein binding. Fig. 5 shows that 13C1 resonance becomes measurable at pH 8.6, and its intensity increases with pH, showing that PLG can bind PA upon EF loop opening. A line width increase of carboxyl resonance is observed raising the pH from 8.6 (Δν½ = 11 Hz) to 9.7 (Δν½ = 17 Hz). The amount of bound PA as a function of pH, as derived from the integration of C16 methyl resonance, is shown in Fig. 6. The transition midpoint occurs at pH 9.7, thus affording a clear indirect estimate of Glu89 pK a of PLG.Fig. 6Plot of 13C PA methyl resonance areas versus pH for BLG (triangle) and PLG (square).

The dotted lines represent the curve fits obtained with the program Sigma Plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We observed, from the analysis of 1H NMR spectra, that PLG maintains its conformation up to pH 10, whereas at higher pH the protein starts to precipitate. 1H and 13C chemical shifts of PA complexed with PLG are reported in Table II.Table II1H and 13C chemical shifts of PA complexed with PLG, pH 9.7, 27 °CPosition number1H13CC-1185.85C-22.0840.99C-31.4329.29Other1.0532.17C-151.0025.14C-160.6917.66 Open table in a new tab The influence that pH exerts on protein structure is widely believed to be electrostatic in nature via changes in the protonation state of titrable groups, which in turn influence processes like ligand uptake or release, partial or global unfolding, and protein-protein association (23Fogolari F. Brigo A. Molinari H. J Mol Recognit. 2002; 15: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show for the first time that the protonation state of Glu89 influences ligand binding in β-lactoglobulins, forcing the EF loop to act as a mobile lid, hindering the access to the protein cavity when it is in the closed conformation. NMR titration experiments have shown that PLG is able to bind PA, provided that the appropriate pH solution conditions (pH > 8.6) are met. The dependence of the amount of bound PA on pH can be fitted with a sigmoid curve, both for BLG and PLG, thus indicating that the same binding mechanism is at work for the two proteins. In PLG the observed transition midpoint is highly shifted toward alkaline pH (pH 9.7) with respect to BLG (pH 5.5) (Fig. 6), reflecting the different pK a of Glu89 side chains in the two proteins. These data strongly suggests that, contrary to previous reports (24Burova T.V. Grinberg N.V. Visschers R.W. Grinberg V.Y. de Kruif C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3958-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the EF loop conformational change also occurs in PLG and is likely to be a common feature of all β-lactoglobulins. To further investigate this phenomenon, pK a calculations were performed for representative β-lactoglobulins from different species. It has been shown by us and others that theoretically determined pK a values are in good agreement with experimentally determined ones (25Herrgard S. Gibas C.J. Subramaniam S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2921-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and we feel confident that the pK a shifts calculated for the different models reflect a reliable trend, which should be considered as such, rather than as an assessment of the exact pK a value of each titrating group. It is generally agreed that large pK a shifts can be ascribed to the electrostatic effects of desolvation, nearby charges, and/or to the disruption of hydrogen bonds (25Herrgard S. Gibas C.J. Subramaniam S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2921-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To rationalize Glu89 pK a shifts in the analyzed models, contributions due to mutations at the level of residues either involved in H-bonds or close in space to the Glu89 side chain were therefore considered. As shown in Table I, Glu89 pK a computed for lacb_pig, lacc_felca, and lacb_horse are higher than that computed for lacb_bovin, reflecting the mutation of the flanking Asn88 residue to a negatively charged aspartic acid. The strongest validation of these observations comes from NMR titration experiments demonstrating that PLG binding occurs at higher pH with respect to BLG. The agreement between experimental and theoretical pK a gave us confidence in the interpretation of the pK a trend calculated for all β-lactoglobulins. It is important to stress that laca_canfa, showing a negative charged residue at position 88, similar to lacb_pig, lacc_felca, and lacb_horse, exhibits a calculated pK a of 5.64, similar to that obtained for lacb_bovin (5.61). The analysis of the model showed that Glu88 side chain in laca_canfa points in the opposite direction with respect to Glu89, with the distance between the two carboxylic groups being the highest (8.5 Å) among all the analyzed structures (in the range 3.5-6.0 Å), thus reducing the electrostatic effects. The low pK a value calculated for laca_horse correlates well with the presence of two close, positively charged residues (Arg90 and His116). To single out whether the main role is played by the flanking Arg90 or by the close His116, we modeled the following multiple mutations in BLG, N88G,N90R (mutant 1) and N88G,N90R,S116H (mutant 2), and calculated the corresponding Glu89 pK a values. Interestingly a pK a of 5.10 was calculated for mutant 1 and a pK a of 3.30 was obtained for mutant 2, thus indicating that the close, positively charged residue 116 plays the determining role in influencing the pK a. It is worth noting that when Glu89 pK a was calculated for all of the models with the EF loop in the open conformation, very similar values were obtained, in the range 3.75-4.36 (Table I), as expected for accessible, solvent-exposed carboxylates. A comment could be added that further supports the reliability of pK a calculations. The low pK a value (1.05) estimated for Asp98 in lacb_bovin is in good agreement with the value of 2 that was determined experimentally by NMR (20Fogolari F. Ragona L. Licciardi S. Romagnoli S. Michelutti R. Ugolini R. Molinari H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Docking experiments run on BLG and PLG indicated that the opening of the EF loop plays a key role in modulating the binding of both proteins. The GRID solution obtained for the PLG·PA complex clearly showed that fatty acid is located within the protein calyx adopting a conformation similar to that observed experimentally in BLG (Fig. 2B). PLG residues showing short contacts with bound PA are substantially the same as observed in holo-BLG (26Wu S.Y. Pérez M.D. Puyol P. Sawyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 170-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However the comparison of 1H and 13C one-dimensional and two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra of holo-PLG and -BLG revealed that PA H-16 and H-15 resonances exhibited less marked up-field shifts when bound to PLG (δH16 = 0.69 ppm, δH15 = 1.00) rather than to BLG (δH16 = 0.20 ppm, δH15 = 0.54-0.43). This behavior can be attributed to a different distribution of aromatic residues in the binding cavity; in BLG, PA methyl protons feel the shielding effect of two aromatic residues (Phe82 and Phe105) lying within 5 Å of its center (Fig. 2A), whereas in PLG the mutation F105L accounts for the reduced shielding effect (Fig. 2B). The minor chemical shift dispersion observed in PLG for C-4—C-12 carbons can be ascribed to the same effect. All of these NMR data confirm that PA should have the same spatial arrangement within the calyx of the two proteins. The conformational equilibrium clearly observed for PA bound to BLG, involving the carboxyl tail, at a pH value close to that of the EF loop conformational change (4Ragona L. Zetta L. Fogolari F. Perez D.M. Pujol P. De Kruif K. Lohr F. Ruterjans H. Molinari H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), has been also observed for holo-PLG, as indicated by the 13C carboxyl PA line width increase on going from pH 8.6 to 9.7. Docking simulations provided a lower binding energy for the interaction of PA with PLG (-10.6 kcal/mol) with respect to BLG (-14.81 kcal/mol), suggesting a minor affinity of the porcine protein for fatty acids. We have previously shown that binding energies provided by GRID for BLG were in good agreement with those measured through dynamic fluorescence experiments (27Collini M. D'Alfonso L. Molinari H. Ragona L. Catalano M. Baldini G. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we are therefore confident of the reliability of the given energy differences. The mutation K69E, observed on going from BLG to PLG, may be held responsible for the lower interaction energy as deduced from the inspection of MIFs, showing less favorable electrostatic interactions with the ligand in PLG. Altogether these data indicate that the pH-dependent conformational change of EF loop is a common feature of all β-lactoglobulins. The analysis presented here, while allowing the identification of structurally and functionally important electrostatic interactions in β-lactoglobulins, opens the way to the design of engineered proteins characterized by binding capability in a selected pH range. Interestingly the binding mechanism identified for β-lactoglobulins is reminiscent of the mechanism of lipase interfacial activation associated with a conformational change, in which a lid, consisting of one α-helix, opens up by rotating around its hinge regions, thus allowing ligand binding. As it was reported that (i) β-lactoglobulins may play a role in increasing lipases activity by removing free fatty acids (28Pérez M.D. Sanchez L. Aranda P. Ena J.M. Oria R. Calvo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and (ii) liver pig triacylglycerol hydrolases exhibit activity at an optimum alkaline pH of 8.5 (16Verger R. Rietsch J. Dam-Mieras M.C.E. de Haas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3128-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the unusually high pH of binding detected for PLG is functional in lipases activity. S. Mecucci and P.

Crustaceans shed their rigid exoskeleton at each molt yet are still capable of forceful movement. We hypothesize that the soft water-inflated body of newly molted crabs may rely on a hydrostatic skeleton, similar to that of worms and polyps. We measured internal hydrostatic pressure and the force exerted during claw adduction and observed a strong correlation between force and hydrostatic pressure, consistent with hydrostatic skeletal support. This alternation between the two basic skeletal types may be widespread among arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W2010420888,"The major abasic endonuclease of human cells, Ape1 protein, is a multifunctional enzyme with critical roles in base excision repair (BER) of DNA. In addition to its primary activity as an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease in BER, Ape1 also possesses 3'-phosphodiesterase, 3'-phosphatase, and 3'-->5'-exonuclease functions specific for the 3' termini of internal nicks and gaps in DNA. The exonuclease activity is enhanced at 3' mismatches, which suggests a possible role in BER for Ape1 as a proofreading activity for the relatively inaccurate DNA polymerase beta. To elucidate this role more precisely, we investigated the ability of Ape1 to degrade DNA substrates that mimic BER intermediates. We found that the Ape1 exonuclease is active at both mismatched and correctly matched 3' termini, with preference for mismatches. In our hands, the exonuclease activity of Ape1 was more active at one-nucleotide gaps than at nicks in DNA, even though the latter should represent the product of repair synthesis by polymerase beta. However, the exonuclease activity was inhibited by the presence of nearby 5'-incised abasic residues, which result from the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity of Ape1. The same was true for the recently described exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli endonuclease IV. Exonuclease III, the E. coli homolog of Ape1, did not discriminate among the different substrates. Removal of the 5' abasic residue by polymerase beta alleviated the inhibition of the Ape1 exonuclease activity. These results suggest roles for the Ape1 exonuclease during BER after both DNA repair synthesis and excision of the abasic deoxyribose-5-phosphate by polymerase beta."
https://openalex.org/W1967568763,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine in Th1 cell-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases such as, e.g. Crohn's disease. Moreover, IL-10 has been shown to limit the progression of atherosclerosis, presumably by influencing endothelial cell function. Here we demonstrate that under pro-inflammatory conditions expression of the human IL-10 receptor gene is enhanced in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent exposure to IL-10 results in an up-regulation of both endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-3) expression and activity. Gel mobility shift analyses and decoy oligonucleotide experiments suggest that this effect of IL-10 is mediated through activation of the transcription factor STAT-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3). One functional consequence of IL-10 up-regulation of NOS-3 abundance in cultured endothelial cells is the attenuation of CD154-induced IL-12 p40 expression. Moreover, CD154-induced IL-12 p40 expression is enhanced after blockade of NOS-3 activity but attenuated in the presence of exogenous nitric oxide. Increased NOS-3 expression may, thus, be one mechanism by which IL-10 exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in Th1 cell-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases.

Chronic inflammatory diseases are caused and maintained by a multitude of both exogenous and endogenous factors.

Deleuze V. Emmanuel F. Bureau M.F. Soubrier F. Esposito B. Duez H. Fievet C. Staels B. Duverger N. Scherman D. Tedgui A. Circ.

Heistad D.D. Berg D.J. Faraci F.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to professional immune cells, endothelial cells play an important role in chronic inflammatory disease, because they are required to coordinate the onset, progression, and termination of inflammation. On the one hand, they act as gatekeepers, promoting or attenuating the extravasation of leukocytes at sites of inflammation (9Krieglstein C.F. Granger D.N. Am. J. Hypertens. 2001; 14: 44-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, they are capable of expressing pro-inflammatory gene products, thereby augmenting activation of the infiltrating leukocytes further (10Kinlay S. Libby P. Ganz P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Whether endothelial cells promote or attenuate inflammatory responses to a large part seems to hinge on the level of nitric oxide (NO) production in these cells. NO is a highly potent anti-inflammatory agent that has been demonstrated to retard the progression of atherosclerosis (11Busse R. Fleming I. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the development of other chronic inflammatory diseases (12Kubes P. McCafferty D.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Taking into account both the (presumably endothelium-mediated) capacity of IL-10 to suppress Th1 cell-mediated inflammation in vivo and the anti-inflammatory properties of endothelium-derived NO, we have addressed the question under which conditions human endothelial cells are susceptible to IL-10 signaling and whether IL-10 can exert its anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating endothelial NO synthase (NOS-3) expression.

Before starting the experiment, media were exchanged, and cells were incubated for 1 additional hour in the incubator.

The range of cycles to be in the exponential phase of the PCR reaction was newly established for each set of samples. Primers and annealing temperatures used are listed in Table I. In experiments where the mouse myeloma cells were incubated with human endothelial cells, a primer pair specific for the human large ribosomal subunit protein L32 mRNA was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the cDNA content of the samples. The PCR reactions for IL-10 receptor (chain 1, IL-10R1), NOS-3, the inducible isoform of NO synthase (NOS-2), and IL-12 p40 were specific for gene products derived from human endothelial cells; no PCR products were detectable in the mouse myeloma cells.Table IPrimers and conditions used for RT-PCR analysisGene productSequenceAnnealing temperatureVCAM-1Forward 5′-CATGACCTGTTCCAGCGAGG-3′63 °CReverse 5′-CATTCACGAGGCCACCACTC-3′GAPDHForward 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCG-3′58 °CReverse 5′-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′IL-10Forward 5′-GAGAACAGCTGCACCCACTTCC-3′58 °CReverse 5′-AGTCGCCACCCTGATGTCTCAG-3′IL-10 receptorForward 5′-GGACACCCATCCCAAATCAGTC-3′59 °CReverse 5′-CACGGTGAAATACTGCCTGGTG-3′IL-12 p40Forward 5′-GTACTCCACATTCCTACTTCT-3′62 °CReverse 5′-TTTGGGTCTATTCCGTTGTGTC-3′MCP-1Forward 5′-GCGGATCCCCTCCAGCATGAAG-3′58 °CReverse 5′-TCTTCTTGGGTTGTGGAGTGAG-3′NOS-2Forward 5′-TACATGCAGAATGAATAC-3′55 °CReverse 5′-CTGATCAATGTCATGAGC-3′NOS-3Forward 5′-GGAACCTGTGTGACCCTC-3′58 °CReverse 5′-CCACGTCATACTCATCCA-3′rpL32Forward 5′-GTTCATCCGGCACCAGTCAG-3′60 °CReverse 5′-ACGTGCACATGAGCTGCCTAC-3′ Open table in a new tab Gel Mobility Shift Analysis—Preparations of nuclear extract and gel mobility shift analyses were performed as described previously (15Krzesz R. Wagner A.H. Cattaruzza M. Hecker M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), except for the addition of the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (20 mmol/liter) and sodium vanadate (1 mmol/liter) to all buffers used. The custom-made oligonucleotides containing the proposed binding site for STAT-3 (position –858 to –838 in the human nos-3 promoter; GenBank™ accession number X76303) had the forward sequence 5′-CCTGCATTCTGGGAACTGTAG-3′ and was hybridized with the matching reverse strand by standard procedures (15Krzesz R. Wagner A.H. Cattaruzza M. Hecker M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The SIE oligonucleotide was purchased in its double-stranded form and had the forward sequence 5′-GTGCATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCTACA-3′. Decoy Oligonucleotide Technique—Preincubation of the cultured endothelial cells with the double-stranded decoy oligonucleotides (10 μmol/liter final concentration) for 4 h was done as described previously (15Krzesz R. Wagner A.H. Cattaruzza M. Hecker M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sequence for the nos-3 promoter-specific STAT-3 decoy oligonucleotide was exactly the same as that used for gel mobility shift analysis except that the terminal four bases on either site of the molecule were linked by phosphorothioate esters for added stability. The sequence of the mutated S3 decoy oligonucleotide (S3M) was 5′-CCTG-TATGCCGTGAGCTATAG-3′ for the forward strand (mutated bases are printed in bold). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures (14Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Loading and transfer of equal amounts of protein in each lane was verified by reprobing the membrane with a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (14Cattaruzza M. Wachter R. Wagner A.H. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of protein amounts relative to β-actin was performed using the One-DScan Gel analysis software (Scananalytics, Billerica, MA) where appropriate. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed exactly as described previously (13Lienenlüke B. Germann T. Kroczek R.A. Hecker M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, cell culture supernatants were collected at the times indicated, centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm to pellet cell debris and CD154-positive myeloma cells, and frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (13Lienenlüke B. Germann T. Kroczek R.A. Hecker M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, formaldehyde-fixed ileum biopsies derived from patients with Crohn's disease or the corresponding biopsies of non-inflamed ileum resected from tumor patients were embedded in paraffin blocks of which 3-μm-thick sections were cut. After paraffin removal samples were blocked for nonspecific binding. The primary mouse monoclonal anti-IL-10 receptor antibody was diluted 1:50 and incubated with the sections for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive rinsing a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed again, incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the AEC chromogen solution, counter-stained with hematoxylin, and finally, mounted with sealing medium. Nitrite Determination—Nitrite was measured as an estimate of NO production by a modified Griess reaction (16Wagner A.H. Schwabe O. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To obtain IL-10 effects independent from vitamin D3, the cultured endothelial cells were preincubated with a combination of cytokines (60 units/ml IL-1β, 1000 units/ml TNF-α, and 1000 units/ml IFNγ) for 12 h to induce IL-10R expression. After this time, the cells were washed twice with culture medium and then exposed to IL-10 (2 ng/ml) and/or to the same combination of cytokines as described before. Cell culture supernatants were collected 48 h post-cytokine exposure and assayed for their nitrite content as described previously (16Wagner A.H. Schwabe O. Hecker M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Determination of Superoxide Formation—Generation of superoxide in the cultured endothelial cells was estimated as described previously (17Wagner A.H. Schroeter M.R. Hecker M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2121-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was used as a positive control and changes in the cells capacity to generate superoxide in response to acute (1–10 min) and prolonged (6–12 h) exposure to IL-10 (2 ng/ml) or a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines (60 units/ml IL-1β, 1000 units/ml TNF-α, and 1000 units/ml IFNγ) were monitored. Statistical Analysis—Unless indicated otherwise, results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of n observations with cells obtained from different umbilical cords. One sample t test with two-sided p value or one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett post-test were used as appropriate to determine statistically significant differences between the means and and/or the means and control with p < 0.05 considered significant. Induction of IL-10 Receptor Expression by Various Pro-inflammatory Stimuli—To confirm that the cultured endothelial cells are capable of responding to IL-10 treatment, first IL-10R1 expression was analyzed. Although clearly detectable by RT-PCR analysis, little IL-10R1 mRNA was present in quiescent cells. However, exposure to certain pro-inflammatory cytokines such as cell-bound CD154 or IFNγ for 6 h resulted in a distinct up-regulation of IL-10R1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). This effect was even more pronounced when the two stimuli were combined. Also, the combination of IFNγ with TNFα and/or IL-1β induced IL-10R1 mRNA expression to a similar extent. On the protein level, CD154 or IFNγ also triggered an increase in IL-10R1 expression that was comparable with the change in mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Moreover, incubation of the cultured endothelial cells with vitamin D3 (10 nmol/liter), previously characterized to induce IL-10R1 mRNA in human keratinocytes (18Michel G. Gailis A. Jarzebska-Deussen B. Muschen A. Mirmohammadsadegh A. Ruzicka T. Inflamm. Res. 1997; 46: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), revealed a transient increase both in IL-10R1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1). Unlike the changes in IL-10R1 expression, there was no appreciable release of the cytokine itself from the cultured endothelial cells according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay irrespective of the chosen experimental condition (quiescent or cytokine-stimulated cells). IL-10 mRNA expression, on the other hand, could be detected by RT-PCR analysis in some batches of cells at a very low level (not shown). To monitor IL-10R1 expression in vivo, intestinal biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease were compared with those from non-inflamed controls by immunohistochemistry. Whereas endothelial cells in arteries were devoid of IL-10R1 immunoreactivity in both types of specimens (not shown), both arteriolar and venous endothelial cells stained positive for IL-10R1 but only in biopsies of patients with Crohn's disease (Fig. 2). Interestingly, medial smooth muscle cells also revealed IL-10R1 immunoreactivity that was increased under pro-inflammatory conditions (Fig. 2). Both these findings were confirmed at the mRNA level in human cultured smooth muscle cells by RT-PCR analysis (not shown). IL-10 Up-regulation of NOS-3 Expression—To better visualize the effects of IL-10 on endothelial cell gene expression, in all subsequent experiments IL-10R1 expression was first up-regulated by exposing the cells to vitamin D3 for 9 h. This preincubation period was chosen based on the time course of IL-10R1 expression in three individual batches of endothelial cells (not shown). The reason for using vitamin D3 to up-regulate IL-10R1 expression was that vitamin D3, in contrast to the aforementioned cytokines, neither affected the expression of pro-inflammatory gene products such as the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or the adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 nor that of the NO synthase isoforms NOS-3 or NOS-2 (not shown). Next, the effects of IL-10 on endothelial cell gene expression were analyzed. Exposure of the cultured cells to IL-10 (2 ng/ml) resulted in a time-dependent increase in both NOS-3 mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B). Expression of NOS-2, on the other hand, was not detected by RT-PCR analysis in these cells, irrespective of the chosen experimental conditions (not shown). To explore if IL-10 is capable of functionally counteracting cytokine down-regulation of NOS-3 expression in the cultured endothelial cells (cf. Ref. 19Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) independently from vitamin D3, nitrite concentrations in the conditioned media were determined as a means of NOS-3 activity. To this end, the cells were preincubated for 12 h with IL-1β (60 units/ml), TNF-α (1000 units/ml), and IFNγ (1000 units/ml; Ref. 19Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to induce IL-10R1 expression. Thereafter, they were exposed for 48 h to IL-10 (2 ng/ml), the cytokine combination, or both. Although IL-10 clearly enhanced NOS-3 activity, this was reduced in the presence of the cytokines but maintained after exposure to both IL-10 and the combination of cytokines (Fig. 3C). In contrast to NOS-3 activity, the cytokine combination affected neither basal nor phorbol ester-stimulated superoxide formation in the cultured endothelial cells, as judged by 5-(carboxy)-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence analysis at different intervals (over 10 min, 6 h, and 12 h of incubation; not shown). IL-10 Up-regulates NOS-3 Expression via STAT-3—Because IL-10 has been reported to exert its genomic effects primarily by activating the transcription factor STAT-3, next, nuclear translocation of STAT-3 was monitored in IL-10-stimulated cells. Gel mobility shift analysis using either an SIE (STAT family) or the S3 oligonucleotide mimicking the putative STAT-3 binding site in the human nos-3 promoter demonstrated increased binding of a nuclear protein that was identified as STAT-3 according to supershift analysis (Fig. 4A). Moreover, neutralization of the transcription factor by employing a decoy oligonucleotide encompassing the putative STAT-3 binding site in the nos-3 promoter virtually abolished IL-10-induced NOS-3 expression, whereas the corresponding control oligonucleotide revealed no significant effect (Fig. 4B). Attenuation of CD154-induced IL-12 p40 Expression—To assess the functional consequences of IL-10-induced NOS-3 expression, its effect on expression of the p40 subunit of IL-12 was investigated. Exposure of the cultured endothelial cells to CD154-expressing mouse myeloma cells, but not P3×63Ag8.6B control cells (cf. Ref. 13Lienenlüke B. Germann T. Kroczek R.A. Hecker M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), resulted in a significant induction of IL-12 p40 mRNA and protein. This was inhibited by ∼60% on the mRNA and by ∼50% on the protein level in cells pretreated with vitamin D3 and subsequently IL-10 (Figs. 5, A and B). To confirm that this inhibitory effect was indeed brought about by IL-10 up-regulation of NOS-3 expression, hence increased NO formation, the sensitivity of CD154-induced IL-12 p40 expression to NO was studied. Blockade of endogenous NO synthesis with the selective NOS-3 inhibitor (as compared with NOS-2; cf. Ref. 20Southan G.J. Szabo C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), N G-nitro-l-arginine (0.1 mmol/liter), 1 h before CD40 stimulation clearly augmented IL-12 p40 expression, whereas this was significantly attenuated upon exposure of the endothelial cells to the NO donor (cf. Ref. 21Hecker M. Vorhoff W. Bara A.T. Mordvintcev P.I. Busse R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1994; 351: 426-432Google Scholar), CAS-1609 (10 μmol/liter; Fig. 6). Moreover, the decrease in CD154-induced IL-12 p40 expression in IL-10-treated endothelial cells was blunted upon exposure to N G-nitro-l-arginine (0.1 mmol/liter) 1 h before CD40 stimulation (Figs. 5 and 6). To exclude any source for NO other than NOS-3, mRNA derived from endothelial cells exposed to IL-10 and the CD154-expressing mouse myeloma cells was analyzed for NOS-2 expression, again with negative results (not shown). The data presented here provide three novel findings; (i) expression of the il-10r1 gene in human endothelial cells is cytokine-inducible so that IL-10 receptor expression in these cells is likely to be up-regulated during chronic inflammation such as, e.g. in Crohn's disease or atherosclerosis; (ii) IL-10 up-regulates NOS-3 expression in IL-10 receptor expressing endothelial cells presumably through activation of STAT-3; and (iii) the increase in NO formation associated with this change in gene expression enables endothelial cells to control pro-inflammatory reactions such as CD154 induction of IL-12 p40 gene expression. Moreover, this increase in the NO-synthesizing capacity of the endothelium may constitute a critical aspect of the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 in Th1 cell-mediated chronic inflammation. The Experimental Model—Although various pro-inflammatory cytokines were capable of up-regulating IL-10 receptor expression in the cultured endothelial cells, they were excluded from further studies due to their pronounced inhibitory effects on NOS-3 mRNA expression (19Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Vitamin D3 was used instead solely to enhance the endothelial cell response to IL-10 stimulation. Although derivatives of vitamin D3 are thought to have anti-inflammatory potential (22Jirapongsananuruk O. Melamed I. Leung D.Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 981-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), vitamin D3 per se neither affected NOS-3 expression nor that of other gene products of interest such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or NOS-2 in the cultured endothelial cells. To functionally evaluate one possible consequence of the IL-10-induced increase in NOS-3 expression, CD154 induction of IL-12 p40 expression was chosen. Leukocytes contaminating the cultured endothelial cells as a source of IL-12 p40 mRNA or protein could effectively be ruled out due to the absence of CD45-positive cells (cf. Ref. 13Lienenlüke B. Germann T. Kroczek R.A. Hecker M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The IL-10 Receptor in Endothelial Cells—The IL-10 receptor complex, a member of the IFNγ receptor family, consists of two polypeptides, the principal IL-10 receptor, i.e. IL-10R1, and an accessory receptor (23Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Whereas the IL-10 receptor complex is constitutively expressed by T helper cells, B-cells and monocytes, other cell types do not normally express these proteins in significant amounts. Only a few reports exist in the literature providing direct evidence for IL-10R1 mRNA expression in non-immune cells such as e.g. in human keratinocytes (18Michel G. Gailis A. Jarzebska-Deussen B. Muschen A. Mirmohammadsadegh A. Ruzicka T. Inflamm. Res. 1997; 46: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although several effects of IL-10 on endothelial cells have been reported (8Gunnett C.A. Heistad D.D. Berg D.J. Faraci F.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this to our knowledge is the first demonstration of IL-10R1 expression in human endothelial cells. Despite being detectable in the cultured endothelial cells also under basal conditions, IL-10R1 protein expression was markedly up-regulated in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli such as IFNγ, TNFα, or cell-bound CD154, which are highly abundant at sites of inflammation as well as in atherosclerotic lesions (24Libby P. Sukhova G. Lee R.T. Galis Z.S. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: S9-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In this context, IL-10R1 immunoreactivity was exclusively detected in endothelial cells lining the submucosal blood vessels of the inflamed ileum from patients with Crohn's disease but not in control biopsies from patients with intestinal carcinoma. These findings imply that endothelial cells become more responsive to IL-10 during an inflammatory episode via de novo synthesis of the IL-10 receptor. Transcriptional Regulation of the nos-3 Gene by IL-10 — Combination of gel mobility (super)shift analysis and the decoy oligonucleotide technique (cf. Refs. 12Kubes P. McCafferty D.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar and 25Morishita R. Higaki J. Tomita N. Ogihara T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) revealed that IL-10 up-regulates NOS-3 expression in the cultured endothelial cells via activation of STAT-3. Although a binding site for STAT-3 could be predicted by sequence analysis of the human nos-3 gene promoter, this finding nonetheless is surprising because this transcription factor typically is involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory gene products (26Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita M.A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). That IL-10 itself potentially displays such an ambiguity in its biological effects was demonstrated in an additional series of experiments discussed below. Functional Consequences of IL-10-induced NOS-3 Expression—The role of NO in chronic inflammation is somewhat controversial. Whereas excessive NO formation due to induction of NOS-2 in combination with an increased generation of superoxide might be responsible for inflammation-induced tissue damage (12Kubes P. McCafferty D.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), potent anti-inflammatory properties have been ascribed to NOS-3-derived NO (11Busse R. Fleming I. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27Harrison D.G. Clin. Cardiol. 1997; 20: 11-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the early phase of an inflammatory episode the low endothelial cell NO output, which is further decreased through cytokine-mediated down-regulation of NOS-3 expression, may not be sufficient to effectively limit the pro-inflammatory response. The IL-10-induced increase in NOS-3 expression may thus counter-balance the inhibitory effect of the cytokines and restore endothelial cell NO formation to normal levels. Our findings of a maintained NOS-3 expression, i.e. NO output, in endothelial cells exposed to both a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-10 (and without pretreatment of the cells with vitamin D3 to up-regulate IL-10 receptor expression) strongly supports this hypothesis. The bioavailability of NO is limited by the amount of superoxide concomitantly formed, for the two radicals rapidly neutralize each other to yield the biologically inactive nitrate (28Kelm M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as, e.g. TNFα, may enhance superoxide formation in endothelial cells, which in addition to the decrease in NOS-3 expression could offset the stimulatory effect of IL-10 on the formation of biologically active NO. In our hands, however, these cytokines did not reveal any appreciable effect on endothelial cell superoxide formation, so that our hypothesis of a restoration of NO bioavailability in endothelial cells exposed to IL-10 at sites of inflammation, thereby limiting the expression of other pro-inflammatory gene products in an autocrine/paracrine manner, still stands. The marked attenuation of CD154-induced IL-12 p40 expression after IL-10 up-regulation of NOS-3 expression is one example for such an effect. CD154-induced IL-12 p40 expression was chosen as a “readout” for NOS-3-mediated IL-10 effects on pro-inflammatory gene expression for the following reasons; (i) CD40 stimulation, in contrast to the pro-inflammatory cytokines employed, does not affect NOS-3 expression itself; (ii) IL-12 p40 expression in primary human cultured endothelial cells is exclusively induced via CD40 stimulation (13Lienenlüke B. Germann T. Kroczek R.A. Hecker M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2864-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); (iii) IL-12 plays an important role in the onset and maintenance of Th1-cell mediated (chronic) inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis (29Shevach E.M. Chang J.T. Segal B.M. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1999; 21: 249-262PubMed Google Scholar); and (iv) IL-12 synthesis in antigen-presenting cells is the prime target of the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 in these diseases (3Uyemura K. Demer L.L. Castle S.C. Jullien D. Berliner J.A. Gately M.K. Warrier R.R. Pham N. Fogelman A.M. Modlin R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IL-12 p40 expression was mimicked by exposing the cultured endothelial cells to exogenous NO and effectively lifted in cells where NOS-3 activity had been blocked. IL-10 attenuation of IL-12 expression in endothelial cells, thus, seems to be critically dependent on the increase in NOS-3 expression and, hence, activity. However, two questions remain; (i) Why does basal NO formation (blocked by N G-nitro-l-arginine) only moderately affect IL-12 p40 mRNA expression, whereas NOS-3 blockade in endothelial cells previously exposed to IL-10 results in a super-induction of IL-12 p40 mRNA expression? This observation, although puzzling initially, may be explained by the ambivalent nature of action of IL-10. Besides its prominent anti-inflammatory effects, mainly directed against antigen-presenting cells, the cytokine also has a pro-inflammatory potential, e.g. in Th2 cell-dependent immune responses, which may be unmasked in endothelial cells through NOS-3 blockade. (ii) Why is this super-induction of IL-12 p40 expression only detectable at the mRNA level? Comparable effects have been described for other pro-inflammatory gene products, such as IL-1β or TNFα (for review see Ref. 30Clark A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of this “programmed mismatch” between mRNA and protein expression is not fully understood, it is well documented that besides a decrease in mRNA stability, mRNA translation into protein can be strongly blunted with respect to these gene products. Nonetheless, the ambiguous action of IL-10 on the level of gene transcription may be of pathophysiological relevance. IL-10 may, thus, be beneficial in conditions with unrestrained endothelial NO synthesis as, e.g. in the early phase of a chronic inflammatory reaction, but without effects or even detrimental in conditions of low NO bioavailability as, e.g. in manifest inflammation (26Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita M.A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Conclusions—The present findings suggest that IL-10 acts as an “endogenous brake,” limiting the development of chronic inflammatory diseases (3Uyemura K. Demer L.L. Castle S.C. Jullien D.

Consequently, the administration of recombinant IL-10 constitutes a promising concept in the treatment of chronic Th1-type immunoregulatory disorders such as e.g. Crohn's disease (6Asadullah K.

Remarkably, Pol γ catalyzes reverse transcription with a slightly higher efficiency than HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, suggesting that the activity may be physiologically significant, and furthermore, proofreading activity with an RNA template was also observed. RNA-primed DNA synthesis activity is required for initiation of mtDNA replication, and we have found that Pol γ holoenzyme is capable of performing this reaction at a physiologically relevant rate and that the accessory subunit plays an essential role in the initiation steps. Single ribonucleotides have been found scattered in the mtDNA genome, although their role and significance are not yet defined. Our finding that Pol γ also incorporates ribonucleotide triphosphates into a DNA primer offers a plausible enzymatic pathway for the origin of the RNA-containing mtDNA genome.

Mammalian mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ) 1The abbreviations used are: Pol γ, mitochondrial DNA polymerase; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; H-strand, heavy strand; L-strand, light strand; RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1. is a key enzyme found in the mitochondria and is essential for mitochondrial DNA replication. It is a multifunctional enzyme that is involved in DNA synthesis, proofreading, and base excision repair by possessing DNA-directed DNA polymerization, 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic excision, and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activities (1Johnson A.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12509-12514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to these activities, Pol γ is known to perform a novel RNA-directed DNA synthesis (reverse transcription) activity in vitro (4Gallo R.C. Yang S.S. Ting R.C. Nature. 1970; 228: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Robert-Guroff M. Schrecker A.W. Brinkman B.J. Gallo R.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, the physiological role of this activity cannot be elucidated in the absence of relevant rate measurements. The reverse transcriptase activity has been also found in bacterial DNA polymerase I, and its steady state catalytic efficiency (V max/Km) was ∼80–120-fold less than that for the DNA-directed DNA synthesis (6Ricchetti M. Buc H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because of the absence of the pre-steady state rates, the relevance of this activity remains unclear. The mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome is ∼16 kilobase pair of circular DNA consisting of a heavy strand (H-strand) and a light strand (L-strand) (7Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 8Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The first step of mtDNA replication involves transcription (i.e. RNA synthesis) of the L-strand DNA at the L-strand promoter located downstream of the origin of the H-strand DNA synthesis (9Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30614-30621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The RNA is then processed by mitochondrial RNA processing RNase to form an RNA primer (10Chang D.D. Clayton D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Lee D.Y. Clayton D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The H-strand DNA is synthesized using the RNA primer by Pol γ. After about two-thirds of the entire H-strand is synthesized, the displaced single-stranded H-strand forms a hairpin structure that is recognized as the origin of L-strand synthesis (12Wong T.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A small RNA primer is created at the origin, and the L-strand DNA is synthesized. Because the mtDNA replication events appear to occur in an asynchronous fashion and an intermediate containing a large single-stranded DNA is formed, this proposed mechanism for mtDNA synthesis is termed a strand-asymmetric model. Recently, another mechanism of mtDNA replication, a strand-coupled model, has been proposed (13Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this model, both leading and lagging strands are synthesized simultaneously, and they are essentially in duplex throughout replication. Surprisingly, newly synthesized lagging L-strand is partly ribonucleotide-rich and forms a DNA/RNA heteroduplex with the parent H-strand. As a result, in the next step, the ribonucleotides in the lagging strand need to be replaced by corresponding deoxyribonucleotides. It is suggested that the RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) activity by Pol γ might be involved in this event. Recent studies of RNase digestion of mtDNA showed that mammalian mtDNA contains at least 30 ribonucleotides with ∼500-bp intervals (14Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Single ribonucleotides were found at scattered positions in the entire mtDNA. Because Pol γ is highly processive, it is unlikely that it falls off during mtDNA synthesis, and RNA polymerase incorporates one ribonucleotide, thus suggesting that perhaps Pol γ may incorporate ribonucleotides during DNA synthesis. The role and significance for the presence of ribonucleotides in mtDNA has not been defined. Pol γ consists of two different subunits, a catalytic subunit and an accessory subunit. The catalytic subunit alone is able to catalyze DNA polymerization and excision. The accessory subunit does not have known enzymatic activities, but mutational studies have shown that the subunit is essential in vivo (15Iyengar B. Luo N. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. Campos A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4483-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the accessory subunit is reconstituted with the catalytic subunit, the rate of DNA synthesis is dramatically enhanced (16Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the accessory subunit is known, and it is highly homologous to bacterial glycyl-tRNA synthetase (18Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on the sequences of mtDNA, it has been suggested that a tRNA-like secondary structure is formed close to the origin of replication, and the accessory subunit alone binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA (19Carrodeguas J.A. Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50008-50014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the subunit not only activates DNA polymerization but also is involved in primer recognition during initiation of mtDNA replication and serves as processivity clamp (20Fan L. Sanschagrin P.C. Kaguni L.S. Kuhn L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9527-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, direct measurement of the effect of the enzyme on dissociation rate demonstrates that the accessory protein does little to “clamp” the polymerase to the DNA; rather it acts by stimulating polymerization (17Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although the reverse transcriptase activity by Pol γ has been known for a long time, the mechanism has not been studied in detail, and the physiological relevance of the activity remains unknown. As a first step in elucidating the physiological role, it is important to know how efficiently the enzyme catalyzes this reaction. In addition, the initiation step of mtDNA replication where the RNA primer is elongated with deoxyribonucleotides is known to be catalyzed by Pol γ; however, no kinetic characterization has been performed on this activity. Therefore, the present work addresses the following important questions on novel activities by human Pol γ related to mtDNA replication: 1) How efficiently does Pol γ perform reverse transcription, and how does this compare with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase? 2) Knowing that Pol γ catalyzes 3′ → 5′ DNA excision reaction, does Pol γ possess the same activity when the template is RNA? 3) Is Pol γ holoenzyme sufficient in incorporating deoxynucleotides into an RNA primer without additional proteins or cofactors? If so, how efficient is it? 4) Does the accessory subunit play a role in the elongation of the RNA primer during DNA synthesis? and 5) Does Pol γ incorporate ribonucleotides? Studying these novel activities of Pol γ is important not only to provide insight into mechanism and function, but also because these activities may be associated with actions of nucleoside analog drugs because it has been shown that mitochondrial toxicity of anti-HIV drugs highly correlates with the drug incorporation and removal by Pol γ (21Feng J.Y. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23832-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.A. Ray A.S. Hanes J. Suo Z. Colacino J.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40847-40857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We have used pre-steady state and steady state kinetic approaches to examine those novel activities by Pol γ and address these important questions related to mitochondrial DNA replication. Materials—The dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Ribopolynucleotides (R18 and R45) were synthesized and purified by New England Biolabs. Deoxyribopolynucleotides (D23, D36, and D45) were synthesized by the Keck Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility at Yale University and purified by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Overexpression and Purification of Pol γ—Both the wild type and exonuclease-deficient mutant (exo–) catalytic subunits of Pol γ were overexpressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus expression system as described previously (23Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The accessory subunit of Pol γ was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (17Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 234,420 and 71,894 m–1 cm–1 for the catalytic and accessory subunits, respectively. The holoenzyme was reconstituted by mixing the catalytic and accessory subunits at a 1:10 ratio for 10 min prior to mixing with substrates. Labeling and Annealing of Oligonucleotides—Primers were labeled at the 5′ ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (24Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For annealing, the labeled primers and desired templates were mixed at a 1:1.4 ratio and underwent heat treatment at 90 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling, typically 50 °C for 10 min and on ice for 10 min. The complete annealing was confirmed by a native gel electrophoresis containing 15% polyacrylamide. The sequences of the primers and templates used in this study are: D23 (5′-*GCC TCG CAG CCG TCC AAC CAA CT-3′), D25 (5′-*GCC TCG CAG CCG TCC AAC CAA CTC A-3′), R18 (5′-*guc ccu guu cgg gcg cca-3′), D45 (5′-CGG AGC GTC GGC AGG TTG GTT GAG TTG GAG CTA GGT TAC GGC AGG-3′), R45 (5′-cgg agc guc ggc agg uug guu gag uug gag cua ggu uac ggc agg-3′), and D36 (3′-CGA AAG TCC AGG GAC AAG CCC GCG GTG ACG ATC TCT-5′). Sets of the primer/template used in this study are D23/D45, D25/D45, D23/R45, and R18/D36. Except for R18/D36, the primer/templates were blunt-ended at the 5′ end of the primer. Pre-steady State Kinetic Assays—Rapid chemical quench experiments were performed using a KinTek Corporation (Austin, TX) model RQF-3 rapid quench flow apparatus as described previously (24Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14056-14063Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All concentrations of reactants were reported in the final concentrations. Deoxynucleotide incorporation experiments were performed under burst conditions where slightly excess primer/template is mixed with the enzyme. For burst experiment analyses, time-dependent product formation was fitted to an equation; [Product] = A·(1 – exp(–k obs·t)) + A·k ss·t, where A is the amplitude, k obs is the observed burst rate, t is time, and k ss is the observed steady state rate. The program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used for the data analyses. RNA-directed DNA Synthesis—Reverse transcriptase activity by Pol γ was studied under burst conditions. The reaction was initiated by mixing a reactant containing varied concentrations of dCTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.8, and another reactant containing 300 nm D23/R45, 80 nm Pol γ holoenzyme. The reaction was quenched in 0.3 m EDTA. The products were separated on a 20% acrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and analyzed on a Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager System. Determination of Kd for DNA/RNA—The dissociation constant (Kd) for D23/R45 was determined as described for DNA/DNA previously (17Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A reactant containing 250 μm dCTP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 was mixed with 80 nm holoenzyme with varied concentrations of D23/R45 using chemical quench apparatus. The reaction was quenched 1.0 s after mixing, and the formation of the product DNA 24-mer was measured. The data were fit to the quadratic equation: [E·DNA/RNA] = 0.5·(Kd + [Eactive] + [DNA/RNA]) – {0.25·(K d + [Eactive] + [DNA/RNA])2 – ([Eactive]·[DNA/RNA])}½, where E·DNA/RNA is the enzyme DNA/RNA complex, and Eactive is active enzyme. Exonuclease Activity Assays—Exonuclease activity was studied under steady state conditions in the absence of dCTP using 40 nm wild type Pol γ and varied concentrations of the primer/template from 0.2 to 2 μm. The initial rate of cleavage was determined by following the products. Maximum rate of excision, k exo, and Km for primer/template were determined by fitting the data to the following Michaelis-Menten equation, k ss = k exo·[P/T]/(Km + [P/T]), where k ss is the observed steady state rate, and P/T is primer/template. DNA-directed RNA-primed DNA Synthesis—Incorporation of one or two deoxyribonucleotides into an RNA primer was studied using rapid chemical quench as described above. In case of single nucleotide incorporation, a solution containing 0–200 μm dCTP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 was rapidly mixed with 80 nm exo– enzyme preincubated with 300 nm R18/D36. For two-nucleotide incorporation, 200 μm dCTP and dTTP were used. In both cases, the reaction was quenched by mixing with 0.3 m EDTA. The two-nucleotide incorporation experiment was performed in the absence and in the presence of the accessory subunit. For steady state kinetic experiments of elongation of the RNA primer, the reaction was initiated by injecting 5 mm MgCl2 into a mixture containing 200 μm of all four dNTPs, 4 μm R18/D36, and 200 nm wild type Pol γ in the presence and the absence of the accessory subunit. The reaction was then quenched at different times by adding 0.3 m EDTA. Ribonucleotide Incorporation—Ribonucleotide incorporation by Pol γ was studied under burst conditions. The reaction was initiated by mixing a reactant containing varied concentrations of CTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.8, and another reactant containing 300 nm D23/D45, 100 nm exo– Pol γ holoenzyme. The same experiments were done for ATP incorporation using D25/D45. Because the ribonucleotide incorporation reaction was slow, the reaction was quenched by manually mixing the reaction mixture with 0.3 m EDTA. Active Site Determination—As is often the case, the enzymes are not always 100% active, and the total enzyme concentration is not necessarily the active enzyme concentration. For a careful kinetic characterization of Pol γ, the active site concentration of the enzyme was determined. Active site concentration of the reconstituted holoenzyme was determined by measuring the burst amplitudes as described previously (24Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The burst experiments were performed by combining 97.5 nm holoenzyme (based on extinction coefficient at 280 nm) preincubated with 1 μm D23/D45 (sequence shown under “Experimental Procedures”) and a mixture containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 10 or 100 μm dCTP. In both cases (10 and 100 μm dCTP), the burst amplitude was 80 nm, indicating that the purified and reconstituted enzymes were 82% active (data not shown). When D23/R45 was used, a burst phase was observed, and the amplitude was consistently 30 nm (Fig. 1A), indicating that 30% of the total protein was observed to be active. The lower amplitude could be due to low binding affinity of DNA/RNA or due to nonproductive binding of the DNA/RNA heteroduplex (26Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration dependence of DNA/RNA binding to the holoenzyme was studied to examine whether the DNA/RNA binding was limiting under our further experimental conditions where the DNA/RNA concentration is 300 nm. Binding of DNA/RNA—A mixture containing 250 μm dCTP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 was rapidly mixed with 80 nm holoenzyme preincubated with various concentrations of DNA/RNA, and the reaction was quenched 1.0 s after mixing with 0.3 m EDTA. The amount of D24-mer formed was plotted versus DNA/RNA concentration, and the data were fit to a quadratic equation (Fig. 1B). The best fit gave the Kd of 16.2 nm, which is similar to the value previously determined for DNA/DNA of 9.9 nm (17Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The results indicate that binding of D23/R45 is not limiting under our experimental conditions, and there is a high affinity for this primer/template substrate. A Pre-steady State Burst in Incorporation of dCTP into DNA/RNA—The tight binding of a DNA/RNA substrate implies that reverse transcription by Pol γ may be the result of a mechanism paralleling DNA-directed DNA synthesis. The RNA-directed activity was further studied to measure the nucleotide concentration dependence of the pre-steady state burst of polymerization. The rate of single nucleotide incorporation into a DNA/RNA primer/template was measured by mixing the enzyme preincubated with D23/R45 and a mixture of dCTP and magnesium. Fig. 1A shows a kinetic trace at 20 μm dCTP that was fit to a burst equation. The curve clearly showed two phases. The fast burst phase represents rapid conversion of the pre-bound substrate to the product, and the slow steady state phase indicates rate-limiting product release. The observed burst rate at different concentrations of dCTP was plotted and fitted into hyperbolic equation to determine the maximum rate of polymerization (k pol) of 21.9 ± 1.1 s–1 and equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for dCTP of 25.7 ± 4.1 μm (Fig. 1C). Efficiency (or specificity constant) for incorporation (k pol/Kd) was calculated to be 0.85 μm–1 s–1. These values were compared with previously determined numbers with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) using both D23/D45 and D23/R45 and with Pol γ using D23/D45 under the same experimental conditions (Table I) (21Feng J.Y. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23832-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The efficiency of incorporation by Pol γ was ∼50-fold less with D23/R45 than D23/D45. However, comparison between Pol γ and HIV-1 RT showed that the k pol, Kd , and efficiency values were very similar (Table I). Surprisingly, the efficiency of incorporation was slightly (∼10%) better with Pol γ. These results suggest that the reverse transcriptase activity by Pol γ may be physiologically significant.Table IComparison of kinetic parameters between Pol γ and HIV-1 RTD23/D45D23/R45kpolKdEfficiencykpolKdEfficiencys-1μ mμ m-1 s-1s-1μ mμ m-1 s-1Pol γ44 ± 2aRef. 21.1.1 ± 0.1aRef. 21.40aRef. 21.21.9 ± 1.125.7 ± 4.10.85HIV-1 RT1.9 ± 0.1bRef. 27.24 ± 5bRef. 27.0.080bRef. 27.22.9 ± 0.7bRef. 27.30 ± 4bRef. 27.0.76bRef. 27.a Ref. 21Feng J.Y.

Open table in a new tab Exonuclease Activity—Pol γ possesses a 3′ → 5′ DNA exonuclease proofreading activity, and because Pol γ is capable of utilizing RNA as a template in DNA synthesis as shown above, it is possible that the enzyme also catalyzes 3′ → 5′ DNA excision with an RNA template. To test this hypothesis, a steady state kinetic method is employed using D23/R45 as a substrate, as well as D23/D45 as a side-by-side comparison. The rate of excision was measured by adding magnesium into a mixture containing 40 nm wild type Pol γ and 1.5 μm primer/template and quantitating the total amount of DNA cleaved by Pol γ. The kinetic traces were plotted and fit to lines (Fig. 2). The observed rates for DNA/RNA and DNA/DNA were 0.038 ± 0.001 and 0.0120 ± 0.0002 s–1, respectively. Elongation of RNA Primer with dNTPs—During initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, an RNA primer is formed at the origin of the heavy strand synthesis. Although evidence that Pol γ can initiate DNA synthesis using an RNA primer has been shown previously (28Fan L. Kaguni L.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), no detailed kinetic characterization is available. Therefore, we have examined whether Pol γ is capable of adding dNTPs to an RNA primer at a physiologically relevant rate. A model primer/template (R18/D36) as an initiation substrate was used, and incorporation of the next correct deoxyribonucleotide, dCMP, was studied by pre-steady state burst experiments. A burst phase with the rate of 2.11 s–1 was observed at dCTP concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3A). The observed burst rates at varying concentrations of dCTP were plotted, and the Kd value for dCTP of 37 μm and the k pol value of 3.2 s–1 were determined based on a hyperbolic fit (Fig. 3B). Role of the Accessory Subunit—The accessory subunit is known to significantly enhance the efficiency of dNTP incorporation into a primer during DNA synthesis. Thus, in the absence of the accessory subunit, there may be a change in the rate-limiting step because the incorporation rate with an RNA-primed substrate was relatively slow compared with a DNA-primed substrate in the presence of the accessory subunit. Therefore, effects of the accessory subunit in incorporation of dNTP into an RNA primer were examined. Pre-steady state burst experiments monitoring two nucleotides (dCMP and dTMP) incorporation were performed in the presence (Fig. 4A) and in the absence of the accessory subunit (Fig. 4B). The rates for single and two nucleotides incorporation were confirmed to be the same, and the two-nucleotide incorporation gave more distinct separation on the acrylamide gel. Elongation of the RNA primer was observed both in the presence and the absence of the accessory subunit. However, in the absence of the accessory subunit, no burst was observed, indicating that the rate-limiting step is prior to the release of elongated product and is most likely to be a conformational change or chemistry step. Whereas in the presence of the accessory subunit, a burst phase with the rate of 2.58 ± 0.58 s–1 and an amplitude of 18.7 ± 1.2 nm were observed. Assuming the active enzyme concentration in these experiments is 18.7 nm based on the burst amplitude in the presence of the accessory subunit, the rate for the reaction in the absence of the accessory subunit was determined to be 0.027 s–1. These results indicate that the accessory subunit enhanced the rate of incorporation for ∼100-fold. This compares with the 6-fold enhancement seen for the DNA-dependent DNA polymerization reaction (17Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that in the exonucleolytic cleavage by Pol γ is ∼2-fold faster in the absence of the accessory subunit than in the presence (2Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, based on our excision rate described above (0.012 s–1), in the absence of accessory subunit, the excision rate could roughly be estimated to be 0.02–0.03 s–1. Because incorporation rate in the absence of the accessory subunit was 0.027 s–1, it is possible that the catalytic subunit is not able to start DNA synthesis from an RNA primer because the rates for the forward and the reverse reaction are similar. To test this hypothesis, incorporation of all four dNMPs into an RNA primer was studied in the presence and absence of accessory subunit under steady state conditions. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the presence of the accessory subunit, the primer elongation was seen up to the maximum length. On the other hand, in the absence of the subunit, shorter species accumulated, and the intensities of those bands were not changing after a certain time (Fig. 5B). This is probably due to the similarity in rates of elongation and excision, therefore, reaching equilibrium between the forward and the reverse reactions. This result strongly suggests that the accessory subunit is required in efficient initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication. Ribonucleotide Incorporation—The mtDNA is found to contain scattered single ribonucleotides, and it has been hypothesized that this may be due to an unexplored catalytic activity by Pol γ. Therefore, incorporation of a single ribonucleotide, CMP, into D23/D45 was studied under burst conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 (top panel), a single ribonucleotide was incorporated into the DNA primer. A minor band was also observed between D23-mer and chimeric 24-mer bands, which is due to a trace contamination of dCTP (<0.1%) in CTP solution. Because deoxyribonucleotides are much better substrates for Pol γ than ribonucleotides, dCTP was preferentially incorporated rapidly, plus the mobility of ribonucleotide in a polyacrylamide gel is slower than deoxyribonucleotide, and the chimeric 24-mer product and D24-mer contaminant were clearly distinguished. The kinetic trace of 100 μm CTP incorporation is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6. Because the reaction is very slow, no burst phase was observed, indicating that the rate-limiting step for ribonucleotide incorporation is a step prior to the product release, possibly the chemistry step. Therefore, the initial velocity of the reaction was measured (Fig. 6, inset), and the Michaelis-Menten analysis was performed by varying the CTP concentration. The dependence of observed initial rates on CTP concentration gave Km for CTP of 67 ± 21 μm and k cat of 0.0096 ± 0.001 s–1 (data not shown). Similar experiments were performed with ATP ribonucleotide using D25/D45, the Km for ATP was 100 ± 26 μm, and the k cat was 0.0056 ± 0.0004s–1 (data not shown). RNA-dependent DNA Synthesis—Reverse transcriptase activity by human mitochondrial DNA polymerase was studied by rapid chemical quench methods that allowed us to investigate the individual steps of the reaction. As shown for HIV-1 RT previously, a burst phase was seen in dCTP incorporation into D23/R45 with Pol γ (Fig. 1A), indicating that the molecular mechanism for reverse transcription is similar to that for HIV-1 RT. Therefore, the values of dissociation constant (Kd), the maximum rate of polymerization (k pol), and the efficiency of incorporation for dCTP into DNA/RNA were determined and compared with DNA/DNA and with those for HIV-1 RT (Table I). Interestingly, those parameters for DNA/RNA were almost identical between the two enzymes. Our results suggest that the RT activity by Pol γ may be significant because it is slightly more efficient than that of HIV RT. RNA-directed DNA Excision—The novel 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity has never been reported with a DNA/RNA primer/template. As shown in Fig. 2, where the 3′ end has a correct base pairing, no burst phases with the amplitude of the enzyme concentration of 40 nm were observed using both D23/D45 and D23/R45, indicating that the rate-limiting step for the exonuclease reaction is prior to product release such as primer/template binding, chemistry, or conformational change. The rate for DNA/DNA (0.012 s–1) was similar to the previously determined number with the same enzyme and primer/template concentrations but a different sequence of the primer (0.022 s–1) (21Feng J.Y. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23832-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, k exo for D23/R45 was 3-fold higher than for D23/D45 with this primer/template. Initiation of Mitochondrial DNA Replication—During the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, RNA/DNA heteroduplex is formed, and the RNA fragment serves as a primer for DNA synthesis (8Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). We have investigated whether Pol γ is able to add dNTPs to the RNA primer and initiate DNA synthesis. For single nucleotide incorporation into an RNA primer, we obtained the rate constant of 3.2 s–1. This rate must be faster than the overall mtDNA replication rate to be physiologically relevant. The mtDNA replication rate has been reported to be very slow because it takes2hto replicate the entire genome (7Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This suggests that the rate of deoxyribonucleotide incorporation into the RNA primer (3.2 s–1) at the initiation stage is sufficiently fast. Furthermore, the elongation rate has to be significantly faster than the rate of excision by the same enzyme. Our results show that in the presence of the accessory subunit, the incorporation rate was more than 200-fold faster than the excision rate. Therefore, we conclude that Pol γ is able to initiate mtDNA replication at a physiologically relevant rate. However, in the absence of the accessory subunit, the rate of deoxyribonucleotide incorporation was about 100-fold slower than in the presence, and the burst phase was no longer observed. This indicates that there was a change in the rate-limiting step from product release to either chemistry or conformational change. In addition, our steady state elongation experiment clearly showed that the accessory subunit is required for efficient DNA elongation from an RNA primer (Fig. 5). Ribonucleotide Incorporation—It is highly interesting that ribonucleotides are found in the mtDNA at scattered positions (14Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To understand how those ribonucleotides are incorporated, single ribonucleotide incorporation into a DNA primer was studied under burst conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, CMP was incorporated by Pol γ at relatively slow rate (0.0096 s–1), and no burst phase was observed. The rate of AMP incorporation was 0.0055 s–1, about 2-fold slower that that of CMP. Because a burst phase was not observed, the rate-limiting step of overall ribonucleotide incorporation reaction is a step prior to the elongated primer/template product release. It is possible that the 2′-hydroxyl group of the incoming ribonucleotide interacts with the residue in the active site, which could interfere the conformational change or the chemistry. The rate for deoxyribonucleotide (dCMP) incorporation into D23/D45 was reported to be 44 s–1, and the binding is very tight (Table I). Although it is difficult to correlate the frequency ribonucleotide incorporation found in mtDNA (∼1 in every 500 base pairs) with our kinetic results, we have shown that Pol γ possesses the ability to incorporate a ribonucleotide into a DNA primer, and accordingly this activity could play a physiological role in incorporating ribonucleotide into mtDNA. Roles of RNA-associated Activities—In this study, four novel RNA-associated activities of Pol γ, reverse transcription, RNA-directed 3′ → 5′ DNA excision, RNA-primed DNA synthesis, and ribonucleotide incorporation, were investigated. Our proposed roles for these activities during mtDNA replication are summarized in Fig. 7. Because Pol γ catalyzes RNA-associated reactions at physiologically relevant rates, we support the strand-coupled mtDNA replication model in which an intermediate with newly synthesized ribonucleotide-containing lagging strand is formed. To complete the replication, those ribonucleotides have to be replaced by corresponding deoxyribonucleotides. It has been suggested that the RT activity may be involved in this conversion (14Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this case, the resulting transcript would be the complementary strand; thus, further DNA synthesis from the transcript to its complementary strand is required. The other possible mechanism of the conversion is that the ribonucleotides are digested by RNase H activity, and DNA is synthesized. The mitochondrial RNA processing RNase could be considered as RNase H. It is puzzling as to why the ribonucleotide-containing intermediate is formed during mitochondrial RNA processing RNase DNA replication because it requires additional steps to complete the replication. It is also possible there may be more complex processes where the RT activity is utilized during the replication and perhaps also is involved in mitochondrial DNA repair. For instance, it is known that DNA/RNA heteroduplex is formed during the replication, and if there is any DNA damage in the heteroduplex, the reverse transcriptase activity may be required to repair the damage. Nucleotide substitution mutations are estimated to occur in mtDNA 100-fold more frequently as in nuclear DNA (29Lewis W. Copeland W.C. Day B.J. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A major cause of those mutations is oxidative stress. During mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species are formed, and there are high chances for oxidative DNA damage in mitochondria. The repair of those mutations involves AP endonuclease incision at an AP site followed by removal of the AP site by deoxyribose phosphate lyase; then DNA polymerase activity is required to fill the gap. Finally, the two fragments are ligated by DNA ligase (see Ref. 30Bogenhagen D.F. Pinz K.G. Perez-Jannotti R.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). If there is DNA damage in a DNA/RNA heteroduplex, RT activity would be required for the gap filling reaction during the base excision repair. This RNA-templated DNA repair activity by Pol γ is currently under investigation. The observation that Pol γ catalyzes RNA-directed DNA excision activity also suggests that the RNA-associated activities are important. The role of the RNA-directed DNA excision activity is likely to be proofreading during reverse transcription. The rate of excision with an RNA template was 3-fold higher than with DNA. One reason for this might be that the fidelity of reverse transcription is lower than DNA-directed DNA synthesis, and it requires more efficient proofreading activity. This might be associated with the fact that the fidelity of HIV-1 RT is much lower than other polymerases (1Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Our proposed role of RNA-primed DNA synthesis activity is elongation of an RNA primer that is formed during initiation of mtDNA replication as discussed above. It is also possible that this activity is involved in conversion of the ribonucleotide-containing strand into the DNA strand. The mitochondrial RNA processing RNase could process the RNA-rich region of the strand, and Pol γ uses the RNA fragment as a primer. In the present studies, novel RNA-associated activities by Pol γ have been kinetically investigated, and several significant findings are presented. First, Pol γ catalyzes reverse transcription slightly better than HIV RT. This indicates that the RT activity by Pol γ may be physiologically significant and provides strong evidence for the strand-coupled model of mtDNA replication. Second, RNA-directed DNA excision activity was shown for the first time, although this can be considered as a logical consequence of reverse transcriptase activity by a polymerase containing a proofreading exonuclease. Because the rate with an RNA template was 3-fold faster than with a DNA-template, this novel RNA-associated excision activity may be important. This activity is proposed to be a proofreader, but we have not yet shown selectivity in the excision of nucleotides from a DNA/RNA primer/template heteroduplex. Third, RNA-primed DNA synthesis activity, which is required for initiation of mtDNA replication, has been studied. We have shown that Pol γ holoenzyme is sufficient in catalyzing this reaction at a physiologically relevant rate without any other proteins or cofactors and that the accessory subunit has an essential role in the initiation step. Finally, we have found that Pol γ is capable of incorporating a ribonucleotide into a DNA primer, and this activity could take part in incorporating ribonucleotides into the mtDNA. We thank Dr. Allison Johnson and Jeff Bartron for preparation of the exo– catalytic subunit and the recombinant baculovirus for expressing Pol γ, Dr. Adrian Ray for discussions, and Professor Joann Sweasy for thoughtful suggestions and careful reading of the manuscript."

The mechanism of Ski-mediated repression of TGF-β signaling is primarily attributed to the capacity of Ski to interact with Smad2/3/4 (7Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have proposed structural models of complex formation between Ski and the MH2 domains of Smad3/4 (12Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The minimal domain in Ski that defines interaction with Smad3 MH2 domain was mapped to the amino terminus (amino acid residues 17–45 in human c-Ski) and was demonstrated to preferentially bind to Smad3 when it was in the active trimeric complex (12Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They also reported that this Ski fragment directly binds to Smad3 allowing Smad3-Smad4 heteromer formation in the complex. In another study the crystal structure of the Smad4 binding domain in Ski in complex with Smad4 MH2 domain was resolved and lead to a model in which Ski competes with Smad3 for binding to Smad4 and thus disrupts the functional integrity of the complex (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore at the present time studies on the formation of complexes involving Ski and Smads remain controversial, and clearly more work is needed to clarify the interaction of Ski with the Smad3-Smad4 complex. Here we identify an additional domain in Ski that affects interaction with Smad2/3, which is distinct from the previously identified Smad3 binding domain (12Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our results also provide evidence that binding of Ski to Smad3/4 does not disrupt Smad3-Smad4 heteromer formation, rather the Smad heteromer provides Ski with several discrete sites to mediate interaction with the Smad3/4 complex. Thus interaction of Ski with the Smad3/4 complex through binding to either Smad3 or Smad4 is sufficient for the repression activity of Ski on Smad-dependent transcriptional activation. Chemicals and Oligonucleotides—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific unless indicated. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Plasmid Constructs—T7-tagged wt-cSki and mt-cSki (L110P), 6Myc-Smad2, 6Myc-Smad3, 6Myc-Smad4, and constitutively active type I receptor TβR-I(TD) were described previously (4Ueki N. Hayman M.J. J.

All mutagenesis and cloning procedures were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 and mink lung epithelial CCL-64 (Mv1Lu) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Expression plasmids were introduced into the cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Precleared extracts were incubated with anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-T7 (Novagen) mouse monoclonal antibodies, or mouse normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were recovered using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PROTRAN, Schleicher & Schuell). For Western blotting, the primary antibodies used were anti-T7 or anti-Myc. Proteins of interest were detected using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Gene Assay—CCL-64 cells in 24-well plate were transfected with luciferase reporter construct 4×SBE-Luc (50 ng/well), β-galactosidase (TK-βGal, 50 ng/well), plus effector plasmids (100 ng/well). Total amount of transfected DNA was equalized with vector (pEGFP-C1). Luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection and normalized to the β-galactosidase activities according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The results are mean values and S.D. from three independent experiments. For ligand stimulation, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml, Sigma) or appropriate solvent 12 h after transfection. Identification of an Additional Domain in Ski That Mediates Smad3 Binding—In the previous study, analysis of a Ski single point mutant SkiL110P, which was unable to bind to N-CoR, revealed that the Ski/N-CoR interaction was not required for repression of TGF-β signaling, whereas it was for nuclear hormone signaling (4Ueki N. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24858-24864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This finding led us to analyze further how SkiL110P could repress Smad-dependent transcriptional activation without N-CoR/SMRT. As previously reported (4Ueki N. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24858-24864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), SkiL110P can associate with Smad4 and Sin3 to a similar extent to the wild-type Ski. Since Smad2/3 are also important factors for Ski-mediated repression, we investigated the interaction of SkiL110P with Smad2/3. We performed co-immunoprecipitation assay using lysates containing Ski (wt-Ski or mt-Ski), Smad2/3, and a constitutively active type I receptor TβR-I(TD) (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the mutation L110P significantly (but importantly not completely) reduced the binding capacity to Smad3 (Fig. 1A, upper panels, lane 6) in comparison with the wild-type (Fig. 1A, upper panels, lane 3). Similar results were obtained by using Smad2 (Fig. 1A, lower panels). These results indicate that the mutation L110P in Ski substantially affects interaction with Smad2/3 in addition to N-CoR/SMRT. Analysis of the proximal amino acid sequence of the Leu110 site revealed that it resides in a hydrophobic residue-rich region that includes a potential amphipathic α-helix highly conserved in Ski/Sno/Dachshund family proteins (Fig. 1B) (14Kim S.S. Zhang R.G. Braunstein S.E. Joachimiak A. Cvekl A. Hegde R.S. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 787-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To test the notion that these residues may facilitate the interaction with Smad3, we performed individual alanine substitution mutagenesis and examined the capacity of these mutants to associate with Smad3. Co-immunopreciptation assays using lysates containing each Ski mutant, Smad3, and TβR-I(TD) showed that the mutations P107A, Q108A, I109A, V113A, and L114A significantly reduced Ski's binding ability to Smad3 (Fig. 1C, lanes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9), indicating that these residues are required for effective Smad3 interaction. Interestingly, the L110A mutation had little effect and even appeared to slightly increase the interaction with Smad3 (Fig. 1C, lane 7), while L110P significantly decreased the interaction (Fig. 1C, lane 10). We obtained similar results using Smad2 (data not shown), and recently using glutathione S-transferase-pull-down assays this region was also shown to bind to Smad2. 2L. Li and E. Stavnezer, personal communication. Each mutation tested had no effect on Smad4 binding (data not shown). Our data strongly suggest that this domain from amino acids 107–114, which is distinct from the previously identified Smad3 binding domain (amino acid residues 17–45 in human c-Ski) (12Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), also mediates interaction of Ski with Smad2/3. Analysis of this region in Ski proteins from other species, and also in more distant family members such as SnoN and Dachshund (Dach2), revealed that this region is very highly conserved. Fig. 1B shows that there is 100% protein sequence identity between human, mouse, and frog c-Ski, and this region is also conserved in human SnoN and human Dach2 (Fig. 1B). Thus, this degree of conservation indicates it is likely that this region plays an important role in Ski-Smad2/3 interactions. Two Distinct Domains in Ski Mediate Smad3 Interaction— The partial binding ability shown in the Ski mutants described above (Fig. 1) suggested that two distinct domains in Ski may independently mediate interaction with Smad3. In addition they raised the possibility that the remaining Ski-Smad3 binding found in the mutants could be via Ski-Smad4 interaction, which potentially could provide an indirect link between Ski and Smad3 through binding to the Smad3-Smad4 heteromer. To examine these possibilities, we generated a series of Ski mutants having independent mutations for binding to either Smad3, and/or Smad4, or in combination. Mutation of L19A (equivalent mutation L21A in human c-Ski) was shown previously to abolish interaction with Smad3 (12Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mutation W255E (equivalent mutation W274E in human c-Ski) was shown to disrupt Smad4 interaction (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we introduced mutations L19A, L110P, and W255E individually or in combination to generate targeted disruption of Smad interactions (Fig. 2A). Co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using lysates containing Ski, Smad3, and TβR-I(TD) to examine the effect of each mutation on Smad3 binding (Fig. 2B). L19A (LA) alone significantly reduced but did not completely abolish Smad3 binding (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This was similar to the result with L110P (LP) (Fig. 2B, lane 3), albeit to a greater extent. W255E (WE) alone had no effect on Smad3 binding (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Interestingly, combination of mutations LA/LP completely abolished Smad3 interaction (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Mutations LA/WE, LP/WE, and LA/LP/WE showed no noteworthy difference from LA, LP, and LA/LP, (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–8), indicating that mutation WE has no effect on Smad3 interaction. This result was consistent with the previous observations that Ski interacts with Smad3 and Smad4 through discrete binding sites (7Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q.

Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of the mutations on Smad4 binding, similar co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using Smad4 instead of Smad3 (Fig. 2C). LA, LP, and LA/LP mutations had no substantial effect on Smad4 binding (Fig. 2C, lanes 2, 3, and 5), while WE alone was sufficient for complete abrogation of Smad4 interaction (Fig. 2C, lane 4), as reported previously (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that while each Smad3 binding mutation alone (LA or LP) is not sufficient, combined mutations (LA/LP) disrupt Smad3 interaction independent of the Smad4 binding mutation (WE). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that under these experimental conditions, two distinct domains in Ski can independently mediate interaction of Ski with Smad3. Interestingly, Mizuide et al. (15Mizuide M. Hara T. Furuya T. Takeda M. Kusanagi K. Inada Y. Mori M. Imamura T. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 531-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) recently identified two separate sites in the MH2 domain of Smad2/3, which mediate interaction with Ski/Sno. Thus, it is possible that two distinct interfaces of Ski/Sno and Smad2/3 facilitate interaction with each other. Effects of Independent or Combined Mutations That Affect Interaction of Ski with Smad3 or Smad4 on Smad3/4-dependent Transcription—To investigate the effect of each Ski mutation on Smad-mediated transcriptional activation, we performed an established reporter gene assay using Smad3/4-dependent 4×SBE-Luc reporter construct in CCL-64 cells (9Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, regardless of the significantly reduced binding ability to Smad3 as evidenced by the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2B), LA alone, LP alone, and LA/LP repressed transcription as effectively as the wild-type (WT) (Fig. 3, LA, LP, LA/LP, and WT). Furthermore, WE alone also repressed transcription to a similar extent to WT (Fig. 3, WE and WT), regardless of the complete lack of interaction with Smad4 (Fig. 2C). However, combined mutations LA/WE and LP/WE partially reversed repression (up to 50 and 30% of vector control, respectively) (Fig. 3, LA/WE and LP/WE). Clearly indicating that these mutants retain partial repression activity. In contrast, LA/LP/WE, which completely abolished individual interaction with Smad3 and Smad4 (Fig. 2, B and C), nullified the repression (Fig. 3, LA/LP/WE). These results indicate that interaction of Ski with either Smad3 or Smad4 is necessary and sufficient for repression of Smad3/4-dependent transcriptional activation. Ski Allows Direct Smad3-Smad4 Heteromer Formation, Enabling Recruitment of Ski to the Smad3/4 Heteromeric Complex through Either Smad3 or Smad4 Binding—Smad3 and Smad4 form heteromers in response to TGF-β signaling (16Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Ski mutants, which lack direct interaction with either Smad3 or Smad4, can be recruited to Smad complex through the Smad3-Smad4 heteromer. To test this notion, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2, B and C) in the presence of both Smad3 and Smad4 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly LA/LP in the presence of Smad4 allowed this mutant to interact with Smad3 (Fig. 4A, lane 5), in clear contrast to its inability of direct interaction with Smad3 (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Similarly, in the presence of Smad3 the WE Ski mutant could now interact with Smad4 (Fig. 4A, lane 4), in contrast to its inability to directly interact with Smad4 (Fig. 2C, lane 4). However, LA/WE and LP/WE significantly reduced interaction with Smad3 and Smad4 (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7), and LA/LP/WE completely abolished the interaction (Fig. 4A, lane 8). The partial interaction shown by LA/WE and LP/WE (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7) is consistent with the partial transcriptional repression activity seen in the luciferase assay (Fig. 3, LA/WE and LP/WE). It is possible that exogenously expressed mutant Ski can dimerize with endogenous Ski through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain (17Zheng G. Blumenthal K.M. Ji Y. Shardy D.L. Cohen S.B. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31855-31864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); thus, the presence of endogenous wild-type Ski may contribute to recruit Smad3/4 to the complex. However, this possibility is ruled out, as the interactions are not observed in our co-immunoprecipitation assays using the triple mutant form of Ski (LA/LP/WE), which retains this coiled-coil domain (lanes 8, Fig. 4A and Fig. 2, B and C). These results provide evidence that binding of Ski still permits Smad3-Smad4 heteromer formation, and interaction with either Smad3 or Smad4 is necessary and sufficient for Ski-mediated transcriptional repression in TGF-β signaling. Our finding that there are two distinct domains in Ski involved in Smad2/3 interaction allowed us to generate a series of informative Ski mutants completely lacking direct binding to either Smad3 (LA/LP), Smad4 (WE), or both (LA/LP/WE) (Fig. 4B). These Ski mutants have provided strong evidence that either Smad3 or Smad4 interaction with Ski is necessary and sufficient for repression of TGF-β signaling. This is mediated by the Smad3-Smad4 heteromer enabling indirect links between Ski mutants (LA/LP and WE) and Smads (Smad3 and Smad4, respectively). This notion was further supported by the fact that only the Ski mutant LA/LP/WE, which binds to neither Smad3 nor Smad4, completely abolished repression activity of Smad-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 3, LA/LP/WE). Contrary to our model, Wu et al. (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) recently proposed that Ski disrupts heteromeric complex formation of Smad3-Smad4, based on a structural observation that Ski binds to the L3 loop of Smad4. It is not clear why Smad3-Smad4 complex formation was not detected in their biochemical analyses, using equivalent mutants to our LA, WE, LA/WE mutants in the presence of both Smad3 and Smad4. In contrast, their report of the effect of the mutations on Smad-mediated transcriptional activation appeared consistent with our results, in that LA and WE repressed as efficiently as the wild-type Ski, and LA/WE still retained partial repression activity (up to 50% of vector control) (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). While their proposed model did not completely explain the transcriptional properties of those mutants, our model, in which Ski allows direct Smad3-Smad4 heteromer formation in the complex, is consistent with the transcriptional properties of these mutants. Consistent with our results, another group reported the heteromer formation of Smad3-Smad4 in the presence of Ski (12Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have shown that Ski requires interaction with either Smad3 or Smad4 for repression of TGF-β signaling. As previously shown by several groups using gel shift assays (7Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 8Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 243-254PubMed Google Scholar), Ski can be recruited to the Smad-binding elements (SBE) on DNA through interaction with Smads. However, how Ski can exert its repression activity on Smads remains unknown. We recently reported that this Ski-mediated repression is N-CoR-independent (4Ueki N. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24858-24864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ski was shown to link Smad3 and Sin3, forming a complex including HDAC1 (8Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that corepressors other than N-CoR play a role in Ski-mediated repression in TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, Ski was suggested to interfere with Smad-CBP/p300 coactivator complex formation (8Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and thus may function by inhibiting the binding of coactivators rather than recruiting corepressors. Hence these lines of repression by Ski cannot be ruled out either. Regardless of the details our data clearly show that binding of Ski to the Smad3/4 complex is central to its ability to repress. We are grateful to Ed Stavnezer for sharing unpublished results and helpful comments, K. Donnelly for supporting our research project, and members of the Hayman laboratory for helpful discussions and criticisms."

Deletions of any single residues in this loop caused almost complete loss of Ca2+-ATPase activity, while their substitutions had no or only slight effects. Single deletions or substitutions in the adjacent N- and C-terminal regions of the loop (His32-Asn39 and Leu49-Ile54) had no or only slight effects except two specific substitutions of Asn39 found in SERCA2b in Darier's disease pedigrees. All the single deletion mutants for the Glu40-Ser48 loop and the specific Asn39 mutants formed phosphoenzyme intermediate (EP) from ATP, but their isomeric transition from ADP-sensitive EP (E1P) to ADP-insensitive EP (E2P) was almost completely or strongly inhibited. Hydrolysis of E2P formed from Pi was also dramatically slowed in these deletion mutants.

The results indicate that the Glu40-Ser48 loop, with its appropriate length (but not with specific residues) and with its appropriate junction to A domain, is a critical element for the E1P to E2P transition and formation of the proper structure of E2P, therefore, most likely for the large rotational movement of A domain and resulting in its association with P and N domains.

Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar and 2Ebashi S. Lipmann F. J.

In the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is activated by binding of two Ca2+ ions (E2 to E1Ca2, steps 1 and 2) and then autophosphorylated by MgATP to form ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 3). Upon formation of this EP, the bound Ca2+ ions are occluded in the transport sites. The subsequent isomeric transition to ADP-insensitive form (E2P, step 4) will result in a reduction in affinity and a change in orientation of the Ca2+ binding sites, and thus a Ca2+ release into lumen (step 5). Finally, hydrolysis takes place and returns the enzyme into an unphosphorylated and Ca2+-unbound form (E2, step 6). E2P can also be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ by reversal of its hydrolysis. The enzyme has three cytoplasmic domains (N, P, and A), which are widely separated in the Ca2+ bound form (E1Ca2) and associated in the Ca2+-unbound and thapsigargin-bound form (E2(TG)) (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The modeling of tubular crystals formed with decavanadate (E2V) revealed (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) that three cytoplasmic domains gather to form a most compactly organized single headpiece in E2V. With the limited proteolysis experiments, we previously showed (7Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that E2V is very similar to E2P in domain organization and that E2P is the intermediate having the most compactly organized headpiece in the catalytic cycle. The results further indicated that a large rotation of A domain (by ∼90° (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar)) and its strong association with P and N domains most likely occur during the E1P to E2P transition and suggested that stabilization energy provided by intimate contacts between all three cytoplasmic domains in E2P will provide energy for moving transmembrane helices and release the bound Ca2+ ions. It is thus crucial to find out structural elements essential for the A domain movement and resulting domain organization and for transmitting these changes to transmembrane helices. We have recently identified the Lys189-Lys205 outermost loop of A domain as to make intimate contact with P domain for formation of the proper structure of Ca2+-released form of E2P in step 5 (9Kato S. Kamidochi M. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9624-9629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). P domain was actually documented with the crystal structures E1Ca2 and E2(TG) to function as a coordinator for transmitting the movements of the transmembrane helices to the cytoplasmic domains (6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In addition, it is also possible that the loops connecting A domain with the transmembrane helices (M1-M3) may play roles in the movement of A domain and in transmitting the movement to transmembrane helices. The likely importance of interactions of M2- and M3-connecting loops with P domain was previously pointed out (6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 10M⊘ller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol.

Na/K-ATPase and Related ATPases. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2000: 233-236Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Glu40-Ser48 loop with an extended structure, the major part of the M1-connecting loop, is well separated from and not having significant interactions with other parts of the molecule in E2V as well as in E1Ca2 and E2(TG) (Fig. 2), and possible roles of this loop remain unknown. Interestingly, not only A domain, but also M1 connected to this loop, seems to undergo very large and unique structural changes during Ca2+ transport cycle, i.e. up-and-down and horizontal movements and bending near the membrane surface (6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on and explored possible roles of the Glu40-Ser48 loop by site-specific mutagenesis and found that deletions of any single residues in this loop result in almost complete loss of the Ca2+-ATPase activity, while their substitutions have no or only slight effects. Results further showed that both the E1P to E2P transition and the E2P hydrolysis are almost completely inhibited in all these single deletion mutants. The results indicate that the Glu40-Ser48 loop is critical for formation of the proper structure of E2P and further suggest that the loop may coordinate the motions of A domain and M1 during the E1P to E2P transition and thus possibly contribute to the rearrangement of the transmembrane helices. Mutagenesis and Expression—Mutations were created by PCR using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and plasmid pGEM7-Zf(+) (Promega) containing the ApaI-KpnI fragment of the rabbit SERCA1a cDNA as a template. The ApaI-KpnI fragments were then excised from the PCR products and used to replace the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (15Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells as described previously (16Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. The amount of expressed SERCA1a was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (17Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expression levels of all the mutants in the microsomes were comparable with that of the wild type. ATPase Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C in a mixture containing 20 μg/ml microsomal protein, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm A23187, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), 0.55 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity, which was determined in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without added CaCl2, otherwise as above. The specific ATPase activity/mg of expressed SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of expressed SERCA1a and the Ca2+-ATPase activity of expressed SERCA1a, which was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the control microsomes from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA1a. This background level with the control microsomes was as low as 3% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild-type SECRA1a. Formation and Hydrolysis of EP—Phosphorylation of SERCA1a in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi, and dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled SERCA1a, were performed under conditions described in the legends to figures. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Rapid kinetics measurements of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were performed with a handmade rapid mixing apparatus (18Kanazawa T. Saito M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 693-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or otherwise as above. The precipitated proteins were separated at pH 6.0 by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Weber and Osborn (19Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described previously (20Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP formed with the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background was less than 4% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild-type SERCA1a. The amount of EP/mg of SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of EP thus obtained and the amount of expressed SERCA1a. Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were reproduced by the program VMD (Theoretical Biophysics Group, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Effects of Deletions and Substitutions on ATP Hydrolysis—The specific Ca2+-ATPase activities of the expressed mutant and wild-type SERCA1a were determined at 25 °C (Fig. 3). Deletions of any single residues in the Glu40-Ser48 loop resulted in almost complete loss of the activity, while their nonconservative substitutions caused only partial decrease or rather slight increase in the activity. Single deletions or substitutions of the residues in the adjacent N-terminal (His32-Asn39) and C-terminal (Leu49-Ile54) regions of the Glu40-Ser48 loop had only slight or moderate effect on the activity, except that the specific substitutions of Asn39 (N39D and N39T, but not N39A) had a significantly reduced activity. Quadruple alanine substitutions of Asn39, Glu40, Glu44, and Glu45 were previously shown to cause no loss of function (22Clarke D.M. Maruyama K. Loo T.W. Leberer E. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the present results are in essential agreement. Formation of EP from ATP—We then performed detailed kinetic analysis with the mutants. EP was formed from ATP at 0 °C under conditions otherwise similar to those for the ATPase assay. All the mutants possessed the ability to form EP, and the amount formed was comparable with that of wild type (Fig. 4). In Fig. 5, the fraction of E2P accumulated was determined at steady state (15 s after addition of ATP). In the presence of K+, which strongly accelerates decay of E2P and thus suppresses its accumulation in the wild type (23Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of E2P accumulated in all the mutants was very low as in the wild type. In the absence of K+, the fraction of E2P largely increased in the wild type (to 73% of the total amount of EP (E1P plus E2P)), but it remained very low in the single deletion mutants for the Glu40-Ser48 loop and in the mutants N39D and N39T, indicating that almost all EP accumulated was E1P in these mutants. On the other hand, as in the wild type, the fraction of E2P largely increased in the other mutants, in which the residues in the loop were substituted or those in the adjacent N- and C-terminal regions of the loop were deleted or substituted (with the exception of N39D and N39T). The results strongly suggest that the E1P to E2P transition in step 4 is inhibited in the single deletion mutants for the Glu40-Ser48 loop and in the substitution mutants N39D and N39T. We, therefore, examined the decay of E1P accumulated in the presence of K+.Fig. 5Accumulation of E2P from ATP. Microsomes were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 0.1 m KCl (black bars) or 0.1 m LiCl without added KCl (gray bars) or otherwise as described in the legend to Fig. 4. The reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid at 15 s after the start of phosphorylation, and the total amount of EP was determined. For determination of E2P, an equal volume (50 μl) of a mixture containing 5 mm ADP, 3 mm EGTA, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), and 0.1 m KCl (black bars) or 0.1 m LiCl without added KCl (gray bars) was added to the above phosphorylation mixture at 15 s after the start of phosphorylation. At 1 s after this addition, the reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid. E1P disappeared entirely within 1 s after the addition of ADP. The amount of E2P is shown as percentage of the total amount of EP. The values presented are the mean ± S.D. (n = 3-4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Decay of EP Formed from ATP—Decay of EP formed from ATP in the presence of K+ was determined at 0 °C by first phosphorylating with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of K+ and Ca2+ for 15 s under the conditions in which almost all EP formed was E1P (see Fig. 5) and then terminating phosphorylation by adding excess EGTA to prevent further phosphorylation and thus allow decay of 32P-labeled EP. The EP decay was well fitted with a single exponential as shown in Fig. 6 with the representative mutants and wild type. The decay rates were thus obtained with all the mutants and summarized in Table I. The decay was almost completely blocked by any single deletions in the Glu40-Ser48 loop, and the rates were only 1-3% of that in the wild type. On the other hand, the rates in the substitution mutants for the Glu40-Ser48 loop and in all the deletion and substitution mutants for the adjacent regions of the Glu40-Ser48 loop were comparable with or only slightly lower than that in the wild type, except the mutants N39D and N39T (but not N39A) that had the significantly reduced rate (dashed lines in Fig. 6).Table IRate constants for partial reaction steps of all the mutantsDecay of E1P formed from ATPHydrolysis of E2P formed from PiTransition from E2 to E1Ca2 (formation of E1P from E2)s −1%s −1%s −1%WT0.0546(100.0)0.837(100.0)0.327(100.0)Δ320.0306(56.1)0.906(108.3)0.120(36.6)Δ330.0455(83.4)0.786(93.9)0.194(59.6)Δ340.0562(103.0)0.626(74.9)0.159(48.7)Δ360.0335(61.3)0.581(69.5)0.313(95.7)Δ370.0371(67.9)1.317(157.4)0.243(74.2)Δ380.0527(96.5)0.574(68.6)0.247(75.5)Δ390.0457(83.7)0.271(32.4)0.242(74.1)Δ400.0004(0.7)0.003(0.4)0.172(52.7)Δ410.0006(1.1)0.003(0.4)0.201(61.4)Δ420.0006(1.2)0.003(0.3)0.217(66.2)Δ430.0006(1.1)0.005(0.6)0.165(50.4)Δ440.0007(1.3)0.013(1.6)0.241(73.8)Δ450.0007(1.4)0.011(1.3)0.162(49.5)Δ460.0011(2.0)0.019(2.2)0.245(75.1)Δ470.0014(2.6)0.023(2.8)0.219(67.1)Δ480.0016(2.9)0.017(2.0)0.275(84.0)Δ490.0203(37.2)0.669(80.0)0.228(69.8)Δ500.0150(27.5)0.581(69.5)0.222(67.9)Δ510.0263(48.2)0.811(97.0)0.297(90.8)Δ520.0571(104.6)0.712(85.1)0.256(78.4)Δ530.0426(78.1)0.313(37.4)0.173(52.9)Δ540.0457(83.7)0.341(40.7)0.131(40.3)G37P0.0363(66.5)0.972(116.2)0.373(114.2)H38A0.0570(104.4)1.856(221.9)0.450(137.7)N39A0.0655(120.0)1.192(142.5)0.279(85.3)N39D0.0117(21.4)1.023(122.3)0.148(45.4)N39T0.0147(26.9)0.789(94.4)0.148(45.1)E40A0.0602(110.3)2.123(253.8)0.229(69.9)L41G0.0310(56.7)0.211(25.2)0.273(83.4)P42G0.0427(78.2)1.209(144.6)0.378(115.8)P42A0.0330(60.4)0.403(48.2)0.248(75.8)A43G0.0469(85.8)1.713(204.8)0.280(85.5)E44A0.0372(68.1)1.263(150.9)0.461(141.0)E45A0.0419(76.6)1.546(184.8)0.288(88.0)G46P0.0490(89.8)1.041(124.4)0.307(94.0)K47A0.0695(127.2)2.279(272.4)0.411(125.6)S48A0.0591(108.3)1.233(147.4)0.279(85.2)L49A0.0651(119.2)1.173(140.3)0.428(131.1)I54V0.0448(82.0)0.475(56.7)0.302(92.5) Open table in a new tab Hydrolysis of E2P Formed from P i —E2P was formed by Pi in the absence of Ca2+ and K+ and presence of 35% (v/v) Me2SO, which extremely favors E2P formation (24de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In some of the single deletion mutants, including those for the Glu40-Ser48 loop, the amount of EP formed was somewhat reduced (Fig. 7A). Nevertheless the hydrolysis of 32P-labeled E2P was examined with all the mutants at 0 °C by diluting the above phosphorylated samples with a large volume of a solution containing K+ and non-radioactive Pi. The conditions were thus made otherwise identical to those used for the decay of EP formed from ATP in Fig. 6. The hydrolysis of E2P proceeded with first-order kinetics as shown in Fig. 7, B and C, with the representative mutants and wild type. The hydrolysis rates were thus obtained with all the mutants and summarized in Table I. The hydrolysis was markedly slowed or blocked by any single deletions in the Glu40-Ser48 loop, and the rates were only 0.3-3% of that in the wild type. In contrast, the hydrolysis in the substitution mutants for the Glu40-Ser48 loop and in the deletion and substitution mutants for the adjacent regions of the loop including N39D and N39T (dashed lines in Fig. 7C) was as rapid as, or only slightly slower than, that in the wild type. Transition from E2 to E1Ca 2 —The mutants and wild type were preincubated in the absence of Ca2+ at pH 6 where equilibrium between E1 and E2 is most shifted to E2 (25Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6120-6126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then phosphorylated at 0 °C by simultaneous addition of saturating concentrations of Ca2+ and ATP under conditions otherwise similar to those for the ATPase assay. The time course of EP formation was well described by the first-order kinetics as shown in Fig. 8 with the representative mutants and wild type. The rates were thus obtained with all the mutants and summarized in Table I. The rates of all the mutants, including the single deletion mutants for the Glu40-Ser48 loop, were comparable with that of the wild type and not significantly reduced. When ATP was added to the enzyme preincubated with Ca2+ otherwise as above, the EP formation proceeded at much faster rate (5 s-1 in the wild type and the comparable rate (4-7 s-1) in all the mutants). The results show that the Ca2+-induced E2 to E1Ca2 transition, which is rate-limiting for the EP formation from E2, is essentially not inhibited in all the mutants. Roles of Glu40-Ser48 Loop—In the present study, we explored possible roles of the Glu40-Ser48 loop connecting A domain and M1 helix by mutagenesis and found that deletions of any single residues within this loop (but not their substitutions) almost completely block or strongly inhibit both the E1P to E2P transition and the E2P hydrolysis. Results indicate that the loop with its appropriate length (but not with specific residues) is critical for the rapid isomeric transition and hydrolysis of EP. During the E1P to E2P transition and Ca2+ release into lumen, a large rotation of A domain by ∼90° and its intimate contact with P and N domains occur to form the most compactly organized cytoplasmic domains in E2P without bound Ca2+ (7Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this E2P, the hydrophobic atmosphere (24de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dupont Y. Pougeois R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is thus realized around the phosphorylation site and a specific water molecule can now attack the acylphosphate bond to hydrolyze. It is therefore likely that the formation of the proper structure of E2P, i.e. the movement of A domain and resulting domain organization, was impaired by the deletions of even single residues (∼3.5 Å shortening) in the Glu40-Ser48 loop. The facts found in the structural model E2V, an E2P analogue (7Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), that the Glu40-Ser48 loop is extended and not interacting with other parts of the molecule (Fig. 2), is consistent with the view that no specific residues are involved in the role of this loop but that its length being crucial. In the detailed and well accepted reaction mechanism for the E1P to E2P transition and Ca2+ release, the process consists of two steps (steps 4 and 5, Fig. 1). The single deletions in the Glu40-Ser48 loop obviously caused blocking of the loss of ADP sensitivity in step 4 (i.e. the E1P to E2P transition). We have recently found (9Kato S. Kamidochi M. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9624-9629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the mutations in the Lys189-Lys205 outermost loop on A domain do not inhibit the loss of ADP sensitivity but strongly inhibit the subsequent processing of E2P in step 5 and indicated that the final process of gathering of A and P domains is accomplished in step 5 to release the bound Ca2+ by the intimate contact of the Lys189-Lys205 loop with P domain. Together with this study, we thus could identify two structural elements crucial for the successive, but distinct, two steps; the large rotation of A domain and its association with P and N domains (to some extent) in step 4 and the final process for intimate contact of A and P domains in step 5. Importantly, it was found in comparison of the structures E1Ca2 and E2(TG) (6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) that upon Ca2+ dissociation, M1 connected to the Glu40-Ser48 loop undergoes horizontal and upward movements and a large structural change, i.e. bending at Asp59, forming an amphipathic helix M1′ that has hydrophobic residues on one side and charged residues on the other (Fig. 2). M1′ is thus likely to be situated at the membrane surface by interactions with lipids and possibly with Arg63 in M1. This large motion is likely caused by the steric collision of M1 with M3 that inclines together with M4-M6 and P domain toward M1 and A domain (6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The unique structure of M1′ and M1 are also found in E2V, an analogue of E2P. Then it is possible that the shortening of the Glu40-Ser48 loop by the deletions may inhibit such motion of M1 and thus block the appropriate movements of M3-M6, P domain, and A domain for the E1P to E2P transition. Alternatively, it may also be possible that the appropriate movement of A domain would be inhibited if M1′ first formed is not flexible enough to move upward from the position at the membrane surface and to compensate the shortening of the Glu40-Ser48 loop by the deletions. In any case, it is likely that, not only the crucial large rotation of A domain and gathering of the cytoplasmic domains, but also the unique movement and structural change of M1, likely contribute to formation of the proper structure of E2P. It is possible that the Glu40-Ser48 loop functions in coordinating these motions of A domain and M1 during the E1P to E2P transition and thus in rendering A domain to accept the inclined P domain at an appropriate position and contributing to cross-talk between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The observation showing essentially no effects of the deletions in the Glu40-Ser48 loop on the rate of the E2 to E1Ca2 transition (and subsequent E1P formation) (steps 1-3, Fig. 8) indicates that the structural importance of the Glu40-Ser48 loop may be already lost in E2. This view is consistent with our previous observation (7Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that the cytoplasmic domain organization in the more relaxed E2 state is significantly different from that in the most compactly organized E2P state. The view may also be compatible with the notion (6Toyoshima C. Nomura H. N"

This occurs concomitant with the induction of slow/oxidative marker genes such as troponin I slow and myoglobin that have been shown to be regulated by MEF2.

It is possible that this regulatory capability involves calcineurin and MEF2 because both factors potentiate the PGC-1α-mediated activation of the slow fiber-specific promoters of troponin I slow (TnIslow) and myoglobin. TnIslow has been used as a model gene to study mechanisms of slow fiber-specific expression. TnIslow is the major isoform of the TnI gene family expressed in all newly formed fibers but is down-regulated in future fast and up-regulated in future slow myofibers during fetal development (33Sutherland C.J.

Sequence motif and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis of the 157-bp hTnIslow USE identified potential transcription factor-binding sites within this region including a MEF2 consensus element and USE B1 that contains an initiator of transcription or Inr-like element (1O'Mahoney J.V.

The Inr-like element was shown to be essential for high level, slow fiber-specific expression. In addition, transgenic analysis has demonstrated that the MEF2-binding site contributes to expression in the soleus muscle (31Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R.

Using the yeast one-hybrid assay, a novel 944-aa DNA-binding protein, MusTRD1, was isolated that binds to the Inr-like element within the USE B1 region (1O'Mahoney J.V. Guven K.L. Lin J. Joya J.E.

Mutation of the Inr-like core sequence (GATTAA) within the USE-B1 region (nucleotides –977 to –960) to USE-B1b (GATatc) abrogated both slow fiber-specific expression from the USE and DNA binding by MusTRD1. MusTRD1 contains five repeat domains that share ∼70% homology to the six repeat domains of the Inr-like binding protein TFII-I (38Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G.

Two MusTRD1 homologues, GTF3 and CREAM (consisting of 959 aa), from humans and three mouse orthologues, BEN 1, 2, and 3, have been isolated (39Tassabehji M. Carette M. Wilmot C. Donnai D. Read A.P.

We have discovered multiple MusTRD isoforms in mice that arise from alternative splicing of a single gene, Gtf2ird1, on mouse chromosome 5 (44Tay, E. S., Guven, K. L., Subramaniam, N., Polly, P., Issa, L. L., Gunning, P. W., and Hardeman, E. C. (2003) Biochem. J., in pressGoogle Scholar). In keeping with the nomenclature that we have devised for the mouse isoforms, we have changed the name of human MusTRD1 to hMusTRD1α1 (human muscle TFII-I repeat domain-containing protein 1α1). The name of the isoform is based on the peptide sequence. The first number indicates the unique combination of C-terminal repeat domains present. Isoforms contain 1 of 2 possible C-terminal exons that are designated “α” (exon 31) or “β” (exon 30). The final number indicates which of the seven possible specific combinations of unique C-terminal exons is present. In this study, we show that hMusTRD1α1 acts as a repressor of hTnIslow transcription and that repression occurs through the hTnIslow USE. We show that MEF2C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C) transcriptional activation via the USE is dependent upon an intact Inr-like element and is blocked by hMusTRD1α1. hMusTRD1α1 binds to the Inr-like element via two DNA-binding domains (DBDs) located between aa 351 and 458 and aa 544 and 944, respectively. Transient transfection analysis of a deletion series of hMusTRD1α1 revealed that repression can occur in the absence of DNA binding. hMusT1α1 is a potent repressor by itself, and GST pull-down analysis revealed that it can interact directly with nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR). This report demonstrates that hMusTRD1α1 interacts directly with MEF2C and can prevent MEF2C from binding to its cognate binding site. The data support a role for hMusTRD1α1 as a repressor of slow fiber-specific genes by preventing MEF2-mediated transcriptional activation. Plasmid Constructs—The pTnIslow USEB1tkluc and pTnIslow USEB1btkluc reporter constructs contain the human TnIslow USE (–1031 to –874) and a mutated B1b version (1O'Mahoney J.V. Guven K.L. Lin J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6641-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) linked to the thymidine kinase (tk) minimal promoter (+81 to +52) and the luciferase cDNA. The p(B1)3x tkluc and p(B1b)3x tkluc reporters contain three copies of the B1 region of the USE (–977 to –960; 5′-AGCCACAGGATTAACATA-3′) or the mutated B1b version (5′-AGCCACAGGATatcCATA-3′) linked to the tk promoter and the luciferase cDNA. The pcDNAMEF2C expression construct contains the mouse Mef2c cDNA driven by the CMV promoter and was a gift from Richard Harvey. Five hMusTRD1α1 cDNAs with progressive truncations of the 3′ ends were amplified by PCR using hMusTRD1α1 template (accession number AF118270) and inserted into pcDNA3.1myc/his (Invitrogen). The primers used include: 786R, AGCGGATCCGGATCACCTTCTCCCC; 689R, AGCGGATCCGTGTGTTGGCGATGTC; 564R, AGCGGATCCGGGGCCGGATCACGTC; 458R, GGGCCCTCTAGACTCGAGGTGACCTGAATGAATGATG; 350R, AGCGGATCCGCGTGTTGATGTCCTC; and F1, GGTCGAATTCATGGCCTTGCTGGGTAA containing an EcoRI site (underlined) to facilitate directional cloning. pcDNA3.1hMusTRD1α1ΔN444 myc/his was produced by AoCI/BstEII digestion and religation of the full-length pcDNA3. 1hMusTRD1α1944aa myc/his. Mammalian one-hybrid assays utilized pCMVGAL4hMusTRD1α1944aa and pCMVGAL4NCoR1–312 constructed by fusing the CMV promoter, GAL4 DBD, and either the hMusTRD1α1944aa cDNA or an NCoR cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal repression domains (45Horlein A.J.

Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Cos-7 cells, undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 cultures maintained 3 days in differentiation medium using Trizol® (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with Impromptu® (Promega). PCR was conducted using the primers: MusTRDF, GAGCTACAGTCAGACTTCCTCAG, and MusTRDR, TCTCTGACTTGTCATGGACGATG, which were designed to regions conserved between mouse and human. MusTRD Antibody—Sheep anti-hMusTRD1α11–20aa serum was raised against the first 20 aa of hMusTRD1α1 (Mimotopes, Clayton, Australia). Hyperimmune serum was affinity purified using biocytin-tagged N-terminal peptides coupled to M-280 streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynal, Carlton, Australia). Transactivation Assays—C2C12 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were cultured overnight in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% chick embryo extract. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen) with 250 ng of pTnIslow USEB1tkluc or pTnIslow USEB1btkluc and 100-ng quantities of the pcDNA3.1hMusTRD1α1-truncation series, pcDNAMEF2C or combinations of the above. After transfection the cells were allowed to differentiate for 36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum before harvesting. Cos-7 cells (1 × 105) were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum before transfection with 500 ng of the p(B1)3x tkluc, p(B1b)3x tkluc, or p(GAL4)3x tkluc reporter constructs in combination with 200-ng quantities of pcDNA3.1hMusTRD1α1944aa myc/his, pCMVGAL4hMusTRD1α1944aa, pCMVGAL4NCoR1–312, or pGAL4DBD using FuGENE 6™ (Roche). The cells were harvested 40 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were performed according to the supplied protocol (Promega) using a Top Count Microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Packard). The activities were normalized to protein concentration and expressed as ratios of empty vector activity. The experiments were performed three times, and a representative result is shown. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—hMusTRD1α1 350-, 458-, 564-, 689-, 786-, 944-, and 500-aa proteins and MEF2C protein were produced by in vitro coupled transcription-translation reactions using TNT® rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The oligonucleotides used include trimerized B1 or B1b elements, B1(3X) and B1b(3X) (described elsewhere), MEF2 (nucleotides –908 to –891 from the USE; CATCCTAAAAATACCCGG), and mutMEF2 (the same region with four mutated residues in the core MEF2 consensus sequence (CATCCTAAtgcgACCCGG) and were labeled using Klenow to fill 3′ overhangs in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and purified on 15% acrylamide gels. DNA binding reactions containing 40 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 10% glycerol, 0.1–0.5 ng of labeled oligonucleotides, and in vitro translated proteins were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. In assays involving antibodies or competitors, the sheep anti-hMusTRD1α11–20aa polyclonal antibody, preimmune serum, 2, 4, and 6 μlof in vitro translated hMusTRD1α1944aa, and 4 μl of rabbit reticulolysate as a control were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of DNA. 1 ng of annealed, unlabeled B1b(3X) oligonucleotide fragment was included in antibody shift assays to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins present in reticulocyte lysates. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed through a 4% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and visualized by autoradiography. The experiments were performed three times, and a representative result is shown. Immunoprecipitation—Cos-7 cells transfected with pCMXNCoR and pcDNA3.1hMusTRD1α1350 myc/his were lysed using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 containing Complete™ (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture). 100 μg of lysate was mixed with an anti-NCoR Rb88 polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 2239–2453 aa region and protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The complexes bound to the agarose beads were washed in 1× lysis buffer, then boiled in SDS loading buffer, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE before transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride HybondP membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The filter was incubated with the 9E10 anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), and binding of the secondary antibody was detected using ECL Super Signal™ (Pierce). GST Pull-down Assays—Expression of GST-NCoR1649–2453, GST-hMusTRD1α1944, and GST alone in the BL21(DE3)pLysS Gold Escherichia coli strain (containing the pACYC-T7-Trx plasmid) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. GST pull-down assays were performed by co-incubation of GST or GST fusion proteins with in vitro translated 35S-labeled hMusTRD1α1350aa or MEF2C initially for 30 min at 30 °C and for a further 40 min at room temperature in PPI buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). Bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and the bands were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 reader and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). MEF2C Activates and hMusTRD1α1 Represses Transcription through the hTnIslow USE—The transcriptional regulation of the hTnIslow USE via MEF2C and hMusTRD1α1 was investigated initially in C2C12 muscle cultures. Expression vectors encoding hMusTRD1α1 or MEF2C were co-transfected into C2C12 cells with luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by the hTnIslow USE (Fig. 1). MEF2C elicited an approximate 2-fold increase in hTnIslow USE transcriptional activity in differentiated C2C12 cultures (Fig. 1B, left panel). In contrast, hMusTRD1α1 repressed the basal activity mediated by the hTnIslow USE by ∼2-fold. To assess the transcriptional effects of hMusTRD1α1 on MEF2C-mediated transactivation, hMusTRD1α1 and MEF2C expression constructs were co-transfected together with the hTnIslow USE. hMusTRD1α1 repressed the MEF2C-mediated transcriptional activation of the hTnIslow USE by ∼3-fold. The specific involvement of the Inr-like element in this regulation was examined using USE-B1b that contains a mutation in this element that prevents hMusTRD1α1 binding (1O'Mahoney J.V. Guven K.L. Lin J. Joya J.E. Robinson C.S. Wade R.P. Hardeman E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6641-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). There is a 36-fold reduction in activity upon mutation of the GATTAA core sequence demonstrating that basal transcriptional activity is mediated by the B1 region (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, mutation of this core sequence resulted in a 68-fold reduction of MEF2C-mediated induction of the hTnIslow USE, demonstrating that this site is necessary for MEF2C-mediated transcriptional activation. These results also suggest that an unidentified factor binding to B1 is needed for basal activity and activation mediated by MEF2C and that hMusTRD1α1 competes with the same DNA site to mediate repression. hMusTRD1α1-mediated repression of the USE could be due to an intrinsic property of the protein. Alternatively, it could repress by modifying other myogenic factors present in C2C12 cells, or it could recruit other MusTRD isoforms because these cells express a number of MusTRD isoforms, including the mouse orthologue of hMusTRD1α1 (44Tay, E. S., Guven, K. L., Subramaniam, N., Polly, P., Issa, L. L., Gunning, P. W., and Hardeman, E. C. (2003) Biochem. J., in pressGoogle Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To discriminate these possibilities, expression studies were conducted in Cos-7 cells that do not express myogenic regulatory factors and express negligible amounts of MusTRD transcripts. In addition, the B1 region of the USE was used so that the Inr-like element was present but not the MEF2-binding site. The B1 region was trimerized and linked to a heterologous promoter driving luciferase to achieve a sufficient level of expression in Cos-7 cells (Fig. 1A). hMusTRD1α1 was co-transfected together with a construct bearing either the B1 or B1b region. hMusTRD1α1 repressed basal transcriptional activity by ∼3-fold (Fig. 1B). Mutation of the core GATTAA sequence in the B1b version resulted in a 4-fold loss of basal transcriptional activity in Cos-7 cells. These data demonstrate that hMusTRD1α1-mediated repression can occur in the absence of MEF2C and its binding site. hMusTRD1α1 Contains Two DNA-binding Domains—To locate the region(s) of hMusTRD1α1 responsible for DNA binding, we examined the functional capabilities of a deletion series of hMusTRD1α1 cDNAs. As a first step in this process, we demonstrated that in vitro translated full-length hMusTRD1α1 (hMusTRD1α1944aa) binds to the Inr-like element within the B1 region of the hTnIslow USE (Fig. 2A). Oligonucleotides containing either a trimerized B1 or B1b region were incubated with in vitro translated hMusTRD1α1944aa protein. A protein-DNA complex formed when the B1 region was used as a probe but did not form with the mutated oligonucleotide. The presence of hMusTRD1α1 in the slowest migrating complex was demonstrated using an α-MusTRD1α11–20aa antibody directed against the first 20 aa of hMusTRD1α1. The specificity of the antibody was shown by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). A supershift of the upper complex occurred in the presence of the antibody, demonstrating that it contains hMusTRD1α1 binding to the B1 region. Truncated versions of hMusTRD1α1 were generated by progressive C-terminal deletion of putative regulatory regions as well as an N"

However, the cellular targets that mediate the effects of USF on cellular proliferation and transformation remain uncharacterized. IGF2R, with multiple functions in both normal growth and cancer, was investigated here as a possible USF target in both nontumorigenic and tumorigenic breast cell lines. The 5′-flanking sequences of the human IGF2R gene contain multiple, highly conserved E boxes almost identical to the consensus USF DNA-binding sequence. These E boxes were found to be essential for IGF2R promoter activity in the nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. USF1 and USF2 bound the IGF2R promoter in vitro, and both USF1 and USF2, but not c-Myc, were present within the IGF2R promoter-associated chromatin in vivo. Overexpressed USF2, but not USF1, transactivated the IGF2R promoter, and IGF2R mRNA was markedly decreased by expression of a USF-specific dominant negative mutant, identifying IGF2R as a USF2 target. IGF2R promoter-driven expression was USF-independent in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that a defect in USF function may contribute to down-regulation of IGF2R expression in cancer cells.

The ability of USF to antagonize the transforming potential of c-Myc together with the similar binding preferences of Myc and USF suggest that these factors share a subset of common targets, and indeed, c-Myc and USF bind to some common promoters in vivo (6Boyd K.E. Farnham P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Boyd K.E. Farnham P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The degree to which the DNA binding specificity bears on target selection and biological activity by USF and Myc is not known but is likely to depend on the promoter and cell context. USF1 and USF2 transcriptional and antiproliferative activities have been shown to be cell context-dependent. In cells derived from normal breast epithelium, both endogenous and exogenous USF1 and USF2 strongly activated transcription from artificial promoters containing USF-binding sites (8Ismail P.M. Lu T. Sawadogo M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, USF antiproliferative activities and transcriptional activity at artificial promoters were impaired in several tumorigenic cell lines. In Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, USF failed to activate transcription, and exogenous USF did not inhibit cellular proliferation (9Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Endogenous USF did not transactivate an artificial promoter in several breast cancer cell lines, even though the USF protein levels and in vitro DNA-binding properties were the same as in normal breast epithelial cells (8Ismail P.M. Lu T. Sawadogo M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In three of six breast cancer cell lines, both exogenous USF1 and USF2 were inactive, whereas in the other three cell lines, overexpressed USF1, but not USF2, activated the USF-responsive reporter. This latter situation parallels the case in HeLa cells, where overexpression of USF was required to observe transcriptional or antiproliferative activities (5Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Besides the correspondence between loss of USF activity and tumorigenic status of the cells studied so far (8Ismail P.M. Lu T. Sawadogo M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), there is evidence for a role of USF in regulating growth in normal cells. In particular, mice lacking the Usf2 gene produce small offspring with decreased viability, whereas the destruction of both Usf1 and Usf2 genes results in early embryonic lethality (11Sirito M. Lin Q. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Analysis of mammary tissue in postpartum Usf2–/– females revealed that USF2 plays a key role in normal mammary cell differentiation and lactation. 2D. Hadsell, unpublished results. Phosphorylation of USF1 by p38 kinase is a key step in the increased transcription of the tyrosinase gene in response to stress (12Galibert M.-D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The role of USF in normal growth regulation, together with the loss of USF activity in cancer cells, suggests that USF activity loss is linked to tumorigenesis and that deregulation of USF target genes in cancer cells contributes to the tumorigenic phenotype. USF has been implicated in the regulation of several genes involved in tumorigenesis, including cyclin B1 (13Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), BRCA2 (14Wu K. Jiang S.-W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), adenomatous polyposis coli (15Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cathepsin D (16Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1980; 12: 1310-1321Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we report a key role for USF in expression of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) gene in normal mammary epithelial cells. Three near-consensus USF sites within the promoter of the IGF2R gene indicated that it would be transcriptionally regulated by USF, and the growth suppressive function of the IGF2R gene product was consistent with a role for USF in maintaining its expression. The IGF2R gene encodes a 2491-amino acid multifunctional membrane receptor that plays a vital role during embryonic growth (17Lau M.M.H. Stewart C.E.H. Liu Z. Bhatt H. Rotwein P. Stewart C.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2953-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). IGF2R binds the growth factor IGF2 and delivers it to lysosomes for degradation, thus suppressing IGF2 signaling (18Morgan D.O. Edman J.C. Standring D.N. Fried V.A. Smith M.C. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1987; 329: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In other functions, the IGF2R protein transfers lysosomal enzymes within the cell by binding to mannose 6-phosphate residues (19Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and binds a number of other ligands, including latent transforming growth factor-β, which is converted to its active form in a process that involves IGF2R binding (20Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The IGF2R protein is ubiquitously expressed, although variations in the amounts of receptor have been noted during development, on experimental induction of diabetes in rats, and on hepatic fibrogenesis (21Keiss W. Hoeflich A. Yang Y. Groenbaek H. Flyvbuerg A. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 66-72PubMed Google Scholar, 22De Bleser P.J. Scott C.D. Niki T. Xu G. Wisse E. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse, IGF2R is expressed only from the maternal allele, whereas in adult humans, the IGF2R gene is not normally imprinted (23Barlow D.P. Stoger R. Herrmann B.G. Saito K. Schweifer N. Nature. 1991; 349: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 24Kalscheuer V.M. Mariman E.C. Schepens M.T. Rehder H. Ropers H.-H. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In transgenic experiments, most mice lacking IGF2R die shortly after birth, a phenotype rescued by targeted deletion of either IGF2 or its signaling receptor, IGF1R (17Lau M.M.H. Stewart C.E.H. Liu Z. Bhatt H. Rotwein P. Stewart C.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2953-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 25Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A number of studies have implicated IGF2R loss in carcinogenesis. Mutations have been identified in the IGF2R gene in many cancers (26De Souza A.T. Hankins G.R. Washington M.K. Orton T.C. Jirtle R.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 27Zavras A.I. Pitiphat W. Wu T. Cartsos V. Lam A. Douglass C.W. Diehl S.R.

Genet. 1996; 14: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and tumor cell growth is modified by changes in IGF2R expression (31O'Gorman D.B. Costello M. Weiss J. Firth S.M. Scott C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5692-5694PubMed Google Scholar, 32Souza R.F. Wang S. Thakar M. Smolinski K.N. Yin J. Zou T.T. Kong D. Abraham J.M. Toretsky J.A. Meltzer S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Outside of imprinting, the mechanisms controlling IGF2R levels and the contribution of transcriptional regulation to IGF2R expression are not well understood. Deletion analysis of the mouse Igf2r gene identified a 5′ region with two E boxes essential for promoter activity in liver cells (33Liu Z. Mittanck D.W. Kim S. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). In hepatic stellate cells, Igf2r expression was down-regulated by a repressor binding at an E box of the mouse promoter (34Weiner J.A. Chen A. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the identity of this repressor and other trans-acting factors of the IGF2R promoter are not known. Here we show that the USF proteins bind to multiple E boxes in the human IGF2R promoter and that these E boxes are essential for promoter activity. The role of USF at this promoter was investigated in a cell line with robust endogenous USF activity, the nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. These experiments demonstrate that the human IGF2R gene is a target of USF2, but not of c-Myc. However, the IGF2R promoter is unresponsive to USF in two breast cancer cell lines, providing further evidence for disrupted USF transcriptional activity in cancer cells. Cell Culture—MCF-10A cells were grown in monolayers at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor, and 1.05 mm CaCl2. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmids—PRL-SV40 (Promega), pRSV-Luc, pMLLuc, pU3MLLuc, pSG424, and pRc/CMV566, and expression vectors for A-USF, A-Max, USF1 (psvUSF1), USF2 (psvUSF2), and c-Myc (pSV-c-myc-1) have been described (9Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The various IGF2R-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by annealing in pairs and then ligating combinations of four pairs of overlapping oligonucleotides into pMLLuc digested with SmaI and HindIII. Wild-type (WT) IGF2R reporter, pABCLuc, was constructed with the following oligonucleotides: forward: CTGCGCTCACGTGACCCGGGCCTGGGAGGAGCCGGGGCGGGCGGGG (Igf2r1), GTCACCTGAACAAGGGAGTCACGTGAGCGGGGGGCGGGGGTGGG (Igf2r3), GGGGCGGTGCCGGGCGGCTGTCACGTGACGCGGTTCCGGGGCCGCCG (Igf2r5), and CTGCCGCTGTCGCTGTCGCCGAGCCCAGTCGAGCCGCGCTCACCTC (Igf2r7); reverse: TGACCCCCGCCCGCCCCGGCTCCTCCCAGGCCCGGGTCACGTGAGCGCAG (Igf2r2), CCCCCCCACCCCCGCCCCCCGCTCACGTGACTCCCTTGTTCAGG (Igf2r4), GCAGCGGCGGCCCCGGAACCGCGTCACGTGACAGCCGCCCGGCACCG (Igf2r6), and AGCTTGAGGTGAGCGCGGCTCGACTGGGCTCGGCGACAGCGACAGCG (Igf2r8). Various combinations of the CACGTG sequences (underlined) were changed to AGATCT in the promoter mutants. pMZFP1 was constructed by ligating the HindIII (end-filled)/BamHI insert from pABCLuc into the vector pSL1180 (Amersham Biosciences) digested with StuI and BglII. To construct pCBALuc, a Klenow DNA polymerase end-filled BamHI/HindIII fragment from pABCLuc containing the IGF2R promoter region was ligated to pRLSV40 (Promega) digested with BglII and HindIII and end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—For experiments in which luciferase activities were measured, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2–2.5 × 105 cells per well 20–24 h prior to transfection. To each well, 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and up to 2 μg of plasmid DNA (in quantities noted for each experiment) were added to 94 μl of serum-free medium. 44–48 h after transfection, cells were scraped into 100 μl of lysis buffer (10Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce). The lysates were spun 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were assayed for luciferase activities with a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories) using the firefly luciferase assay buffer described previously (10Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). Unless otherwise noted, each data point is an average of three or more independent transfections. Error bars represent one standard deviation. DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting of recombinant USF and chemical sequencing G-reactions were carried out according to published protocols (35Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The 340-bp probe was singly labeled at the 5′ position of the top strand by digesting pMZFP1 with SalI in the presence of calf intestinal phosphatase, treating with polynucleotide T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and then cutting with XhoI. After agarose electrophoresis, the labeled fragment was captured and eluted from NA45 DEAE-cellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The expression and purification of recombinant USF1 and USF2 have been described previously (36Van Dyke M.W. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 37Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). MCF-10A nuclear extracts (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muhler M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) were employed in footprinting with the same probe as for recombinant USF. The binding reactions for MCF-10A nuclear extract were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in reaction buffer lacking magnesium, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 120 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.025% Triton X-100, 100 ng of poly[d(GC)], and 200 ng of pBKS–. 105 mm NaCl was contributed by 6.6 μl of nuclear extract (from 2.0 × 105 cells) and 140 mm NaCl by 8.8 μl of nuclear extract (from 2.6 × 105 cells). Magnesium chloride (6 mm final) was added with the DNase I (0.0086 mg/ml final), and reactions were stopped and processed as described (35Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Expression vectors for A-USF and A-Max also encoded the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, permitting detection of these proteins by Western blotting. To detect USF1, USF2, c-Myc, A-USF, and A-Max, proteins from 10 μl of luciferase were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to HA (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), USF1 (C-20, sc229, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), USF2 (C-20, sc862, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or c-Myc (N-262, sc764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibody detection was by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cells in monolayer culture were cross-linked for 20 min by addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of glycine to give a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the dish, and then washed again in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (10 μl/ml, Sigma P8340) and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspended cell pellet was incubated on ice for 10–30 min in lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 0.085 m KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 20 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) with protease inhibitors and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments of sizes 0.5–1 kb. After a spin of 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the chromatin extract supernatant was treated with pre-blocked staphylococcus A cells (6Boyd K.E. Farnham P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged again (14,000 rpm for 15 min). Anti-USF1 (C-20, sc229), anti-USF2 (N-18, sc861), or anti-Myc (N-262, sc764) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to this pre-cleared chromatin extract and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. A mock reaction with no added antibodies was carried out in parallel. Each reaction was incubated with 10 μl of pre-blocked staphylococcus A cells for 15 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and extensive washing of the pellet as described (7Boyd K.E. Farnham P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Supernatant of the mock reaction served as input and was processed in parallel with the immunoprecipitates. Pellets were incubated with elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at 25 °C for 15 min with gentle shaking. After a spin at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, the eluates were heated at 65 °C for 6 h to overnight in 300 mm sodium acetate containing RNase A to reverse cross-linking. DNA was isolated as described previously (7Boyd K.E. Farnham P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and analyzed by PCR. PCR primers for ChIP were as follows: IGF2R promoter (product size 164 bp): forward, 5′-CACCTGAACAAGGGAGTCACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAAGGCGGAGGTGGAGAC-3′; CDK4 promoter (product size 347 bp): forward, 5′-GTGGCCTAGGTTGCCATGGCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTCACCAATGTGACCAGCTGCC-3′; and h-TERT intron 2 (product size 546 bp): forward, 5′-CCAGGTGTCCTTGGCGTTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCAGAGCCCAGCCTAAGCAA-3′. Separation of Transfected and Nontransfected Cells—Transfected cells were selected by magnetic cell separation (MACSelect, Miltenyi Biotech). For this procedure, each 75-cm2 plate of MCF-10A cells was transfected with a mixture of 60 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), 940 μl of serum-free medium, 2 μg of pA-USF or the control vector p566 and 10 μg of a plasmid encoding a truncated CD4 molecule (pMACS 4.1, Miltenyi Biotech). After 46 h, cells were washed and harvested in PBE (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm EDTA), incubated with MACSelect 4 magnetic microbeads, and passed through the magnetic column according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by adding TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science) to the separated cells and extracting RNA into an acidic aqueous phase according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantity of total RNA recovered was measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Relative message levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in a method adapted from earlier described protocols (39Latil A. Bièche I. Vidaud D. Lidereau R. Berthon P. Cussenot O. Vidaud M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1919-1926PubMed Google Scholar, 40Roy R.N. Gerulath A.H. Cecutti A. Bhavnani B.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 153: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (RT) primed by random hexamers or by oligo(dT). A portion of each RT reaction was amplified in a PCR in the LightCycler PCR instrument (Roche Applied Science) using either the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) or Taq polymerase in commercial Taq reaction buffer (Promega). In the latter case, a dilution in dimethyl sulfoxide of SYBR Green I dye (Molecular Probes) was added to each 20-μl PCR. PCR primers were present at a concentration of 0.5 μm. After a denaturation step (30 s at 95 °C), reactions were cycled 40 times (95 °C for 0 s, 65 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 8 s, and 85 °C for 3 s). The fluorescence was measured at 85 °C to minimize fluorescence from short, nonspecific products. Melting curves were obtained at the end of each PCR experiment to verify the production of specific products, and sizes of products from representative PCRs were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. The real time fluorescence measurements permit detection of the threshold cycle number (Ct) corresponding to the exponential growth of PCR product. Ct is proportional to the log of the cDNA concentration. From Ct values of a series of dilutions of an external standard (cDNA from nontransfected MCF-10A cells), a standard curve was generated, and the Ct value of each unknown was used to calculate a transcript amount relative to the external standards. To control for differences in overall RT efficiency and variation in mRNA quality and amount, IGF2R and a reference gene, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (RPLP0), were amplified from the same experimental RT reaction and the data expressed as a ratio of IGF2R to RPLP0. RPLP0 (product size 149 bp): forward primer, 5′-GGCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCATCAGCACCACAGCCTTC-3′; IGF2R (product size 220 bp): forward primer, 5′-GCTGACCACTTGCTGTAGGAGAAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ATCCTCACTGTCCTGGTCATCCC-3′. USF-binding Sites Are Essential for IGF2R Promoter Function in Human Breast Epithelial Cells—The proximal human IGF2R promoter contains three E boxes that are near-consensus matches for the optimal USF-binding site. A comparison of these three E boxes (boxes A–C, Fig. 1A) with the 12-bp consensus binding site for transcription factor USF (5′-GGTCACGTGACC-3′) reveals that each contains not only the central CA(C/T)GTG motif shared by USF, Myc, and TFE3 bHLHzip family members (1Bendall A.S.

Also present in the proximal IGF2R promoter is a fourth E box (site B′) lacking the central USF motif and potential binding sites for SP1 family members or other transcription factors that recognize GC-rich sequences.

As a tool to functionally characterize molecules of the membrane cortex, we generated novel monoclonal antibodies against a fraction enriched for components of the neuronal membrane skeleton. We obtained two antibodies against the kinase-anchoring protein gravin. Gravin was strongly up-regulated during differentiation of human model neurons (NT2-N neurons) and was enriched at the inner peripheral cortex in close proximity to the plasma membrane where its localization primarily depended on association with membranes. In differentiated neurons, gravin colocalized in putative signaling complexes with protein kinase C (PKCβII) and partially with PKCα and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Colocalization with PKCϵ was not observed. PKCβII, PKCα, and PKA but not PKCϵ coprecipitated with gravin indicating physical interaction. Binding of gravin to PKCα required the presence of Ca2+ and was increased after inhibition of PKC. In contrast, binding of PKCβII and PKA were independent of Ca2+ and PKC inhibition. Activation of PKC decreased binding of PKCα to gravin, decreased its association with the plasma membrane, and reduced the mean size of gravin particles. Taken together the data suggest that gravin provides a dynamic platform to localize kinases in an isoenzyme-specific and activation-dependent manner at specific sites in neurons.

During development, many neurons establish a complex morphology that is characterized by the formation of multiple and in many cases highly branched neurites. Within the neurites, many organelles and proteins exhibit a nonuniform distribution that is thought to provide the basis for the formation of structurally and functionally distinct domains. For example, mitochondria are clustered at sites of high energy consumption, and several cytoskeleton-associated proteins are enriched at positions where active process outgrowth occurs. Some kinases and phosphatases also show a nonuniform distribution in neurons and are enriched at specific regions. In many cases this is achieved by locally anchoring them to cytosolic filament systems or to components of the cortical membrane skeleton. It is thought that proteins such as protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AKAPs, protein kinase A anchoring proteins; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; AF, area fractions; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, room temperature; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DOC, deoxycholate; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; PS, phosphatidylserine; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; SSeCKS, Src-suppressed C kinase substrate; TFR, transferrin receptor.1The abbreviations used are: AKAPs, protein kinase A anchoring proteins; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; AF, area fractions; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, room temperature; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DOC, deoxycholate; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; PS, phosphatidylserine; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; SSeCKS, Src-suppressed C kinase substrate; TFR, transferrin receptor. and several classes of protein kinase C targeting proteins serve as linker proteins to position certain kinases to these immobile structures in a dynamic and region-specific manner. AKAPs are a group of structurally unrelated proteins that are able to target PKA to specific organelles or subcellular structures (for reviews see Refs. 1Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar and 2Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1782-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C-targeting proteins such as substrates interacting with C kinase and receptors of activated C kinase similarly localize PKC (3Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recently, multivalent scaffolding proteins that bind several kinases and phosphatases have been described. Examples are the neuronal AKAP-79 that is enriched in postsynaptic densities and binds PKA, PKC, and PP2B through distinct domains (4Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 5Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), and the protein gravin, which was originally identified as an antigen of autoantibodies in patients with myasthenia gravis (6Gordon T. Grove B. Loftus J.C. O'Toole T. McMillan R. Lindstrom J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gravin is a myristoylated high molecular weight protein that is expressed in several tissues and highly expressed in brain (7Grove B.D. Bowditch R. Gordon T. Zoppo G.D. Ginsberg M.H. Anat. Rec. 1994; 239: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In vitro, gravin expression correlates with cell adhesion and migration (8Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Grove B.D. Bruchey A.K. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggesting a role of gravin also during neuronal development where such mechanisms have an important role. Like AKAP-79, gravin binds PKA and PKC through distinct domains (8Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and may be involved in localizing kinases to specific domains in a cell. The first 1000 amino acids of gravin are 69% identical to the respective part of rodent SSeCKS (“Src-suppressed C kinase substrate”) that was originally identified as a negative mitotic regulator (10Lin X. Nelson P.J. Frankfort B. Tombler E. Johnson R. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, because the sequence similarity in the remaining ∼800 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus is very low (<20%), it is not clear whether the two proteins are orthologous or homologous proteins. SSeCKS is a major in vivo substrate of PKC and is associated with the cortical cytoskeleton and enriched in plasma membrane and podosomes (11Lin X. Tombler E. Nelson P.J. Ross M. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28430-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Like gravin, SSeCKS is myristoylated and contains several potential PKC- and one PKA-binding motif. Overexpression of SSeCKS in cultured cells leads to cell flattening, formation of filopodial and lamellipodial-like extensions, and a loss of stress fibers (12Gelman I.H. Lee K. Tombler E. Gordon R. Lin X. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 1588-1595Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Inhibition of SSeCKS expression in turn increases the formation of stress fibers (13Nelson P.J. Moissoglu K. Vargas J.J. Klotman P.E. Gelman I.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 361-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence exists that phosphorylation by PKC affects the intracellular distribution of SSeCKS, and phosphorylated SSeCKS is concentrated in membrane protrusions and ruffles (14Chapline C. Cottom J. Tobin H. Hulmes J. Crabb J. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19482-19489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). How gravin is distributed in neurons and whether similar mechanisms operate to localize gravin is not known. Both PKA and PKC are highly expressed in brain and are important for neuronal function, e.g. learning and memory (for reviews see Refs. 15Walaas S.I. Greengard P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 299-349PubMed Google Scholar and 16Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Treatment of hippocampal neurons with PKA- or PKC-specific activators or inhibitors affect neurite outgrowth and branching (17Cabell L. Audesirk G. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 11: 358-368Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Audesirk G. Cabell L. Kern M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 102: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PKA exists as an inactive tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. Intracellular cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, which causes dissociation of the complex and makes the enzyme catalytically active. Multiple forms of regulatory and catalytic subunits exist of which the β-forms are enriched in brain. Most AKAPs bind only the regulatory subunit II. The family of PKC isoenzymes consists of monomeric proteins that can be divided into three groups based on structural differences, the conventional, novel, and atypical PKCs (19Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ) can be activated by membrane phospholipids, Ca2+, and diacylglycerols and appear to have similar substrate specificities. Novel PKC isoenzymes (δ, ϵ, θ, and η) are independent of Ca2+, and atypical PKCs (ζ, ι, and λ) are independent of Ca2+ and diacylglycerols. How the different PKC isoforms are localized in neurons is largely unknown. To analyze the role of gravin in localizing kinases in human neurons, a well established model for terminally differentiated, postmitotic, and polar central nervous system neurons (NT2-N neurons (20Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Piontek J. Chen C.C. Kempf M. Brandt R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) was employed. Here we describe the generation of two new monoclonal antibodies against gravin. The antibodies were used to determine the subcellular localization of gravin and its association with PKA and PKC isoenzymes by subcellular fractionation, immunocytochemistry, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, the potential regulation of the localization of gravin and its interaction with kinases were analyzed. Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma; cell culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen, and culture flasks and dishes were from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark) unless otherwise stated. Collagen was prepared from rat tails by acetic acid extraction. Cell Culture—NT2 cells were grown in serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 5% horse serum, 292 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and differentiated essentially as described previously (20Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NT2-N neurons were obtained after 5 weeks differentiation with retinoic acid and 2 weeks treatment with mitotic inhibitors as described previously (21Piontek J. Chen C.C. Kempf M. Brandt R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SK-N-BE (2Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1782-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells (22Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in serum/OPTI-MEM (OPTIMEM supplemented with 5% iron-enriched FCS, 292 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and differentiated with 10 μm retinoic acid for 1 week. In some experiments cells were treated with 300 nm phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), with 10 μm bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), with 50 nm staurosporine, with 10 μm ionomycin, or, as a carrier-control, with 0.2% Me2SO in serum/DMEM (NT2-N neurons) or serum/OPTI-MEM (SK-N-BE (2Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1782-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) for 1 h or the indicated times prior to analysis. The effect of glutamate and isoproterenol was tested by preincubation for 30 min in Krebs buffer (125 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 22 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose) followed by incubation with 50 μm glutamate or 10 μm isoproterenol in Krebs buffer for 30 min and compared with incubation with Krebs buffer alone. For transfections, NT2 cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslips until they reached about 40% confluency and were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 8 μl of FuGENE per coverslip. Cells were processed for immunocytochemistry 48 h after transfection. Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies—Mice were immunized with a fraction enriched for inner peripheral plasma membrane proteins. Plasma membranes with the submembranous cortex were prepared from human neuronal cells as described previously (23Maas T. Eidenmüller J. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15733-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The membrane cortex was stripped by treatment with 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11.5, and separated by centrifugation for 1 h at 190,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4, lyophilized, resuspended in PBS, and precleared for 5 min at 5000 × g. BALB/c mice were injected four times intraperitoneally with 50 μg of the protein fraction at intervals of 3-4 weeks. 4 days after the final injection, spleens were removed, and the splenocytes were fused with the myeloma line X63Ag8.653 as described previously (24Faissner A. Kruse J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 627-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A second immunization was performed with the PBS-insoluble material after solubilization with 8 m urea and diluted to a final concentration of 0.85 m urea in PBS. The resulting hybridoma clones were screened for immunoreaction against cytoskeletal and peripherally enriched proteins. Positive clones were recloned twice to obtain stable antibody producing hybridoma lines and cultured in RPMI 1640, 1% FCS, 292 μg/ml glutamine. Antibodies were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation of the hybridoma supernatant, resuspended in PBS, dialyzed against PBS, and stored in the presence of 50% (v/v) glycerol at-20 °C. Preparation of Cellular Lysates and Cell Fractionation—Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped off into ice-cold PBS, and collected for 5 min at 300 × g. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1× protease/inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF), incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 10 min at 13000 × g, and the supernatant (lysate) was collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with BSA samples containing 20% RIPA as standards. Triton X-100 lysates were prepared the same way except that Triton buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) was used instead of RIPA. For fractionation by differential centrifugation, NT2-N cells from two 10-cm tissue culture dishes were counted, collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g, and washed twice with PBS and once with 0.25 m sucrose with all steps at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF and protease/inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), homogenized by 15 strokes with a tight-fitting steel homogenizer, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 × g and 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 0.25 m sucrose containing inhibitors and supernatants combined to yield a post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). The PNS was separated by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the supernatant was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid/DOC precipitation, washed with acetone, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer (26Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar). For detergent extraction, NT2-N cells from one 10-cm tissue culture dish were washed twice with PBS, scraped off into extraction buffer (80 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30% (v/v) glycerol), counted and collected for 5 min at 300 × g with all steps at RT. Cells were resuspended in 150 μl of extraction buffer containing either 60 μg/ml digitonin or 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF, and protease/inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of RIPA buffer. Plasma membrane fractions were prepared by microsphere separation of surface-biotinylated cells essentially as described previously (23Maas T. Eidenmüller J. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15733-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, two 10-cm tissue culture dishes of NT2-N cells were surface-biotinylated with a cleavable S-S biotin derivative, incubated with streptavidin-coupled microspheres, and cracked by freezing/thawing. The homogenate was separated using a magnetic bead attractor into an unbound fraction and a fraction enriched for plasma membranes and the submembranous cortex. The unbound fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to separate the cytosol (supernatant) from uncracked cells and organelles. The cytosol fraction was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid/DOC precipitation (26Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar). The bound fraction was washed three times, separated from the beads by cleavage of the S-S bridge of the biotin derivative, and pelleted at 100,000 × g to yield a fraction enriched for plasma membranes and components of the membrane skeleton. Affinity Purification of Cellular Lysates and MALDI-MS Analysis—1 mg of anti-gravin antibody (JP-74) was covalently coupled to 500 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) using dimethylpimelimidate according to standard procedures (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and packed into a column for chromatography. Triton X-100 lysate from 3 × 107 differentiated SK-N-BE (2Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1782-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells was loaded, and the column was washed with 5 ml of RIPA buffer and eluted with 1 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 1.8. The eluate was lyophilized, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 5% acrylamide. Half of the gel was subjected to immunoblotting with JP-74 antibody, and the other half was stained with Coomassie Blue. The Coomassie-stained band that corresponded to the band detected by immunoblot was excised, repeatedly washed with water and water/acetonitrile (1:1), and digested overnight with 19 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C. The peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) at the protein analysis service unit of the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany). Samples were prepared using thin film preparation techniques, and MALDI mass spectra were recorded as described previously (28Schneider S. Bosse F. D'Urso D. Muller H. Sereda M.W. Nave K. Niehaus A. Kempf T. Schnölzer M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 920-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data base search was conducted with the peptide masses against the nonredundant data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information with the program ProFound (www129.85.19.192/prowl-cgi/ProFound-.exe). Mass tolerance for the monoisotopic peptide masses was set to 0.1 Da. To confirm the results, the sequence of one of the peptides was also determined by MALDI post-source decay (29Sinha P. Poland J. Schnölzer M. Rabilloud T. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy—NT2-N neurons were plated at 4000 cells/cm2 onto Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips and cultured for 3 days in serum/DMEM. After this time, almost all neurons had established polarity as judged from axon-specific tau staining. Cells were washed once with PBS, once with extraction buffer (80 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 30% (v/v) glycerol), extracted for 2 min at RT with extraction buffer containing 60 μg/ml digitonin, and washed with extraction buffer. Cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in extraction buffer, washed with PBS, incubated for 20 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and permeabilized with 60 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min. Staining was as described earlier (30Kempf M. Clement A. Faissner A. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5583-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) using mouse monoclonal anti-gravin (clone JP-98), rat monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (YL1/2 (31Kilmartin J.V. Wright B. Milstein C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar)), polyclonal anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβII, anti-PKCϵ, and anti-PKAcat rabbit antiserum (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), and anti-PKA-RII goat antiserum (Sigma). As secondary antibodies, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-goat, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled donkey anti-rabbit antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used. DAPI was included in the mixture of secondary antibodies to detect the nuclei. Cells were analyzed using Leica DMIRB fluorescence microscope or Leica TCS 4D True confocal scanner equipped with an argon/krypton laser. For morphometric analysis, cells were imaged with a 100x/1.3 Plan Fluor objective on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera (Vosskühler COOL-1300). Image analysis employed the program Lucia G version 4.60 (Nikon). Images were adjusted to achieve a linear increase in pixel intensity with increasing fluorescence in selected frames (10 × 10 μm). A threshold at 50% of the intensity range was defined and used to select and measure automatically the number and area of all objects above the threshold. For quantitation of colocalization, binary maps of the individual labels were generated by defining thresholds as described above in selected microscopic frames (20 × 20 μm). Area fractions (AFs) of the binary maps were determined for each individual label and combined using “and” as logical operator. The percentage of colocalization with respect to an individual label (label 1) was calculated as ((AFlabel 1 “and” AFlabel 2)/AFlabel 1). For immunoelectron microscopy, NT2-N neurons were extracted, fixed, and stained with anti-gravin antibody (JP-98) as described above. After five washes with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA, cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse bridge antibody for 30 min at RT, washed five times with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA, and incubated 30 min at RT with 5 nm immunogold-labeled protein A (Aurion). The cells were washed five times with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA, postfixed for 30 min with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, washed three times for 10 min with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, and then incubated for 1 h with 1% (w/v) OsO4 (Herth, München, Germany), 1.5% (w/v) K4Fe[CN]6 (Merck) in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were washed three times with water and dehydrated with graded ethanol washes. Cells were embedded in epoxide resin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) by conventional methods, sectioned, and contrasted consecutively with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Immunoprecipitations were performed with RIPA lysates according to standard procedures (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 3 × 106 (NT2-N) or 5 × 106 (SKN-BE (2Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1782-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g and 4 °C, and resuspended in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4). The suspension was passaged five times trough a 27-gauge needle, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 5 μg/ml JP-74 monoclonal IgG or, as a control, with 5 μg/ml of an unrelated monoclonal IgG for 90 min at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein A beads were added, and the mixture was incubated on a shaker at 4 °C for 90 min. Immune complexes were collected, and the beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. In some experiments, Ca2+ was replaced by 1 mm EGTA or, in other experiments, 120 μm phosphatidylserine was added to the lysis and wash buffer. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE and transfer onto PVDF were performed as described previously (32Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using benchmark protein molecular weight markers (Invitrogen). For immunoblots, monoclonal anti-gravin (clone JP-98, if not stated otherwise), anti-tubulin (DMIA), anti-actin (Amersham Biosciences), and anti-transferrin receptor (H68.4, WAK-Chemie, Bad Soden) antibody, or polyclonal anti-gravin (J. D. Scott, Portland, OR), anti-NF-M antiserum (Chemicon), anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβII, anti-PKCϵ, and anti-PKAcat antiserum (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled mouse anti-rabbit (Sigma) antiserum was used. Detection used enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) and was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification of the blots was carried out with an Arcus II scanner (Agfa-Gevaert) and the program NIH Image 1.61/ppc. Identification of a Human Neuronal Cortical Membrane Skeleton Antigen as Gravin—In an immunological approach to obtain novel antibodies against components of the neuronal membrane skeleton, a fraction was prepared that was enriched in inner peripheral plasma membrane proteins using microsphere separation of homogenized human model neurons (Fig. 1A). Previously we have shown that this procedure yields a protein mixture that contains components of the submembranous actin cortex but is largely devoid of cytosolic proteins (23Maas T. Eidenmüller J. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15733-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The isolated material was used to immunize mice and to produce hybridoma lines. Screening by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis resulted in the isolation of a panel of clonal hybridoma lines that produced antibodies against cortically enriched antigens. Two of the antibodies detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼300 kDa which showed a very similar subcellular distribution. The antigen of one antibody (JP74) was affinity-purified and subjected to MALDI-MS after tryptic digest (Fig. 1B). By data base search, 23 of the detected peptides matched the kinase-anchoring protein gravin and covered 24% of the protein sequence corresponding to a probability of 99% (program ProFound) for the analyzed protein to be gravin. No other notable protein match was observed. Immunoprecipitation with a gravin antiserum (kind gift of Dr. J. D. Scott) confirmed that JP74 recognized gravin and that also the other antibody (JP98) recognized the same protein (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2053465902,"Human platelets express the receptor for immunoglobulin G, FcγRIIa, that triggers cell aggregation upon interaction with immune complexes. Here, we report that the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the Linker for Activation of T-cell (LAT) in human platelets stimulated by FcγRIIa cross-linking was followed by its complete dephosphorylation in an αIIb/β3 integrin-dependent manner. Concomitant to LAT dephosphorylation, the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was activated through a mechanism involving its proteolysis by calpains downstream of integrins. Both PTP1B and LAT were associated with the actin cytoskeleton complex formed during platelet aggregation. Moreover, phospho-LAT appeared as a good substrate of activated PTP1B in vitro and these two proteins interacted upon platelet activation by FcγRIIa cross-linking. The permeant substrate-trapping PTP1B (TAT-PTP1B D181A) partly inhibited LAT dephosphorylation in human platelets, strongly suggesting that this tyrosine phosphatase was involved in this regulatory pathway. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, we provide evidence that PTP1B activation and LAT dephosphorylation processes were required for irreversible platelet aggregation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PTP1B plays an important role in the integrin-mediated dephosphorylation of LAT in human platelets and is involved in the control of irreversible aggregation upon FcγRIIa stimulation.

Altogether, our results demonstrate that PTP1B plays an important role in the integrin-mediated dephosphorylation of LAT in human platelets and is involved in the control of irreversible aggregation upon FcγRIIa stimulation. Human platelets possess only one Fc γ receptor for immunoglobulin G (FcγRIIa), which is a 40-kDa single-chain transmembrane glycoprotein also present in monocytes, neutrophils, and B lymphocytes (1Rosenfeld S.I. Looney R.J. Leddy J.P. Phipps D.C. Abraham G.N. Anderson C.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In platelets, clustering of FcγRIIa induces shape change, secretion, and aggregation, which are typical physiological responses required for efficient hemostatic function of these cells (2Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This activating signal contributes to the rapid destruction of platelets during heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and in some autoimmune diseases (3KappersKlunne M.C. Boon D.M.S. Hop W.C.J. Michiels J.J. Stibbe J. vanderZwaan C. Koudstaal P.J. vanVliet H.H.D.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Newman P.M. Chong B.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FcγRIIa-mediated signaling pathway implicates the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which presents an amino acid sequence called Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM). 1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; FcγRIIa, Fc γ receptor for immunoglobulin G; GPVI, glycoprotein VI; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; LAT, linker for activation of T cell; PLC, phospholipase C; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; SH2, Src homology 2; Inh, inhibitor; IP, immunoprecipitate. Mouse platelets lack this receptor but develop a similar signaling pathway downstream the glycoprotein VI (GPVI), also present in human platelets. Upon clustering, GPVI recruits and requires the Fc γ-chain sharing a strong homology with the human FcγRIIa receptor (5Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. Vanvugt M.J. Vandewinkel J.G.J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 6Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In human platelets, upon FcγRIIa receptor cross-linking, the tyrosine residues within the ITAM motif are rapidly phosphorylated and become docking sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (7Ibarrola I. Vossebeld P.J.M. Homburg C.H.E. Thelen M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Activated GPVI is coupled with the Fc-γ-chain protein, which contains the similar ITAM motif. The phosphorylation of ITAM appears to be mediated by the Src-related kinases p59Fyn and p56Lyn and allows the recruitment and the activation of the p72Syk kinase and subsequently the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2) (8Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the links between Src kinases, Syk, and PLCγ2 are not clearly established in platelets and likely involve adaptor molecules. Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT), a transmembrane 36–38-kDa adaptor protein essential for T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, is also present in platelets (9Gross B.S. Melford S.K. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In T-cells, LAT is tyrosine-phosphorylated after TCR stimulation by the Syk-related kinase ZAP 70 (10Zhang W.G. Sloanlancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and contains in its intracellular part five optimal binding sequences for linking to SH2 domains containing proteins. In T-lymphocyte, numerous signaling molecules have been shown to associate with phosphorylated LAT, including PLCγ1, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI 3)-kinase, Grb2, and SLP76 (11Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In platelets, LAT is strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of GPVI clustering by collagen or convulxin stimulation. Several signaling proteins, including the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and PLCγ2, have been shown to interact with phosphorylated LAT in platelets (9Gross B.S. Melford S.K. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Gibbins J.M. Briddon S. Shutes A. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Watson S.P. J. Biol.

McGlade C.J. Schraven B. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33427-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In collagen-stimulated platelets, the signaling complexes recruited by tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT are essential for PLCγ2 activation (14Pasquet J.M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation level of proteins is the result of a controlled balance between protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The mechanisms involved in protein dephosphorylation are still poorly known in platelets. Until now, no transmembrane PTP has been described at the platelet surface but three cytosolic PTPs have already been identified in these cells (SHP-1, SHP-2, and PTP1B) (15Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11927-11934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SHP-1, a PTP containing two SH2 domains in its N terminus, is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it is often implicated in the negative regulation of a number of membrane receptors (18Adachi M. Fischer E.H. Ihle J. Imai K. Jirik F. Neel B. Pawson T. Shen S.H. Thomas M. Ullrich A. Zhao Z.Z. Cell. 1996; 85: 15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is rapidly phosphorylated and translocated to the platelet cytoskeleton upon thrombin stimulation (17Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Rendu F. Bachelot C. Falet H. Platelets. 1996; 7 (361): 361Google Scholar). However, the role of SHP-1 in platelet functions is still unclear. SHP-2, another SH2 domain-containing PTP, is associated with the receptor PECAM 1 (CD31) in platelets and could be involved in the signaling pathway initiated by this adhesion molecule (21Edmead C.E. Crosby D.A. Southcott M. Poole A.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Cicmil M. Thomas J.M. Leduc M. Bon C. Gibbins J.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The 50-kDa PTP1B has also been described in human platelets (16Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In these cells, the amount of PTP1B is about 0.2% of total detergent-soluble proteins, a level comparable with that of pp60Src kinase. In resting platelets, the full-length PTP1B tightly associates with the endoplasmic reticulum via its C-terminal 35 amino acids (23Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). When platelets are activated by thrombin, PTP1B undergoes a proteolytic cleavage in a region between its catalytic domain and its membrane-anchoring C-terminal targeting sequence. This process is dependent on integrin engagement and platelet aggregation and leads to enzymatic activation of PTP1B (16Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In other cells such as fibroblasts, PTP1B plays an important role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading (24Arregui C.O. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that PTP1B can dephosphorylate p130Cas, suggesting that it might have a regulatory role in mitogen-mediated signal transduction pathway via integrin (26Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase pp60c-src has also been identified as a good substrate of PTP1B leading to an activation of this kinase (27Bjorge J.D. Pang A. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41439-41446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recently, a critical role for PTP1B in the negative regulation of insulin signaling has been well documented (28Dadke S. Kusari J. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PTP1B appears as the major PTP responsible for insulin receptor regulation (29Goldstein B.J. Bittner-Kowalczyk A. White M.F. Harbeck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4283-4289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 30Mahadev K. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21938-21942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTP1B inhibitors may become new drugs for type 2 diabetes treatment (31Johnson T.O. Ermolieff J. Jirousek M.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 32Tobin J.F. Tam S. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2002; 5: 500-512PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets, the substrate and the role of PTP1B are still unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the tight control of LAT adaptor protein dephosphorylation in platelets activated by FcγRIIa clustering. We found that the adaptor LAT, for which phosphorylation appeared transient in this signaling cascade, was actually one of the PTP1B substrates. Indeed, our results demonstrate that LAT dephosphorylation requires PTP1B activation via calpains downstream of αIIb/β3 integrin engagement. Our data suggest a role of PTP1B in the coordination of signaling processes leading to irreversible platelet aggregation through dephosphorylation of proteins such as LAT. Reagents, Antibodies, and Fusion Proteins—The anti-FcγRIIa monoclonal antibody (mAb IV.3), the monoclonal PTP1B antibody, the polyclonal Src family kinase antibody (SRC-2), and the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The specific F(ab′)2 fragment was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from Eurogentec. The fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (ALEXA 488) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (ALEXA 594) were from Molecular Probe. Convulxin was purified from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus as previously described (33Francischetti I.M. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Poly-(Glu4-Tyr1)n, calpains inh1, RGDS, and other chemical products were from Sigma. The phosphatase inhibitor PTP InhI was from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ni-ProBond resin was from Invitrogen. GST·LAT cDNA was generated by inserting the cytosolic domain of LAT containing amino acid 18–255 obtained by RT-PCR from megacaryocytic DAMI cells into pGEX-KG vector. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads using Amersham Biosciences instructions. Rabbit anti-LAT antibody was produced in our laboratory by immunizing rabbit with this GST·LAT fusion protein. The full-length human cDNA (GST·PTP1B), containing a Cys215 to Ser mutation (GST·PTP1B C215S) was a gift from Dr. J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). The full-length cDNA construct PTP1B (D181A) obtained from Dr. N. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) was subcloned in pTAT-HA-His vector (34Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) as a NcoI/EcoR1 fragment. Isolation of TAT fusion protein was realized after sonication of bacteria in 8 m urea HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl buffer, 20 mm imidazole; the clarified sonicate was applied to Ni-ProBond resin. TAT fusion protein elution was performed by the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. Detection of the TAT·HA-His PTP1B (D181A) fusion protein was performed by Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-PTP1B antibodies. Quantification of the purified protein was done by BIO-RAD protein assay system. Platelet Preparation and Stimulation—Human blood platelet concentrates were obtained from the local blood bank (Etablissement de transfusion Sanguine, Toulouse, France). Platelet preparation and FcγRIIa cross-linking were performed as previously described (35Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24314-24321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation was measured at 37 °C by a turbidimetric method in a dual-channel aggregometer (Payton Associates, Scarborough, Ontario, Canada). In some experiments, platelets were not shacked. To test the effect of inhibitors on LAT tyrosine phosphorylation, platelet suspensions (1 × 109 platelets/ml) were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C with 500 μm RGDS or 10 μm calpains inh1. In some experiments, the phosphatase inhibitor (PTP InhI) was added at 12.5 μm final concentration on platelet suspensions after the indicated time of stimulation. To test the effect of PTP1B substrate trapping, 10 μg of TAT·HA-His-PTP1B (D181A) fusion protein were added to 500 μl of platelets, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min before stimulation. Mouse platelets were prepared according to the following protocol: C57/Bl6 animals were anesthetized with a mix of Imalgene (ketamine) Rompun, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture using heparin (100 units/ml) as anticoagulant. Pooled blood was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 8 min at 22 °C, and platelet-rich plasma was removed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 8 min at 22 °C. The platelet pellet was washed twice in tyrode's buffer (134 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.34 mm NaH2PO4,20mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2,5mm glucose) and finally suspended in the same buffer at the density of 8 × 108 platelets/ml. Stimulations of mouse platelets were carried out with 5 nm convulxin at 37 °C under stirring conditions. Isolation of Platelet Cytoskeleton—500 μl of human platelets (1 × 109 cells/ml) were activated by FcγRIIA cross-linking for indicated times; stimulation was stopped by addition of cytoskeleton buffer (CSK) to give a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 1% TritonX-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and 10 min at 4 °C under shaking. Cytoskeletal material was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed three times with CSK buffer. Cytoskeletal proteins were sonicated three times for 10 s in Lammeli sample buffer and then submitted to Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—500 μl of 1 × 109/ml resting or stimulated platelets were lysed in RIPA buffer at final concentrations of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 4 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. 5 μg of the indicated antibody was added to the clarified lysate in a final volume of 750 μl and placed on a rocking platform for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by adding 35 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence lighting system. For re-immunoprecipitation technique, the first immunoprecipitate (IP-PTP1B) obtained from control or 5-min-stimulated platelets was incubated with 60 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS) and boiled for 2 min. The final volume was brought to 1.5 ml by the addition of RIPA buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and a second IP was performed with LAT antibody. In some experiments TAT·HA-PTP1B (D181A) treated or non-treated human platelets were subjected to HA immunoprecipitation as described above and analyzed by Western blot using polyclonal anti-Src kinases antibody (SRC-2). Binding Assays Using GST Fusion Proteins—For LAT re-immunoprecipitation from PTP1B (C215S) pulldown complex, 500 μl of platelet suspension (5 × 108) were stimulated for 5 min in the absence or in the presence of 12.5 μm PTP InhI added 1 min after FcγRIIa cross-linking. The reaction was stopped by 250 μl of 3× RIPA buffer, and the clarified lysate was incubated with GST·PTP1B (C215S) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, and the protein complexes from pulldown assay were denatured by addition of 60 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS) and boiled for 2 min. The final volume was brought to 1.5 ml by the addition of RIPA buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation was performed with 4G10 antibody followed by Western blotting using LAT antibody. Immune Complex Protein Phosphatase Assay and in Vitro LAT Dephosphorylation—Enzymatic activity of PTP1B in platelets was determined using paranitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. PTP1B immune complexes were washed twice with PTP assay buffer (62 mm HEPES, pH.5, 6.25 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with 25 mm final concentration of paranitrophenyl phosphate for 30 min at 30 °C under shaking. Reactions were terminated by adding 800 μl of 1N NaOH. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min, optical density of supernatants was measured at 410 nm. For LAT dephosphorylation in vitro, LAT immunoprecipitation was performed from platelets after 1 min of FcγRIIa stimulation as described above. PTP1B immune complex was realized at 5 min stimulation. The dephosphorylation reaction was performed by mixing the two washed immune complexes in 50 μlof the same buffer. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C under shaking, the reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer and detection of the phosphoproteins was performed by SDS-PAGE, followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. In-gel Phosphatase Assay—These experiments were performed according to the procedure of Burridge and Nelson (36Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 2 mg of poly(Glu4-Tyr1)n were phosphorylated by incubation overnight at 30 °C with pp60c-src kinase immunoprecipitated from thrombin-activated platelets and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C (13,000 rpm; 5 min). The supernatant of agarose beads was mixed with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, labeled poly(Glu-Tyr) was sedimented. The precipitate was dissolved in 200 μl of Tris buffer 0.75 m, pH 8.8, and incorporated in SDS-polyacrylamide running gel prior to polymerization at ∼106 cpm/ml. Platelet lysates or LAT immunoprecipitates were submitted to SDS-PAGE according to the standard protocol. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Resting human platelets were incubated or not with TAT·HA-PTP1B (D181A) fusion protein as described above. Platelets were allowed to adhere on fibrinogen-coated coverslips at the concentration of 100 μg/ml during 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with formalde-hyde 3%, 30 min at room temperature. Then they were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific sites were saturated with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Platelets were incubated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody mixed with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Slides were examined under a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 510, Axiovert 100) using immersion objective ×63. The Rapid Tyrosine Phosphorylation of LAT Is Followed by an Integrin-mediated Dephosphorylation in FcγRIIa-stimulated Platelets—FcγRIIa cross-linking led to a rapid LAT phosphorylation reaching a maximum at 1 min, followed by a dephosphorylation that was complete after 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 1A). When platelet aggregation was prevented by the absence of shaking during stimulation (Fig. 1B) or by cell preincubation with RGDS peptide (Fig. 1C), we observed a sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT. In some, but not all, experiments, a small delay in LAT phosphorylation was observed in non-shaking conditions of stimulation (Fig. 1B). Overall, these data indicate that the phosphorylation of LAT did not require platelet aggregation and integrin engagement, whereas its dephosphorylation was strongly dependent on these processes. Because calpains have been shown to regulate some tyrosine dephosphorylation events downstream of integrins in platelets, we investigated the effect of a calpains inhibitor (calpains inh1) on LAT phosphorylation status. As shown in Fig. 1D, LAT dephosphorylation was partly inhibited by this inhibitor, suggesting an implication of calpains-regulated PTPs downstream of integrin in this mechanism. PTP1B Is Activated in Human Platelets upon FcγRIIa Cross-linking—To investigate the PTPs involved in LAT dephosphorylation in human platelets via FcγRIIa cross-linking, lysates obtained from resting or stimulated platelets were submitted to an In-gel phosphatase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2A shows that resting platelets developed two basal PTP activities at 50 and 42 kDa. After 3 min of FcγRIIa cross-linking, the level of phosphatase activity of the 42-kDa species strongly increased with the appearance of several new bands detected at a molecular mass between 40 and 55 kDa. Some other PTPs presenting higher molecular mass were also detected during platelet aggregation with modest activation level (data not shown). Moreover, experiments performed with RGDS preincubated platelets show that the increase in the 42-kDa species at 5 min of stimulation was blocked, indicating a crucial role of integrins in this PTP activation. As expected, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (PTP InhI) inhibited this enzymatic activation. The proteins detected in the In-gel phosphatase assay at about 40 and 50 kDa could be the active fragment of PTP1B and its full-length, respectively. To determine the identity of these proteins, we performed immunodepletion of the whole lysates obtained from 5-min-stimulated platelets. As shown in Fig. 2B, the supernatant of PTP1B immunoprecipitate (lane 2) exhibited only a weak phosphatase activity at 42 kDa and a significant decrease at 50 kDa (about 50%), indicating that these two bands corresponded to the two forms of PTP1B present in stimulated platelets. Moreover, Fig. 2C shows that, under basal conditions, PTP1B was essentially present as a full-length 50-kDa protein, whereas 3 min after FcγRIIa cross-linking, the truncated form of PTP1B (42 kDa) was generated. This cleavage decreased when platelets were preincubated with a calpains inhibitor (calpains inh1), suggesting that calpains catalyzed PTP1B proteolysis in FcγRIIa-stimulated platelets. Because some enzymes refold better than others, In-gel phosphatase assay is not always appropriate to quantify a specific PTP activity. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated PTP1B from platelet lysates and measured its activity by an in vitro phosphatase assay using paranitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. PTP1B developed a 2.3-fold increase in enzymatic activity after 5 min of platelet stimulation (Fig. 2D). Moreover, pretreatment of cells with RGDS totally prevented integrin-induced PTP1B cleavage (not shown) and decreased the activity detected in PTP1B immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that αIIb/β3 integrin and calpains pathway regulate the cleavage of PTP1B and modulate its global activity measured in vitro in human platelets stimulated by FcγRIIa cross-linking, as previously observed in thrombin-activated platelets (16Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in cell physiology, and numerous signaling proteins have been found to associate with this cellular compartment after platelet aggregation (17Li R.Y.

As shown in Fig. 3, LAT associated with the cytoskeleton fraction upon FcγRIIa-mediated platelet activation. This association reached a maximum at 2 min and persisted until 5 min. Interestingly, PTP1B was found in the same compartment after 2 min of stimulation. The co-localization of LAT and PTP1B in the platelet cytoskeleton correlated with the time course of LAT dephosphorylation, suggesting that PTP1B could dephosphorylate LAT in this cell compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2076346475,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein EB2 (also called Mta, SM, or BMLF1) has properties in common with mRNA export factors and is essential for the production of EBV infectious virions. However, to date no RNA-binding motif essential for EB2-mediated mRNA export has been located in the protein. We show here by Northwestern blot analysis that the EB2 protein purified from mammalian cells binds directly to RNA. Furthermore, using overlapping glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EB2 peptides, we have, by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSAs) and Northwestern blotting, located an RNA-binding motif in a 33-amino acid segment of EB2 that has structural features of the arginine-rich RNA-binding motifs (ARMs) also found in many RNA-binding proteins. A synthetic peptide (called Da), which contains this EB2 ARM, bound RNA in REMSA. A GST-Da fusion protein also bound RNA in REMSA without apparent RNA sequence specificity, because ∼10 GST-Da molecules bound at multiple sites on a 180-nucleotide RNA fragment. Importantly, a short deletion in the ARM region impaired both EB2 binding to RNA in vivo and in vitro and EB2-mediated mRNA export without affecting the shuttling of EB2 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, ectopic expression of ARM-deleted EB2 did not rescue the production of infectious virions by 293 cells carrying an EBVΔEB2 genome, which suggests that the binding of EB2 to RNA plays an essential role in the EBV productive cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2069472658,"The Bacillus subtilis AT (anti-TRAP) protein inhibits the regulatory protein TRAP (trp RNA-binding attenuation protein), thereby eliminating transcription termination in the leader region of the trp operon. Transcription of the AT operon is activated by uncharged tryptophan transfer RNA (tRNATrp). Here we show that translation of AT also is regulated by uncharged tRNATrp. A 10-residue coding region containing three consecutive tryptophan codons is located immediately preceding the AT structural gene. Completion of translation of this coding region inhibits AT synthesis, whereas incomplete translation increases AT production. Tandem sensing of uncharged tRNATrp therefore regulates synthesis of AT, which in turn regulates TRAP's ability to inhibit trp operon expression."
https://openalex.org/W2049847760,"Ena/VASP proteins are implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization during actin-dependent motility processes. Recruitment to subcellular sites of actin polymerization is mediated by the highly conserved N-terminal EVH1 domain, which interacts with target proteins containing proline-rich motifs. The VASP EVH1 domain specifically binds peptides with the consensus motif FPPPP present in all its binding partners, including the Listerial ActA protein. Previous studies have shown that the Phe and first and final Pro residues are highly conserved and cannot be substituted with any other natural amino acid without significant loss of binding affinity. We have incorporated peptoid building blocks (sarcosine derived, non-natural amino acids) into the peptide SFEFPPPPTEDEL from the Listerial ActA protein and were able to substitute the most highly conserved residues of this motif while maintaining binding to the VASP EVH1 domain with affinities in the range of 45-180 μm. We then used NMR chemical shift perturbations to locate specific domain residues involved in particular interactions. These studies may open up the way for designing selective modulators of VASP function for biological studies and for the development of novel therapeutics for diseases involving pathologically altered cell adhesion or cell motility.

Low affinity, protein-protein interactions mediated by proline-rich motifs (PRMs), 1The abbreviations used are: PRM, proline-rich motif; DIC, diisopropylcarbodiimide; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HOBT, hydroxybenzotriazole; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation (spectroscopy); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CSP, chemical shift perturbation; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. and PRM-binding domains are becoming increasingly recognized as important players in signal transduction pathways (1Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 2Kay B.K.P. Williamson M. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Well known examples include the interactions of Src homology 3 (SH3)-, WW-, and Ena-VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domains with targets containing PxxP, PPx(Y/P)LPP, and FPxφP motifs, respectively, which typically bind with affinities in the range of 5-100 μm. Finely tuned interactions of this type are vital for the accurate regulation of important signal transduction processes involved in proliferation, migration, or differentiation of cells in the adult organism or during its development. The high degree of conservation found in the target PRMs can be rationalized on the basis of high resolution structural data now available for many of these complexes. Proline is the only natural N-substituted amino acid, and its unusual backbone structure gives rise to a unique mechanism for highly specific recognition (3Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The low affinities often involved make protein-protein interaction modules difficult targets for drug design. However, the importance of these interactions has already triggered several attempts to overcome the principal problems involved in designing ligands for protein surfaces (4Kuruvilla F.G. Shamji A.F. Sternson S.M. Hergenrother P.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 2002; 416: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Ena/VASP proteins are important components of signaling cascades that modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics in response to extracellular stimuli (5Harbeck B. Huttelmaier S. Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30817-30825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). They are involved in various cellular and subcellular actin-based motility processes that are dependent on highly organized, transient, microfilament networks that lead to the formation of plasma membrane protrusions such as lamellipodia or filopodia and have also been found to be crucial for supporting intracellular motility of the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (6Renfranz P.J. Beckerle M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 88-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, Ena/VASP proteins are thought to promote local actin filament growth either by recruitment of polymerization-competent profilactin to Ena/VASP-binding proteins or by steric exclusion of polymerization-inhibiting actin-binding proteins from growing actin filament ends (for review see Refs. 7Cameron L.A.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4721-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ena/VASP proteins are known to be involved in a diverse range of activities, including formation of epithelial sheets, spreading and aggregation of thrombocytes, migration of fibroblasts or neurons, and polarization of lymphocytes or macrophages, as well as being essential for the virulence and cell to cell spreading of Listeria. Recruitment of Ena/VASP proteins to subcellular sites of actin polymerization is mediated by their conserved, N-terminally located EVH1 domain via interactions with target proteins containing PRMs (9Reinhard M.

Because the three-dimensional structure of the EVH1 domains of several Ena/VASP proteins are now known (20Prehoda K.E. Lee D.J. Lim W.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), this opens the way for the rational design of modulators which would act by binding specifically to the EVH1 domain. Small-molecule modulators of Ena/VASP proteins, delivered to cells in a dose-dependent manner, could then be used to obtain valuable information complementary to genetic knockout data (4Kuruvilla F.G.

Shokat K.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such inhibitors would be useful in a number of different ways: (i) to selectively inhibit the interaction of EVH1 domains with their natural ligands, allowing controlled and detailed studies of EVH1-mediated signaling events; (ii) in appropriately modified forms, as molecular tags to monitor the localization, distribution, and rates of formation/dissociation of EVH1-mediated interactions within the cell; and (iii) as potential precursors/lead molecules in the development of future generations of novel therapeutics for treatment of diseases where partial inhibition of EVH1-mediated events would be desirable (for example, in modulating pathologically altered cell adhesion or cell motility in inflammatory and metastatic diseased states and in combating virulence of intracellular pathogens). Here we make use of the available high resolution structural data on complexes of several EVH1 domains with peptides containing FPxφP motifs to guide the design of novel EVH1 inhibitors. Specifically, we decided to take advantage of ActA peptides to derive VASP EVH1 inhibitors. The Listerial surface protein, ActA, was found to be singularly necessary for VASP recruitment even in the presence of native VASP binding partners (13Drees B. Friederich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although ActA contains four tandem repeats of short sequences containing the FPxφP motif, each capable individually of binding to one EVH1 domain (27Machner M.P. Urbanke C. Barzik M. Otten S.

We therefore used derivatives of this peptide for our studies. Our previous work in vitro showed that the proline residues at positions Pro5 and Pro8 were absolutely necessary for EVH1 domain binding (22Ball L.J. Kühne R. Hoffmann B. Häffner A. Schmieder P.

When either of these prolines was replaced by any other natural amino acid, complete loss of VASP EVH1-binding affinity was observed in almost every case. The high resolution structures of the EVH1 domains from Mena, Evl, and VASP proteins, in complex with FPXφP-containing peptides (20Prehoda K.E. Lee D.J. Lim W.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), showed that this conservation was due to the highly efficient packing of the N-substituted Pro5 and Pro8 pyrrolidine rings into hydrophobic grooves between a small cluster of closely spaced, aromatic side chains on the EVH1 domain surface (22Ball L.J. Kühne R. Hoffmann B. Häffner A. Schmieder P. Volkmer-Engert R. Hof M. Wahl M. Schneider-Mergener J. Walter U. Oschkinat H. Jarchau T.

Our first aim was therefore to study the effects of replacing these prolines with alternative N-substituted amino acid peptoid building blocks that would maintain the required N-substituted backbone structure. Previous workers used alternative N-substituted amino acids in place of prolines to create a number of peptomers for both SH3 and WW domains with affinities comparable to the natural peptides (3Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 4Kuruvilla F.G. Shamji A.F. Sternson S.M. Hergenrother P.J. Schreiber S.L.

We applied a similar approach to the study of EVH1-domain:peptide interactions to help us to understand more about the specific roles of the conserved prolines in EVH1-recognition and to what extent variations in this N-substituted side chain can be tolerated at these sites. We also identified other conserved residues in positions flanking the FPxφP core motif using the SPOT method (30Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The effects of non-natural amino acid substitution at these positions was then also investigated. Preparation of the VASP EVH1 Domain; VASP-(1-115)—The DNA sequence of VASP-(1-115) was cloned into the plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Protein for SPOT scans was expressed in 2× YT medium (16 g of bactotryptone (Difco), 10 g of bacto yeast extract (Difco), 5 g of NaCl in 1 liter, 2% glucose, 10 μg/ml ampicillin) and purified as described previously (22Ball L.J.

Uniformly 15N-labeled VASP (1-115) for NMR titrations, was expressed in an MOPS minimal medium (31Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J.

The peptide building blocks were synthesized according to the standard SPOT synthesis protocols (30Frank R.

Peptoid building block 1, sarcosine, was used in the Fmoc-protected form and treated in the chemical synthesis like proline, not as a peptoid building block. Reactions were monitored by bromphenol blue staining of membranes after each Fmoc deprotection step. Screening of the Peptomer Array—The membrane was soaked in methanol and washed twice with 50 ml of methanol, three times with 50 ml of TBS (prepared from a 10× solution comprising 80 g of NaCl, 2 g of KCl, and 61 g of Tris in 1 liter of water and adjusted to pH 8.0), and blocked with blocking reagent overnight (5 ml of blocking buffer from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany, 5 ml of TBS, 250 μl of Tween 20 (10% in water), and 2.5 g of saccharose in 50 ml of MilliQ water). The membrane was then washed once with 50 ml of T-TBS (TBS plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (added from a 10% (v/v) solution in water)) and incubated with a solution of GST-VASP EVH1 (50 μm in TBS) for 3 h. Following incubation the membrane was washed three times with 50 ml of TBS and incubated for a further 2 h with a monoclonal rabbit GST antibody (Sigma). After further washing with 50 ml of TBS, the membrane was then incubated for 0.5 h with the second anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-labeled antibody (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Analysis and quantification of binding was carried out using a chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) and LumiImagerTM (Roche Diagnostics). Images were processed using the program CorelDraw. Larger Scale Peptomer Synthesis—For the larger scale preparation (several milligrams) of each peptomer, syntheses were carried out in parallel on an Abimed AMS 422 multiple peptide synthesizer. A microtiter plate with 96 wells was used. Each well was filled with 20 mg of TentaGel S RAM resin from Rapp Polymere, Germany (the resin had a derivatization degree of 0.25 mmol/g) suspended in a 3:7 mixture of dimethylacetamide:dichloromethane. To obtain sufficient yields for our studies, 8 wells were used for each of the desired peptomers, giving a maximum theoretical yield of 40 μmol for each peptomer. For chain elongation with natural peptide residues, Fmoc-protected amino acids with free carboxyl groups were used, and coupling was achieved with standard DIC/HOBT chemistry. Chain elongation with N-substituted peptoid residues was achieved by reacting the free amine-groups first with bromoacetic acid-dinitrophenylester and then with the desired primary amine. For coupling of the residue N-terminal to a peptoid residue, the amino acids to be added were pre-activated as anhydrides with 0.5 eq of DIC as described in the literature (36Ast T. Heine N. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Wenschuh H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 4317-4318Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the complete peptomers from the resin, as well as cleavage of side-chain protecting groups, was achieved by adding 500 μl of a solution of 1% (w/v) phenol, 2% (v/v) water, 5% (v/v) dichloromethane, and 3% (v/v) triisobutylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid to each well. The eight separate reaction vessels for each compound were pooled and diluted with a hundred times excess of cold diethylether to facilitate precipitation of the reaction product. The suspensions were centrifuged with a Heraeus Megafuge 1.0 R, using a BS4402/A rotor at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in cold ether. This procedure was repeated three times. All peptomers were analyzed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography on an analytical Vydac C18 column using a linear gradient of 5-60% acetonitrile:water (0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) for 20 min at 1.2 ml/min flow rate (detection at 214 nm) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix (LaserTec BenchTop II mass spectrometer, PE Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography on a preparative Vydac C18 column if necessary. Biacore Measurements—Biacore measurements were carried out on a Biacore system using CM5 chips. VASP-(1-115) was coupled to the chip using standard protocols provided by the manufacturer, at pH 3.0 in 10 mm glycine buffer. Putative ligands were measured in seven steps, at concentrations: 15.625 μm, 31.25 μm, 62.5 μm, 125.0 μm, 250.0 μm, 500.0 μm, and 1 mm. Compounds were dissolved in standard Biacore HBS-EP buffer, containing 0.01 m HEPES, 015 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% polysorbate 20 (v/v) at pH 7.4. Binding curves were fitted using the program Origin 5.0 by Microcal. NMR Titrations—NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K, using a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer in standard configuration, with a triple resonance probe equipped with triple axis self-shielded gradient coils. Uniformly 15N-labeled VASP EVH1 in phosphate buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm NaN3, 10% D2O; pH 6.0) was used at a concentration of 0.1 mm. Peptomers were dissolved in the same buffer (with the pH adjusted to 6.0 before titrations) and added stepwise to the protein samples. After each addition of ligand, a 15N-HSQC spectrum with eight scans was recorded. Measurements of K D were all calculated from CSPs of the EVH1 domain residue Ala75, which showed large perturbations in response to all ligands titrated in this work. Data were processed using the XWIN-NMR program (version 2.6) of Bruker Analytik GmbH (Rheinstetten, Germany) and the AZARA program (version 2.1) of W. Boucher. Assignment was carried out on Silicon Graphics O2 workstations, using the interactive program ANSIG 3.3 (37Kraulis P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 38Kraulis P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 24: 627-633Google Scholar). AZARA and ANSIG are both available by anonymous file transfer protocol from ftp.bio.cam.ac.uk in the directory ftp/pub. Modeling of Complexes of VASP EVH1 with Peptomers—Complexes of the VASP EVH1 domain with peptomer ligands were modeled in a 250-ps molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K using Amber 5.0 (39Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. III T.E.C. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Amber 5. 5th ed. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). Simulations were performed under periodic boundary conditions using explicit water molecules. The periodic boundary conditions box was equilibrated by using constant pressure dynamics. The use of the SHAKE option constraining all heavy atom-hydrogen bond lengths allowed a step width of 2 fs. The non-bonded cutoff was set to 12 Å, and the non-bonded pair list was updated every 10 fs. During the calculation only those residues that showed CSPs greater than 0.1 ppm were allowed to move. The starting structure for each complex was obtained by docking of the FPXφP motif of the peptide onto the EVH1 domain surface with the same contacts as reported in the crystal structure of Mena EVH1 (20Prehoda K.E. Lee D.J. Lim W.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The structures of the complexes after 250 ps were minimized until a root mean square deviation gradient of 0.005 was reached. The AMBER program package is available from www.amber.ucsf.edu/amber/amber.html. We have shown previously that substitution of either of the proline residues at positions 5 or 8 in the ActA peptide 1SFEFPPPPTEDEL13 by any other natural amino acid results in loss of EVH1 binding (22Ball L.J. Kühne R. Hoffmann B. Häffner A. Schmieder P. Volkmer-Engert R. Hof M. Wahl M. Schneider-Mergener J. Walter U. Oschkinat H. Jarchau T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, by replacing these prolines with non-natural N-substituted peptoid building blocks, we found it was possible to create peptomer ligands that maintained moderate EVH1-binding affinities (90-400 μm) comparable to some of the natural ligands (20-400 μm). Fig. 1a shows a 13-residue sequence from the third ActA repeat, which we used as the starting point for our studies. The most highly conserved residues of this peptide, Phe4, Pro5, Pro8, and Leu13, as identified from previous SPOT amino acid substitution scans (22Ball L.J. Kühne R. Hoffmann B. Häffner A. Schmieder P. Volkmer-Engert R. Hof M. Wahl M. Schneider-Mergener J. Walter U. Oschkinat H. Jarchau T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (shaded in the figure) were chosen for substitution analysis by N-substituted peptoids (Fig. 1b). In addition, the two very highly conserved prolines were investigated simultaneously using double substitution analysis (Fig. 1c). Single Amino Acid Substitutions—To study the effects of single substitutions (Fig. 1b), each of the abovementioned residues were substituted in turn against the 24 commercially available peptoid building blocks shown in Table I, whereas all other residues were left unchanged (see Fig. 1a). The amino group of the new substituent is in each case incorporated into the peptide backbone producing a sarcosine-derived structure for substituted residues. The row labeled “WT” shows the binding of the native ActA peptide as a control.Table IStructures of the 24 primary amines used in the SPOT synthesis and the following solid-phase synthesis of peptomers Substitution of the FPxφP-core-flanking position Leu13 with these peptoid building blocks lead only to very weak spots on the membrane, indicating the importance of leucine at this position. Single substitutions of Phe4 for peptoid building block 7 (see Table I), Pro5 for peptoid building blocks 4, 7-10, and 21, and Pro8 for peptoid building blocks 4, 7-10, 14, and 23, all produced peptomers that bound to the VASP EVH1 domain. It is clear from our previous work and that of others, that a large aromatic side chain, Phe or Trp, at position 4 is essential for EVH1 binding (19Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E.

This can be rationalized by the structural data available for EVH1 complexes that show that a large, flat side chain at this Ca position is required in the peptide to intercalate the exposed aromatic side chains (Tyr16, Trp23, Phe79; VASP numbering) of the VASP EVH1 domain surface (20Prehoda K.E.

https://openalex.org/W2139508266,"Abstract Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ddb1 is homologous to the mammalian DDB1 protein, which has been implicated in damaged-DNA recognition and global genomic repair. However, a recent study suggested that the S. pombe Ddb1 is involved in cell division and chromosomal segregation. Here, we provide evidence that the S. pombe Ddb1 is functionally linked to the replication checkpoint control gene cds1. We show that the S. pombe strain lacking ddb1 has slow growth due to delayed replication progression. Flow cytometric analysis shows an extensive heterogeneity in DNA content. Furthermore, the Δddb1 strain is hypersensitive to UV irradiation in S phase and is unable to tolerate a prolonged replication block imposed by hydroxyurea. Interestingly, the Δddb1 strain exhibits a high level of the Cds1 kinase activity during passage through S phase. Moreover, mutation of the cds1 gene relieves the defects observed in Δddb1 strain. The results suggest that many of the defects observed in Δddb1 cells are linked to an aberrant activation of Cds1, and that Ddb1 is functionally linked to Cds1."
https://openalex.org/W2030468904,"The low affinity Na+/sulfate cotransporter, NaSi-1, belongs to the SLC13 family that also includes the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporters, NaDC. Two serine residues in hNaSi-1, at positions 260 and 288, are conserved in all of the sulfate transporters in the family whereas the NaDC contain alanine or threonine at those positions. Therefore, the functional roles of serines 260 and 288 in substrate and cation binding by hNaSi-1 were investigated. These two serine residues were first mutated to alanine and the mutants were characterized in Xenopus oocytes. Alanine substitution of Ser-260 resulted in increased Km values for both substrate and Na+ whereas alanine replacement at Ser-288 resulted in a broadened cation selectivity, indicating that these two serines might play important roles in cation and/or substrate binding of hNaSi-1. The two serines and 12 surrounding residues were further mutated to cysteine and studied using a thiol-reactive compound, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methane-thiosulfonate (MTSET). Four mutants surrounding Ser-260 (T257C, T259C, T261C, and L263C) were sensitive to MTSET inhibition. The sensitivity to MTSET was dependent on the presence of substrate, suggesting that the accessibility of these substituted cysteines depends on the conformational state of the transporter. Because the four residues are located in transmembrane domain 5, this transmembrane domain is likely to participate in the conformational movements during the transport cycle of hNaSi-1.

Because the four residues are located in transmembrane domain 5, this transmembrane domain is likely to participate in the conformational movements during the transport cycle of hNaSi-1. Sulfate is an essential inorganic anion because of its involvement in many physiological and pathophysiological processes (1Beck L. Silve C. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 835-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Morris M.E. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The low affinity Na+/sulfate cotransporter from kidney, NaSi-1, reabsorbs sulfate across the luminal membrane of renal proximal tubule cells and plays an important role in maintaining sulfate homeostasis (3Markovich D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1499-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). NaSi-1 belongs to the SLC13 (Solute Carrier 13) gene family, which also includes the high affinity Na+/sulfate cotransporter (SUT-1) and the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporters (ex. NaDC-1-3) (4Pajor A.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The transport of sulfate by NaSi-1 is electrogenic involving the cotransport of 3 Na+ ions with one divalent sulfate anion (5Busch A.E. Waldegger S. Herzer T. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12407-12409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of NaSi-1 is relatively well characterized, there is little known about the structure or location of substrate and cation binding sites. The NaSi-1 transporters share about 43% sequence identity with NaDC-1 transporters, whose structure-function relationships have been studied in more detail. Previous chimera studies of rabbit NaDC-1 and rat NaSi-1 showed that the substrate recognition site of these two transporters is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein, from transmembrane domains (TMD) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methane-thiosulfonate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine. 5 to 11 (6Pajor A.M. Sun N. Bai L. Markovich D. Sule P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least one of the three Na+ binding sites in NaDC-1 is located close to the substrate-binding site in TMDs 7, 10, and 11 (7Kahn E.S. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Functionally important residues have been identified in TMDs 7, 8, and 9 of NaDC-1, and cysteine-scanning mutagenesis showed that TMD-9 may be involved in transducing conformational changes between the cation-binding sites and the substrate-binding site (8Griffith D.A.

In this study, the functional role of two serine residues in hNaSi-1 was investigated. Serines 260 and 288 are conserved in all of the sulfate transporters in the SLC13 superfamily, but the dicarboxylate transporters have alanine or threonine at those positions. Alanine replacement at Ser-260 resulted in increased Km values for both sulfate and Na+ whereas the S288A mutant had broadened cation selectivity, indicating that these two serine residues are important for cation and/or substrate binding. The residues surrounding Ser-260 are also functionally important residues. Four cysteine-substituted mutants surrounding Ser-260 (T257C, T259C, T263C, and L263C) were sensitive to [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methane-thiosulfonate (MTSET) inhibition, depending on the conformational state of the transporter. Sensitivity was greatest in the presence of Na+ and all four residues showed substrate protection. Since these residues are located near the extracellular face of TMD-5, the results suggest that TMD-5 is likely to move during the conformational changes associated with the transport cycle of hNaSi-1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutants in this study were prepared using the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis method of Kunkel (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The wild-type hNaSi-1 was used to prepare single-stranded DNA, 2Li, H., and Pajor, A.M. (2003) Am. J. Physiol., in press. which was rescued using M13K07 helper phage and then used as a template for mutagenesis using the Mutagene in vitro mutagenesis kit (BioRad), according to manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the mutants was verified by the Sealy Center for Molecular Science (University of Texas Medical Branch). Xenopus Oocyte Injections—The wild-type or mutant hNaSi-1 cDNA in pSPORT1 plasmid was linearized with XbaI, purified using RNase-free Chroma-spin 1000 columns (Clontech), and used as a template for in vitro cRNA transcription using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) (12Wu J. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cRNA was resuspended in RNase-free water to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. Stage V and VI oocytes were prepared from adult female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus I) and injected with 50 nl of cRNA the following day as described previously (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Oocytes were then stored at 18 °C in Barth's solution supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. 2Li, H., and Pajor, A.M. (2003) Am. J. Physiol., in press. The medium and culture vials were changed daily. Transport Measurements—Uptakes of [35S]sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were measured in Xenopus oocytes 3 or 4 days after cRNA injection as described previously.2 Each group of 5 oocytes was rinsed with room temperature choline buffer (in mm: 100 choline Cl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.5 using 1 m Tris). Uptakes were initiated by adding 0.4 ml of transport buffer containing [35S]sulfate in Na+ buffer (same as choline buffer with 100 mm NaCl in place of choline Cl). After 10- or 15-min incubation, 3× 4 ml ice-cold choline buffer were added to stop the reaction and wash the oocytes. Individual oocytes were dissolved in 0.25 ml of 10% SDS and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. For most of the experiments, sulfate uptakes in uninjected oocytes have been subtracted from uptakes in cRNA-injected oocytes. In kinetic experiments, 10-min uptakes were measured with increasing concentrations of sodium sulfate in the presence of 100 mm Na+. Previous experiments showed that uptakes of 1 mm sulfate by wild-type hNaSi-1 were linear to at least 60 min.2 The uptake rates were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation: v = V max × [S]/(Km + [S]), where [S] is the concentration of sulfate, V max is the maximum uptake rate and Km is the concentration of sulfate that produces 0.5V max. In Na+ activation experiments, 10-min sulfate uptakes (as the potassium salt) were measured with different concentrations of Na+, prepared by replacing Na+ with choline. The data were fitted to the Hill equation: ν = V max × [Na+] n /(K nNa + [Na+] n), where [Na+] is the concentration of Na+, K Na is the half-saturation constant for Na+ and n is the Hill coefficient. Data were fitted by non-linear regression to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS). For the cation selectivity experiments, uptakes of sulfate (potassium salt) in Li+, Cs+, K+, or choline buffer were measured by replacing 100 mm NaCl with 100 mm of LiCl, CsCl, KCl, or choline Cl while keeping other components in the buffer the same. For substrate specificity experiments, uptakes of 10 μm [35S]sulfate were measured in the absence or presence of 1 mm test inhibitors. Sulfate uptakes in the presence of inhibitors are presented as a percentage of uptakes in the absence of inhibitors. Statistical analysis with one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test was performed using SigmaStat software (Jandel, Version 1.0). MTSET Experiments—Oocytes were washed three times with room temperature choline buffer and then preincubated in [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methane-thiosulfonate (MTSET) in Na+ or choline buffer with or without 5 mm sulfate added. Control groups were preincubated in the same buffers without MTSET. The MTSET solution was prepared immediately prior to use. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, the MTSET solution was washed away with 4 × 4 ml washes of choline buffer. The uptake of 100 μm [35S]sulfate was measured as described above. The data are presented as a percentage of uptakes by oocytes preincubated in the absence of MTSET. MTSET is an irreversible inhibitor and the data were modeled according to reversible non-competitive inhibition, which resembles irreversible inhibition kinetically. The data were fitted to %i = (%i max × [I])/(IC50 + [I]), where %i is the % inhibition at a given inhibitor concentration, the %i max is the maximal percent inhibition, IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that produces half-maximal inhibition, and [I] is the concentration of inhibitor. Pseudo first-order rates of inactivation, k (in min–1 mm–1), were estimated from the IC50 values where 0.5 = e– t ×[IC50]× k where 0.5 represents 50% activity remaining after MTSET treatment and t is the time of MTSET incubation in minutes. Biotinylation of Oocytes and Western Blots—Oocytes were biotinylated using the membrane impermeant reagent, Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), and then precipitated with Immunopure Immobilized Streptavidin (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight as described previously.2 The biotinylated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% Tricine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell Inc.) (14Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1808-C1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were blocked with PBS-TM (PBS containing 0.5% Carnation instant dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight and then incubated for 2 h with 1:1000 dilution of primary antibodies in PBS-TM at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS-TM. The primary antibodies recognize a 65 amino acid peptide of hNaSi-1.2 The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG from donkey (Amersham Biosciences), was diluted to 1:5000 in PBS-TM and applied to the blots at room temperature for 1 h, and then the blots were washed three times with PBS. Immunoreactive protein signals were detected using the Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Pierce) and images were acquired using a Kodak Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Company) with 6 captures of 5 min to prevent saturation of the image. The mass of hNaSi-1 was estimated by comparison with chemiluminescent protein size standards (MagicMark Western Standard, InVitrogen). Expression of S260A and S280A Mutants—The sequence alignment of hNaSi-1 with the other members of the SLC13 superfamily shows that serine residues 260 and 288 (numbered according to the hNaSi-1 sequence) are conserved in the Na+/sulfate transporters, but alanine or threonine is found in the Na+/dicarboxylate transporters (Fig. 1A). Therefore, alanines were substituted for serines 260 and 288 in hNaSi-1. These serines are located near the extracellular face of TMD-5 and -6 (Fig. 1B). As verified in a single Western blot experiment, both mutant proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and appeared more abundant than the wild-type. However, the activity of S260A was greatly reduced compared with wild-type hNaSi-1 and S288A (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Western blot and uptakes in Xenopus oocytes expressing hNaSi-1, S260A and S288A. A, Western blot of biotinylated oocytes. Uninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with cRNA of wild-type or mutant hNaSi-1 were biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. The biotinylated proteins were separated on 6% Tricine SDS-PAGE and used for Western blotting with anti-hNaSi-1 antibodies. Size standards are shown in the far left lane. B, uptakes of 100 μm [35S]sulfate in oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant hNaSi-1 were measured for 15 min in the presence of 100 mm Na+. The data are presented as a percentage of the uptakes of wild-type hNaSi-1 and are shown as means ± S.E. (n = 3–4 experiments). The asterisk indicates significant difference from wild-type (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic Properties of S260A and S288A—The mean values of Km and V max in wild-type hNaSi-1 are 340 ± 50 μm and 4153 ± 362 pmol/oocyte-hr (means ± S.E., n = 4), respectively, similar to what had been reported previously (15Lee A. Beck L. Markovich D. Genomics. 2000; 70: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).2 The mean Km for sulfate was significantly increased (p < 0.05) to 1123 ± 228 μm in S260A compared with wild-type (mean ± S.E., n = 3). The sulfate Km in S288A, 429 ± 144 μm (n = 3), was not significantly different from that of wild-type. The two mutants had a similar or lower value of V max compared with the wild-type, 2539 ± 252 pmol/oocyte-h for S260A and 3651 ± 492 pmol/oocyte-h for S288A. Fig. 3A shows sulfate kinetics in wild-type and mutant hNaSi-1 with the mean uptake values from three experiments normalized to V max. The results suggest that alanine replacement at Ser-260 produces a decreased apparent affinity of hNaSi-1 for substrate, whereas alanine replacement at Ser-288 does not affect the apparent affinity. Na + Activation of Sulfate Uptakes—As seen previously, there was a sigmoidal dependence of sulfate uptakes on Na+ concentration (Fig. 3B), consistent with a transport mechanism involving three sodium ions (5Busch A.E. Waldegger S. Herzer T. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12407-12409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K Na for wild-type hNaSi-1 was 26 ± 3 mm and the Hill coefficient was 1.8 ± 0.4 (mean ± range, n = 2). In a single experiment, the S260A mutant showed a greatly decreased sodium affinity but it was not possible to obtain an accurate kinetic constant because the kinetic curve did not show saturation at the highest concentration of sodium (100 mm) tested whereas the S288A mutant appeared to have an increase in Na+ affinity with a K Na of 15 ± 2 mm (mean ± S.E. of regression). Cation and Substrate Specificity—The cation selectivity of the two mutants and wild-type hNaSi-1 was measured by replacing the 100 mm Na+ buffer with Li+, Cs+, K+, or choline buffer (Fig. 4). Both the wild-type hNaSi-1 and S260A mutant exhibited a strict cation selectivity with transport activity only in the presence of Na+ but not the other monovalent ions. Interestingly, the S288A mutant appeared to have a broadened cation selectivity. Relative uptakes in cations other than Na+ were significantly higher in S288A than in the wild-type or S260A (p < 0.05). The rate of sulfate uptake measured in Li+ in S288A was ∼28% of that measured in sodium buffer (Fig. 4). Substrate specificity was determined by measuring the inhibition of uptakes of 10 μm sulfate by 1 mm concentrations of test inhibitors. There were no differences in substrate specificity between wild-type hNaSi-1 and the S260A and S288A mutants (results not shown). Similar to previous findings (15Lee A. Beck L. Markovich D. Genomics. 2000; 70: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), our studies showed that hNaSi-1 has a broad substrate specificity for anions with structures that are similar to sulfate, such as chromate (CrO42-), thiosulfate (S2O32-), selenate (SeO42-), and sulfite (SO32-). There was no inhibition by phosphate, probe-nencid, or an inhibitor of Na+/dicarboxylate transport, furosemide (16Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was minor inhibition by a second NaDC-1 inhibitor, flufenamate (16Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we saw no inhibition by succinate although prior studies suggested that succinate could inhibit hNaSi-1 (15Lee A. Beck L. Markovich D. Genomics. 2000; 70: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cysteine-scanning Mutagenesis around Ser-260 and Ser-288 —Wild-type hNaSi-1 is sensitive to inhibition by the membrane-permeant cysteine reagent, (2-aminomethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), but insensitive to the membrane-impermeant reagents (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and MTSET (data not shown). MTSEA and MTSET both add positive charges and MTSES adds a negative charge to the protein (17Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The related protein, NaDC-1, loses activity in proportion to the number of endogenous cysteines that are removed (18Pajor A.M. Krajewski S.J. Sun N. Gangula R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 205-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that there were no differences in MTSET sensitivity between cysteine mutants prepared in a wild-type NaDC-1 and cysteine-reduced (3 cysteines) background (9Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used wild-type hNaSi-1 as the parental protein for cysteine scanning mutagenesis around Ser-260 (residues 257–263) and Ser-288 (residues 285–291). A total of 14 residues, including Ser-260 and Ser-288, were mutated to cysteine one at a time (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 5, all of the cysteine mutant proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but all except A291C had greatly reduced or no activity. Five of the mutants, G258C, S260C, N262C, F285C, and P290C were completely inactive. MTSET Sensitivity of Cysteine Mutants—The cysteine-substituted mutants were incubated with a relatively high 1 mm concentration of MTSET to identify sensitive residues. Only four mutants surrounding Ser-260 (T257C, T259C, T261C, and L263C) were sensitive to MTSET (results not shown). In contrast, S288C and the surrounding active mutants (T286C, F287C, F289C, and A291C) were all functionally insensitive to chemical modification by MTSET (results not shown). The concentration dependence of MTSET inhibition for the four sensitive mutants (T257C, T259C, T261C, and L263C) was tested by measuring the sulfate uptake activity of each mutant after 10 min preincubation with increasing concentrations of MTSET (Fig. 6). T259C had the highest IC50 of about 900 μm, followed by T261C with an IC50 of 63 μm, T257C with an IC50 of 3 μm and L263C with an IC50 of 0.2 μm. The reactivity with MTSET is related to the accessibility of the cysteine, which may be modified by the local environment surrounding the residue (19Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For comparison, the pseudo first-order rate constants of inhibition, k (in min–1 mm–1), were also estimated: 345 (L263C), 23 (T257C), 1 (T261C), 0.08 (T259C). The value of k for T259C is probably the least accurate since there seems to be some activation at low MTSET concentrations and the maximal inhibition was not reached at the highest concentration of MTSET. However, the results suggest that the substituted cysteines at positions 263 and 257 are likely to be more accessible to the MTSET, whereas the substituted cysteines at positions 259 and 261 are less accessible to MTSET. Cation and Substrate Dependence of MTSET Inhibition— The effect of cations and substrate on the MTSET modification of substituted cysteines is shown in Fig. 7. The concentration of MTSET was selected for each mutant based on the relative IC50 values (T257C, 2.5 μm; T259C, 500 μm; T261C, 250 μm; L263C, 1 μm). All four mutants were equally sensitive to inhibition after preincubation with MTSET in Na+ or choline buffer (p < 0.05). Although there appears to be a difference between Na+ and choline in the L263C mutant, this was not significantly different (p = 0.08). All four mutants showed significant substrate protection in Na+ but not choline buffer. Effect of Na + on Sulfate Kinetics in hNaSi-1—The changes in MTSET accessibility with different cations or substrate likely reflect changes in conformation in hNaSi-1. We assume that binding is ordered, with sodium binding before sulfate, which then triggers a conformational change that allows sulfate binding. Previous kinetic studies with rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles have suggested that sodium binding precedes sulfate binding (20Ahearn G.A. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 78: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but this model had not been tested using the cloned NaSi-1. The relationship between sulfate kinetic constants and sodium concentration in hNaSi-1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was measured (results not shown). The sulfate Km was lowest in 100 mm Na+ buffer (379 ± 66 μm, n = 6) compared with 20 mm Na+ (707 ± 70 μm, n = 3) or 40 mm Na+ (687 ± 23 μm, n = 2) (mean ± S.E.). The maximum uptake rates, V max, of uptakes in 20 mm, 40 mm and 100 mm Na+ buffer are (in nmol/oocyte-hr): 2.7 ± 1.5, 5.5 ± 2.4, and 3.1 ± 0.7, respectively. There was no significant difference in V max values but there was also considerable variation within groups. The goal of this study was to determine the functional roles of two serines, at positions 260 and 288, in the human Na+/sulfate cotransporter, hNaSi-1. These residues are conserved in all of the sulfate transporters of the SLC13 superfamily but alanine or threonine is found at those sites in the dicarboxylate transporters. Serine 260 appears to be important for both substrate and cation binding. Furthermore, the residues surrounding Ser-260 at the outer surface of TMD-5 appear to change their accessibility to the extracellular medium depending on the conformational state of the protein. In contrast, Ser-288 and the surrounding amino acids are probably required to maintain the structure of the protein and substitution of these residues results in decreased uptake activity. Ser-288 does not appear to be involved directly in substrate or cation binding, and there are no functional consequences of chemical modification of cysteines in TMD-6 with MTSET. Serines were chosen for mutagenesis because previous studies have suggested that hydroxyl groups of serines can participate in substrate or cation binding in transport proteins (21Blostein R. Wilczynska A. Karlish S.J. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24987-24993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Danek Burgess K.S. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although hNaSi-1 contains a total of 42 serine residues, only two of these, Ser-260 and Ser-288, are conserved in the sulfate but not the dicarboxylate transporters of the SLC13 superfamily. Since the transport mechanism in all members of this family is similar, involving three sodium ions and one divalent anion substrate, differences in sequences might identify residues responsible for differences in substrate selectivity. Our previous study showed that the substrate recognition domain in NaDC-1 and NaSi-1 is found in the C-terminal half of these transporters, past amino acid 141 (6Pajor A.M. Sun N. Bai L. Markovich D. Sule P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that serines 260 and 288 might be involved in determining substrate selectivity or binding. The results of this study suggest that Ser-260 is likely to be involved in substrate and/or cation binding. Replacement of Ser-260 by alanine resulted in decreases in apparent affinity for both substrate and cations. One possible explanation is that Ser-260 is directly involved in the structure of the substrate and cation binding sites or it is located close to these binding sites. Our previous results with NaDC-1 have shown a close relationship between the cation and substrate binding sites, and single mutations often affect both (8Griffith D.A. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7524-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that Ser-260 participates only in sodium binding, but since sodium is an essential activator of transport, changes in sodium affinity are reflected as changes in substrate affinity. The sodium activation experiment with S260A showed that uptakes were measured at subsaturating sodium concentration, since the curves did not show saturation even at the highest sodium concentration tested. In hNaSi-1, we found that changes in sodium concentration affect the Km for substrate with an increased Km at subsaturating concentrations. The finding that the S260A mutation produces a change in sodium binding was a bit surprising since we would expect that the dicarboxylate and sulfate transporters would share sodium binding sites. But since binding information is transduced between sodium and sulfate binding sites, these sites should be located close together. Three of seven mutants around Ser-260 (G258C, S260C and N262C) completely lost transport activity, whereas the other four mutants (T257C, T259C, T261C, and L263C) exhibited decreased transport activity. Since the mutants were all expressed well in oocytes, the alterations in transport activity are most likely because cysteine replacements at these residues changed the optimal conformation for substrate binding or translocation. Therefore, not only the two serines but also the surrounding residues at the extracellular surface of TMD5 are important for the transport function of hNaSi-1. The secondary structure model of hNaSi-1 is based on a combination of homology modeling with the other transporters in the same superfamily and hydrophobicity analysis. The sequence of hNaSi-1 predicts between 8–13 hydrophobic domains long enough to span the membrane as α-helices and there is experimental evidence for an odd number of transmembrane domains in the SLC13 superfamily. The C terminus in both hNaSi-1 and NaDC-1 contains the N-glycosylation site and is extracellular (14Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1808-C1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 There is evidence, at least for NaDC-1, that the N terminus is intracellular and the large loop between putative TMD-4 and -5 is also intracellular (25Zhang F.F. Pajor A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the fact that membrane impermeant MTSET reacts with residues around Ser-260 supports the idea that these residues are either exposed to the extracellular medium or are in a water-filled pore. Serine 288 does not play as critical a role in transport in hNaSi-1 compared with Ser-260. Alanine substitution of Ser-288 resulted in an increased apparent affinity for cations and the ability to transport sulfate in the presence of lithium. It is not likely that Ser-288 directly forms part of the cation binding sites because of the increased sodium affinity with alanine replacement. Therefore, it is possible that the hydroxyl group in the side chain of Ser-288 may form a hydrogen bond with another residue to support the structure of the cation-binding sites, rather than directly interacting with cations. Interesingly, all of the members of this family have the capacity to interact with lithium with very low affinity (4Pajor A.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that lithium can substitute for sodium probably reflects an increased binding affinity for all cations. Previous studies of the Na+/K+-coupled glutamate transporter, GLT-1, showed that glycine replacement at Ser-440 produced a broadened ion specificity but did not affect the Km for transportable substrates (24Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since Ser-440 in GLT-1 is likely to be near the substrate-binding site, it was suggested that the changed ion specificity may also be related to a small change in substrate binding produced by the mutation. Sodium is an essential activator of sulfate transport in NaSi-1 and appears to bind prior to sulfate (see transport model, Fig. 8). In previous studies with renal brush border membrane vesicles, sodium affected the Km for sulfate but did not affect V max (20Ahearn G.A. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 78: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our studies here with the cloned hNaSi-1 expressed in oocytes also showed decreased Km with increasing sodium, with no significant change in V max. In an ordered, rapid equilibrium system in which the activator binds prior to substrate binding, the V max is not affected by concentrations of the activator but the apparent Km for substrate increases with decreasing concentrations of the activator (26Segel I.H. in Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, NY1975: 125-132Google Scholar). The V max is not affected because it is possible to overcome the low concentration of activator with high enough substrate concentrations. In this study, exposure of hNaSi-1 to the presence or absence of sodium is likely to produce different conformational states in the transporter. In the absence of sodium (choline buffer) the transporter is most likely to be in the unloaded state with binding sites exposed either to the inside or outside of the cell (Fig. 8). When the cells are incubated in sodium buffer without substrate, the transporter is most likely to be in state 2 (Fig. 8). Finally, in the presence of sodium and substrate, the transporter is likely to immediately translocate so that the binding sites are exposed to the inside of the cell and not accessible to MTSET (Fig. 8). A further supporting observation is the fact that choline + substrate produces the same results as choline alone. If the binding order allowed substrate to bind before sodium, it would be possible to see substrate protection in the absence of sodium. An alternate explanation for substrate protection that we cannot rule out at this point is that the substrate-binding site is located near the substituted cysteine, thus preventing access of MTSET. MTSET modification of substituted cysteines in the four mutants, T257C, T259C, T261C, and L263C, was dependent on the presence of substrate. All four substituted cysteines appear to be accessible to MTSET at the same conformational states. These mutants were equally sensitive to MTSET modification in Na+ or choline buffer, and there was evidence of substrate protection. Therefore, accessibility of these substituted cysteines to MTSET is high in multiple conformational states, such as 1 (or 6) and 2 (Fig. 8). All four substituted cysteines in TMD-5 exhibited substrate protection. The simplest explanation for this is that substrate binding triggers a conformational change in the protein and the cysteine is no longer accessible to the MTSET. Alternately, the substituted cysteine is located near the substrate-binding site and substrate binding prevents MTSET accessibility. The four substituted cysteines sensitive to MTSET are located near the extracellular face of TMD-5, on opposite sides of the helix (Fig. 9). The apparent changes in accessibility of these residues to MTSET modification suggest that TMD-5 is likely to be involved in the conformational changes during the transport cycle, either because it moves itself or other parts of the protein move to expose or occlude the residues. There is growing evidence from studies with lac permease that conformational changes involving the rotation and tilting of helices occur during the transport cycle (12Wu J. Hardy D. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We previously reported similar conformationally-sensitive residues in TMD-9 of NaDC-1 (9Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29961-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the main findings of this study are that the conserved serines at positions 260 and 288 and the surrounding amino acids in TMDs 5 and 6 are functionally important in hNaSi-1. Serine 280 may be involved in indirectly maintaining the structure of the cation-binding site. Serine 260 at the outer face of TMD-5 appears to be more important functionally. It determines the Km for both substrate and cations. Furthermore, the residues surrounding Ser-260 appear to have different accessibilities to the extracellular medium depending on the presence or absence of substrate. Therefore, it is likely that TMD-5 is involved in the conformational changes during transport, either directly or indirectly.
