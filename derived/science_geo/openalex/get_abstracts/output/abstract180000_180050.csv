There are four types of PADs, I, II, III, and V, in humans. We studied the subcellular distribution of PAD V in HL-60 granulocytes and peripheral blood granulocytes. Expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged PADs in HeLa cells revealed that PAD V is localized in the nucleus, whereas PAD I, II, and III are localized in the cytoplasm. PAD V deletion mutants indicated that the sequence residues 45–74 have a nuclear localization signal (NLS). A sequence feature of this NLS is a three-lysine residue cluster preceded by a proline residue and is not found in the three other PADs. Substitution of the lysine cluster by an alanine cluster abrogated the nuclear import activity. These results suggested that the NLS is a classical monopartite NLS. HL-60 granulocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils stained with antibody specific for PAD V exhibited distinct positive signals in the nucleus. Subcellular fractionation of HL-60 granulocytes also showed the nuclear localization of the enzyme. When neutrophils were stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, protein deimination occurred in the nucleus. The major deiminated proteins were identified as histones H2A, H3, and H4. The implication of PAD V in histone modifications is discussed. Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) deiminates arginine residues in proteins to citrulline residues Ca2+ dependently.

The structures of these PADs are relatively conserved in the C-terminal two-thirds of the sequence and diverge more distantly in the N-terminal one-third of the sequence. Rodent enzymes have different substrate specificities toward synthetic substrates and different tissue distributions (9Watanabe K. Akiyama K. Hikichi K. Ohtsuka R. Okuyama A. Senshu T. Biochim.

In addition, increased amounts of deiminated myelin basic proteins are in the afflicted area of brains of patients with multiple sclerosis, and prevalent autoantibodies recognizing citrulline residues as an epitope of autoantigen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have suggested the pathological involvement of PAD in diseases (15Moscarello M.A. Pritzker L.

PAD V was first found in HL-60 cells when cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes (HL-60 granulocytes) by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and differentiate into monocytes by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (7Nakashima K.

PAD V was also found in peripheral blood granulocytes (22Asaga H. Nakashima K. Senshu T. Ishigami A. Yamada M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 46-51PubMed Google Scholar). PAD V in HL-60 cells can be activated to deiminate nuclear proteins of nucleophosmin/B23 and histones by stimulation with calcium ionophore (23Hagiwara T. Nakashima K. Hirano H. Senshu T. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This has suggested the location of PAD V in the nucleus. The locations of PADs in cells are important for understanding a role of PADs in cellular functions, but have not yet been studied comprehensively (15Moscarello M.A. Pritzker L. Mastronardi F.G. Wood D.D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Asaga H. Nakashima K. Senshu T. Ishigami A. Yamada M. J.

Here we show the nuclear localization of PAD V in granulocytes compared with three other PADs and discuss a role of PAD V in histone modification. HL-60 and HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (25Kawamura H. Tomozoe Y. Akagi T. Kamei D. Ochiai M. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2732-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HL-60 granulocytes were produced by culturing HL-60 cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid for 3 days (7Nakashima K. Hagiwara T. Ishigami A. Nagata S. Asaga H. Kuramoto M. Senshu T. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27786-27792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Human granulocytes were prepared from heparinized blood of healthy donors with PolymorphprepTM (AXIS-SHIELD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neutrophils and eosinophils were separated in a Percoll density reagent (Amersham Biosciences) (22Asaga H. Nakashima K. Senshu T. Ishigami A. Yamada M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 46-51PubMed Google Scholar). A whole PAD V encoding region in pGEX-PAD V was subcloned into a pEGFP vector (Clontech) (7Nakashima K. Hagiwara T. Ishigami A. Nagata S. Asaga H. Kuramoto M. Senshu T. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27786-27792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A human PAD I cDNA (KAT12008) was purchased from Takara Bio. A human PAD II cDNA (KIAA 0994) was from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (26Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A whole coding region of PAD II was amplified with PCR using a pair of primers attached with anEcoRI linker. PAD I was amplified with PCR using a pair of primers attached with a SalI linker. PAD III was amplified with PCR using pKKhPAD3 as a template and a pair of 5′ and 3′ primers attached with an EcoRI linker and a SalI linker, respectively. The amplified cDNAs were subcloned into a pEGFP vector. PAD V deletion mutants 1–262 and 262–663 were prepared by digestion of a PAD V cDNA with SmaI, and 1–394 was prepared by digestion with XhoI. Deletion mutants 58–663, 182–663, 1–104, 35–104, and 45–74 were prepared with PCR using a pGEX-PAD V as a template and a pair of 5′ and 3′ primers attached with an EcoRI linker. Alanine substitution mutant 1–104 (K59A/K60A/K61A) for three lysine residues (59–61) in a wild type was constructed by overlap extension (27Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). Sequences in constructs prepared with PCR were verified by sequencing. Growing HeLa cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with RPMI 1640, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cells (4 × 106 cells) were mixed with 30 μg of the CsCl-purified plasmid in 0.5 ml of medium and subjected to electroporation at 200 V, 1180 μF, and low ohm with a Cell-Porator (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and then cultured in the complete medium for 24 h. Escherichia coliBL-21 carrying PAD I, II, and V cDNAs in a pGEX-6P vector were cultured with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 16 h (7Nakashima K. Hagiwara T. Ishigami A. Nagata S. Asaga H. Kuramoto M. Senshu T. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27786-27792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). From their extracts GST-fused PADs were affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography and digested with Prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences), and excised PADs were recovered in a flow-through fraction through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Recombinant PAD III was a gift from Hidenari Takahara, Ibaraki University (8Kanno T. Kawada A. Yamanouchi J. Yosida-Noro C. Yoshiki A. Siraiwa M. Kusakabe M. Manabe M. Tezuka T. Takahara H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant PADs I, II, III, and V showed specific activities of 165, 37, 120, and 224, respectively, when determined withN α-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester under the conditions described previously (7Nakashima K.

The previously described rabbit antiserum against GST-PAD V was affinity chromatographed on an N-terminal PAD V fragment-(1–262) bound column (7Nakashima K. Hagiwara T. Ishigami A. Nagata S. Asaga H. Kuramoto M. Senshu T. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27786-27792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The serum (2 ml) was fractionated with 17% sodium sulfate, and precipitated IgG was dialyzed, passed through a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 17.5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, and then passed through GST-bound Sepharose. The unabsorbed fraction was bound to GST-PAD V-(1–262)-bound Sepharose (a 0.6-ml column containing 2.5 mg of protein) and the column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl. The bound IgG was eluted with 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, with a yield of about 200 μg. Sample proteins were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE by the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207497) Google Scholar) and the resolved proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with anti-PAD V(N) (0.15 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-GFP antiserum (Clontech) (1:5,000), and then bound IgG was detected with a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) (Bio-Rad) using a chemiluminescence reagent kit, Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots of deiminated proteins were treated with the medium for chemically modifying citrulline residues at 37 °C for 3 h and then modified citrulline residues were detected with a rabbit monospecific antibody to modified citrulline (anti-MC, 0.125 μg/ml) (29Senshu T. Sato T. Inoue T. Akiyama K. Asaga H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The citrulline modifying medium consisted of 1 part of reagent solution A containing 0.0416% FeCl3-6H2O, 4.6 mH2SO4, and 3.0 mH3PO4 and 1 part of reagent solution B containing 0.5% diacetylmonoxime and 0.25% antipyrine. The chemiluminescent signal was captured and recorded in a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager and the signal intensities were determined with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). HL-60 cells and blood granulocytes in suspension were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution free of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride and were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(−) for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed, suspended in ice-cold PBS(−), and spread on glass slides by cytospinning at 1,600 rpm for 6 min in a CytofugeTM2 (StatSpin Inc). The cells were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cytospin preparations of HL-60 cells and blood eosinophils were heated to boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 7.0, under a microwave at 550 W for 10 min and cooled to room temperature (30Shi S.R. Cote R.J. Taylor C.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This antigen retrieval procedure was omitted for neutrophils. The fixed cells were incubated with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS(−) for 10 min, and then blocked with 2% normal goat serum containing 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS(−). HL-60 cells were double-stained with a mixture of rabbit anti-PAD V(N) (1.5 μg/ml) and mouse anti-MPO monoclonal antibody 3-2H3 (0.5 μg/ml) (31Hur S.J. Toda H.K. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8542-8548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound IgGs were detected with a biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Wako) (1:200), a streptavidin-Cy3 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) (1:200). Neutrophils were double-stained with anti-PAD V(N) and anti-MPO, and eosinophils with anti-PAD V(N) and mouse anti-MBP monoclonal antibody BMK-13 (Monosan) (1:40 dilution). The bound IgGs were detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Wako) (1:200) and a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (1:200). For preabsorption, 0.15 μg of either anti-PAD V(N) or nonimmune IgG and 3 μg of recombinant PAD V protein were mixed, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the immunoreaction. Cells were stained for nuclear DNA with DAPI and mounted in a solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50% glycerol, 0.1% NaN3, and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane. HL-60 granulocytes were suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer (25Kawamura H. Tomozoe Y. Akagi T. Kamei D. Ochiai M. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2732-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 760 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to separate it into supernatant (cytoplasmic) and pellet (nuclear) fractions. The supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to immunoblotting. Blood granulocytes were suspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Locke's solution, stimulated with 1 μm calcium ionophoreA23187 for 5 min at 37 °C, and fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cytospin preparations were incubated with medium for chemically modifying citrulline residues for 3 h at 37 °C and then were incubated successively with anti-MC (0.625 μg/ml), goat anti-rabbit IgG-biotin conjugate, and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (11Senshu T.

Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The medium consisted of 1 part of solution A (0.0416% FeCl3-6H2O, 4.6m H2SO4, and 3.0 mH3PO4) and 1 part of solution B (1% diacetylmonoxime, 0.5% antipyrine, and 0.5 m acetic acid). Signals for bound peroxidase were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a substrate and the cells were stained with Giemsa. Histones were extracted from a nuclear fraction with 0.4 n H2SO4 and precipitated with acetone, and the precipitates were subjected to SDS-15% PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (23Hagiwara T. Nakashima K. Hirano H. Senshu T. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To investigate the subcellular localization of PAD by fluorescence microscopy, we prepared plasmid constructs containing PADs I, II, III, and V cDNA fused with a 3′ end of the EGFP gene and used them to transfect HeLa cells for their expression. After 24 h in culture, their expressions were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP serum (Fig.1 A). GFP-tagged PADs with about 98 kDa were detected in GFP-PAD gene-transfected cells, but not in control cells. The enzymatic activities of these GFP-PAD fusion proteins were confirmed (Fig. 1 B). On incubation of lysates of GFP-PAD gene-transfected cells with Ca2+, but without Ca2+, a number of deiminated proteins with a wide range of molecular weights were detected with anti-MC (lanes 3–10). The control cell lysate formed no deiminated protein with or without CaCl2 (lanes 1 and 2). Panel C of Fig. 1 shows fluorescence micrographs of these cells in parallel cultures. The control EGFP was located throughout the cell (panels a and f). GFP-tagged PAD V was located exclusively in the nucleus stained with DAPI (panels e andj), whereas GFP-tagged PADs I, II, and III were located only in the cytoplasm (panels b–d andg–i). These results suggested a unique nuclear location of PAD V in the cells. To identify an NLS of PAD V, we prepared N- and C-terminal deletion mutants that were fused with the EGFP gene (Fig.2 A). These constructs were expressed in HeLa cells for 24 h. Expressions of all GFP-tagged deletion mutant proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP serum on the basis of their expected sizes (data not shown). No isolated deletion mutants had PAD activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the fluorescence micrographs show localizations of these deletion mutants in these cells. The control GFP was distributed throughout the cells (panel a). The N-terminal deletion mutants 58–663, 182–663, and 261–663 were distributed throughout the cells, although more densely in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (panels b–d). However, the C-terminal deletion mutants 1–394, 1–262, and 1–104 and deletion mutant 35–104 were located in the nucleus (panels e–h). Deletion mutant 45–74 as short as 30 amino acids was also located in the nucleus (panel i), indicating the presence of an NLS. This fragment has three consecutive lysine residues, 59–61, preceded by proline residue 57 (Fig. 2 C). These are features of a basic type NLS motif (Fig. 2 D). But that was not found in the three other PADs (Fig. 2 C). To determine the contribution of the three lysine residues to the NLS activity, we prepared a wild type 1–104 and its mutant 1–104 (K59A/K60A/K61A) which has three alanine (59–61) instead of the three lysine residues and fused them with the GFP-GST gene (Fig.3 A). These constructs were transfected to HeLa cells for expression. Expressions of GFP-GST-tagged wild type and mutant proteins in 24-h culture cells were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antiserum (data not shown). Panel B of Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence micrographs of these cells. The wild type GFP-GST-PAD-(1–104) was located in the nucleus, whereas the mutant GFP-GST-PAD-(1–104) was located in the cytoplasm, and the control GFP-GST was found throughout the cell. These results suggested that the KKK motif in this position might be essential for the nuclear import of PAD V. The above results indicate the ability of recombinant PAD V to become located in the nucleus. We next determined the locations of native PAD V in HL-60 and blood granulocytes by immunocytochemistry. We affinity purified an antibody specific for PAD V from antiserum against PAD V with its N-terminal segment 1–261-conjugated Sepharose beads. It was termed anti-PAD V(N). The antibody was first tested with recombinant human PADs I, II, III, and V by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 A). It reacted with PAD V, but not with similar amounts of PADs I, II, and III. This antibody was also tested on lysates of HL-60 cells (Fig.4 B). HL-60 granulocytes expressing PAD V were prepared by culturing HL-60 cells with RA. These cells gave one distinct band of 67 kDa PAD on a blot (lane 2), whereas control HL-60 cells gave no signal (lane 1). For immunocytochemical staining, cytospin preparations of paraformaldehyde-fixed HL-60 cells were first immersed in a boiling citrate buffer and then double-stained with a mixture of anti-PAD V(N) and anti-MPO. MPO was used as a marker specific for a neutrophil cytoplasmic granule. This antigen retrieval procedure was essential for visualization of PAD V staining. On staining of HL-60 granulocytes, the distinct signals for PAD V were detected in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C, panel e). In control HL-60 cells no signal was detected in the nucleus, but a faint signal was detected in the cytoplasm (panel b). Signals for MPO were consistently found in the cytoplasm of control HL-60 cells and HL-60 granulocytes (panels a and d). These results indicated that HL-60 PAD V is localized in the nucleus. We next examined PAD V in peripheral blood granulocytes. Granulocytes gave only a single band with 67 kDa on blots and its signal intensity increased with increase in the cell number from 1 × 104 to 4 × 104 (Fig.5 A, lanes 5–7). The cellular content of PAD V was estimated to be ∼1.9 × 106 molecules per cell using recombinant PAD V as a standard (lanes 1–4). Neutrophils were double-stained with a mixture of anti-PAD V(N) and anti-MPO (Fig. 5 B) without boiling in citrate buffer. Distinctive signals of anti-PAD V were confined to narrow diffuse DAPI-staining regions located along segmented forms of the nucleus (panels b and cand e and f). This is more clearly shown at higher magnification (panel d–f). The PAD-positive cells were identified as neutrophils by their nuclear morphology and by the cytoplasmic location of the MPO signal (panels a, d, g, and j). When nonimmune IgG was used as a control, no signals were detected in the nucleus, whereas the cytoplasm was stained faintly (panel h). Preabsorption of the antibody with recombinant PAD V completely abolished the signal in the nucleus, although the faint cytoplasmic signals remained (panel k). Preabsorption of nonimmune IgG also showed only the faint cytoplasmic signals (data not shown). These results indicated that neutrophil PAD V is localized in the nucleus. An eosinophil fraction prepared in a Percoll density gradient was >50% in purity. Eosinophil cytospin preparations were treated by microwave to boiling and double stained with a mixture of anti-PAD V(N) and anti-eosinophil MBP, as a marker specific for a cytoplasmic granule. Panel C of Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence micrographs. The major signal of PAD was found overlapping with the nucleus stained with DAPI, whereas a weaker signal was found in the cytoplasm overlapped with the MBP signal (panel a–c). When cells were stained with nonimmune IgG, no nuclear signal was detected, but the cytoplasmic signal was observed again (d–f). These cytoplasmic signals could be accounted for by nonspecific IgG binding to the cytopolasm. These results indicate that eosinophil PAD is localized in the nucleus. To substantiate the PAD V nuclear location shown above, we examined PAD V of HL-60 granulocytes by fractionation of their lysates into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Immunoblotting of these fractions indicated that PAD V was present only in the nuclear fraction, and α-tubulin was mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.6 A, upper panel). Protein staining of a gel showed that all core histones were recovered in the nuclear fraction (lower panel). The virtual absence of α-tubulin and histones in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively, showed negligible cross-contamination between these fractions. The amounts of lactate dehydrogenase activity, PAD activity, and DNA determined were 99% of the total in the cytoplasmic fraction, and 97 and 100% in the nuclear fraction, respectively. These results also indicated the nuclear localization of PAD V. To examine the solubilization of PAD V from the nucleus, we extracted the nuclear fraction with increasing concentrations of NaCl with or without 0.5% CHAPS (Fig. 6 B). PAD was almost fully solubilized at 0.2m NaCl without CHAPS and addition of 0.5% CHAPS solubilized PAD at 0.1 m NaCl (upper panel). Core histones remained insoluble under all the conditions employed (lower panel). To investigate where protein deimination occurs in blood granulocytes, we suspended cells in medium containing 2 mm CaCl2 and gave a 5-min stimulus with 0.5 μm calcium ionophore A23187. These cells were stained for deiminated proteins with anti-MC. Panel A of Fig.7 shows the micrographs of these cells. The positive signals were confined to segmented forms of the nucleus in neutrophils with the stimulus (panel b), but not without the stimulus (panel a). The number of positive cells amounted to about 50% of the total cells within 5 min and reached almost all cells by 15 min. Next, we identified deiminated proteins in cells by immunoblotting using anti-MC (Fig. 7 B). The unstimulated cells gave no bands on blots (lanes 1 and 5), whereas the stimulated cells gave three major distinct bands with ∼14, 17, and 18 kDa and several other weak bands with higher molecular weight (lanes 2–4 and 5–8). The signal intensities of these bands (14–18 kDa) increased with increase in the A23187 concentra"

The motor protein myosin Vb regulates plasma membrane recycling through its association with Rab11a. Overexpression of the tail of myosin Vb disrupts trafficking out of plasma membrane recycling systems and leads to the accumulation of Rab11a in both polarized and non-polarized cells. We have investigated the association of Rab11 family interacting protein 2 (Rab11-FIP2) with myosin Vb as an adapter protein between Rab11a and myosin Vb. Immunofluorescence studies indicated a colocalization of endogenous Rab11-FIP2 with green fluorescent protein-myosin Vb tail overexpressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Yeast two hybrid assays showed that amino acids 129–356 of Rab11-FIP2 were important for binding to myosin Vb tail.In vitro association assays and co-transfection experiments in both MDCK and HeLa cells confirmed this result but further refined the binding site to amino acids 129–290 of Rab11-FIP2. Like myosin Vb, functional studies indicated that Rab11-FIP2 is also important for normal plasma membrane recycling. Green fluorescent protein-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512), which lacks its amino-terminal C2 domain, functioned as a dominant negative acting truncation that caused accumulation of Rab11a and disrupted IgA trafficking in MDCK cells and transferrin trafficking in HeLa cells.

Although the handling of individual cargo proteins may vary among cell types, a number of studies over the past several years have established a central role for the small GTPases Rab11a and Rab25 in plasma membrane recycling. In non-polarized cells, transferrin receptor recycles through a perinuclear recycling system dependent on Rab11a (1Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J.

Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, Rab11-FIP3, Rab11-FIP4, Rab coupling protein (RCP), and pp75/Rip11 all interact with Rab11a through a conserved carboxyl-terminal amphipathic α-helical domain (10Hales C.M.

In parietal cells, MDCK cells, and HeLa cells, multiple Rab11-FIP proteins are present spatially within populations of Rab11a-containing recycling vesicles (10Hales C.M. Griner R.

Finally, we have also reported that the actin motor protein myosin Vb associates specifically with Rab11 family GTPases (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Myosin Vb immunoreactivity was present on Rab11a-containing recycling vesicles and GFP-myosin Vb targeted to recycling system vesicles in both HeLa and MDCK cells (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M.

Importantly, the overexpression of the tail of myosin Vb lacking a motor domain caused accumulation of Rab11a in pericentriolar vesicle aggregates and strongly inhibited trafficking out of the recycling system in both HeLa and MDCK cells (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, GFP-myosin Vb transfection blocked exit of transferrin from the recycling system vesicles in HeLa cells and pIgA-R from the apical recycling system in MDCK cells. All of these results indicated that myosin Vb was the motor protein responsible for transit out of plasma membrane recycling systems. Myosin Vb is a member of the class V myosins (myosin Va/dilute, myosin Vb/myr6, and myosin Vc) that promote transit along the actin cytoskeleton and appear to associate with distinct Rab GTPases. Although the Rab protein partner for myosin Vc remains obscure (15Rodriguez O.C. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recent investigations have demonstrated the association of myosin Va with vesicles containing Rab27a (17Wu X. Rao K. Bowers M.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Recent studies from McCaffrey and colleagues (12Wallace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have suggested that Rab11-FIP2 can dimerize and may also form hetero-oligomers with other Rab11-FIP family members. Importantly, our original yeast two hybrid studies indicated that Rab11-FIP2 could interact with the tail of myosin Vb (10Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K.L. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Rab11-FIP2 may contribute to anchoring of Rab11a-positive vesicles to myosin Vb. We now report that yeast two hybrid analysis, immunolocalization experiments, and in vitro binding studies all confirm the direct association of Rab11-FIP2 with myosin Vb. In trafficking studies, a truncation of Rab11-FIP2 lacking the amino-terminal C2-domain inhibited plasma membrane recycling in both HeLa and MDCK cells. These studies show that Rab11-FIP2 is a receptor/adapter protein linking myosin Vb to Rab11a and regulating the movement of vesicle cargo through the recycling endosome. Yeast two hybrid binary assays were conducted as described previously (10Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K.L. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, truncations of Rab11-FIP2 were amplified by PCR adding an EcoRI site to the 5′ end and a SalI site to the 3′end. PCR amplification products were then digested with EcoRI andSalI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into pBD-Gal-(CaM) (Stratagene) vector utilizing T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Plasmids were confirmed with automated sequencing (Molecular Biological Core Facility, Medical College of Georgia). Rab11-FIP2 truncations were then cotransfected with either pAD-myosin Vb tail or pAD empty vector as a control into the yeast strain Y190. Yeast were allowed to grow for 3 days at 30 °C and then analyzed via β-galactosidase assay. A positive result represented blue color within 4 h. Recombinant GST-myosin Vb tail attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads and recombinant His-Rab11-FIP2, His-Rab11-FIP2 (129–356), His-Rab11-FIP2 (129–290), and His-Rab11-FIP2 (191–290) were made as described previously (10Hales C.M.

The sample was cut with SalI, cloned into pGEX5x-1, and confirmed for sequence accuracy. Myosin Vb tail in pGEX5x-1 and pGEX5x-1 empty vector were transformed into BL21pLysS competent cells (Promega), and recombinant protein was produced following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h. GST and GST-myosin Vb tail beads were stored in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) at 4 °C. Rab11-FIP2 and Rab11-FIP2 truncations were PCR amplified and cloned into pET30a (Novagen) for His-tagged recombinant protein production. For a single pull-down reaction, 50 μl of GST and GST-myosin Vb tail beads were blocked for 2 h in buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1:200 protease inhibitor mixture. Approximately 2 μg of His-Rab11-FIP2, His-Rab11-FIP2 (129–356), His-Rab11-FIP2 (129–290), or His-Rab11-FIP2 (191–290) were combined with either GST or GST-myosin Vb tail beads. Samples were incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at room temperature. Supernatants were removed, and remaining His-tagged protein not bound to GST or GST-myosin Vb tail beads was rescued utilizing His-bind resin (Novagen). The GST and GST-myosin Vb tail beads (pellets) were washed in reaction buffer without bovine serum albumin. The supernatant and pellet beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and Western blots were performed. Because the His-tagged proteins contained an amino-terminal S protein tag, proteins were detected utilizing an S protein-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Novagen). Transient transfections were performed utilizing Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Immunostaining was performed as described previously (10Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C.

Imaging of dual transfection experiments with GFP-Rab11-FIP2 truncations and DsRed myosin Vb tail was performed utilizing a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal fluorescence microscope. All other images were obtained with a Molecular Dynamics confocal microscope. The GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) sequence was digested from pEGFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) withNheI and SalI and cloned into the tetracycline responsive plasmid, pTRE2 (Clontech). Utilizing Effectene, GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) in pTRE2 was then transfected dually with pCB7 vector into an MDCK tetracycline repressible cell line (T23) (25Mostov K.E. Deitcher D.L.

Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated in serial dilutions on 110-mm plates. After 7 days, single colonies were picked and transferred to 24-well plates. After 7 more days cells were trypsinized and transferred to 12-well plates in the absence or presence of doxycycline. Cell lines expressing GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) were passaged to six-well plates, T25 flasks, and finally, T75 flasks. GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) tetracycline repressible cell lines were tested for clonality via imaging and for expression levels via Western blot. IgA apical recycling and transcytosis assays were performed by modification of previously described methods (5Casanova J.E. Wang X. Kumar R. Bhartur S.G. Navarre J. Woodrum J.E. Ray G.S. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) adapted for the use of fluorescent ligand. Briefly, Alexa 546 dye was covalently attached to polymeric IgA (Alexa Fluor 546 protein labeling kit). Alexa 546-IgA (10 μg/ml) was then added to the apical surface or the basolateral surface of transwell filters containing confluent MDCK cells stably transfected with the polymeric IgA receptor and GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) in the presence or absence of doxycycline (5 ng/ml). Medium without dye was utilized for IgA trafficking assays to reduce background fluorescence. For fluorescence imaging, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 0 and 40 min for apical recycling assays and 0 and 60 min for transcytosis assays. For quantitative analysis, apical and basolateral supernatants and cell bodies were collected at 0 and 40 min for apical recycling and 0 and 60 min for transcytosis. Samples were suspended in SDS buffer (final concentration, 300 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 17.5 mm sucrose) and resolved utilizing SDS-PAGE. Low fluorescence plates (Amersham Biosciences) were utilized for preparing the polyacrylamide gels. Gels were then scanned utilizing an Amersham Biosciences two-dimensional fluorescent gel scanner. Fluorescent IgA bands were quantified for pixel intensity utilizing GeneQuant software. At different time points, the quantitated amounts of IgA in the apical and basolateral media, as well as label remaining within cells, were determined and used to calculate the percent of total IgA retained in cells: [(IgAcells)/(IgAcells + IgAapical media + IgAbasolateral media)] × 100. At least three separate experiments in triplicate were conducted for each condition. Differences among groups were analyzed for statistical significance with Student's t test (InStat). Transferrin trafficking was conducted as described previously with differences noted below (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). HeLa cells containing transiently transfected GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) were utilized to assess trafficking. Alexa 546-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) was loaded into the cells. For images, cells were fixed at 0 and 40 min. Cells were then stained for transferrin receptor (CD71). The uptake of transferrin into HeLa cells was quantitated by determining Alexa 546 fluorescence in transfected and non-transfected cells using digital image analysis (Metamorph). For quantitative analysis, imaging of HeLa cells was performed at ×63 using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal fluorescence microscope capturing 2-μm optical sections. All images were obtained with identical exposure settings and were analyzed without further image processing. Integrated fluorescence in an 8-μm-diameter circular perinuclear region in 100 cells was determined for each condition. Results were expressed as a mean of arbitrary fluorescence intensity units per cell. Our previous studies had implicated myosin Vb as the motor protein for transit out of the plasma membrane recycling endosome system (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the localization of endogenous Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, and pp75/Rip11 (pp75/Rab11 interacting protein) with overexpressed GFP-myosin Vb tail. In polarized MDCK cells, endogenous Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, and pp75/Rip11 co-localized with both GFP-myosin Vb tail and endogenous Rab11a (Fig. 1). The results suggest that all of these Rab11 interacting proteins may function in a contiguous vesicle recycling system ultimately dependent on myosin Vb activity. Because yeast two hybrid data has indicated an association between myosin Vb and Rab11-FIP2 (10Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K.L. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), further yeast two hybrid assays were used to determine the myosin Vb binding site in Rab11-FIP2. Amino acids 129–356 of Rab11-FIP2 (Rab11-FIP2 (129–356)) were sufficient to maintain an association with myosin Vb tail (Fig. 2). Interestingly, when truncated from the carboxyl terminus to amino acid 465, Rab11-FIP2 would associate nonspecifically. Truncation analysis indicated that the autoactivation domain mapped to amino acids 429–465 in Rab11-FIP2 (data not shown). Similar yeast two hybrid assays were conducted in which full-length Rab11-FIP2 was tested against deletion mutants of myosin Vb tail. Deletion of either 45 amino acids of the amino terminus (myosin Vb tail (45–588)) or 32 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus (myosin Vb tail (1–553)) of the myosin Vb tail eliminated interaction with Rab11-FIP2. In contrast, we have demonstrated previously that myosin Vb tail (45–588) and myosin Vb tail (1–553) could interact with Rab11a in yeast two hybrid studies (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To confirm the myosin Vb tail/Rab11-FIP2 association, GST fusion protein binding assays were used. Rab11-FIP2 strongly associated with GST-myosin Vb tail beads compared with little detectable interaction with GST control beads (Fig. 3). Despite the presence of protease inhibitors, His-Rab11-FIP2 was highly susceptible to proteolysis especially in supernatant fractions (data not shown). In agreement with yeast two hybrid results, Rab11-FIP2 (129–356) was also retained on GST-myosin Vb tail beads, compared with no detectable association with GST beads. (Fig. 3). Interestingly, GST binding assays indicated an association between myosin Vb tail and Rab11-FIP2 (129–290) but not the smaller fragment Rab11-FIP2 (191–290) thus narrowing the myosin Vb tail binding region. To confirm the association of myosin Vb and Rab11-FIP2 in situ, we studied the distribution of GFP-Rab11-FIP2 truncations with co-expressed DsRed-myosin Vb tail. In singly transfected MDCK cells, GFP-Rab11-FIP2 was distributed in a multi-vesiculated pattern similar to that observed for immunostaining of endogenous Rab11-FIP2 (Fig. 4 A). However, GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512), which lacked the amino-terminal C2 region of Rab11-FIP2, was distributed to a more compact large punctate spot (Fig. 4 A). Other GFP-Rab11-FIP2 truncations, which did not contain the carboxyl-terminal Rab11 binding site, demonstrated a predominantly cytosolic distribution (Fig. 4 A). In MDCK cells (Fig. 4 B), both GFP-Rab11-FIP2 and GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) colocalized with co-expressed DsRed-myosin Vb tail. As a control, non-chimeric GFP alone did not colocalize with DsRed-myosin Vb tail (data not shown). Importantly, compared with their cytosolic distribution in single transfection studies (Fig. 4 A), GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (1–465), GFP-Rab11-FIP (129–356), and GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–290) colocalized with DsRed-myosin Vb tail in a punctate pattern. Identical results were observed with dual transfections into HeLa cells (data not shown). These studies confirmed the in vitroassociation assays. In MDCK cells stably expressing pIgA-R, apical recycling or transcytosis of IgA is trafficked through Rab11a-containing vesicles (5Casanova J.E. Wang X. Kumar R. Bhartur S.G. Navarre J. Woodrum J.E. Ray G.S. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). GFP-myosin Vb tail concentrates pIgA-R and disrupts IgA transcytosis (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine the involvement of Rab11-FIP2 in IgA trafficking. GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) was chosen for the assay, because it elicited a tight punctate distribution similar to the dominant negative acting myosin Vb tail (Fig. 4 A). A tetracycline repressible line containing GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) was created to compare trafficking in cells in the absence or presence of overexpressed GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512). Fig. 5 demonstrates that polymeric IgA-R co-localized with both GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) and Rab11a in concentrated intracellular puncta in each cell. Western blots of whole cell extracts from cells grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline indicated undetectable expression levels of GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512) in the presence of 5 ng/ml antibiotic (Fig. 6 B, inset).Figure 6IgA trafficking in polarized MDCK cells. A, IgA trafficking was assessed in MDCK cells stably transfected with GFP-Rab11-FIP (129–512) either without doxycycline (−DOX; expressing GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512)) or with doxycycline (+DOX; not expressing GFP-Rab11-FIP2 (129–512)). Alexa 546-IgA was loaded basolaterally for IgA transcytosis. Cells were fixed at 0 and 60 min (T-0 andT-60) for imaging. Alexa 546-IgA was loaded apically for IgA apical recycling.

In the present study, we evaluated the importance of the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its signaling through the EP4 receptor in mediating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) invasiveness. Genetic inhibition of tumor COX-2 led to diminished matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, CD44, and EP4 receptor expression and invasion. Treatment of NSCLC cells with exogenous 16,16-dimethylprostaglandin E2 significantly increased EP4 receptor, CD44, and MMP-2 expression and matrigel invasion. In contrast, anti-PGE2 decreased EP4 receptor, CD44, and MMP-2 expression in NSCLC cells. EP4 receptor signaling was found to be central to this process, because antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of tumor cell EP4 receptors significantly decreased CD44 expression. In addition, agents that increased intracellular cAMP, as is typical of EP4 receptor signaling, markedly increased CD44 expression. Moreover, MMP-2-AS treatment decreased PGE2-mediated CD44 expression, and CD44-AS treatment decreased MMP-2 expression. Thus, PGE2-mediated effects through EP4 required the parallel induction of both CD44 and MMP-2 expression because genetic inhibition of either MMP-2 or CD44 expression effectively blocked PGE2-mediated invasion in NSCLC. These findings indicate that PGE2 regulates COX-2-dependent, CD44- and MMP-2-mediated invasion in NSCLC in an autocrine/paracrine manner via EP receptor signaling. Thus, blocking PGE2 production or activity by genetic or pharmacological interventions may prove to be beneficial in chemoprevention or treatment of NSCLC."

Here we identify four murine FXR transcripts, derived from a single gene, that encode four isoforms, FXRα1, FXRα2, FXRβ1, and FXRβ2. FXRα and FXRβ differ at their amino terminus, and FXRα1 and FXRβ1 have a four-amino acid residue insertion in the hinge region immediately adjacent to the DNA binding domain. Real time PCR and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends followed by Southern blotting reveal that these four transcripts are expressed differentially in liver, intestine, kidney, adrenals, stomach, fat, and heart. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that FXRα2 and FXRβ2 bind to FXR response elements with a higher affinity as compared with FXRα1 and FXRβ1, suggesting that the four-amino acid insert may affect FXR function. Consistent with this idea, the results of transient transfection experiments demonstrate that the four FXR isoforms differentially transactivated a number of promoter-reporter genes; activation of an ileal bile acid-binding protein promoter-reporter gene varied 20-fold depending on the FXR isoform; the rank order of activation was FXRβ2 > FXRα2 ≫ FXRα1 = FXRβ1. In contrast, SHP reporter or BSEP reporter genes were activated to similar degrees by each of the FXR isoforms. Finally, NIH3T3 cells were stably infected with individual murine FXR isoforms, and the cells were treated with FXR ligands. The endogenous ileal bile acid-binding protein gene was activated by the four FXR isoforms with the same rank order as seen in transfections. This effect was gene-specific, since induction of bile salt export pump mRNA was independent of the FXR isoform.

Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Most of these receptors are comprised of a ligand-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1) at the amino terminus, a DNA binding domain, a hinge region and a ligand binding domain, a dimerization interface, and a ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2) at the carboxyl terminus (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). A few family members have been identified that do not bind DNA directly but instead function by interacting with other transcription factors and altering their activity (15Seol W. Choi H.S.

Nonetheless, the major sub-group contains members that bind to DNA as heterodimers with the common partner, retinoid X receptor (RXR)1 (14Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). The farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) falls into this category. FXR was isolated by screening a rat cDNA library using PCR and degenerate primers corresponding to the highly conserved DNA binding domain of nuclear receptors (17Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J.

Two forms of murine FXR (RIP14–1 and RIP14–2) that differ at their amino terminus were originally isolated (18Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RIP14-2, in contrast to RIP14-1, contained an additional 12 bp that results in the insertion of four amino acids in the hinge region, adjacent to the DNA binding domain. Analysis of the cDNA encoding rat FXR indicates that it does not contain the 12-bp insert but otherwise corresponds to murine RIP14-1. It is not known whether these different isoforms have different functions. Taken together, these results suggested that there might be at least four FXR isoforms that differ either at their amino terminus and/or at the site of the four-amino acid insertion in the hinge region. Because the hinge region is thought to have a role in the DNA binding properties of nuclear receptors (34Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M.

The current report provides evidence to support these proposals. C57BL/6J female mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Eight to 12-week-old wild type mice were sacrificed, and tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Four different mouse FXR cDNAs were isolated from the liver tissue using gene-specific primers (GSP1 and GSP2) and adapter primers (ADP1 and ADP2) in the Sure-RACE panels according to the manufacture's protocol (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). The first round of PCR utilized ADP1 and GSP1 (Fig. 1 A). The generated cDNA was further amplified in a second round of PCR utilizing ADP2 and GSP2. The full-length coding regions of four murine FXR isoforms were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers and cloned into BamHI/XhoI sites of CMX-PL1 vector to produce expression constructs CMX-FXR-α1, CMX-FXRα2, CMX-FXRβ1, and CMX-FXRβ2. To make retroviral expression constructs, the full-length coding regions of four different isoforms were separately excised from the CMX expression constructs using BamHI/XhoI restriction enzymes and subcloned into BglII/XhoI sites of the MSCV-IRES-neo vector to make constructs MSCV-FXRα1, -FXRα2, -FXRβ1, and -FXRβ2. The mouse BSEP promoter (−1050 to +25) was amplified using gene-specific primers and cloned intoSacI/XhoI-digested-pGL3-LUC vector (Promega) to create pGL3-BSEP-Luc. All the plasmids have been confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids pIBABP1031-Luc and pIBABP142mut-Luc were kind gifts from Dr. David Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) (21Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J., Tu, H. Learned R.M.

Sure-RACE mouse panels (OriGene Technologies) contain double-stranded cDNAs synthesized from 24 tissues. A 5′ adapter, containing sequences corresponding to ADP1 and ADP2, was ligated at the 5′ ends. The cDNAs were amplified using gene-specific primers (GSP1 and GSP2) and adapter-specific primers (ADP1 and ADP2). The PCR products were then isolated on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, and the membranes were probed with a mouse FXR cDNA probe. The bands corresponding to FXRα or FXRβ were recovered from the gel and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After transformation, the white colonies were patched onto duplicate ampicillin-positive LB plates. The colonies from the plate were first screened to identify whether they represent FXRα or FXRβ using P3 and P4 (see Fig. 1) followed by using P1 (for screening the isoform with 12-bp insert) and then P2 (for screening the isoform without 12-bp insert) (Fig. 1). The sequences for P1 and P2 are 5′-TGGCTGAATGTATGTATACAGGTTTGTTAA-3′ and 5′-ATGTTGGCTGAATGTTTGTTAACTGA-3′, respectively. All positive colonies were further confirmed either by sequencing or PCR. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of RNA was denatured, electrophoresed, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with the indicated cDNA probe. Real time PCR was performed essentially as described (37Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Walczak R. Pei L. Wilpitz D.C. Collins J.L. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7558-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using the Taqman reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each amplification mixture (50 μl) contained 50 ng of cDNA, 900 nm forward primer, 900 nm reverse primer, 250 nm fluorogenic probe, and 25 μl of Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR thermocycling parameters were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Real time PCR was carried out using Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector. Samples were analyzed simultaneously for cyclophilin expression. Quantitative expression values were extrapolated from separate standard curves. Each sample was assayed in duplicate and normalized to cyclophilin. The sequences for primers and probes are as follows: FXRα, 5′-TGGGCTCCGAATCCTCTTAGA-3′ (forward primer, F), 5′-TGGTCCTCAAATAAGATCCTTGG-3′ (reverse primer, R), 5′-CCTTGGACATCTCTGGCCCAAAGCA-3′ (Probe, P); FXRβ, 5′-GGGCTTAGAAAATCCAATTCAGATTA-3′ (F), 5′-CGTCCGGCACAAATCCTG-3′ (R), 5′-TCTTCACCACAGCCACCGGCTG-3′ (P); I-BABP, 5′-CAAGGCTACCGTGAAGATGGA-3′ (F), 5′-ACCTCCGAAGTCTGGTGATAGTTG-3′(R), 5′-GGAACTCTGCCACCACCTTGCCA-3′ (P); BSEP, 5′-ACAGAAGCAAAGGGTAGCCATC-3′ (F), GGTAGCCATGTCCAGAAGCAG-3′ (R), CCGCGCCCTCATACGGAAACC-3′ (P); cyclophilin, 5′-GGCCGATGACGAGCCC-3′ (F), 5′-TGTCTTTGGAACTTTGTCTGCAA-3′ (R), 5′-TGGGCCGCGTCTCCTTCGA-3′ (P). All probes were dually labeled at the 5′ end with 6-carboxyfluorescein and at the 3′ end with 6- carboxytetramethylrhodamine. EMSAs were performed essentially as described (27Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R.

Mouse FXR isoforms or human RXRα was synthesized in vitro using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega). To compare transcription/translation efficiency of the expression constructs expressing different mouse FXR isoforms, equal volumes of 35S-labeled lysates were loaded and separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. The bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Binding reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1–3 μl each of in vitro translated receptors and32P end-labeled oligonucleotide. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mmTris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. The sequences for mouse I-BABP (mI-BABP) probe and hSHP probe were 5′-GTTTTCCTTAAGGTGAATAACCTTGGGGCTC-3′ and 5′-GTACAGCCTGGGTTAATGACCCTGTTTATGC-3′, respectively. CV-1 and HepG2 cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed in triplicate in 48-well plates as described (27Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R.

Cells were treated with ligands or vehicle (Me2SO) in super-stripped fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) as indicated in the legends. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To produce stable cell lines, 293T cells were transfected with MSCV-FXRα1, -FXRα2, -FXRβ1, -FXRβ2, or MSCV-neo along with ΨE helper virus. The supernatants of the culture media were then used to infect NIH3T3 cells followed by selection with 800 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin®, Invitrogen) for 3–4 weeks. The selected stable cells were subsequently treated with the indicated ligands, as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Based on the previous reports on rat (17Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and murine (18Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) FXR, we hypothesized that there might be four murine FXR isoforms. For clarity, the four isoforms that have been characterized in the present report have been termed FXRα1, FXRα2, FXRβ1, and FXRβ2 (Fig. 1 A). FXRβ2 and FXRα1 correspond to RIP14-1 and RIP14-2, previously identified by Seolet al. (18Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify all possible FXR isoforms we employed 5′-RACE and cDNAs generated from 24 murine tissues that had been ligated to a 5′ adaptor (OriGene Technologies). Gene-specific primers (GSP1 or GSP2 in Fig. 1 A) together with adapter-specific primers (ADP1 or ADP2) were used in a series of PCR reactions to amplify FXR-specific cDNAs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Southern blot analysis identified the PCR products that corresponded to FXR cDNAs, and these were subsequently cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides P3 or P4 (Fig. 1 A) were then used to differentiate colonies corresponding to FXRα from FXRβ (data not shown). Filters containing either FXRα- or FXRβ-positive colonies were probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides P1 or P2 (Fig. 1 A) to distinguish whether these colonies did or did not contain the 12-bp insert (Fig. 2 A). This approach coupled with DNA sequencing of selected inserts identified four murine FXR isoforms (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the 5′ RACE data and various databases suggests that (i) murine FXR consists of 11 exons and 10 introns, (ii) FXRα transcription is initiated from exon 1, (iii) FXRβ transcription is initiated from exon 3, (iv) FXRα and FXRβ share exons 4∼11, and (v) the 12-bp insert is located at the 3′ terminus of exon 5 (Fig 1; Table I). Thus, alternative splicing between exon 5 (that contains the variable 12 bp) and exon 6 produces FXR isoforms that include (α1, β1) or exclude (α2, β2) the four-amino acid (12 bp) insert (Fig. 1 B). Table I provides details of the genomic organization and intron-exon junctions of the murine FXR gene; the gene encompasses 76,997 bp and contains 11 exons that range in size from 100 to 572 bp and introns that vary from 328 to 16,388 bp. Almost all of the exon/intron boundaries display the canonical GT/AG sequence (Table I). The data were obtained by comparison of the sequence of the FXR cDNA with the publicly available genomic sequence of murine chromosome 10 (www.genome.ucsc.edu). Fig. 1 C illustrates the domain structures of the FXR isoforms and shows that the FXRβ isoforms contain an additional 37 amino acids at the amino terminus that are absent from FXRα. The four-amino acid (MYTG) insert is located in the hinge region, adjacent to the DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 C).Table IGenomic organization of the murine FXR geneExonExon sizeIntron sizeSplice acceptor site (intron-exon)Donor acceptor site (exon-intron)bpbp118416,388 GTCACCCAGGGCAATCCAAG-taagtaccaa21349,602tgccttccag-GATCTTATTTAGCTTATTTG-gtaagttgtc31218,086tccttctcag-TTGCCGTGAACCAGCTAAAG-gtaggtcact437214,615tttacttcag-GTATGCTAACGGCTGCAAAG-gtgagagctt51422,749tctcccacag-GTTTCTTCCGTTGGCTGAAT-gtatgtatac61381,613cccccccaag-GTTTGTTAACGTTTTGCAGG-gtaacagtgc7100328gccagtgtag-GAGAAAACGGAAATAAAATC-gtatgtgctc81014,450taaaatttag-TTAAAAGAAGAAGCTTCCAG-gtattttttt914815,454atcatcatag-GGTTTCAGACCGAAAGAGTG-gtaagtgaca101151,585tcctacatag-GTATCTCTGACTCTCTCCAG-gtaataatgc11572ccccacatag-ACAGACAATATGAATGTAAT Open table in a new tab To determine the relative expression of FXRα1:FXRα2 and FXRβ1:FXRβ2 in different tissues, we transferred ≥33 bacterial colonies that contained DNA corresponding to either FXRα or FXRβ to filters. These filters were probed sequentially with probes P1 and P2 (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 2 A). As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, this approach distinguished between FXRβ colonies that contained (Fig. 2 A, left panel) or did not contain (Fig. 2 A, right panel) the 12-bp insert. Thus, the ratio of FXRβ1:FXRβ2 in the liver was 1:1.9 (Fig. 2 A; Table II). Table IIsummarizes the results obtained from similar assays utilizing cDNAs generated from six tissues. The data indicate that the ratio of FXRα1:FXRα2 and FXRβ1:FXRβ2 in different tissues varies significantly. For example, the ratio of FXRα1:FXRα2 (+12 bp/−12 bp) is 1:51 in the heart and 1:0.75 in the adrenal gland (Table II). Analysis of the PCR products also indicated that some tissues, including the heart, kidney, stomach, and adrenal gland expressed predominantly one FXR isoform, either FXRα or FXRβ (Table II). Because the DNA was analyzed after a PCR amplification step, the ratios of the four FXR isoforms are considered to be semi-quantitative.Table IIRelative expression of FXRα1:FXRα2 and FXRβ1:FXRβ2 in mouse tissuesTissueFXRαFXRβNumber of coloniesRatio of α1/α2Number of coloniesRatio of β1/β2Heart521:51NDNDKidneyNDND351:1.7Liver331:1.2351:1.9StomachNDND351:4.8Small intestine351:1.2341:2.1Adrenal gland351:0.75NDNDColonies (≥33 colonies) were screened for analysis of the relative expression of FXRα1 and FXRα2 or FXRβ1 and FXRβ2 using the method as described in Fig. 2 A.

Here we show that the FFA, oleic acid, increased apoptosis 16-fold in the pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1, over a 18-h period as assessed by Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide staining and caspase-3 and -9 activation, with negligible necrosis. A parallel analysis of the phosphorylation activation of protein kinase B (PKB) showed this was reduced in the presence of FFA that correlated with the incidence of apoptosis. At stimulatory 15 mm glucose and/or in the added presence of insulin-like growth factor 1, FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis was lessened compared with that at a basal 5 mmglucose. However, most strikingly, adenoviral mediated expression of a constitutively active PKB, but not a “kinase-dead” PKB variant, essentially prevented FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis under all glucose/insulin-like growth factor 1 conditions. Further analysis of pro-apoptotic downstream targets of PKB, implicated a role for PKB-mediated phosphorylation inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β and the forkhead transcription factor, FoxO1, in protection of FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis. In addition, down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic tumor suppresser protein, p53, via PKB-mediated phosphorylation of MDM2 might also play a role in partially protecting β-cells from FFA-induced apoptosis. Adenoviral mediated expression of wild type p53 potentiated FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis, whereas expression of a dominant negative p53 partly inhibited β-cell apoptosis by ∼50%. Hence, these data demonstrate that PKB activation plays an important role in promoting pancreatic β-cell survival in part via inhibition of the pro-apoptotic proteins glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β, FoxO1, and p53.

In insulin-resistant states such as obesity, there is a compensation of increased pancreatic β-cell mass and function so that insulin production is up-regulated and diabetes does not develop. However, with time and/or severity of the insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and an inadequate β-cell mass develop, so that it can no longer compensate for the peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes results (1Pick A.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: S20-S24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of nutrients and growth factors can activate mitogenic signaling pathways to increase β-cell proliferation (3Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For example, glucose can independently induce β-cell mitogenesis, and intriguingly growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone induce β-cell proliferation in a glucose-dependent manner (9Hugl S.R.

Characterization of the pathways involved in this mitogenic stimulation have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-1/ERK-2) signaling pathways, downstream of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), play an important role in β-cell growth and survival (3Lingohr M.K.

Invest. 2002; 32: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms that are involved in preventing pancreatic β-cell death. Several studies in other cell types have implicated an important role for early upstream activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) in signaling pathways for maintaining cell survival (12Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). In this regard and relevant to pancreatic β-cells, it has recently been shown that β-cell-specific expression of a constitutively active form of PKB in transgenic mice markedly increases β-cell mass, mostly by preserving β-cell survival and increasing β-cell size (13Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In contrast, there appears to be less of a role for PKB in promoting β-cell proliferation (14Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. McCuaig J. Hugl S.R. Snow L. Kahn B.B. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol.

The increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate results in PKB translocation to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology domain (15Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). PKB has a myriad of protein substrates that could influence apoptosis, including the family of forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors, glycogen synthase kinase-3 α/β (GSK3α/β), BAD, caspase 9 (12Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar), and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) (17Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). There are three known isoforms of forkhead factors, FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 (also known as FKHR, FKHR-L1, and AFX, respectively), which, upon phosphorylation by PKB, appear to be retained in the cytoplasm preventing their translocation into the nucleus, where they mediate transcription of pro-apoptotic factors. GSK3 is also an important pro-apoptotic signaling protein and the kinase activity of GSK3 is inhibited by PKB phosphorylation. PKB phosphorylation has also been shown to inhibit the activity of components of the apoptotic machinery including the Bcl2 family member, BAD, and the cysteine protease, caspase 9. A recent finding has identified the ubiquitin ligase protein, MDM2, as a direct target of PKB, and interestingly, when phosphorylated by PKB, MDM2 negatively regulates the tumor suppresser protein, p53, a known pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Although several pro-apoptotic substrates are directly inhibited by PKB-induced phosphorylation, it is currently unclear to what extent PKB activation is protective of β-cell apoptosis and, if so, which of the PKB substrates might be relevant in terms of promoting β-cell survival.In this study, we have determined that FFA can induce apoptosis in the pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, FFA also induced an inhibition of IGF-1-induced PKB phosphorylation activation complementary to previous observations of FFA-induced inhibition of PKB activity (5Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Wrede C.E. Kajio H. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, adenoviral mediated expression of constitutively active PKB completely protected β-cells from FFA-induced apoptosis. As such, we provide evidence that PKB plays an important role in protecting pancreatic β-cells against a physiologically relevant factor, FFA.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that prolonged exposure to the FFA, oleate, induced β-cell apoptosis in INS-1 cells, as did palmitate (data not shown), similar to the FFA-induced apoptosis previously observed in islet β-cells (7Cnop M. Hannaert J.C. Hoorens A. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis might occur, in part, via intracellular production of ceramide from palmitate (6Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). However, because, unlike palmitate, oleate is not a significant source for de novo synthesis of ceramide (33Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 34Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the oleate-induced β-cell apoptosis observed in this study was most likely ceramide-independent. Intriguingly, we also found that methyl oleate did not induce β-cell apoptosis. This verifies that the oleate-induced β-cell death we observed was mediated via a programmed apoptotic mechanism, rather than a necrotic one caused by a nonspecific detergent effect of the FFA. In addition, because methylated FFA cannot undergo esterification to fatty acyl-CoA (35Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), these data indicate that oleate-induced apoptosis was mediated by a prerequisite for oleoyl-CoA formation, as previously indicated in studies where inhibition of fatty-acyl CoA synthetase reduced FFA-induced apoptosis (6Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar).Increasing the glucose concentration from a basal 5 mmglucose, and/or addition of IGF-1, tended to decrease the degree of FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis (Fig. 3), suggesting a requirement for activation of signaling pathways to promote β-cell survival. In this regard, we found that glucose/IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation activation of the anti-apoptotic signaling protein, PKB, was reduced in the presence of FFA, correlating with previous findings of FFA-induced inhibition of PKB activity in β-cells (5Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Wrede C.E. Kajio H. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a number of reports in other cell types, which have shown that FFA and ceramide inhibit insulin-induced PKB activation (36Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 37Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Currently, the mechanism of FFA-induced inhibition of PKB activation in β-cells is unclear; however, several possibilities have been proposed in other cell types. For example, inhibition of PKB by FFA and/or ceramide does not appear to be caused by the down-regulation of signaling components upstream of PKB (5Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Wrede C.E. Kajio H. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), such as PI3K or PDK1, but instead is thought to prevent PKB translocation to the plasma membrane (38Stratford S. DeWald D.B. Summers S.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 39Hajduch E. Balendran A. Batty I.H. Litherland G.J. Blair A.S. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that PKB dephosphorylation may be increased by FFA-induced activation of certain protein phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 2A, in turn reducing PKB activity (40Cazzolli R. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). There are also reports that suggest there can be a FFA-induced activation of certain PKC isoforms that increase Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1/2, dampening downstream IRS signal transduction, including decreased PI3K/PKB activation (42Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 43Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F.

White, E. W. Kraegen, and G. I. Shulman, manuscript in preparation. For the moment, it remains to be shown whether any of these potential mechanisms might be pertinent to FFA-induced inhibition of PKB in β-cells.Notwithstanding, insufficient PKB activation can induce β-cell apoptosis, especially in the light of our findings in this study, which show activation of PKB plays a key role in promoting pancreatic β-cell survival. Adenoviral mediated gene transfer of a constitutively active PKB variant into β-cells almost completely prevented FFA-induced apoptosis especially in the presence of IGF-1. These findings are complementary to that of transgenic expression of a constitutively active PKB-α (also known as Akt-1) specifically in mouse pancreatic β-cells (myr-Akt1 mice), where there was increased β-cell mass attributable to increased β-cell survival and increased size of β-cells, but not up-regulation of β-cell proliferation where the actual number of β-cells per islet was decreased (13Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that increased expression of constitutively active or wild type PKB in β-cells has little effect on glucose/IGF-1-induced β-cell proliferation (14Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. McCuaig J. Hugl S.R. Snow L. Kahn B.B. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21110-21120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and because in this study we have used the INS-1 cell line, PKB-mediated changes in β-cell neogenesis are irrelevant. As such, our findings emphasize the importance of PKB activation in promoting β-cell survival.Remarkably, the β-cell specific myr-Akt1 mice are resistant to low dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes (13Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Here we show that a marked increase in PKB activity in β-cells is protective against a physiologically relevant mediator of β-cell death, FFA. In the pathogenesis of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, chronic exposure to FFA has been proposed to be a key factor in promoting reduced β-cell mass, so that peripheral insulin resistance can no longer be compensated for and, together with β-cell dysfunction, the disease is acquired (3Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although we believe our findings to be informative, for the moment it is premature to consider that PKB protection of the β-cell from FFA-induced apoptosis has therapeutic possibilities in protecting β-cell mass delaying the onset of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes (13Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 45Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). We recognize the limitation of this study in using the INS-1 cell line, and it will be important, first of all, to examine whether these observations are reflected in the in vivosetting in animal models of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes. Moreover, because PKB has a plethora of protein substrates, it will also be important to establish which are the appropriate substrates downstream of PKB involved in promoting β-cell survival.In this regard, we examined several downstream PKB targets to determine whether their regulation, as influenced by PKB, could be associated with the degree of FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis. Phosphorylation of two known pro-apoptotic PKB targets, GSK3α/β and FoxO1, leads to their inactivation (12Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Here we found that increased phosphorylation state of GSK3α/β and FoxO1 correlated well with increased PKB phosphorylation activation (especially in cells expressing the constitutively active PKB), and this in turn inversely correlated with the extent of FFA-induced apoptosis. Hence, PKB-mediated phosphorylation inactivation of GSK3α/β and FoxO1 likely promotes β-cell survival. Inhibition of GSK3α/β has indeed previously been implicated to play a role in the protection of cells from apoptosis (12Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar); however, little is known in regard to GSK3 activity in β-cells, and it will be important to elucidate the pro-apoptotic protein phosphorylation substrates of GSK3 in future studies. FoxO1 is one of a family of forkhead transcription factors, suggested to be involved in the expression of a number of pro-apoptotic genes, as well as the transcriptional activation of other genes (27Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). PKB phosphorylation of FoxO1 prevents its translocation to the nucleus, and it is retained in the cytoplasm (via interaction with 14.3.3 proteins), thus decreasing FoxO1 transcriptional activity in driving expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as p27, a cyclin inhibitor, and Fas ligand (27Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, as with GSK3 substrates, the potential pro-apoptotic genes regulated by FoxO1 in the β-cells need to be better determined.In addition to GSK3 and FoxO1, MDM2, an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, has also been identified as a substrate for PKB (17Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). MDM2 is involved in the regulation of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, which is a transcription factor known to induce apoptosis (30Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation by PKB, MDM2 translocates to the nucleus, whereupon it interacts with p53, suppressing the activity and promoting p53 degradation, which in turn further reflects the anti-apoptotic action of PKB activation (17Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). We did not have the tools at hand to directly examine MDM2 phosphorylation by PKB; however, we determined whether p53 might be involved in FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis. It was found that adenoviral mediated increase in wild type p53 expression increased the incidence of β-cell apoptosis in the presence or absence of FFA, suggesting it plays a role, at least in part, in the general mechanism of β-cell apoptosis. In contrast, adenoviral mediated expression of a negative variant of p53, which is deficient in DNA binding (31Scheffner M. Takahashi T. Huibregtse J.M. Minna J.D. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5100-5105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), gave a partial protection of FFA-induced apoptosis. These data implicate a contributing role for p53 in the mechanism of FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis, perhaps because of reduced p53 down-regulation as a consequence of FFA-induced inhibition of PKB activation. However, because protection from FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis in AdV-p53-MT-infected cells was only partial, and to a lesser extent than that of expressing constitutively active PKB, clearly phosphorylation inhibition of other factors downstream of PKB, including GSK3α/β and FoxO1, will play contributing roles in promoting β-cell survival.In conclusion, chronic exposure of FFA can promote β-cell apoptosis, at least in part by dampening PKB activation. This may have implications for the development of an inadequate β-cell mass that no longer compensates for peripheral insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes (3Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, it will be important to first substantiate that our findings in this study can be replicated in an in vivo setting. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that FFA has been implicated to interfere with insulin signal transduction in muscle, including downstream inhibition of PI3K and PKB, which contribute to an insulin-resistant state (46Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). As such, there might well be some intriguing parallels between FFA-induced inhibition of IRS-mediated signal transduction pathways that causes insulin resistance, as well as promoting apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells. In insulin-resistant states such as obesity, there is a compensation of increased pancreatic β-cell mass and function so that insulin production is up-regulated and diabetes does not develop. However, with time and/or severity of the insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and an inadequate β-cell mass develop, so that it can no longer compensate for the peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes results (1Pick A.

The enamel matrix proteins amelogenin, ameloblastin, and enamelin are also expressed during this same approximate developmental time period, suggesting that enamelysin may play a role in their hydrolysis. In support of this interpretation, recombinant enamelysin was previously demonstrated to cleave recombinant amelogenin at virtually all of the precise sites known to occur in vivo. Thus, enamelysin is likely an important amelogenin-processing enzyme. To characterize the in vivobiological role of enamelysin during tooth development, we generated an enamelysin-deficient mouse by gene targeting. Although mice heterozygous for the mutation have no apparent phenotype, the enamelysin null mouse has a severe and profound tooth phenotype. Specifically, the null mouse does not process amelogenin properly, possesses an altered enamel matrix and rod pattern, has hypoplastic enamel that delaminates from the dentin, and has a deteriorating enamel organ morphology as development progresses.

Our findings demonstrate that enamelysin activity is essential for proper enamel development. Dental enamel covers the crown of the tooth and is unique among mineralized tissues because of its high mineral content, large crystals, and organized prism pattern. Other mineralized tissues such as bone, dentin, and cementum are composed of ∼20% organic material. In contrast, mature enamel has less than 1% organic matter by weight (1LeFerve M. Manly R. J. Am. Dent. Assoc. 1932; 24: 233-242Google Scholar, 2Deakins M. Volker J.F. J. Dent. Res. 1941; 20: 117-121Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, enamel crystallites possess a volume that is 100 times greater than the volume of crystallites found in other mineralizing tissues. These enamel crystallites form enamel rods that, in turn, form a unique interlacing (decussating) prism pattern. As a result, dental enamel is the hardest substance in the body. Its hardness is intermediate between that of iron and carbon steel, yet it also has a high elasticity (3Cole A.S. Eastoe J. Biochemistry and Oral Biology. 2nd Ed. Butterworth & Co. LTD, London1988: 460-474Crossref Google Scholar). Although mature enamel is a very hard protein-free tissue, it does not start this way. Enamel development (amelogenesis) consists of several stages that include the secretory, transition, and maturation stages. During the secretory stage, enamel crystallites elongate into long thin ribbons that are only a few apatitic unit cells in thickness (about 10 nm) with a width of ∼30 nm (4Daculsi G. Kerebel B. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 65: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Cuisinier F.J. Steuer P. Senger B. Voegel J.C. Frank R.M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ribbons are evenly spaced, are oriented parallel to each other, and grow in length but very little in width and thickness. Ultimately, enamel crystal length determines the final thickness of the enamel layer as a whole (for review, see Ref.6Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). It is during the secretory stage that the columnar-shaped ameloblast cells, located adjacent to the forming enamel, secrete specialized enamel proteins into the enamel matrix. These proteins include amelogenin (7Eastoe J.E. J. Dent. Res. 1979; 58: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ameloblastin (8Krebsbach P.H. Lee S.K. Matsuki Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J.

Murakami C. Dohi N. Shimizu M. Simmer J.P. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Amelogenin is the predominant component and comprises ∼90% of total enamel matrix protein (10Termine J.D. Belcourt A.B. Christner P.J. Conn K.M. Nylen M.U. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the full-length enamel proteins are found only at the mineralizing front, suggesting that they participate in crystal elongation (11Smith C.E. Pompura J.R. Borenstein S. Fazel A.

Because enamelysin is present in the mineralizing front, it is thought to participate in the early cleavage events that allow the crystals to grow in length but not in width or thickness (25Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Previously, recombinant enamelysin was demonstrated to cleave recombinant amelogenin at virtually all of the precise cleavage sites that were demonstrated to occur in vivo (28Ryu O.H. Fincham A.G. Hu C.C. Zhang C. Qian Q. Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, enamelysin was identified as a predominant amelogenin-processing enzyme. As the secretory stage ends and the transition stage begins, the ameloblasts shrink in size and down-regulate protein release into the enamel matrix. These changes are associated with an end of the elongation of enamel crystals. The transition stage is followed by the maturation stage, where enamelysin expression is eliminated, and the crystallites grow in width and thickness but no longer in length. The remaining proteins within the enamel matrix are degraded by an enamel matrix serine proteinase (Kallikrein-4) before their export out of the enamel (25Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. Crit. Rev.

These general features of amelogenesis are remarkably consistent among different species (33Robinson C. Kirkham J. Weatherell J.A. Richards A. Josephsen K. Fejerskov O. Caries Res. 1988; 22: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conversely, enamelysin expression was observed in pathologic tissues such as in ghost cells of calcifying odontogenic cysts (35Takata T. Zhao M. Nikai H. Uchida T. Wang T. Histochem.

Recently, enamelysin expression was also observed in bradykinin-treated granulosa cells isolated from the follicles of porcine ovaries (38Kimura A. Kihara T. Ohkura R. Ogiwara K. Takahashi T. Biol.

Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), no other intact physiologically normal tissue has been demonstrated to express enamelysin. Therefore, to date enamelysin is considered a tooth-specific MMP. To characterize the in vivo role of enamelysin during amelogenesis, we have generated a mouse with a null mutation that eliminates enamelysin activity. This mouse has a severe and profound phenotype that includes altered amelogenin processing, enamel that delaminates from the dentin, hypoplastic enamel, a disorganized prism pattern, and a deteriorating tooth morphology as enamel development progresses. These results demonstrate that enamelysin plays a critical protein-processing role during enamel development. All animals used in this work were housed in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facilities, and all operations were performed in accord with protocols approved by each Institute's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. The enamelysin catalytic domain targeting vector was constructed using gene sequences cloned from a 129-strain mouse genomic library in the Lambda Fix II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The targeting vector was pBluescript SK+ including a 4.6-kb 5′ homology-spanning sequence from a PstI site in the 3′ region of intron 2 to the PstI site at the 5′ end of intron 4. The 1.1-kb 3′ homology arm encompassed the sequence from theBamHI site at the end of exon 5 to the XbaI site near the 3′ end of intron 5. The sequence from the PstI site in intron 4 through the EcoRI site at the 5′ end of intron 5 were replaced with a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-driven hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase minigeneEcoRI cassette (39van der Lugt N. Maandag E.R. te Riele H. Laird P.W. Berns A. Gene. 1991; 105: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was completed by the addition of an herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minigene cloned into the XbaI site in the 3′ terminus of the short homology arm and the SalI site of the plasmid polylinker. HM-1 mouse embryonic stem cells (40Magin T.M. McWhir J. Melton D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3795-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) were transfected with the targeting vector by electroporation and cultured in selective growth medium containing 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 16 μmthymidine, 0.4 μm aminopterin (hypoxanthine/thymine/aminopterin supplement, Invitrogen), and 2 μm ganciclovir (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hypoxanthine/thymine/aminopterin-resistant clones were expanded and screened for the legitimate targeting event using a primer complementary to the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase minigene 5′ p01, 5′-ACC CTC TGG TAG ATT GTA GCT TAT C-3′, and a primer complimentary to sequences not included in the targeting vector 3′ p02, 5′-CCT TTC CCA ACA TTG TCA CTG C-3′. Cell clones containing the targeted allele were further characterized by Southern blot analysis. An exon 6-specific probe was hybridized toEcoRI-digested mouse genomic DNA. As a result of gene targeting, the endogenous EcoRI site present in the 5′ end of intron 4 was deleted and replaced by an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase cassette. This results in a band of ∼6.5 kb in cells with the targeted construct and a band of ∼7.3 kb for the native allele (Fig. 1,A and B). To generate chimeric mice, targeted embryonic stem cells were injected into 72-h-old blastocysts from C57BL/6 mice and implanted into pseudopregnant B6D2 or C57BL/6 crossed with dilute brown agouti (NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD). Offspring were mated to C57bl/6 wild type mice (NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD) to generate heterozygous animals for the targeted gene. These were subsequently interbred to generate homozygous mutant progeny. Genotyping of animals was performed by PCR amplification of DNA obtained from tail biopsies with primers 5′ p03, 5′-CTG CGT CCC CAG ACT TTT GAT TT-3′, and 3′ p04, 5′-GCT TTT CAT GGC CAG AAT GCT CT-3′, to detect the targeted allele and primers 5′ p05, 5′-AAG TAG ACT GAA GTC AGG AGA GCC-3′, and 3′ p06, 5′-CTG TAG TGG TGA CCC TAG TCA TCT T-3′, to detect the wild type allele. Total RNA was prepared by flash-freezing tissue in liquid N2 followed by extraction in Trizol (Invitrogen). Twenty μg samples of total RNA were size-fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, immobilized on nylon membranes, and hybridized to an exon 5-specific radiolabeled probe. First mandibular molars were extracted from 4.0–4.5-day-old pups, all non-mineralized tissues were removed, and proteins were extracted from mineralized tooth caps by placing them in gel loading buffer (Zymograms: 62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1.0% SDS, 0.3% glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue; in addition, protein gel loading buffers had 0.1% dithiothreitol). Casein zymography gels were prepared (12% acrylamide, 375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.1% casein, 0.0005% TEMED, and 0.05% ammonium persulfate), and electrophoresis was performed at a constant current of 20 mA per gel for ∼2 h. After electrophoresis, protein gels were silver-stained (Amersham Biosciences), and zymography gels were washed twice for 10 min in 50 ml of 2.5% Triton X-100 solution (2.5% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)). The gels were incubated for 1–2 days at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mmCaCl2 and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R-250 solution (0.23% CBB R-250, 5.8% acetic acid, and 30% methanol) for 20 min and destained with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid until clear bands of substrate lysis were observed (41Smith C.E. Issid M. Margolis H.C. Moreno E.C. Adv. Dent. Res. 1996; 10: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Incisors obtained from three euthanized wild type, three heterozygous, and six enamelysin null mice were fixed in 5% neutral formalin/saline overnight, incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 8 h, rinsed overnight with running water, and decalcified in 20% sodium citrate, 45% formic acid for 2 weeks. This and all subsequent incubations were performed at ambient temperature. The jaws were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol washes and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. For scanning electron microscopy, erupted molar and incisor teeth were either examined whole or fractured transversely, air-dried, fastened to stubs, sputter-coated, and examined using a JEOL 6400 scanning electron microscope. The mouse enamelysin gene includes 10 exons and is located within the MMP cluster at the centromeric end of chromosome 9 (42Caterina J. Shi J. Krakora S. Bartlett J.D. Engler J.A. Kozak C.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To disrupt the functional expression of the enamelysin gene, a 10.6-kb-segment-containing sequence starting at the 3′ end of intron 2 and extending through most of intron 5 was modified such that the majority of intron 4 and exon 5 was replaced by a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-controlled hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase minigene (Fig.1 A) (39van der Lugt N. Maandag E.R. te Riele H. Laird P.W. Berns A. Gene. 1991; 105: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M.

Exon 5 encodes the highly conserved zinc-binding site (HEXGHXXGXXH) present in the catalytic domains of the MMP family. This deletion renders any polypeptide expressed from this mutant gene catalytically inactive. The targeting construct was transfected by electroporation into HM-1 (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient mouse embryonic stem) cells (40Magin T.M. McWhir J. Melton D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3795-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and hypoxanthine/thymine/aminopterin resistant clones were selected for further characterization. Targeted alleles were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Chimeric offspring derived from two individual cell clones were mated to C57bl/6 mice, and germ line transmission was obtained with chimeras from both clones. Interbreeding of heterozygous mice yielded the expected Mendelian distribution of homozygous mutant (enamelysin−/−), heterozygous (enamelysin+/−), and wild type (enamelysin+/+) mice (Fig. 1 B). Total RNA prepared from enamelysin−/−-homogenized incisors probed with an exon 5-specific probe demonstrated the absence of transcripts containing this exon (Fig. 1 C). Zymography of proteins extracted from 4.0–4.5-day-old first molars verified the absence of enamelysin activity in the enamelysin-deficient mice (Fig.1 C). Note that two enamelysin bands are present on the zymogram. A study in which native enamelysin was purified from porcine enamel suggests that the two bands represent active intact enamelysin and active enamelysin with at least one cut site present within its hemopexin domain. 2Y. Yamada, Y. Yamakoshi, R. F. Gerlach, J. C-C. Hu, K. Matsumoto, M. Fukae, S. Oida, J. D. Bartlett, and J. P. Simmer, submitted for publication. Maxillas from wild type and enamelysin null mice were removed, the periradicular bone was dissected away, and the exposed molars were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. The first maxillary molars from a wild type (Fig.2 A) and enamelysin null mouse are shown (Fig. 2 B). The dashed lines in Fig. 2encompass the enamel-free areas of each molar. As shown in the wild type, enamel-free areas are normally present in the mouse molar at the marsal plateau of the cusps. These areas provide troughs that are necessary for the efficient side-to-side grinding of ingested food. In the enamelysin null mouse, however, the enamel that surrounds the cusps is virtually absent. Only the cervical margin of the tooth had an enamel covering that remained (Fig. 2). Thus, enamel from the null mouse delaminates from the dentin surface. To determine whether the characteristic decussating rod pattern was altered in enamel from enamelysin null mice, incisors were fractured and prepared for scanning electron microscopy. The fracture plane of the wild type and heterozygous tooth extended through the enamel and dentin (Fig. 3, A andB), whereas in the null mouse, fracture planes of enamel and dentin were separate (Fig. 3 C). This suggests that the null mouse enamel does not adhere properly to the dentin surface. Littermate wild type and heterozygous mice had an inner enamel layer (100 μm) consisting of alternating rows of enamel rods decussating at about 90°, an outer enamel layer of parallel rods (15 μm) slightly inclined to the tooth surface, and a surface layer without rods (6 μm). Inspection of the littermate null mouse inner enamel rods revealed the complete absence of the typical decussating rod pattern, and enamel rod diameters were notably uneven (Fig.3 C). Fractures in the sagittal plane of null mouse incisors (not shown) did reveal the three distinct enamel layers; that is, the inner enamel layer (50 μm) with parallel rods inclined at about 45° to the dentin surface, an outer enamel layer (15 μm) with rods nearly parallel to the tooth surface, and a surface layer without rods (5 μm). In addition to the abnormal rod pattern present in the null mice, a comparison of the enamel thickness from the dentin/enamel junction to the enamel surface revealed that the null mice had a significantly thinner (hypoplastic) layer of enamel (70 μm) than did the wild type (120 μm) mice (Fig. 3). Thus, the enamelysin null mouse incisor had enamel that fractured independently of the dentin, abnormal enamel rod pattern, uneven enamel rod diameter, and hypoplastic enamel. An advantage of observing tooth development in rodents is that rodent incisors are continuously erupting, and therefore, all the stages of tooth development are present along each forming incisor throughout adult life. A morphological comparison of enamel development present in a demineralized incisor from littermate wild type mice (Fig.4, A–C), heterozygous mice (Fig. 4, D–F), and enamelysin null mice (Fig. 4,G–I) is shown. Because the tissues were demineralized, only protein is observed. Thus, for the wild type and heterozygous mouse incisors, the staining pattern beneath the ameloblasts becomes lighter with each successive panel until, at the late maturation stage (Fig. 4,C and F), the most mature enamel is clear. This clear area represents demineralized mature enamel that is almost protein-free. Conversely, in the null mouse, with each successive panel (Fig. 4, G–I) the ameloblasts become progressively more disorganized, and the protein in the enamel matrix is not properly resorbed. A comparison of the enamel proteins in the secretory and early maturation panels between the wild type and null animals reveals that the normal protein pattern present in the wild type is consistent with proteins that had surrounded mineralized prism structures (Fig. 4,A and B). This organized enamel protein pattern is absent in the enamelysin null mouse (Fig. 4, G andH). Thus, in comparison to wild type and heterozygous animals, the morphology of the enamelysin null mouse incisor displays hypoplastic enamel, ineffective removal of proteins from the enamel matrix, a disorganized protein pattern, and an increasingly disorganized ameloblast morphology as development progresses. To directly demonstrate that enamelysin cleaves amelogenin in vivo, amelogenins were extracted from 4.0–4.5-day-old mouse molars and size-separated by SDS-PAGE. A clearly different pattern of amelogenin degradation was evident between the wild type and null mice (Fig. 5). Amelogenin proteins from the null mice displayed a prominent band at ∼27 kDa that was only faintly detectable in the amelogenins from the wild type controls. Only one amelogenin band of less than ∼23 kDa was present in the enamel from the null mice, whereas in the controls at least 5 bands were present below this molecular mass. Thus, enamelysin activity is responsible for generating at least four different amelogenin isoforms that are present in naturally maturing dental enamel. In summary, the enamelysin null mouse does not process amelogenin properly, possesses an altered enamel protein and associated rod pattern, has hypoplastic enamel, has enamel that delaminates from the dentin, and has a deteriorating tooth morphology as enamel development progresses. Previously, several studies show that recombinant enamelysin cleaves recombinant amelogenin (21Llano E. Pendas A.M. Knauper V. Sorsa T. Salo T. Salido E. Murphy G. Simmer J.P. Bartlett J.D.

Oral Sci. 1999; 107: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), including a study demonstrating that recombinant amelogenin was cleaved at virtually all of the precise cleavage sites that had previously been observed in vivo (28Ryu O.H. Fincham A.G. Hu C.C. Zhang C. Qian Q. Bartlett J.D. Simmer J.P. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, until now (Fig. 5), no study has presented direct evidence demonstrating that enamelysin is responsible for these cleavages in vivo. Because enamelysin is expressed primarily during the secretory stage of amelogenesis when the crystallites grow in length, it appears that enamelysin functions to initiate hydrolysis of the structural enamel matrix proteins so that the enamel crystals may grow in length. Prevention of this process by the elimination of enamelysin activity results in thin, brittle enamel that does not mature properly. Enamelysin activity is therefore essential for proper enamel development. In addition, we have observed (not shown) that the first molar of the null mouse possesses less enamel than the second molar, which in turn, has less enamel than the third molar. The mouse molars erupt in this very sequence, from first to third. The same phenomenon was observed in incisor teeth. Intact enamel covered the labial surface of the recently erupted incisor portion near the gingival margin, but at the incisal tip, the enamel was missing. This enamel wear pattern suggests that the teeth erupt with a complete covering of enamel but that over time the malformed enamel wears or chips away presumably due to normal stresses encountered during mastication. Amelogenin comprises ∼90% of the organic component of developing enamel. Thus, the lack of amelogenin processing in the enamelysin null mouse is likely an important aspect of the null mouse phenotype. Previously it was demonstrated that a solitary point mutation (proline to threonine) in exon 6 of the amelogenin gene caused amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) (45Collier P.M. Sauk J.J. Rosenbloom S.J. Yuan Z.A. Gibson C.W. Arch. Oral Biol. 1997; 42: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This missense mutation was positioned at P5 relative to a Trp/Leu enamelysin cleavage site and was demonstrated to reduce the efficiency of hydrolysis by 25-fold compared with hydrolysis of the non-mutated peptide (46Li W. Gibson C.W. Abrams W.R. Andrews D.W. DenBesten P.K. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore a small change in amelogenin structure can have a profound effect on enamel development. Also, the hydrolysis of enamel proteins can alter their functional properties. Proteolysis of amelogenin reduces both its crystal binding affinity and its solubility (47Aoba T. Tanabe T. Moreno E.C. Adv. Dent. Res. 1987; 1: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Calcif.

Moradian-Oldak J. Zeichner-David M. Fincham A.G. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of amelogenin processing in the enamelysin null mouse likely eliminated necessary changes in the physical properties of amelogenin that are essential for proper enamel development. Interestingly, during the late maturation stage, the ameloblasts of the null mouse sometimes surrounded abnormal nodule structures. In addition, an abnormally thick layer of protein appeared to separate the ameloblasts from the enamel surface (Fig. 4 I). This result was difficult to interpret given that both enamelysin and amelogenin are not normally expressed during this late stage of enamel development. Perhaps, pre-processing of enamel proteins by enamelysin is necessary for their proper removal from the enamel matrix and/or their subsequent degradation by the ameloblasts. Because, the dental enamel disease amelogenesis imperfecta affects only dental enamel, the phenotype/genotype of the enamelysin null mice suggest that one form of human AI may be caused by the recessively inherited inactivation of the enamelysin locus. The human amelogenin gene in the p21.1-p22.3 region of the X chromosome and the human enamelin gene at 4q11-q21 are loci in known cases of AI (52Rajpar M.H. Harley K. Laing C. Davies R.M. Dixon M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 53Lagerstrom M. Dahl N. Nakahori Y. Nakagome Y. Backman B. Landegren U. Pettersson U. Genomics. 1991; 10: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The human enamelysin gene locates to 11q22.3, which has not yet been identified as an AI locus. However, in contrast to the phenotype observed for mutations in the amelogenin gene (X-linked) or the enamelin gene (autosomal-dominant), an enamelysin defect would likely be autosomal-recessive and, therefore, less prevalent within the population. Thus, the likelihood of identifying an enamelysin-deficient AI patient is greatly reduced compared with the known genes that cause AI. An intriguing aspect of the enamelysin null mouse is that because it displays a severe and profound phenotype and survives to breed, it may be useful for transgenic studies to assess the functional significance of MMP domain structure. MMPs are characterized by a domain structure that consists of a signal peptide of ∼20 amino acid residues that is removed after it has directed secretion of the enzyme from the cell, a propeptide composed of ∼80 amino acids that folds back to mask and inhibit the catalytic pocket, a catalytic domain composed of ∼160 amino acids, and except for matrilysin and matrilysin-2, a hemopexin-like domain comprised of ∼200 amino acids (for review, see Ref. 54Birkedal-Hansen H.

In general, MMP hemopexin domain function is poorly characterized. We are therefore currently elucidating the function of the enamelysin hemopexin domain by inserting an enamelysin transgene that encodes all but the hemopexin domain into the null mouse background. Thus, the enamelysin null mouse may allow us an opportunity to identify functional aspects of specific MMP domains as the tooth develops.

In addition to stimulating cell proliferation, LPA also induces cytoskeletal changes and promotes cell migration in a RhoA- and Rac-dependent manner. Whereas RhoA is activated via Gα12/13-linked Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, it is unknown how LPA receptors may signal to Rac. Here we report that the prototypic LPA1 receptor (previously named Edg2), when expressed in B103 neuroblastoma cells, mediates transient activation of RhoA and robust, prolonged activation of Rac leading to cell spreading, lamellipodia formation, and stimulation of cell migration. LPA-induced Rac activation is inhibited by pertussis toxin and requires phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. Strikingly, LPA fails to activate Rac in cell types that lack the Rac-specific exchange factor Tiam1; however, enforced expression of Tiam1 restores LPA-induced Rac activation in those cells. Tiam1-deficient cells show enhanced RhoA activation, stress fiber formation, and cell rounding in response to LPA, consistent with Tiam1/Rac counteracting RhoA. We conclude that LPA1receptors couple to a Gi-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Tiam1 pathway to activate Rac, with consequent suppression of RhoA activity, and thereby stimulate cell spreading and motility.

Three distinct G protein-coupled receptors for LPA have been identified to date, termed LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3(previously Edg2, Edg4, and Edg7, respectively), with LPA1/Edg2 being the first identified and most widely expressed subtype (3Contos J.J.

Although much is known about LPA signaling and its cellular responses, the unique biological properties and specific signaling pathways of each individual LPA receptor remain to be fully characterized. LPA serves as the prototypic GPCR agonist that activates the mitogenic Ras-ERK1/2 cascade via Gi (11Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and evokes rapid contractile responses, such as cell rounding and neurite retraction, via Gα12/13-mediated activation of the small GTPase RhoA (12Jalink K. van Corven E.J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); however, opposite morphological responses to LPA have also been observed, i.e. cell spreading and pseudopodia formation (14Stam J.C.

Although LPA action is most often associated with cell proliferation and morphological changes, less attention has been paid to the effects of LPA on cell motility and migration. Cell migration is fundamental to many normal and pathophysiological processes and plays a central role not only in embryonic development but also in the progression of tumors from a non-invasive to an invasive and metastatic phenotype. LPA stimulates the invasion of tumor cells across a monolayer of normal cells (14Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Moolenaar W.H. Collard J.G.

Physiol. 2000; 278: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a migratory response to LPA is also observed in Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae (19Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. Van Duijn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible existence of as-yet-unidentified LPA receptors in invertebrates. However, it remains unclear how LPA receptors signal cell migration. In general, cell migration is driven by signaling pathways controlled by the three Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, acting in a coordinate fashion (20Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Rac1 regulates lamellipodia protrusion and forward movement; Cdc42 establishes cell polarity, and RhoA mediates actomyosin-driven cytoskeletal contraction and stress fiber formation but also detachment of the rear end of migrating cells (20Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 21Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which LPA and other GPCR agonists activate RhoA have been studied in some detail and are reasonably well understood. These studies have shown that RhoA is activated via Gα12/13subunits; furthermore, they have led to the identification of a family of Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) that provide a direct link between Gα12/13 and RhoA-GTP accumulation (22Hart M.J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little is still known about how LPA receptors may modulate the activity of Rac and/or Cdc42. In particular, the identity of the Rac-GEF(s) (and/or Cdc42-GEFs) that may act downstream of LPA receptors remains unknown. In the present study, we set out to analyze the activation of the three Rho GTPases downstream of the prototypic LPA1/Edg2 receptor and to determine how their activity relates to LPA-induced cell migration. We show that the LPA1 receptor, in addition to transiently activating RhoA, mediates prolonged activation of Rac via a Gi-PI3K pathway leading to lamellipodia formation, cell spreading, and migration. Furthermore, we show that the Tiam1 exchange factor provides the link between LPA1/Edg2 receptors and Rac activation. All cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and Tiam1-deficient MEFs derived from homozygous knockout mice were isolated from 14-day embryos according to standard procedures, as described (25Malliri A. van der Kammen R.A. Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The LPA1/Edg2 cDNA was isolated from a human brain cDNA library (Stratagene) and its sequence submitted to GenBankTM (accession number U78192). C-terminally FLAG- or HA-tagged LPA1 receptor cDNAs were cloned into the retroviral vector LZRS-IRES-Neo (26van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and recombinant viruses were produced by transfection of retroviral cDNA constructs into Phoenix packaging cells (27Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). B103 cells were infected with virus-containing supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene, followed by G418 selection. Myc-tagged N17Rac, N17Cdc42, and N19RhoA cloned into LZRS-IRES-zeo (26van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were introduced into B103-LPA1 cells by retroviral transduction and selected on Zeocin (0.25 mg/ml). HA-tagged Tiam1 constructs have been described (28Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method. Cell migration was measured in Transwell chambers (Costar Corp., pore size 8 μm). Filters were coated with 10 μg/ml laminin-1 (in PBS overnight at 4 °C), rinsed once with PBS, and placed in the lower chamber containing serum-free DMEM supplemented with agonists. Cells suspended in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were added to the upper chamber (1 × 105 cells/well). Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C. Non-migratory cells were removed from the top filter surface with a cotton swab. Migrated cells, attached to the bottom surface, were fixed in 3% formaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized in methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted. Activation of Rac/Cdc42 was measured using GST-Pak pull-down assays (26van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 10-cm dishes. Clarified lysates from serum-starved cells were incubated with the Rac/Cdc42 binding domain of GST-Pak produced in Escherichia coli and immobilized on glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (45 min at 4 °C). RhoA activation was measured using a GST fusion protein containing the RhoA binding domain of Rhotekin, as described previously (29Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Beads were washed, eluted in sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Rac antibody (Transduction Laboratories; 1:2000), rabbit anti-Cdc42 (SC-87; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500), or rabbit anti-RhoA (SC-418; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:250). Activated ERK1/2 and Akt/protein kinase B were detected by anti-phosphomitogen-activated protein kinase (New England Biolabs; 1:1000) and anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473; New England Biolabs; 1:500), respectively. Cells were grown on laminin-1-coated glass coverslips and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. HA-tagged LPA1 was detected by antibody 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Cells were stained simultaneously with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Images were collected by confocal microscopy (Leica). Most cell types co-express at least two distinct LPA receptors, which hampers the dissection of receptor-specific signaling pathways. One exception is the B103 neuroblastoma cell line, which lacks detectable expression of LPA receptors (30Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Through retroviral transduction, we obtained B103 cells that stably express the epitope-tagged LPA1/Edg2 receptor at relatively modest levels (B103-LPA1 cells), as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis (results not shown). In serum/LPA-containing medium, the parental B103 cells have a rounded, refractile appearance and tend to grow in small islands. In contrast, B103-LPA1 cells display a flattened morphology characterized by prominent lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, whereas they are more “scattered” throughout the dish (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that LPA1 receptor expression promotes random cell motility. Proper membrane localization of LPA1 receptors was examined by confocal microscopy, which reveals that LPA1 receptors localize preferentially to lamellipodia (Fig. 1 B). We found that LPA1 receptors undergo rapid internalization from the plasma membrane after LPA addition (Fig. 1 B) and mediate pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive activation of ERK1,2; the latter response was not observed in the parental B103 cells (Fig. 1 C). Thus, LPA1 receptors expressed in B103 cells are functional and couple to Gi/o-mediated activation of ERK1,2. When maintained in serum-free medium, B103-LPA1cells underwent rapid cell rounding and process retraction following addition of LPA (Fig. 2 A), very similar to the contractile responses observed in LPA-treated N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (12Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). LPA-induced cell contraction was complete after about 3 min and was observed in at least 80% of the cells in a randomly selected microscopic field (Fig. 2 A). In the continuous presence of LPA, rounded cells began to re-spread after 15–30 min. Cell rounding and re-spreading were fully prevented by retrovirally introduced dominant-negative N19RhoA and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 but not by PTX 2F. van Leeuwen, unpublished results. (see also Ref. 30Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). LPA-induced cell rounding was associated with a rapid increase in RhoA-GTP levels, as measured by the GST-Rhotekin pull-down assay (Fig. 2 B). In most experiments, however, RhoA activation was hard to detect and always very transient (peaking at 2–3 min and lasting <10 min). From these results, together with previous findings (13Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,22Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), we conclude that LPA1 receptors couple to a Gα12/13-linked RhoGEF-RhoA-Rho kinase pathway to mediate rapid but transient actomyosin-driven cytoskeletal contraction. Because LPA1 receptor expression seems to confer a motile phenotype on B103 cells, we measured LPA-induced cell migration using a Transwell system, in which a laminin-1-coated membrane filter separated the upper cell-containing chamber from the lower LPA-containing chambers. As shown in Fig. 3 A, LPA strongly stimulates cell migration in B103-LPA1 cells but not in the parental B103 cells. In the absence of added LPA, B103-LPA1 cells are slightly more motile than the parental cells (Fig. 3 A); one plausible explanation for this finding is that some “autocrine” LPA may accumulate in the cellular microenvironment during the course of the experiment (3–4 h). Very similar migratory responses were observed when LPA was present in both chambers, indicating that LPA1 receptors mediate both random and directed cell migration (chemokinesis and chemotaxis, respectively). LPA-induced cell migration was markedly, although not completely, inhibited by PTX but not by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 at doses that block ERK1,2 activation (Figs. 3 A and 1 C). Migration in control cells was also reduced by PTX treatment, indicating that Gi is required to sustain basal cell motility. Thus, LPA1 receptor-driven cell migration is mediated by Gi but independent of the Gi-ERK1,2 activation pathway. Cell migration during wound healing of fibroblast monolayers (in serum-containing medium) depends on the activity of RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, with active Rac inducing forward cell movement (20Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). We examined the requirement of Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42 for LPA-induced cell migration by expressing their dominant-negative versions in B103-LPA1cells via retroviral transduction. As shown in Fig. 3 B, expression of dominant-negative N17Rac led to a significant inhibition of LPA-induced migration. Expression of dominant-negative N19RhoA and N17Cdc42 also inhibited cell migration, albeit to a lesser degree. These results indicate that LPA-induced cell migration requires the activity of all three Rho GTPases. We next measured the activation state of Rac and Cdc42 in LPA-stimulated B103-LPA1 cells, using GST-PAK pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 3 C, LPA1 receptor stimulation leads to a rapid increase in Rac-GTP levels. Unlike the relatively weak and transient RhoA activation response (Fig. 2 B), LPA-induced Rac activation was robust and prolonged, decreasing to above basal levels after about 30 min (Fig. 3 C). The GST-PAK fusion protein can also be used to detect Cdc42 activity. However, we did not detect increased Cdc42 activity above basal levels in LPA-stimulated B103-LPA1 cells (n = 6; results not shown). Activation of Rac by cell-surface receptors in general, and GPCRs in particular, occurs through incompletely characterized effector routes. In many cases, however, Rac activation is critically dependent on PI3K activity. We found that LPA-induced Rac activation in B103-LPA1 cells is inhibited by PTX and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3 D), consistent with Rac being activated via Gi-mediated stimulation of PI3K activity. In keeping with this, LPA activates the PI3K downstream target Akt/protein kinase B in a PTX- and wortmannin-sensitive manner (Fig. 3 D). PI3K isozymes can be activated by binding to receptor protein tyrosine kinases, activated Ras or G protein βγ subunits. Previous antibody-blocking experiments have implicated the PI3Kβ isoform in LPA signaling (32Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas more recent findings indicate that this ubiquitously expressed β-isoform is activated by Gβγ dimers both in vitro and in vivo (33Maier U. Babich A. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 34Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, LPA-induced Rac activation is most likely mediated by the Gβγ-regulated PI3Kβ isoform, although this remains to be established experimentally. The available evidence indicates that activation of a given Rho GTPase occurs through stimulation of a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF), rather than by inhibition of a GTPase-activating protein (for review see Ref. 36Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The above results therefore prompt the question of which GEF(s) may link LPA receptors to Rac activation in a PI3K-dependent manner. Little is still known about the identity of Rac-GEFs that act downstream of GPCRs. However, one attractive candidate is Tiam1, a Rac-specific GEF that was originally isolated as a lymphoma invasion-inducing gene product (37Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Tiam1 is widely expressed and has been implicated not only in tumor cell invasion and metastasis but also in neurite outgrowth and cell-cell adhesion (38van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 39Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Tiam1 function is PI3K-dependent by virtue of the presence of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that binds preferentially to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (40Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but otherwise the upstream signaling pathways that lead to Tiam1 activation remain unknown. Whereas Tiam1 is highly expressed in B103 cells,2interference approaches were not feasible since dominant-negative versions of Tiam1 are not available, and our experiments using RNAi-expressing vectors met with little success so far. To examine the possible role of Tiam1 in LPA1 receptor signaling, we therefore took advantage of LPA-responsive cells that lack endogenous Tiam1, notably COS7 cells (38van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), Ras-transformed MDCK cells (41Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and Tiam1-null fibroblasts (see below). These cell types predominantly express LPA1 receptors, with little LPA2 and/or LPA3 mRNA detectable. 3L. van Meeteren, B. Giepmans, and W. H. Moolenaar, unpublished results. In COS7 cells, LPA activates the Gi-mediated Ras-ERK1/2 pathway (42Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) yet fails to stimulate Rac activity (Fig. 4 A). In Tiam1-transfected COS7 cells, however, a significant increase in Rac-GTP levels was observed in response to LPA. We then turned to MDCK epithelial cells, which express endogenous Tiam1 (39Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). When transformed by activated V12Ras, MDCK cells (MDCK-f3) revert from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, which is associated with transcriptional down-regulation of Tiam1 and reduced Rac-GTP levels (41Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, LPA activates Rac in wild-type MDCK cells but not in the Tiam1-deficient MDCK-f3 cells. Re-introduction of Tiam1 restores Rac activation by LPA (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these results show that LPA-induced Rac activation requires Tiam1. Next, we compared Rac activation in MEFs derived from Tiam1 homozygous knockout mice with that in wild-type MEFs. Tiam1-deficient mice are phenotypically normal, but they are resistant to skin carcinogenesis (25Malliri A. van der Kammen R.A. Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Wild-type and Tiam1 knockout (−/−) MEFs express LPA1 and little LPA2 but not LPA3mRNA.3 In serum-starved MEFs, LPA induced a significant increase in Rac-GTP levels (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, no LPA-induced increase in Rac-GTP levels was detected in the Tiam1(−/−) cells, whereas ERK1,2 activation was not impaired (Fig. 4 C). Thus, three independent lines of evidence obtained in different cell systems (COS7, MDCK, and Tiam1-knockout MEFs) demonstrate that Tiam1 is necessary and sufficient for LPA to activate Rac. In other words, LPA-induced Rac activation is mediated by Tiam1. 4A previous study (43Buchanan F.G. Cassondra M.E. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported that LPA induces threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1, but not Rac activation, in 3T3 cells. Although we could readily detect basal threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1 using anti-phosphothreonine antibodies, we failed to detect an increase in Tiam1 phosphorylation following LPA stimulation in any of the cell types used here.2 We therefore conclude that enhanced threonine phosphorylation is not involved in Tiam1 activation. Assessment of the migratory behavior of Tiam(−/−) MEFs was hindered by the fact that Tiam1 deficiency led to marked cell contraction, enhanced stress fiber formation, and reduced cell adhesion, when compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4 D and results not shown). LPA stimulation led to further cytoskeletal contraction in the Tiam1(−/−) cells but not in the wild-type MEFs. These observations strongly suggest that RhoA signaling is enhanced following Tiam1 deletion. Indeed, although no RhoA activation was detectable in wild-type MEFs, the Tiam(−/−) cells showed a significant RhoA activation response to LPA (Fig. 4 D). It thus appears that the balance between Rac and RhoA activity depends on Tiam1 expression, a notion consistent with previous observations (29Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 38van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) showing that Tiam1/Rac activation inhibits RhoA. Whereas the mechanism underlying this negative cross-talk remains to be elucidated, these results show that the Rac-RhoA activity balance in a given cellular context is critical in determining whether LPA receptor stimulation leads to cell spreading and migration or to cell rounding and reduced adhesion. In conclusion, our findings indicate that LPA1 receptors couple to a Gi-mediated PI3K-Rac activation pathway that is essential for the stimulation of cell motility. We have identified Tiam1 as the GDP/GTP exchange factor that is necessary and sufficient for LPA to activate Rac in three different cell types. This newly established Gi-Tiam1-Rac pathway counteracts the G12/13-linked RhoGEF-RhoA activation pathway, as schematically depicted in Fig. 5. In the simplest signaling scheme that is compatible with the current evidence, Tiam1 is activated by direct binding of PI3K lipid products (particularly PtdIns(3,4,5)P3; Ref. 40Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to its N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. However, it could well be that additional signals emanating from Gi are required for full activation of Tiam1, perhaps similar to the situation in P-Rex1, a Rac-specific GEF that is synergistically activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and Gβγ subunits (44Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition to the identification of Tiam1 as a key player in LPA-induced Rac activation, our findings highlight the importance of LPA1/Edg2 as a cell motility-stimulating GPCR. Whether the other LPA receptor members, LPA2/Edg4 and LPA3/Edg7, can play a similar physiological role is currently under investigation. We thank Laurens van Meeteren, Ingrid Verlaan, Trudi Hengeveld, and Gerben Zondag for their excellent assistance, and Angeliki Malliri for providing the MEFs."

Association of E-cadherin with the catenin family of proteins is critical for the maintenance of a functional adhesive complex. We have identified a novel truncated E-cadherin species of 100-kDa (E-cad100) in prostate and mammary epithelial cells. E-cad100 was generated by treatment of cells with ionomycin or TPA. Cell-permeable calpain inhibitors prevented E-cad100 induction by ionomycin. Immunoblotting for spectrin and μ-calpain confirmed calpain activation in response to ionomycin treatment. Both the μ- and m-isoforms of calpain efficiently generated E-cad100 in vitro. The E-cad100 fragment was unable to bind to β-catenin, γ-catenin, and p120, suggesting that this cleavage event would disrupt the E-cadherin adhesion complex. Mutational analysis localized the calpain cleavage site to the cytosolic domain upstream of the β- and γ-catenin binding motifs of E-cadherin. Because E-cadherin is inactivated in many adenocarcinomas we hypothesized that calpain may play a role in prostate tumorigenesis. A prostate cDNA microarray data base was analyzed for calpain expression in which it was found that m-calpain was up-regulated in localized prostate cancer, and to an even higher degree in metastatic prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissue. Furthermore, we examined the cleavage of E-cadherin in prostate cancer specimens and found that E-cad100accumulated in both localized and metastatic prostate tumors, supporting the cDNA microarray data. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which E-cadherin is functionally inactivated through calpain-mediated proteolysis and suggests that E-cadherin is targeted by calpain during the tumorigenic progression of prostate cancer.

Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). The classical cadherins, including N-, P-, and E-cadherin are well-conserved and are structurally similar. The cadherin structure consists of an extracellular domain with five tandem repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with the catenin family binding proteins (2Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The interepithelial binding of E-cadherin, which mediates lateral cell-cell adhesion in secretory tissues such as the prostate and mammary gland (3Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev.

The integrity of E-cadherin binding is dependent on its interaction with the catenin binding proteins in the intracellular domain. E-cadherin binds to β-, γ-, and α-catenin (4Kemler R.

Inactivation of E-cadherin through gene mutation, transcriptional inactivation, or promoter methylation has been demonstrated in many adenocarcinomas (8Richmond P.J. Karayiannakis A.J. Nagafuchi A.

However, these mechanisms are not likely to account for all mechanisms by which E-cadherin becomes inactivated in cancer. One mechanism of E-cadherin inactivation involves the proteolytic ablation of the extracellular domain (14Ito K. Okamoto I. Araki N. Kawano Y. Nakao M. Fujiyama S. Tomita K. Mimori T. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7080-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The generation of a soluble 80-kDa fragment that was shed into the medium of cultured cancer cells in response to calcium influx (15Damsky C.H. Richa J. Solter D. Knudsen K. Buck C.A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that metalloproteases mediated the cleavage of the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin that was shed into cultures of human endothelial cells (19Herren B. Levkau B. Raines E.W. Ross R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Additionally, caspase-3 has recently been shown to cleave E-cadherin during the execution phase of apoptosis (20Steinhusen U. Weiske J. Badock V.V. Tauber R. Bommert K. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies have demonstrated that specific proteases can target and inactivate E-cadherin; however, the biological ramifications of these proteolytic mechanisms remain unknown. We have previously identified a novel 97-kDa truncated E-cadherin species that may be important in localized prostate tumorigenesis (21Rashid M.G. Sanda M.G. Vallorosi C.J. Rios-Doria J. Rubin M.A. Day M.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar). We have since identified a novel E-cad100 species that is generated by a calcium-dependent mechanism and may also be important in prostate tumor progression. Due to the apparent requirement of calcium in the generation of E-cad100, the calpain family of cysteine proteases emerged as a likely candidate mediating this cleavage event. There are two main isoforms of calpain that are ubiquitously expressed in tissue and are designated μ- and m-calpain based on the concentration of calcium required for their respective function in vitro (22Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Ono Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Because physiological concentrations of calcium are in the range of 100–300 nm, it is hypothesized that other mechanisms exist to lower the activation threshold of calcium required for calpain activation in vivo(22Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 24Molinari M. Carafoli E. J Membr Biol. 1997; 156: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Calpains are heterodimeric proteins consisting of a large catalytic 80-kDa subunit, and a smaller 29-kDa regulatory subunit. Calpain is involved in diverse physiologic roles including cell-cycle regulation (26Choi Y.H. Lee S.J. Nguyen P. Jang J.S. Lee J., Wu, M.L. Takano E. Maki M. Henkart P.A. Trepel J.B. J. Biol.

Calpain proteolysis occurs in a limited fashion, producing distinct peptide fragments without further degradation (32Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary structure is likely to affect substrate specificity, since many proteins contain consensus calpain sequences but are not susceptible to cleavage (32Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins that have been identified as substrates of calpain include the cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and members of the integrin family (33Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I.

In adenocarcinoma, the disruption of cellular adhesion appears to rise, in part, through alterations of the E-cadherin cell-adhersion system (35Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). However, proteolytic mechanisms of E-cadherin inactivation in cancer have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigated whether E-cadherin is a substrate for calpain, and whether calpain-dependent proteolysis of E-cadherin was associated with prostate cancer progression. The cell lines LNCaP, MCF-7, and SKBR3 were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C and subcultured weekly. The engineered stable cell lines were maintained by adding 0.8 μg/ml puromycin or 1 mg/ml G418 to the culture media. TPA1 (Alexis Biochemicals) was dissolved in 100% ethanol, aliquoted, and used at a final concentration of 10 nm. Ionomycin, calpain inhibitor I, calpain inhibitor II, calpain inhibitor III, and calpeptin were all obtained from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide was obtained from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 50 μm. Cells were treated with cycloheximide 30 min prior to TPA treatment. SK-Ecad was generated by transfection of a plasmid that contained wild-type human E-cadherin in the pLK-pac vector with a 2×-Myc epitope added to the last codon (gift from Dr. Margaret Wheelock) and was selected with puromycin. Transfection was done with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as instructed. E-cadherin mutants were generated from wild-type human E-cadherin cDNA cloned into the pcDNA3 vector that contained a 2×-Myc epitope added to the last codon. Transfections with pcDNA3-based vectors were done with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and selected with G418. Protein lysates were prepared from tissue and cultured cells in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet p-40, 40 μm PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μmorthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA. Tissue was homogenized prior to lysing. Cells were allowed to lyse 1 h on ice, centrifuged, supernatants extracted, and quantitated using a Bradford assay. Lysates were separated by 6% Novex gels and analyzed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (36Zhao X. Gschwend J.E. Powell C.T. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22751-22757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membranes were stripped with the following stripping solution: 62.5 mmTris pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Following ECL and washing, the membrane was incubated with the stripping solution for 30 min at 55 °C, with gentle shaking every 5 min. Densitometry analysis was performed as previously described (21Rashid M.G. Sanda M.G. Vallorosi C.J. Rios-Doria J. Rubin M.A. Day M.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were prepared and quantitated as described above. The lysates were pre-cleared for 30 min at 4 °C with the appropriate Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories) conjugated with protein G or A prior to immunoprecipitation reactions. All beads were diluted and mixed for 1 h at room temperature with an equal volume of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl) + 2.5% milk prior to use. Following pre-clearing, lysates were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, where an equal volume of lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation reaction. The volumes of each reaction were equalized to 500 μl with lysis buffer, 5 μg of primary antibody was added, and the reaction was carried out at 4 °C rotating end-over-end. The following day, the appropriate Sepharose beads were added and the reaction was allowed to continue to rotate end-over-end at 4 °C for 90 min. The beads were then pelleted and washed three times with lysis buffer (+ protease inhibitors). Reducing sample buffer was added to each pellet, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged, and the supernatants loaded onto 6% NOVEX Tris-Gly (Invitrogen) gels for Western analysis. 2.0 × 105 LNCaP or MCF-7 cells were plated in 6-well plates. 72 h later, cells were pre-treated with 20 μm of the calpain inhibitors in fresh serum-containing media for 15 min. Cells were then treated with 10 μm ionomycin for 20 min. Cells were harvested, lysed, quantitated, and 30 μg of protein per sample were loaded onto 6% NOVEX gels for Western analysis. Antibodies used for the detection of E-cadherin were HECD-1 (Zymed Laboratories), E-9 (16Wheelock M.J. Buck C.A. Bechtol K.B. Damsky C.H. J. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and SC-1499 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments were p120 (Transduction Laboratories), β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories, CAT-5H10), and γ-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). μ-Calpain antibody was purchased from Calbiochem and α-spectrin was purchased from Chemicon. The normal goat IgG antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rat, or anti-goat secondary antibodies were obtained from Amresco and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated (as described above) from LNCaP cell lysates with the C20820 antibody. After the third wash with lysis buffer (+ protease inhibitors), the supernatants were removed, and the reactions placed on ice. The Sepharose beads were then re-suspended in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer and divided equally into five Eppendorf tubes for five separate reactions. They were then centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, the supernatants removed, and tubes placed on ice. For the calpain assay, the following proteolysis buffer was used at 25 μl per reaction: 100 mm HEPES, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mmCaCl2. A separate buffer that contained 10 mmEGTA was also used. Reactions were started by adding 0.4 units of μ-calpain, 0.95 units of m-calpain, or 50 units of caspase-3 (all from Calbiochem) and were carried out at room temperature. For the caspase-3 assay, the following proteolysis buffer was used at 25 μl per reaction: 100 mm HEPES, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm EGTA. Reducing sample buffer was added to each tube to stop the reaction at each time point. The reactions were boiled for 5 min and the supernatants were loaded onto 6% NOVEX Tris/Gly (Invitrogen) gels for Western analysis. E-cadherin deletion mutants were generated using the Quikchange kit (Stratagene). The parental plasmid was wild-type full-length human E-cadherin cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) with a 2× c-Myc tag cloned in-frame at the C terminus. The primers used were as follows: 791Δ5, forward: 5′-GACGTTGCACCAACCCGGTATCTTCC-3′, reverse: 5′-GGAAGATACCGGGTTGGTGCAACGTC-3′; 795Δ5, forward: 5′-CTCATGAGTGTCCGCCCTGCCAATC- 3′, reverse: 5′-GATTGGCAGGGCGGACACTCATGAG-3′; 782Δ6, forward: 5′-GACGCTCGGCCTGAAGCACCAACCCTCATG-3′, reverse: 5′-CATGAGGGTTGGTGCTTCAGGCCGAGCGTC-3′. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing at the University of Michigan sequencing Core facility. Analysis of samples were performed as previously described (39Dhanasekaran S.M. Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R. Varambally S. Kurachi K. Pienta K.J. Rubin M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA generated from prostate samples (i.e. prostate cancer) and benign prostate tissue (reference) samples were labeled with distinguishable fluorescent dyes and hybridized to the cDNA microarray (10,000 clones). The cDNA microarray was analyzed using a scanner, and fluorescence ratios were determined for each gene. Color intensities were converted into ratios of gene expression. These ratios are imported into a data base for further analysis. To test for significant differences in the mean cDNA expression between all tissue types, we performed a one-way ANOVA test. To determine differences between all pairs (e.g. localized prostate cancer versusbenign), we performed a post-hoc analysis using the Scheffémethod. The mean expression scores for all examined cases were presented in a graphical format using error bars with 95% confidence intervals. The results were considered to be significant whenp < 0.05. Patients with localized prostate cancer provided written informed consent in an Institutional Review Board (IRB)- approved study at the University of Michigan to have their prostate tissue evaluated in experimental studies. These fresh radical prostatectomy specimens were obtained through the University of Michigan prostate cancer SPORE tissue bank and were frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min after surgical excision. Histological confirmation of both tumor and normal regions of each prostate gland were confirmed by a genitourinary pathologist at the University of Michigan, and the corresponding tumor or normal region was excised before processing for protein analysis (21Rashid M.G. Sanda M.G. Vallorosi C.J. Rios-Doria J. Rubin M.A. Day M.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar). A Rapid Autopsy Protocol has been previously described (40Rubin M.A. Zhou M. Dhanasekaran S.M. Varambally S. Barrette T.R. Sanda M.G. Pienta K.J. Ghosh D. Chinnaiyan A.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Permission for an autopsy was granted from patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer to participate in an IRB-approved tissue donor program at the University of Michigan. Metastases from prostate cancer were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The metastases were confirmed as prostate cancer in origin by a genitourinary pathologist at the University of Michigan. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that PKC activation induces a signal transduction pathway that leads to the truncation of E-cadherin in prostate and mammary epithelial cells (41Vallorosi C.J. Day K.C. Zhao X. Rashid M.G. Rubin M.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3328-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 42Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D. Fair W.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PKC has a number of physiological ramifications in the cell, including cell proliferation and differentiation, changes in gene expression, and transmembrane ion transport (43Idris I. Gray S. Donnelly R. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 659-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that E-cadherin cleavage may be due to the influx of calcium ions initiated by PKC activation. To specifically address the role of calcium in the cleavage of E-cadherin, we treated LNCaP cells with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, and observed the rapid accumulation of a novel 100-kDa fragment of E-cadherin that was designated E-cad100 (Fig. 1 A, top panel). Ionomycin did not result in the accumulation of the previously described E-cadherin species, E-cad97. Due to the apparent role of calcium in E-cadherin cleavage, we speculated that the calcium-dependent protease calpain may mediate the cleavage of E-cadherin. E-cadherin cleavage and the accumulation of E-cad100 was dramatically inhibited in cells pretreated with the calpain inhibitors calpain inhibitor I, calpain inhibitor II or calpeptin (Fig. 1 A, top panel). These inhibitors had no effect on the generation of the 97-kDa species ruling out the possibility that calpain generates both fragments. E-cadherin cleavage to 100 kDa was also prevented by calpain inhibitor I following TPA treatment (data not shown). To help confirm that ionomycin induced a calpain-mediated cleavage of E-cadherin, we re-probed the membranes with an α-spectrin antibody. α-Spectrin is a well documented calpain substrate with a molecular mass of 280 kDa that is cleaved by calpain to produce a 145/150-kDa doublet (33Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 319 (, (Pt 3)): 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The resulting α-spectrin immunoblot revealed that spectrin cleavage was induced by ionomycin, and that this induction was effectively inhibited by calpain inhibitors (Fig. 1 A,middle panel). In the inactive state, calpain exists as pro-enzyme heterodimer of 80–29 kDa, and following calcium binding undergoes autolysis to an active 78–18 kDa heterodimer (32Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, using the same membrane, we assayed for the autolysis of the large subunit of calpain by immunoblot (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). Although faint, immunoblot analysis revealed a clear conversion of the 80-kDa large subunit to the 78-kDa active monomer following the addition of ionomycin. Pretreatment of LNCaP cells with calpain inhibitor I, calpain inhibitor II, and calpeptin prevented this autolysis. A similar experiment was performed using MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1 B). MCF-7 cells were pretreated with calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin prior to ionomycin treatment. Fig. 1 B shows that these inhibitors effectively blocked E-cadherin cleavage by ionomycin. Re-probing the membrane for α-spectrin shows that calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin blocked calpain-mediated spectrin cleavage (Fig 1 B, middle panel). Although partial, re-probing with μ-calpain antibody showed some inhibition of autolysis of the μ-calpain large subunit (Fig. 1 B,bottom panel). We observed that calpain inhibitor 3 slightly reduced the amount of calpain; this may be an indirect effect of the inhibitor on calpain stability. Taken together, these data show that ionomycin treatment of LNCaP and MCF-7 cells induces a calpain-dependent truncation of E-cadherin to the 100-kDa form that was significantly inhibited by calpain inhibitors. To determine if purified calpain could generate E-cad100 in vitro, we incubated E-cadherin immunopurified from untreated LNCaP cells with either μ- or m-calpain. In the presence of both isozymes, full-length E-cadherin was rapidly cleaved to the 100-kDa fragment, and this truncation could be completely inhibited by addition of the calcium chelator EGTA (Fig. 2, A andB). In the absence of calpain, the 100-kDa product was not detected. Over the course of 20 min, some general degradation of E-cadherin was observed, which was unrelated to the effects of calpain cleavage of E-cadherin. These results provide compelling evidence that both μ- and m-calpain can specifically cleave mature E-cadherin to the 100-kDa fragment in vitro. Examination of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin revealed a potential caspase-3 cleavage site within residues 747DTRD. Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease that is involved in proteolytic breakdown during the execution of apoptosis and has been implicated in the cleavage of E-cadherin (20Steinhusen U. Weiske J. Badock V.V. Tauber R. Bommert K. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). We wanted to determine if E-cad100 was generated by caspase-3. A similar in vitro assay was performed using purified caspase-3, which failed to demonstrate cleavage of E-cadherin to E-cad100 (data not shown). We utilized the E-cad−/− mammary epithelial cell line SKBR3 (44Pierceall W.E. Woodard A.S. Morrow J.S. Rimm D. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1319-1326PubMed Google Scholar) to exogenously express E-cadherin. We selected stable clones that expressed moderate to high levels of the 2×-Myc-tagged E-cadherin protein, which migrates at a slightly higher molecular weight of 130 kDa (37Nieman M.T. Kim J.B. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PKC in these E-cad-expressing SKBR3 cells (termed SK-Ecad) revealed the rapid accumulation of E-cad100 over a course of 12 h (Fig. 3). PKC activation by TPA treatment did not induce expression of any endogenous E-cadherin protein in untransfected SKBR3 cells. We also noticed a dramatic increase in the expression levels of E-cadherin in the transfectants following TPA-treatment; however, the mechanism through which this up-regulation occurs is currently unclear, as the E-cadherin cDNA is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and does not contain any phorbol-responsive elements. To address whether increased expression of E-cadherin was required for cleavage, LNCaP cells were pretreated with cycloheximide prior to TPA treatment. Fig. 4demonstrates that blocking E-cadherin synthesis with cycloheximide did not prevent cleavage. Thus, protein synthesis is not required for calpain-dependent cleavage of E-cadherin. In order to determine what proportion of E-cadherin is cleaved in cell culture, we performed densitometry on multiple E-cadherin Western blots in which E-cad100 has been induced with ionomycin or TPA. On average, the amount of total cellular E-cadherin cleaved was ∼30% (data not shown).Figure 4E-cadherin synthesis is not required for cleavage. LNCaP cells were pretreated with 50 μmcycloheximide"

This is a bypass of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in which isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (GlcB) catalyze the net incorporation of carbon during growth of microorganisms on acetate or fatty acids as the primary carbon source. The glcB gene from M. tuberculosis, which encodes malate synthase, was cloned, and GlcB was expressed inEscherichia coli. The influence of media conditions on expression in M. tuberculosis indicated that this enzyme is regulated differentially to isocitrate lyase. Purified GlcB hadK m values of 57 and 30 μm for its substrates glyoxylate and acetyl coenzyme A, respectively, and was inhibited by bromopyruvate, oxalate, and phosphoenolpyruvate. The GlcB structure was solved to 2.1-Å resolution in the presence of glyoxylate and magnesium. We also report the structure of GlcB in complex with the products of the reaction, coenzyme A and malate, solved to 2.7-Å resolution.

Isocitrate lyase and malate synthase are the two enzymes of this pathway, which has been described in various eubacteria, fungi, and plants (see Ref. 4Cioni M. Pinzauti G. Vanni P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 70: 1-26Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar for a review). In the glyoxylate bypass, isocitrate lyase (ICL)1 and malate synthase (GlcB) function sequentially to convert isocitrate to succinate plus glyoxylate and glyoxylate plus acetyl-CoA to malate and CoA, respectively. Together catalysis by ICL and GlcB ensures the bypass of two oxidative steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, permitting net incorporation of carbon during growth of most microorganisms on acetate or fatty acids as the primary carbon source. Thus, the glyoxylate bypass conserves carbon and ensures an adequate supply of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates for biosynthetic purposes when cells convert lipids to carbohydrates. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis isocitrate lyase activity is increased when the bacilli are in an environment of low oxygen tension or in a transition from an actively replicating to a non-replicating state (5Kannan K.B.

In addition, at least the first enzyme of the glyoxylate bypass of M. tuberculosis is up-regulated when grown in a medium containing either acetate or palmitate as the main carbon source or upon infection of macrophages (3McKinney J.D. Höner zu Bentrup K. Munoz-Elias E.J. Miczak A. Chen B. Chan W.T. Swenson D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs W.R., Jr. Russell D.G.

It has also been shown that a Δicl mutant of M. tuberculosis is unable to maintain a persistent infection in a mouse model (3McKinney J.D. Höner zu Bentrup K. Munoz-Elias E.J. Miczak A. Chen B. Chan W.T. Swenson D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs W.R., Jr. Russell D.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of this pathway to the bacteria in sustaining a chronic infection. The pathway also appears to be critical in the virulence of other intracellular pathogens. Both genes of the glyoxylate bypass, ICL1 and MLS1, encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, respectively, were induced upon phagocytosis of Candida albicans by macrophages (8Lorenz M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 2001; 412: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A mutant of C. albicanslacking ICL1 was less virulent in mice than wild-type (8Lorenz M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 2001; 412: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The glyoxylate pathway has also been implicated in the pathogenesis ofBrucella abortus (9Hong P.C. Tsolis R.M. Ficht T.A. Infect. Immunol. 2000; 68: 4102-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and Rhodococcus equi (10Kelly B.G. Wall D.M. Boland C.A. Meijer W.G.

Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Goethals K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A single malate synthase gene called glcB (also referred to as aceB in M. tuberculosis CDC1551; MT1885; see www.tigr.org) has been identified in M. tuberculosisencoding a malate synthase G (MSG) (Rv1837c; see Ref. 12Cole S.T.

GlcB is an 80-kDa monomeric protein with 741 amino acid residues, which is homologous to malate synthase (AceB) of the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum (13Reinscheid D.J. Eikmanns B.J. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and MSG of the Gram-negative Escherichia coli (14Molina I. Pellicer M.T. Badia J. Aguilar J. Baldoma L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with ∼60% identity. A second group of malate synthases called malate synthase A (MSA) have been identified (15Vanderwinkel E. De Vlieghere M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Typically, MSAs have a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa and include MSA of E. coli K12 (16Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K.

The prokaryotic MSAs tend to be monomeric whereas eukaryotic enzymes of this group are homomultimers. There is high sequence identity within the MSA class (∼65%) whereas the similarity between the MSA- and MSG-type malate synthases is much lower at 18–20%, with MSA and MSG from E. coli K12 showing 18% identity. Sequence alignments of representatives from the MSA and MSG classes of malate synthase show 47 conserved residues among M. tuberculosis GlcB, M. leprae GlcB, E. coli K12 GlcB, C. glutamicumGlcB, E. coli AceB, and Y. pestis GlcB (see Fig. 1 a). Long term persistence is one of the hallmarks of an infection byM. tuberculosis and one of the main obstacles to the global control of the disease. TB remains a leading cause of mortality with ∼3 million deaths per year in the 1990s (19Parrish N.M. Dick J.D. Bishai W.R. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Anti-tubercular drugs that are currently available preferentially target bacteria during active growth and replication, requiring long treatment times to successfully clear a TB infection. The reliance on enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass for intracellular survival and persistent infection of M. tuberculosis (3McKinney J.D. Höner zu Bentrup K. Munoz-Elias E.J. Miczak A. Chen B. Chan W.T. Swenson D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs W.R., Jr. Russell D.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) and the absence of this pathway in mammals has led to interest in these enzymes as attractive novel targets for drug development. It is believed that drugs that are effective against persistent bacteria will clear an infection more quickly, reducing chemotherapy times and so decreasing the risk of development of multi-drug-resistant TB. In this work we investigate the expression of GlcB in M. tuberculosis under varying media conditions. We also purify recombinant malate synthase and present biochemical characterization of the enzyme together with its three-dimensional structure in a substrate-bound form and product-bound form. Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) containing 10% (v/v) OADC enrichment and 0.05% Tween 80 was used. Either modified Dubos medium was used as a defined minimal medium (2 g of asparagine, 1 g of KH2PO4, 2.5 g of Na2HPO4, 10 mg of MgSO4·7 H2O, 50 mg of ferric ammonium citrate, 0.5 mg of CaCl2, 0.1 mg of ZnSO4, 0.1 mg of CuSO4, 0.05% Tween 80, 0.5 g of Casitone (Difco), and 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin per liter), or unmodified Dubos medium was used (5 g of bovine serum albumin and 7.5 g of glucose per liter). Carbon sources were added to 10 mm with the exception of palmitate, which was added to 0.1% (v/v), and glycolate and acetate, which were used at 3 mm final concentration. Non-aerated cultures were grown as 55-ml cultures in flasks with 25-cm2 growth area, without stirring. Aeration of cultures was achieved with a 50-mm Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100-ml medium at a stir rate of 80 rpm. The M. tuberculosis strain CDC1551 was used. E. coli strains were grown in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were harvested, washed three times with PBST (PBS plus 0.05%Tween 80) and resuspended in Tricine buffer (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 100 μg/ml; pepstatin A, 50 μg/ml; leupeptin, 50 μg/ml; trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanidino)-butane, 50 μg/ml). The cells were disrupted with a “bead-beater” (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), and the lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 300,000 × g. A 2.3-kb DNA fragment containing the glcB gene was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CAG TAC ATA TGA CAG ATC GCG TGT C-3′ and 5′-ATA TTG GAT CCC GCA AGC GGG CGG T-3′ and M. tuberculosis CDC1551 DNA as the template. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into p6HisF-11d (kindly provided by Cheng-Ming Chiang, The Rockefeller University, New York). For overexpression, E. coliHB101(pGP1–2) cells carrying the recombinant p6HisF-11d(glcB) plasmid were grown to exponential phase at 30 °C in LB plus ampicillin. Expression of GlcB was induced by shifting the temperature to 42 °C for 20 min, followed by a shift to 37 °C for an additional 90 min. Cells were resuspended in Buffer 1 (50 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mmPipes, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (as above) and lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min. The cell extract was applied to metal affinity resin (Talon™, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) equilibrated with Buffer 1 and then washed with Buffer 1. The His-tagged protein was eluted with Buffer 2 (as Buffer 1, plus 5% glycerol, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm imidazole). Fractions containing malate synthase activity that were greater than 90% pure were pooled. For the crystallization of the GlcB, p6HisF-11d(glcB) plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm in LB media. For the production of selenomethionyl malate synthase, the plasmid was transformed into E. coliB834(DE3) cells, a methionine auxotrophic strain, and the protein was overexpressed in a minimal media containing selenomethionine. Malate synthase was purified by Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography (HiTrap metal-chelating column; AmershamBiosciences). The His6 tag was removed using the protease thrombin, and the enzyme without the tag was further purified by Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography. The protein was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol at −80 °C prior to crystallization. Malate synthase was assayed at room temperature in 96-well plates. Typically, 50 μl of 20 mm Tricine-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 2 mmglyoxylate, and 2 mm acetyl-CoA were mixed with 50 μl of the purified protein (0.16 mg/ml) in Tricine-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.8 mm EDTA buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The enzyme-catalyzed reaction was stopped by adding DTNB to a final concentration of 2 mm in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The amount of CoA-SH released was measured by titrating the free thiol groups with the DTNB and measuring the change in absorbance at 412 nm. TheK m and V max values were determined using a double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk or Hanes-Woolf plot. K i values were determined from linear replots of Lineweaver-Burk slopes versus inhibitor concentrations (21Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). To determine the pH optimum for malate synthase activity, assays were performed using MES/NaOH at pH 5.5, 6, and 6.5, MOPS/NaOH at pH 6.5, 7, and 7.5, Tricine/HCl at pH 7.5, 8, and 8.5, and Tris/HCl at pH 8.5 and 9 in place of 20 mm Tricine-HCl, pH 7.5. The metal ion dependence of malate synthase was investigated by preincubating the enzyme with 5 mm MnCl2, CoCl2, FeCl2, CaCl2, BaCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, and HgCl2 in place of MgCl2. Antibodies against two internal fragments of GlcB (QNTMKIGIMDEERRTT (MS1) and YTEPILHRRRREFKAR (MS2)) were produced in New Zealand White rabbits after coupling the peptide to ovalbumin. The polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using the respective antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. pGlcB::red (glcB::DsRed™) was derived from pMV262 (22Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. et al.Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) by substituting the glcB promoter (227-bp 5′ of the start codon of glcB) and theglcB open reading frame fused at the 3′ end to the DsRed™ red fluorescent protein (Clontech). Flow cytometry to quantify levels of GlcB::DsRed was carried out using a FACScalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). A 488-nm argon-ion laser was used for excitation, and the emission detector (FL-2) was set to a 585-nm filter with a 42-nm bandpass. Analysis was performed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Bacterium-sized particles were detected by their side- and forward-scatter profiles (23Russo-Marie F. Roederer M. Sager B. Herzenberg L.A. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8194-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). FL-2, forward-, and side-scatter data were collected using logarithmic amplifiers. Data were collected on 104 bacterium-sized particles per sample. Bacteria were pelleted (2,000 ×g, 20 min), fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min), washed once (PBS/0.05% Tween 80/0.1% bovine serum albumin), and resuspended in PBS/Tween. The relative fluorescence is expressed as geometric mean fluorescence above background. Crystals of malate synthase were produced by the microbatch method in 3-μl drops containing 3–5 mg/ml protein, 15% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.05 m MgCl2 at 17 °C, covered by paraffin oil. Crystals were observed after 2–3 days and grew to the size of ∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm after 1–2 weeks. The crystals belonged to the space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 78.1 Å, c = 223.2 Å, contained one molecule per asymmetric unit, and had an estimated solvent content of ∼42%. Crystals of selenomethionyl malate synthase were produced as described above and were isomorphous with the native protein crystals. Crystals containing the products malate and CoA were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion. The protein (∼9 mg/ml) was pre-incubated for 20 min with 2 mm acetyl-CoA and 2 mm glyoxylate in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 at room temperature. 2.5 μl of the protein was mixed with 2.5 μl of 1.6 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 10% Dioxane. These crystals belonged to the space group P41212with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 120.78 Å, c = 232.8 Å, two molecules per asymmetric unit, and a solvent content of ∼55%. MAD diffraction data for a single selenomethionyl crystal were collected at beamline 19ID at the Structural Biology Center (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, on a 3 × 3 mosaic CCD area detector. 30% PEG400 was added to the precipitant solution as a cryoprotectant, and crystals were flash-cooled in a liquid nitrogen stream (120 K). Data sets at 4 wavelengths were collected on a single crystal (λ1 = 0.9792 Å (edge, f′), λ2 = 0.9794 Å (peak, f“), λ3 = 0.9421 Å (high energy remote), and λ4 = 1.0197 Å (low energy remote)). The data were processed using the HKL2000 package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C. Sweet R. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar, 25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Rossman M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar). Data on the product-bound malate synthase crystal were collected at beamline 14BMC (BioCars; Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory) at 1.0 Å using paratone-N as the cryoprotectant. The data were integrated, scaled, and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C. Sweet R. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Seventeen selenium sites were automatically identified using the program SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). SHARP was used to refine the position of the selenium sites, and the phase was calculated between 20 to 2.5 Å (27de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Carter C. Sweet R. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 472-494Google Scholar). Solvent flattening using DM (CCP4) (28Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and phase extension to 2.1 Å were used to improve the electron density maps. With the initial experimental map, ∼85% of the sequence was assigned unambiguously and was built in the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). After simulated annealing refinement of the initial model in CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

A magnesium ion and a glyoxylate molecule were built into the active site. 453 water molecules were added using WATERPICK in CNS. Several rounds of positional minimization and B-factor refinement were carried out in CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

The final model contains 701 amino acids (>94%) consisting of residues 2–70, 77–301, 312–381, and 386–727. The missing residues were unable to be built, because the electron density was too weak. 91.4% of the residues were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, and none were in the disallowed region as verified using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

The structure of malate synthase complexed with malate and CoA was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (CCP4) (32Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The structure of GlcB-glyoxylate, with all the non-protein atoms excluded, was used as the search model. Two solutions were found after rigid-body refinement with a correlation coefficient of 66.1 and an Rfactor of 35.7. The model was refined by simulated annealing including non-crystallographic symmetry averaging of the two molecules (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Several rounds of manual correction of the model in O were carried out followed by positional minimization and B-factor refinement to improve the model. Coenzyme A and malate were observed in the active site in an Fo − Fc difference map. The final rounds of refinement were carried out in REFMAC5 using TLS restrained refinement (33CCP4 Acta Crystallgr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was not implemented in the final stages of refinement, once theR factor was ∼22%, and the R freewas ∼30%. At this stage, the statistics were improved without using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The final model contains 1434 residues (96%). Monomer A contains residues 5–303 and 309–727, a magnesium ion, two malate molecules, and a coenzyme A molecule. Monomer B contains residues 3–151, 156–303, and 309–727, a magnesium ion, a glyoxylate ion, and a malate molecule. Analysis of the protein crystals by SDS-PAGE showed no indication of proteolysis of the 80-kDa protein. 640 water molecules were added by inspection of an Fo −Fc map. The final refined structure has anR factor of 19.0% and R free of 28.7% (Table I) with more than 88% of the residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot (31Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Unlike ICL, whose activity increased ∼4-fold, malate synthase expression decreased ∼2-fold under microaerophilic conditions in rich medium (Middlebrook or Dubos) (3McKinney J.D. Höner zu Bentrup K. Munoz-Elias E.J. Miczak A. Chen B. Chan W.T. Swenson D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs W.R., Jr. Russell D.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with Wayne and Lin (6Wayne L.G. Lin K.Y. Infect. Immunol. 1982; 37: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who did not detect an increase in malate synthase activity upon adaptation to microaerophilic conditions, whereas isocitrate lyase activity increased significantly. Cultures grown in minimal medium supplemented with acetate, palmitate, or glucose did not show any significant differences with respect to GlcB expression, which is also in contrast to the ICL expression, which was up-regulated 2- to 3-fold with growth on acetate or palmitate (7Höner Zu Bentrup K. Miczak A. Swenson D.L. Russell D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7161-7167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). InM. tuberculosis, glycolate was the only carbon source that induced a significantly higher expression of GlcB (2-fold) as measured by flow cytometry and by Western blot analysis of cell lysates. InE. coli, growth on glycolate has been shown to up-regulate the expression of GlcB (14Molina I. Pellicer M.T. Badia J. Aguilar J. Baldoma L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These data suggest the GlcB of M. tuberculosis fulfills a role comparable with GlcB (MSG) ofE. coli. Our results indicate that GlcB and ICL from M. tuberculosisare regulated differentially and independently from each other. InE. coli, the genes for isocitrate lyase, malate synthase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase are in an operon under the control of the same promoter and repressor elements (34Cozzone A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 127-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The location of these genes are quite different in M. tuberculosis with ICL and GlcB being far apart on the chromosome. In C. glutamicum, the aceA, encoding isocitrate lyase, and aceB, encoding malate synthase, genes are organized in an antiparallel way that predicts that both genes are expressed independently from their own promoters (13Reinscheid D.J.

However, the role of p38 in insulin action remains controversial. We further test p38 participation in glucose uptake using a dominant-negative p38 mutant and two novel pharmacological p38 inhibitors related to but different from SB203580. We present the structures and activities of the azaazulene pharmacophores A291077 and A304000. p38 kinase activity was inhibited in vitro by A291077 and A304000 (IC50 = 0.6 and 4.7 μm). At higher concentrations A291077 but not A304000 inhibited JNK2α (IC50 = 3.5 μm). Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes expressing GLUT4myc (L6-GLUT4myc myotubes) with A291077, A304000, SB202190, or SB203580 reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 50–60%, whereas chemical analogues inert toward p38 were ineffective. Expression of an inducible, dominant-negative p38 mutant in 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface, immunodetected on plasma membrane lawns of 3T3-L1 adipocytes or on intact L6-GLUT4myc myotubes, was not altered by chemical or molecular inhibition of p38. We propose that p38 contributes to enhancing GLUT4 activity, thereby increasing glucose uptake.

Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in mature skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and insulin-responsive cells in culture by recruiting glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, although SB203580 reduced insulin-mediated glucose in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 muscle cells, it did not diminish GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (13Sweeney G. Somwar R.

Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This reduction in glucose uptake by SB203580 was because of a decrease in the transport V max with no effect on the apparent K m for glucose (14Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we proposed that insulin activates GLUT4 via a p38-dependent signaling pathway. In contrast to these reports, a recent study (29Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Onishi Y. Ono H. Funaki M. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol.

These conflicting results prompted us to re-examine the role of p38 in the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin. To this end, a dominant-negative p38 mutant under the influence of an inducible promoter was expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, two novel inhibitors of p38 that are structurally different from the pyridine imidazoles were identified and used to determine their effect on the stimulation of glucose uptake in L6 cells expressing Myc-tagged GLUT4 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) fusion protein, phospho-specific antibodies to ATF2 (Thr-71) and p38 (Thr-180 and Tyr-182), and anti-p38 antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GLUT1 and anti-GLUT4 C-terminal antibodies were from Biogenesis (Sandown, NH). Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2), cytochalasin B, and forskolin were from Sigma. Partially purified rabbit MKK6 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) was obtained from Fisher. SB202190, SB203580, and phospho-specific CREB antibody (S133) were purchased from Calbiochem. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Pierce. Indinavir was provided by Merck. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. B. B.

Briefly, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (v/v), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (100 units per ml each), and 1% glutamine (v/v) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 9% CO2. Differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes was initiated 2 days following confluence. Cells were used for experiments only when more than 90% of the cells showed accumulation of lipid droplets. Adipocytes were deprived of serum for 3 h prior to all experimental manipulations. Inhibitors were administered in Me2SO, and the maximum concentration of the solvent in the incubation medium did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). This concentration of the vehicle was without effect on any of the parameters measured. Cells were generated and described previously (31Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length mouse p38α was obtained by PCR using a 3T3-L1 fibroblast library as a template (32Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The product was cloned into pCB7 vector as aHindIIII fragment. This construct served as the template to replace threonine 180 and tyrosine 182 with alanine and phenylalanine, respectively. The mutant obtained, p38AGF, was also used in previous studies (33Wang Y.

A C-terminal FLAG tag was introduced to distinguish between endogenous and transfected p38. The resulting fragment was cloned into vector pOPI3 (Stratagene) as a NotI fragment. The p38 insert was sequenced on both strands to confirm the mutation. This system allows relatively tight repression in the absence of the inducer IPTG. The plasmid was co-transfected into 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with plasmid pCMVLacI (Stratagene), and stable transformants were isolated in the presence of hygromycin. These p38AGF-3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in the continuous presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin and differentiated as described above for wild type 3T3-L1 cells. Expression of the p38AGF-FLAG cDNA was induced in adipocytes by growing cells for 48 h in the presence of 5 mmIPTG. GLUT4myc cDNA was constructed by inserting the human c-Myc epitope (14 amino acids) into the first ectodomain of GLUT4 and subcloned into the pCXN2 vector as described earlier (36Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was stably transfected into L6 myoblasts as described previously (37Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The resulting L6-GLUT4myc cells were characterized previously (38Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A.

Myoblasts were maintained in minimal essential medium-α (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C and were differentiated into myotubes by growing in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (v/v). Cells were deprived of serum for 4 h prior to all experimental manipulations. Inhibitors were administered in Me2SO, and the maximum concentration of the solvent in the incubation medium did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). This concentration of the vehicle was without effect on any of the parameters measured. Inhibitors were administered to cells for 40 min; when indicated, insulin (100 nm) was added during the last 20 min of this incubation. Cells were washed twice, and glucose transport was assayed in HEPES-buffered saline solution (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-Na, 2.5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmKCl, pH 7.4) containing 10 μm2-deoxy-d-glucose (0.5 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose) as described previously (41Somwar R. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Clin. Ther. 1998; 20: 125-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Uptake measurements were carried out in the absence of inhibitors, unless indicated otherwise. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B and was subtracted from all values. 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on glass coverslips were treated as indicated in the respective figure legends. Plasma membrane lawns were prepared as described previously (13Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol.

Following the various treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Hypotonic swelling buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) was added in three quick rinses. Breaking buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm microcystin) was added, and the solution was aspirated up and down using a 1.0-ml pipette to promote cell breakage. The coverslips were washed twice with breaking buffer and incubated with cold 3% paraformaldehyde (v/v) in PBS for 10 min on ice, followed by three washes in PBS. Excess fixative was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min, followed by three washes with PBS at room temperature. The plasma membrane lawns were subsequently blocked by a 1-h incubation in 5% goat serum (v/v) in PBS at room temperature and then incubated for 60 min with anti-GLUT1 or anti-GLUT4 C-terminal antibodies (1:250 dilution each) at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies (1:250) were added for 45 min and then washed four times with PBS. Coverslips were placed on microscope slides with mounting solution (Dako). Images of plasma membrane lawns (“sheets”) were obtained using a Leica DM1RB inverted fluorescence microscope with a 40× objective. All images were collected under identical gain settings using Winview software and processed with Adobe Photoshop software for figure production. NIH Image software was used to quantitate fluorescence intensity. For quantitation, the fluorescence/unit area of each lawn was measured in several fields containing multiple lawns. Results were normalized to that of control in each experiment. GLUT4myc levels at the cell surface were measured by an antibody-coupled optical assay as described previously (38Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Following treatments, myotubes were washed once with PBS, fixed for 3 min with 3% paraformaldehyde (v/v) at room temperature, and then neutralized with 1% glycine (w/v) in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Monolayers were blocked with 10% (v/v) goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS at 4 °C for at least 30 min and then incubated with anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, 1:100) at 4 °C for 60 min. Myotubes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, 4 °C) for 30 min. Following removal of secondary antibody, cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 ml of OPD reagent (0.4 mg/mlO-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.4 mg/ml urea hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 m phosphate-citrate buffer) per well. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.25 ml of 3 mHCl. Optical absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 492 nm. Lysates were prepared as described (14Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Following appropriate incubations, cells were lysed on ice with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4and 100 nm okadaic acid), and protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm leupeptin), passed 5 times through a 25-gauge syringe, and heated for 15 min at 65 °C. Fifty micrograms of total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the respective phospho-specific antibody. Kinase activity of recombinant p38 was determined in vitro as follows. p38 (0.7 μg) was activated by incubating with 4 milliunits of rabbit MKK6 for 1 h at 30 °C in Reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmDTT) supplemented with 50 μm ATP. Inhibitors were dissolved in Reaction buffer containing 10 μm ATP, added at the desired final concentration to the activated p38, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Kinase reaction was initiated by adding Reaction buffer supplemented with 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 7.5 μg of ATF2 fusion protein. After 1 h at 30 °C, ATF2 was precipitated with 1% phosphoric acid, filtered, and washed with 0.1% phosphoric acid (v/v) in Millipore MAPH plates. Packard microscint-20 was added, and the plate was counted on a Packard TopCount. Inhibitors were added to 2 μg of active JNK2α in Reaction buffer 1 as described above for p38 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Kinase reaction was carried out in Reaction buffer containing 8 μg of ATF2, 10 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 1 h at 30 °C, ATF2 was precipitated with 1% phosphoric acid (v/v), filtered, and washed with 0.1% phosphoric acid in Millipore MAPH plates. Packard Microscint-20 was added, and the plate was counted on Packard TopCount. Phospho-specific primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Anti-p38 MAPK antibody was used at a 1:1 000 dilution. Anti-FLAG antibody was used at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used at 1:15,000 dilution. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were exposed to x-ray film to produce bands within the linear range and then quantitated using NIH Image (National Institutes of Health software). Results were analyzed by analysis of variance, and groups were compared using the Tukey post-test. p38 is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, and acute synovitis. In addition, this enzyme is believed to participate in normal physiological processes such as adipocyte differentiation (31Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin (13Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A.

Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The biological functions of p38 mentioned here have been assigned mainly by using the pyridinylimidazole class of p38 inhibitors such as SB203580 (3Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). Although SB203580 is believed to be specific for p38 (3Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar), it is important to confirm experimental results obtained with this drug by other strategies. To this end, several compounds with inhibitory action toward p38 were developed (Fig. 1). The design of the compounds was loosely based on the structure of the lead SmithKline Beecham analogue SB203580. However, A291077 and A304000 feature a novel azaazulene-derived pharmacophore as a replacement of the ubiquitous pyridinylimidazole nucleus of the SmithKline Beecham series. This modification seems to impart a greater degree of p38 selectivity toward certain members of the series. The synthesis of these compounds has been disclosed by Sciotti and Wagner (44Sciotti R. Wagner R. World Intellectual Property Organization. Abbott Laboratories, New York2001Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity and potency of the compounds were evaluated using an in vitro kinase assay. Inactive baculovirus-expressed human p38 was activated by partially purified rabbit MKK6 enzyme and then preincubated in vitro with increasing concentrations of A291077, A304000, A305267, or SB203580. Kinase activity toward ATF2 was then determined. The results are shown in Fig. 1. A291077 and A304000 reduced p38 activity in vitro with IC50 values of 0.6 and 4.7 μm, respectively. The structural analogue A305267, however, had no inhibitory action toward p38. SB203580 inhibited p38in vitro with IC50 of 0.3 μm. We also analyzed the effects of these compounds on the activity of the closely related MAPK, JNK2α (Fig. 1). Compared with inhibition of p38, A291077 showed a 6-fold lower potency for JNK2α, inhibiting the enzyme with IC50 of 3.5 μm in vitro. Similarly, SB203580 showed a 5-fold lower potency for JNK2α, inhibiting this kinase in vitro with IC50 of 1.4 μm. In contrast, A304000 reduced JNK2α activity only at much higher concentrations than needed to inhibit p38 (only 37% inhibition at 100 μm). A305267 (up to 100 μm) did not affect JNK2α activity. Several other protein kinases including protein kinase B/Akt, casein kinase-2, and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2) were relatively insensitive to inhibition by A291077 and A304000 (TableI). These results suggest that A291077 and A304000 are potent inhibitors of p38.Table IIC50 values for inhibition of several protein kinases by A291077 and A304000Protein kinaseIC50 for inhibitionin vitroA291077A304000μmp380.64.7Akt15.5>50Casein kinase 2>50>50MAPKAPK2>50>50Protein kinase A7.3>50Protein kinase C>50>50The effect of A291077 and A304000 on the kinase activity of the indicated recombinant proteins was determined in vitro.

To determine whether these agents also inhibit p38 signaling in intact cells, we monitored their effects on phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP-response element binder (CREB), a downstream effector of p38. Phosphorylation of CREB induced by insulin, fibroblast growth factor, or ultraviolet radiation is abrogated by pretreating cells with 10 μm SB203580 (14Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W.

https://openalex.org/W1963564407,"Induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells with staurosporine produced a rise in the intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). Intracellular alkalinization was accompanied by translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, cytochrome<i>c</i> release, and cell death. The chloride channel inhibitor furosemide prevented intracellular alkalinization, Bax translocation, cytochrome <i>c</i> release, and cell death. Translocation of full-length Bid to the mitochondria was also prevented by furosemide. The cleavage product of Bid degradation (truncated Bid, tBid) was not detectable in the mitochondria. Its accumulation in the cytosol was prevented by furosemide. Apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) lowered pH<sub>i</sub>, an effect also accompanied by Bax translocation, cytochrome <i>c</i>release, and cell killing. Furosemide prevented all of these events. TNF induced a depletion of full-length Bid from the mitochondria and the cytosol but induced an accumulation of mitochondrial tBid. Furosemide only delayed full-length Bid depletion and tBid accumulation. The caspase 8 inhibitor IETD did not prevent the translocation of Bax. Although IETD did inhibit the cleavage of Bid and the accumulation of tBid, cell killing was reduced only slightly. It is concluded that with either staurosporine or TNF a furosemide-sensitive change in pH<sub>i</sub> is linked to Bax translocation, cytochrome <i>c</i> release, and cell killing. With TNF Bax translocation occurs as Bid is depleted and can be dissociated from the accumulation of tBid. With staurosporine a role for full-length Bid in Bax translocation cannot be excluded but is not necessary as evidenced by the data with TNF."
https://openalex.org/W1526564054,"Previously, we purified a UV-responsive p53 serine 392 kinase from F9 and HeLa cells and found that its activity is attributed to a high molecular weight protein complex containing the protein kinase CK2, along with the chromatin-associated factors hSPT16 and SSRP1.

Also, UV irradiation apparently induces the association of the complex, thereby increasing the specificity of CK2 for p53 at the expense of other cellular CK2 substrates and leading to an overall increase in p53 serine 392 phosphorylation.

After such stresses, p53 is converted from a latent form into an active transcription factor and primarily induces the expression of numerous target genes involved in cell damage control (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar, 11Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Concurrently, p53 protein levels dramatically increase through relief of targeted degradation to the proteasome (12Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

Thus many stress-activated signaling pathways connect to p53, which in turn activate expression of downstream effector pathways (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms by which stress signals are communicated to p53 is through post-translational modifications (17Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). These modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are believed to control the protein stability of p53 and transcriptional activity by affecting protein-protein interactions and intramolecular conformational changes (11Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation at several sites on the N-terminal domain in response to stress (5Hirao A.

Anderson C.W. Erickson J.W. Appella E. Xie D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10117-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In cells, the importance of Ser-392 phosphorylation for p53 function appears to be situation-specific. For example, overexpression of a p53 Ser-392 > Ala mutant suppressed cell growth equal to wild-type p53 in human osteosarcoma SAOS2 cells, but instead impaired the ability of p53 to suppress ras-mediated transformation in rat embryonic fibroblasts (28Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Also, transient transfection of p53 with a Ser-392 > Glu substitution, but not with six other phosphorylation mutants, constitutively activated p53 as a transcription factor in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts after cell growth arrest by contact inhibition (29Hao M. Lowy A.M. Kapoor M. Deffie A. Liu G. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29380-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that p53 Ser-392 is important for full p53 function. In multiple cell types, p53 Ser-392 is phosphorylated specifically after UV but not γ irradiation or etoposide (3Kapoor M. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2834-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 4Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Casein kinase 2 (CK2) was originally identified as the kinase that targets this sitein vitro (30Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear what the true kinase that targets this site is in cells. Previously, we used a biochemical fractionation to purify UV-responsive p53 Ser-392 kinase activity from murine testicular carcinoma F9 cells (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our results showed that indeed the kinase was CK2, but it eluted from gel filtration chromatography in a high molecular weight fraction corresponding to ∼700 kDa. We identified two other proteins that eluted with CK2 as hSPT16 and SSRP1. Together, these molecules are known in mammals as the chromatin associated factor, FACT (31Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when hSPT16 and SSRP1 are complexed with CK2, they change the substrate specificity of CK2 to phosphorylate p53 over all other tested substrates. However, it remains unclear how CK2 preferentially targets p53 as a substrate after association with hSPT16 and SSRP1 and how this kinase complex is activated by DNA damaging signals. To determine the mechanism by which the p53 Ser-392 kinase complex is activated by DNA damage, we have further characterized this complexin vitro and in cells. First, we have mapped the interaction domains between CK2, hSPT16, and SSRP1 in vitro and in cells, demonstrating that these proteins interact with each other via non-overlapping regions, consistent with the idea that they form a complex. Second, steady-state kinetic analysis of the kinase activity of CK2 shows that binding of hSPT16 and SSRP1 to CK2 inhibits casein phosphorylation while having no effect upon p53 phosphorylation and that hSPT16 and SSRP1 apparently do not bind to the substrate binding pocket of CK2 but instead are inhibiting casein phosphorylation in an indirect fashion. Furthermore, we find that hSPT16, SSRP1, and CK2 protein levels are dramatically increased in the column fraction that contains the UV-responsive p53 Ser-392 kinase activity. Thus these results demonstrate that the association of CK2 with SSRP1 and hSPT16 in cells is induced by DNA damage signals leading to specific targeting of p53 at Ser-392. Casein was purchased from Sigma. CK2 was purchased from Promega. Baculovirus expressing FLAG-WT-hSPT16 was as described (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G.

N-terminal SSRP1 (aa 1–242), mid-SSRP1 (aa 235–475), and C-SSRP1 (aa 471–709) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-KG. N- and C-SSRP1 were also subcloned into a FLAG-modified pCDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Polyclonal anti-CK2α′ and anti-p53 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, monoclonal anti-CK2β antibody was from Transduction Laboratory, Inc., and monoclonal anti-FLAG and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-Ser-392 phosphospecific p53 antibody was prepared as previously described (3Kapoor M. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polyclonal anti-SSRP1 antiserum was generated against full-length histidine-tagged SSRP1 and polyclonal anti-hSPT16 antiserum was made against the middle portion of the protein (aa 321–640). Histidine-tagged proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and then were either left on the beads or were digested with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the GST tag. The anti-SSRP1 antibody was purified as described previously (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Murine embryonic testicular carcinoma F9 cells containing wild-type p53 were grown on plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 4.5g/liter glucose and with l-glutamine (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells were grown on plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. GST fusion proteins overexpressed in bacteria were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer. The GST fusion protein levels were then equalized by loading onto SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 1 μg of fusion proteins were combined with 1 μg of soluble His-WT-SSRP1, FLAG-WT-hSPT16, His-CK2α′, or His-CK2β and incubated at room temperature for 40 min with light vortexing. The samples were washed once with lysis buffer, once with 1:3 diluted lysis buffer in water, once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and once with lysis buffer. They were then run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting (WB). GST-pull-down kinase assays were performed as above except that GST fusion proteins were combined with 1 unit of CK2 followed by washing three times with lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer. WB-kinase reactions were carried out as previously described (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol.

RKO cells were transfected with 3 μg of either pCDNA3.1, pCDNA3.1 FLAG-N-SSRP1, or pCDNA-FLAG-C-SSRP1 expression constructs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and transferred to 10-cm plates at low density. 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added to the media as a selectable marker, and the cells were maintained for 2–3 weeks until colonies became visible. Individual colonies were expanded into 12-well plates and screened for FLAG-N- or C-SSRP1 protein expression by WB with anti-FLAG and anti-SSRP1 antibodies. WB, co-IP, and IP kinase assays were carried out as previously described (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The WB in Fig.6 B was analyzed by a Bio-Rad Model GS700 imaging densitometer. FLAG-N- and FLAG-C-SSRP1 RKO cell lysates were used to perform co-IPs with the anti-FLAG antibody. hSPT16, SSRP1, and CK2α′ were immunoprecipitated with anti-SSRP1 from the P11 0.5 mKCl fractions of the F9 cell nuclear extract preparations as previously described. Radioactive in vitro kinase assays were performed with [γ-32P]ATP, in which the total ATP concentration (cold and hot) was 40 μm. Substrates were either 100 ng of His-p53 or 1 μg of casein. In Fig. 4 C, WT-SSRP1, N-hSPT16, and mid-hSPT16 proteins are histidine-tagged. N-SSRP1, mid-SSRP1, and C-SSRP1 are thrombin-cleaved from GST while bound to the glutathione-agarose. WT-hSPT16 is FLAG-tagged. Alternatively, kinase assays were done using unlabeled ATP (1 mm) followed by SDS-PAGE and then phosphorylated His-p53 was detected by WB using the anti-Ser-392 antibody.Figure 4SSRP1 and hSPT16 influence the substrate specificity of CK2. A, the p53 family member p63γ, but not p73α, is phosphorylated by CK2, although its phosphorylation is inhibited by SSRP1 and hSPT16. In vitro kinase reactions were done for 30 min using [γ-32P]ATP and using either 50 ng of His-p53, 150 ng of His-p63γ, or 500 ng of His-p73α as substrates. rFACT indicates recombinant SSRP1 and hSPT16 incubated together, titrated at 15 ng, and 30 ng of total protein.B, Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of the substrates used inpanel A (∼1 μg of each protein was loaded). Theasterisks indicate the proteins, and His-p73α exists as two polypeptides. C, a radioactive kinase assay was done as above with either His-p53 (100 ng, top panel) or casein (1 μg, bottom panel). CK2 was incubated along with the various SSRP1 and hSPT16 proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dots indicate that casein and the mid-SSRP1 construct are both phosphorylated by CK2 and have equal migration on SDS-PAGE. Thus, although casein phosphorylation inlane 6 is inhibited, the signal is actually due to mid-SSRP1 (see lane 6, compare the top and bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CK2 (0.5 unit) was incubated with or without 4 pmol of FACT (2 pmol of FLAG-hSPT16 and 2 pmol of His-SSRP1) on ice for 1 h. In vitro radioactive kinase assays were then carried out in the presence of 250 μm ATP (including 375 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 0.5 h while titrating substrates casein and His-p53. Casein concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 64 μm and His-p53 ranging from 0.037 to 9.4 μm were titrated into the CK2-FACT-ATP mixture. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the bands were cut out, and radioactivity was quantified using a Beckman model LS 6500 scintillation counter. Reaction velocities were obtained by measuring the picomoles of ATP incorporated into substrate per second and plotted against substrate concentration. Data points were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) to obtain values ofV max, K m, andV/K. In our previous study, the purified p53 Ser-392 kinase complex from murine testicular carcinoma F9 cells eluted from gel filtration chromatography at ∼700 kDa (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Seven polypeptides co-eluted with the kinase activity, five of which were identified as SSRP1, hSPT16, or the subunits of the CK2 heterotetramer. To determine whether hSPT16, SSRP1, and CK2 together can form a complexin vitro, we incubated these recombinant proteins together and loaded them onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Fig.1). When CK2 was run on the column alone, it eluted at close to the predicted molecular mass of the heterotetramer, 140 kDa (top panel). Interestingly, when recombinant hSPT16 and SSRP1 were mixed with CK2 and then run on the column, the p53 kinase activity of CK2 shifted to a high molecular mass fraction, at ∼670 kDa, and at a similar molecular weight to the native p53 Ser-392 kinase complex (middle panel, and see Ref. 26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The bottom panel is a Western blot for hSPT16 and SSRP1 when combined with CK2. The combined molecular masses of the proteins in the FACT·CK2 complex is predicted to be 360 kDa; thus we speculate that the recombinant complex contains multiple copies of some or all the components. Also, hSPT16, SSRP1, and CK2 appear to be the primary components of our previously purified native kinase complex, although it is still likely that other proteins may associate with this complex in cells. To characterize the interactions between members of the p53 Ser-392 kinase complex, we performedin vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) binding assays. GST-SSRP1 fusion proteins were made with either WT SSRP1 or with three deletion mutants that spanned the length of the protein (Fig. 2 A). We generated mutants for both the N terminus and middle region of hSPT16 (Fig.2 A) but were unable to generate either the WT or the C-terminal hSPT16 fusion proteins, because the C terminus of hSPT16 is apparently toxic to bacteria (our observations). 2D. Reinberg, personal communication. The Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel in Fig. 2 A shows that equal levels of the proteins were used, including a GST only (GST-0) control. As shown in Fig. 2 B, FLAG-WT-hSPT16 generated in baculovirus binds to GST-WT-SSRP1 in vitro and also to GST-N-SSRP1 (amino acids 1–242), although with an apparent decrease in affinity (left panel, compare lanes 7 and 8). In the reverse experiment, His-WT-SSRP1 binds to GST-mid-hSPT16 (aa 321–640) (Fig. 2 B, right panel, lane 6). CK2 binding to SSRP1 and hSPT16 was tested by GST-pull-down followed by a kinase assay. Fig. 2 C shows that CK2 binds to GST-WT-SSRP1 and to GST-C-SSRP1 (aa 471–709) (Fig. 2 C,left panel, compare lanes 2 and 5) and that there is also diminished binding to GST-mid-SSRP1 (aa 235–475) (compare lanes 2 and 4). CK2 also binds hSPT16 directly in vitro via the N terminus (aa 1–329) (Fig.2 C, right panel, lane 2). Thus, from these experiments we conclude that these proteins bind to each other via non-overlapping regions, consistent with the idea that they form an SSRP1·hSPT16·CK2 protein complex. The data are summarized in Fig.2 D. Protein kinase CK2 exists as a heterotetramer with catalytic subunits α and α′ and regulatory subunit β, the stoichiometry being α2β2, α2′β2, or αα′β2 (35Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine which of these subunits bind to SSRP1 and hSPT16, we used either GST-WT-SSRP1 or GST-N-hSPT16, the region that interacts with the CK2 heterotetramer (Fig. 2 C). We tested the catalytic α′ subunit and found that it binds to both GST-WT-SSRP1 and GST-N-hSPT16 (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 5and 6), whereas the regulatory β subunit apparently binds much more strongly to GST-WT-SSRP1 (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 8 and 9). A Coomassie Blue-stained gel is shown of the purified His-tagged CK2 proteins (Fig. 3 B). To test whether these protein-protein interaction domains are also true in cells, we made stable cell lines with FLAG-tagged N- and C-SSRP1 in human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells and performed co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) with the FLAG antibody. Using these cell lines, we reproduced the results seen in the in vitroGST pull-down assay exactly. That is, FLAG-N-SSRP1 bound exclusively to endogenous hSPT16 (Fig. 3 C, top panel, lane 2) and FLAG-C-SSRP1 bound exclusively to the endogenous CK2α′ subunit and p53 Ser-392 kinase activity (Fig. 3 C,bottom two panels, lane 3). Therefore, these cellular data confirm the SSRP1 interactions with hSPT16 and CK2 that were observed in the in vitro GST pull-down assay. Interestingly, although recombinant GST-C-SSRP1 migrates on SDS-PAGE faster than GST-N-SSRP1 (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes cand e), FLAG-C-SSRP1 stably expressed in RKO cells migrates slower than FLAG-N-SSRP1 (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 2 and 3). One possibility for the slower migration of FLAG-C-SSRP1 is that the C terminus of SSRP1 is highly modified in cells by post-translational modifications; this is supported by the fact that this region has a high serine content and that this region is phosphorylated in vitro by CK2 (see Fig.4). Based upon our protein-protein interaction experiments, we can present a model for the binding of hSPT16 and SSRP1 to the CK2 heterotetramer (Fig. 3 D). The CK2 crystal structure is solved (36Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and resembles a butterfly, with the two regulatory β subunits making contacts along a 2-fold axis of symmetry, and the catalytic α and α′ subunits situated like the butterfly wings making contacts only with one β subunit. Because the molecular weights of the recombinant and native complexes are similar, we speculate that there are two FACT heterodimers bound per CK2 heterotetramer, which would be a predicted size of 580 kDa, close to the 670 kDa estimated size from gel filtration chromatography. Previously, we discovered that SSRP1 and hSPT16 could modulate the kinase activity of CK2 such that it phosphorylated p53 but inhibited its activity toward other substrates such as casein, histone H1, and MDM2 (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Here we identify the p53 family member p63γ as anin vitro substrate for CK2 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), although p63γ and p53 do not share sequence conservation in the C-terminal domain and there is no p63γ equivalent of Ser-392. We also tested p73α, another p53 family member, but found that CK2 does not phosphorylate this protein (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–9). Surprisingly, hSPT16 and SSRP1 inhibit the CK2-induced phosphorylation of p63γ (compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6), providing more evidence for the specificity of the p53 Ser-392 kinase complex. As described above, we identified the regions of SSRP1 and hSPT16 that directly bind to CK2 and could now test whether these truncation mutants were sufficient to modulate the kinase activity of CK2 also. Kinase assays were performed using either p53 or casein as substrates, with the addition of the various WT and mutant SSRP1 and hSPT16 proteins. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig.4 C, and as seen previously (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abst"
https://openalex.org/W2041966195,"The procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase enhancer (PCPE) is a glycoprotein that binds the COOH-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and potentiates its cleavage by procollagen C-proteinases, such as bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1). Recently, sequencing of a human expressed sequence tag, which maps near the primary open angle glaucoma region on chromosome 3q21, showed it to encode a novel protein with only 43% identity with PCPE but with a similar domain structure. Here we show this novel protein to be a functional procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase enhancer with activity comparable with that of PCPE and thus propose the designations PCPE2 and PCPE1, respectively. PCPE2 is shown to have a much more limited distribution of expression than does PCPE1, with strong expression primarily in nonossified cartilage in developing tissues and at high levels in the adult heart. PCPE2 is shown to be a glycoprotein that differs markedly in the nature of its glycosylation from that of PCPE1. PCPE2 is also shown to have markedly stronger affinity for heparin than PCPE1, which may account for higher affinities for cell layers. Unexpectedly, both PCPE1 and PCPE2 were found to be collagen-binding proteins, capable of binding at multiple sites on the triple helical portions of fibrillar collagens and also capable of competing for such binding with procollagen C-proteinases. The latter observations may provide insights into the ways PCPEs affect the kinetics of the C-proteinase reaction and into the physical interactions that occur between procollagen C-proteinases and their substrates.

Procollagen precursors of the major fibrillar collagens I–III contain N- and C-propeptides 1The abbreviations used are: N-propeptide, amino-terminal propeptide; C-propeptide, carboxyl-terminal propeptide; PCP, procollagen C-proteinase; BMP-1, bone morphogenetic protein-1; PCPE, procollagen C-proteinase enhancer; CUB domain, complement-Uegf-BMP-1 domain; NTR domain, netrin domain; dpc, days post conception; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mTLL-1, mammalian Tolloid-related 1; mTLD, mammalian Tolloid; mTLL-2, mammalian Tolloid-like 2; Tsg, twisted gastrulation; dpc, days postconception; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase Fthat are cleaved to yield the mature triple helical monomers capable of forming fibrils (1Prockop D.J.

The C-propeptides are cleaved by procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) activity provided by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) (2Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S.

PCP activity is potentiated by the 55-kDa glycoprotein procollagen C-proteinase enhancer (PCPE) and by 36- and 34-kDa proteolytic fragments of PCPE (5Adar R. Kessler E. Goldberg B. Collagen Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PCPE contains two NH2-terminal CUB domains (7Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), motifs thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions and found in various proteins with roles in development (8Bork P. Beckmann G. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). PCPE also contains a COOH-terminal NTR domain (7Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has homology with NH2-terminal domains of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases and with COOH-terminal domains of netrins, complement components C3, C4, and C5, and secreted frizzled-related proteins (9Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The 36- and 34-kDa PCPE fragments retain full PCP-enhancing activity and, like the full-length 55-kDa form, bind type I procollagen C-propeptides (5Adar R. Kessler E. Goldberg B. Collagen Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since the 36- and 34-kDa forms contain little or no sequences other than the two CUB domains (7Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such abilities appear to reside exclusively in these motifs. Indeed, it has been suggested that the CUB-containing 34- and 36-kDa fragments may possess higher levels of PCP-enhancing activity than full-length PCPE (6Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to activities provided by the NH2-terminal portion of PCPE, the cleaved COOH-terminal NTR domain, consistent with its homology with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, has the ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (10Mott J.D. Thomas C.L. Rosenbach M.T. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1384-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to whatever functions are provided by full-length PCPE, it may serve as a precursor from which functional NH2- and COOH-terminal products are derived. Interestingly, although these products appear to provide very different activities, both would serve to foster a net deposition of fibrous matrix. PCPE may serve additional roles, since disruption of the rat PCPE gene can result in anchorage-independent growth and loss of contact inhibition in cultured fibroblasts (11Masuda M. Igarashi H. Kano M. Yoshikura H. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 381-391PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear whether such effects on growth control may be secondary to effects on matrix deposition or whether they might represent additional PCPE functions. A human expressed sequence tag from the 3q21-q24 chromosomal region, to which a primary open angle glaucoma locus had been mapped, was found to encode a protein with a domain structure similar to that of PCPE and 43% identity in amino acid sequence (12Xu H. Acott T.S. Wirtz M.K. Genomics. 2000; 66: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, although this novel protein is found at relatively high levels in the trabecular meshwork of the eye, a screen for coding sequence mutations inPCOLCE2, the gene that encodes this novel protein, were negative, thus excluding PCOLCE2 as a primary open angle glaucoma candidate gene (12Xu H. Acott T.S. Wirtz M.K. Genomics. 2000; 66: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that the protein product ofPCOLCE2 is a procollagen C-proteinase enhancer, with levels of activity similar to that of PCPE. We thus suggest that it be designated procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 2 (PCPE2), with redesignation of PCPE as PCPE1. PCPE2 is shown to be a glycoprotein that differs from PCPE1 in the nature of its carbohydrate side chains. It is also shown to bind with markedly greater affinity to heparin than does PCPE1, consistent with previous observations (12Xu H. Acott T.S. Wirtz M.K. Genomics. 2000; 66: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that it is more closely associated with cell layers. Analysis of a wide range of developing and adult tissues shows PCPE2 to have a distribution of expression strikingly different and much more limited than that of PCPE1. Surprisingly, both PCPE1 and PCPE2 were found to bind the triple helical portion of fibrillar collagen and to compete in such binding with procollagen C-proteinases. Possible implications of the data are discussed. Human PCPE2 coding sequences, lacking only signal peptide-encoding sequences, were amplified from human placenta cDNA (Clontech) by PCR with forward primer 5′-ACTGTCAGCTAGCACAGTCCCCAGAGAGACCTGTTTTC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 104–126 of the published human PCPE2 sequence (12Xu H. Acott T.S. Wirtz M.K. Genomics. 2000; 66: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AF098269) and containing an NheI site to facilitate cloning, and reverse primer 5′-CGGGAGGTTTCCAATCAGATAGCTGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1481–1506. The resulting ∼1.4-kb PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and inserts were sequenced using SP6 and T7 primers to identify an error-free clone. To obtain novel mouse PCPE2 sequences, a ∼300-bpPshAI/AflII fragment of human PCPE2 cDNA was used to screen a mouse heart cDNA 5′-STRETCH PLUS library (Clontech). Subsequent to secondary and tertiary screens, nine positive plaques were picked, with release of insert-containing pTriplEx plasmids from the phagemid vectors according to the manufacturer's protocols (Clontech). A consensus sequence for full-length mouse PCPE2 cDNA was obtained by sequencing all inserts on both strands. Probes for RNA blot analysis of human and mouse PCPE1 corresponded to human cDNA clone KT11 and to a 1327-bp mouse cDNA, respectively, both previously described (7Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For RNA blot analysis of human PCPE2, a probe was generated by releasing ∼1.4-kb human PCPE2 cDNA sequences from pGEM-T by digestion withNheI and NotI. The mouse PCPE2 probe was generated by excising a ∼1.4-kb cDNA insert from pTriplEx withNheI and NotI. Random primed probes were hybridized to blots, and blots were washed as previously described (13Scott I.C. Clark T.G. Takahara K. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1999; 55: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Linearized template for generating mouse PCPE1 riboprobes for in situ hybridization has been described previously (7Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Scott I.C. Clark T.G. Takahara K. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1999; 55: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mouse PCPE2 riboprobes were prepared from full-length mouse PCPE2 cDNA in pTriplEx, in which pTriplEx sequences located between PCPE2 sequences and the pTriplEx SP6 promoter had been excised withEcoRV and HincII. Riboprobes were produced from the resulting template upon linearization with XbaI and transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (sense) or upon linearization with NheI and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (antisense). Uniform labeling of riboprobes with [35S]UTP, tissue preparation, and in situhybridization were as described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Sequences corresponding to full-length PCPE1, except for lack of signal peptide sequences, were PCR-amplified from 1474-bp cDNA clone KT11 (7Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using forward primer 5′-ACTGTCAGCTAGCACAGACCCCCAACTACACCAGACCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCATGCGGCCGCAGTCCTGGGACGCAGCAG-3′, containing anNheI or a NotI site, respectively, for cloning. The ∼1.3-kb PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T and sequenced fully on both strands to ensure an error-free clone. To obtain expression constructs for human PCPE1 and PCPE2, the ∼1.3-kb PCPE1 insert and a similar ∼1.4-kb PCPE2 insert lacking only signal peptide sequences (see above) were each excised from pGEM-T with NheI andNotI and separately ligated in frame between theNheI and NotI sites of pCEP-Pu/BM40s (14Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Constructs were designed such that translated products would differ from native proteins only in replacement of native signal peptides by the BM40 signal sequence (for enhancement of secretion). Proper insertion of sequences was verified by DNA sequencing of insert-vector junctions. For expression of FLAG-tagged truncated PCPEs lacking the NTR domain (NPCPE1/FLAG and NPCPE2/FLAG), inserts were PCR-amplified using corresponding expression vectors containing full-length PCPE1 or PCPE2 sequences as templates. For NPCPE1/FLAG, the forward primer was that used for the full-length PCPE1 expression vector. The reverse primer, containing a NotI site and FLAG coding sequences, was 5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCTTTGGGGCCGGGCCCTTGCCCTTCT-3′. The truncated PCPE1 product ends at amino acid residue 288, within the linker region between the NTR and second CUB domains, followed by the FLAG epitope. For NPCPE2/FLAG, the forward primer was that used for the full-length PCPE2 expression vector, whereas the reverse primer, containing a NotI site and FLAG peptide coding sequences, was 5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCACATTGCTTATTTTTTAAGGCATCC-3′. The truncated PCPE2 product ends at amino acid residue 287, within the linker region between the NTR and second CUB domains, followed by the FLAG epitope. NPCPE1/FLAG and NPCPE2/FLAG inserts were cloned into pCEP/Pu/BM40s, as described above for full-length inserts. Human 293 EBNA-1 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained as described (15Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Two days post-transfection, media were replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Cellgro), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1× l-glutamine (Cellgro), 250 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cells were selected in media containing puromycin, not less than 2 weeks, and surviving cells were allowed to grow to confluent mass cultures in the same selective media. Confluent monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 1× l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml puromycin, and 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Harvested media were centrifuged to remove debris, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Conditioned media, typically found to contain ∼8 μg/ml full-length PCPE1 or ∼5 μg/ml PCPE2, respectively, were stored at −70 °C until use. FLAG-tagged NPCPE1 and NPCPE2 proteins, each ∼1 μg/ml, were purified from media as described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fifty ml of conditioned media, containing PCPE1 or -2 from 293-EBNA mass cultures were applied to a column containing 0.5 g of heparin-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) previously equilibrated in PBS. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and then with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. Subsequently, protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, and fractions containing PCPE1 or PCPE2, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Concentrations of PCPE1 and PCPE2 were calculated by comparing intensities of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands from serial dilutions of each sample to those of serially diluted protein standards of known concentrations. To determine relative affinities of PCPE1 and PCPE2 for heparin, 5 ml of conditioned media from mass cultures of 293 EBNA-1 cells were applied to 5 mg of heparin-Sepharose, previously swollen, equilibrated with PBS, and poured into a 0.8 × 4-cm Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). Media were reapplied to the matrix four times, and columns were washed with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Stepwise elution of protein was in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with NaCl concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0 m, followed by final elution in 2% SDS. Fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N.

Genomics. 2000; 66: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PCPE1 and PCPE2, concentrated and enriched via heparin-Sepharose chromatography, were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation using the Glycopro deglycosylation kit (ProZyme) and the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 ng of protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was denatured in 0.08% SDS, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100 °C. Triton X-100 was then added to chelate SDS, and glycosidases were added to final concentrations of 0.1 unit/μl peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), 0.1 milliunit/μl sialidase A, or 0.025 milliunit/μl endo-O-glycosidase. Samples were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, and reactions were quenched with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and 5 min at 100 °C. Products were electrophoresed on 10% SDS acrylamide gels, detected via E-Zinc protein stain (Pierce), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblot analysis or transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated peanut agglutinin (Sigma) and visualized colorimetrically as by Ervasti and Campbell (16Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Recombinant3H-labeled type II procollagen was prepared as previously described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and 400 ng were incubated 30 min at 37 °C alone or in the presence of an equimolar amount (∼133 ng) of recombinant PCPE1 or PCPE2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Recombinant mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL-1), with a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope, was prepared and purified as previously described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G.

Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and 30 ng were added to each reaction, with 0.1 mCaCl2 to bring the final concentration to 5 mmCaCl2. Samples were returned to 37 °C, and reactions were quenched at the indicated time points by adding 10× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% acrylamide gels, which were treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont) and exposed to film. Embryos from timed matings of outbred Black Swiss mice (Taconic) were harvested at 16.5 days postconception (dpc) into OCT (Sakura Finetek USA), positioned in sagittal orientation, and stored at −80 °C until use. Frozen sections were processed as described (17Allen B.L. Filla M.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For in situanalysis of binding, 30 nm PCPE was added to sections in RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h and washed thoroughly with PBS. PCPE1 was localized with antiserum prepared against full-length PCPE1 (see below), at 1:200, followed by Alexa 546-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Serial sections were processed for hematoxylin-eosin staining as described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y.

For polyclonal antibodies against full-length PCPE1, a previously described 1370-bp PCR product (10Mott J.D. Thomas C.L. Rosenbach M.T. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. Banda M.J. J. Biol.

The rabbit was boosted twice at 4-week intervals with 150 μg of PCPE1 per boost and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. 5 μl of bovine type I collagen (Vitrogen, 3 mg/ml; Cohesion Technologies) was diluted to 100 μl with PBS and combined with 200 ng of recombinant PCPE1, PCPE2, NPCPE1/FLAG, NPCPE2/FLAG, twisted gastrulation (Tsg)/C, BMP-1/FLAG, mTLD/FLAG, or mTLL-1/FLAG. Preparation and purification of Tsg/C, BMP-1/FLAG, mTLD/FLAG, and mTLL-1/FLAG have been described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A.

After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, collagen fibrils were precipitated by centrifuging 5 min at 12,000 × g. 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to supernatants, whereas pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using PCPE2 antibodies, antibodies directed against full-length PCPE1, or antibodies directed against COOH-terminal FLAG (4Scott I.C.

To examine simultaneous binding of PCPEs and mTLL-1, 3 μg of collagen was combined with mTLL-1/FLAG (62.5 nm) and either PCPE1 or PCPE2, both at a final concentration of 62.5 nm, in a final assay volume of 40 μl. After incubating for 3 h at 37 °C, samples were prepared as described above, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblot detection of mTLL-1/FLAG or E-Zinc protein staining for PCPE1 or PCPE2. 250 ml of media containing recombinant PCPE2 were applied to a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column, which was washed with 50 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and eluted with 50 ml of a 0.15–1 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Fractions containing PCPE2, determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled. Following dialysis against 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, the sample was applied to a 5-ml SP Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences), washed with 25 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and eluted with 25 ml of a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions containing PCPE2 were pooled, concentrated to 0.8 ml, and exchanged into 150 mm NaCl 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, using an Ultrafree 4 concentrator (Millipore Corp.). Purity of the sample was verified by SDS-PAGE and E-Zinc staining (Pierce). One part 4.9 μm PCPE2 was mixed with one part 0.7 μm type I procollagen (kind gift of Dr. Magnus Höök) in 0.1 μm(NH4)2CO3 buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2. The mixture was incubated for 15 h at 4 °C. Samples were diluted with glycerol to a final concentration of 70%. 100 μl of the sample solution was sprayed with an airbrush onto freshly cleaved mica. Rotary shadowing was performed in a Balzers BAE 250 evaporator as described previously (19Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Replicas were observed using a Philips EM 410LS TEM, calibrated using a carbon-grating replica (Fullam 10021). Images were taken at a final magnification of 145,000×. The Bioquant program (R&M Biometrics, Inc.) was used for quantitating binding events. Type I procollagen molecules with at least one bound PCPE2 were measured on a digitizing hypad. Individual binding events were included in the data analysis only if the entire procollagen molecule and the bound PCPE2 were clearly visible. Each binding event was measured by starting at the COOH-terminal end of the type I procollagen at the base of the globular domain and continuing to the middle of the binding spot. A total of 352 binding events were counted. Binding events were then binned for every 10 nm along the collagen strand. The percentage of number of events in each bin over total events counted was calculated and plotted against the length of the collagen strand. To gain insights into possible differences/similarities in the in vivo roles ofPCOLCE1 and PCOLCE2 gene products, we first compared distributions of expression of the two genes in a dot blot array of poly(A)+ RNA from a broad range of adult and fetal human tissues. As can be seen (Fig.1 A), both PCOLCE1and -2 are highly expressed in adult human heart. This is particularly evident for PCOLCE2, for which high levels of expression are mostly confined to the aorta and portions of the heart (Fig. 1 A, column 4) but which otherwise appears to have a much more limited distribution of expression than PCOLCE1 (Fig. 1). The only other tissues in which high levels of PCOLCE2 expression are seen are pituitary gland, bladder, mammary gland, and trachea. It should be noted that the latter is the only representative of nonsoft tissue on the dot blot array, since trachea contains nonossified cartilaginous rings. Thus, high expression of PCOLCE2 in adult trachea suggests that the high expression of Pcolce2 localized to nonossified cartilage in developing bone (see below) may persist in nonossified cartilage in the adult. The dot blot array shows high levels of PCOLCE1 expression to be more broadly distributed than was observed forPCOLCE2, in both adult and fetal human tissues. Thus, for example, levels of PCOLCE1 expression throughout the digestive track (Fig. 1 A, column 5, andspots 6A–6C) are similar to levels observed in heart, and, as previously reported (13Scott I.C.

https://openalex.org/W2051434444,"Assembly of Escherichia colicytochrome bd and periplasmic cytochromes requires the ATP-binding cassette transporter CydDC, whose substrate is unknown. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE comparison of periplasm from wild-type andcydD mutant strains revealed that the latter was deficient in several periplasmic transport binding proteins, but no single major protein was missing in the cydD periplasm. Instead, CydDC exports from cytoplasm to periplasm the amino acid cysteine, demonstrated using everted membrane vesicles that transported radiolabeled cysteine inward in an ATP-dependent, uncoupler-independent manner. New pleiotropic cydDphenotypes are reported, including sensitivity to benzylpenicillin and dithiothreitol, and loss of motility, consistent with periplasmic defects in disulfide bond formation. Exogenous cysteine reversed these phenotypes and affected levels of periplasmic c-type cytochromes in cydD and wild-type strains but did not restore cytochrome d. Consistent with CydDC being a cysteine exporter, cydD mutant growth was hypersensitive to high cysteine concentrations and accumulated higher cytoplasmic cysteine levels, as did a mutant defective inorf299, encoding a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily. A cydD orf299 double mutant was extremely cysteine-sensitive and had higher cytoplasmic cysteine levels, whereas CydDC overexpression conferred resistance to high extracellular cysteine concentrations.

Escherichia coli possesses two major membrane-bound terminal respiratory oxidases, namely cytochromes bo′(“bo 3” encoded by cyoABCDE) andbd. The latter comprises two polypeptide subunits (encoded by cydA and cydB) and hemesb 558, b 595, andd (1Ingledew W.J. Poole R.K. Microbiol.

Assembly of cytochrome bd is dependent not only on the structural genes cydAB, but also on the unlinkedcydDC operon (7Georgiou C.D. Fang H. Gennis R.B. J.

Unlike traffic ATPases involved in uptake, CydDC is thought not to interact with a cognate periplasmic-binding protein. Strains defective in eithercydD or cydC display complex phenotypes in addition to loss of cytochrome bd. These include loss of periplasmic b- and c-type cytochromes (10Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Goldman B.S. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6091-6096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the substrate of CydDC might be heme (9Poole R.K. Hatch L. Cleeter M.W.J. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Wu G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 421-430Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that would be assembled into apocytochromes following export to the periplasm. However, the assembly of heme into heterologous apoproteins (e.g. Ascarishemoglobin) exported to the periplasm of E. coli does not require cydC (12Goldman B.S. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6338-6347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that outward transport of heme is not absolutely dependent on CydDC. Furthermore, transport studies using inside-out vesicles derived from wild-type and cydDmutant strains revealed no discernible differences between the two strains in association of radiolabeled heme with, or transport by, vesicle membranes (15Cook G.M. Poole RK Microbiology. 2000; 146: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An important clue to the function of CydDC was the finding (12Goldman B.S. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6338-6347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the periplasm of a cydC mutant is more oxidizing, as assayed using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), than that of a wild-type strain. This suggests that CydDC exports a reducing molecule to the periplasm and therefore contributes to the maintenance of the balanced redox conditions required for cytochrome c biogenesis in the periplasm. CcmH, containing a conserved CXXC motif, is required in E. coli for keeping the heme-binding site of apocytochrome c in a reduced form for subsequent heme ligation (16Fabianek R.A. Hofer T. Thöny-Meyer L. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Several other protein thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases are required for cytochrome c maturation; loss of DsbA, DsbB, or DsbD (DipZ) each results in a loss of c-type cytochromes (17Crooke H. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DsbA and DsbB are involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in various periplasmic proteins (20Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 21Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J.-O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), whereas DsbD translocates electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm (22Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), thereby providing a source of reducing power to an otherwise oxidized environment. The aim of this work was to identify the substrate exported by CydDC. We failed to find an obvious protein candidate, but show instead that CydDC exports cysteine to the periplasm, the first demonstration of ATP-driven l-cysteine export. Support for this conclusion comes from: (a) direct demonstration that everted membrane vesicles take up cysteine in an ATP- and CydDC-dependent manner, corresponding to export in vivo; (b) correction by exogenous l-cysteine of newly reportedcydD phenotypes, specifically loss of motility and increased sensitivity to benzylpenicillin; (c) detection of higher cytoplasmic levels of cysteine in cydD mutant cells; (d) susceptibility of cydD mutants to growth inhibition by external cysteine; and (e) increased resistance to cytotoxic levels of cysteine by strains that overexpress CydDC. E. coli strain AN2343 carrying the mutant cydD1 allele and its isogenic wild-type parent strain AN2342 have been described before (8Poole R.K. Williams H.D. Downie J.A. Gibson F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1865-1874PubMed Google Scholar). Strains RKP4611 and RKP4612 were constructed by P1vir transduction (23Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions.

Strains RKP2634 and RKP2005 were obtained by transformation of the wild-type and cydD mutant strain, respectively, with plasmid pRP33 (9Poole R.K. Hatch L. Cleeter M.W.J. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Wu G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 421-430Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that has thecydDC + operon cloned into vector pBR328. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (pH 7.0) (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), or in MOPS-buffered minimal medium (pH 7.4) (26Stewart V. Parales J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1589-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 40 mm lactose plus 10% (v/v) LB. Kanamycin and benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) were added to give final concentrations of 30 and 20 μg ml−1, respectively. l-Cysteine was added as a filter-sterilized 100 mm stock solution to media, giving the final concentrations in the text. Aerated cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks containing one fifth of their volume by shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C or 37 °C. Anaerobically grown cultures were obtained by filling growth vessels to the brim with LB (supplemented with 20 mm KNO3) and incubating without shaking at 37 °C for 14 h. Cells were grown to stationary phase in LB broth at 30 °C, and 5-μl drops were spotted onto semi-solid LB medium (0.3% Difco agar). The cells were incubated at 30 °C for up to 3 days, and the diameter of the resultant swarm of growth was measured. Cells were grown to stationary phase in LB broth at 37 °C, and serial dilutions in 1-ml aliquots were made. Portions (5 μl) of serially diluted suspensions were drop-plated onto solid LB medium containing benzylpenicillin (20 μg ml−1) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 mm cysteine. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the colonies were counted. Periplasmic fractions were isolated using a modified procedure of Willis et al.(27Willis R.C. Morris R.G. Cirakoglu C. Schellenberg G.D. Gerber N.H. Furlong C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 64-75Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, 200 ml of culture was conditioned for osmotic shock by the addition of 6 ml of 1 m NaCl and 6 ml of 1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.3). An equal volume of a 40% (w/v) sucrose solution containing 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and 2 mm EDTA was added, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were harvested, and to each pellet 6 ml of ice-cold water was added. After 45 s on ice, MgCl2 was added to 1 mm and the cells kept on ice for 10 min. Finally, the periplasmic fraction was obtained by centrifugation (10,000 ×g for 5 min) at 4 °C to remove cell debris and stored at 4 °C until ready for use. The cytoplasmic fraction for enzyme assays was produced from the pellet (spheroplasts), which was resuspended in a buffer (6 ml) that contained (final concentration) 20% (w/v) sucrose, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm Na EDTA. Sonication (15 μm amplitude, four or five 15-s bursts, with 30-s breaks) on ice was followed by centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 70 min), and the resulting supernatant (cytoplasm) was stored at 4 °C. For assay of cysteine in the cytoplasm, 400 ml of culture was used and the spheroplasts were suspended in 1 ml of water. Centrifugation after sonication was at 200,000 × g for 2 h. Assays of β-galactosidase (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatase (28Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 29Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to determine the purity of periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions. Activities were measured at room temperature by monitoring at 420 nm the hydrolysis ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside or 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, respectively. Periplasmic samples were concentrated ∼2-fold with a Centricon YM-3 centrifugal filter device (Amicon Bioseparations-Millipore Corp.) with a maximum volume of 2 ml and a molecular mass cut-off of 3,000 Da. A portion (2 ml) of each sample was spun (5,000 × g for 120 min) without the retentate vial. An additional 2 ml of sample was centrifuged exactly as above, and samples were pooled. Concentrated periplasm (∼0.2 mg of protein) was included in 125 μl (total volume) of rehydration solution (8 m urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) IPG buffer pH 3–10 (non-linear) (Amersham Biosciences), 0.28% dithiothreitol, and a few grains of bromphenol blue) and applied to a 7-cm IPG strip. After rehydration (18–20 h), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out using a Multiphor II horizontal unit with immobilized pH gradients (pre-cast IPG strip, pH 3–10, non-linear) in the first dimension and a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel (8–18% polyacrylamide) in the second dimension, according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteins were electroblotted onto ProBlott (Applied Biosystems) membranes at 400–500 mA for 1.5–2 h before staining with Coomassie Blue. The N-terminal sequences of the protein spots were determined by sequential Edman degradation (30Qi S.-Y. Moir A.J.G. O'Connor C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12032-12038Crossref Google Scholar). Sequence identity was computed using the Colibri web site (genolist.pasteur.fr/colibri/) FASTA function (31Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9380) Google Scholar). Further information on sequenced proteins was found on the SWISS-PROT web site (www.expasy.ch/). This was carried out using the method of Gaitonde (32Gaitonde M.K. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). A standard curve (0–0.5 μmol of cysteine-HCl) was prepared, and used to quantify cysteine levels in cytoplasmic fractions, which had been treated with acetic acid and acid ninhydrin “Reagent 2” (250 mg ninhydrin dissolved in a mixture of 6 ml of acetic acid and 4 ml of HCl). Samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, then cooled rapidly in water before dilution to 5 or 10 ml using 95% ethanol. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction products were measured at 561 nm. To correct for interference by other ninhydrin-reactive components that contributed to a sloping base line in the absorbance spectra of dilute cytoplasmic fractions,A 561 was measured relative to a baseline drawn between 530 and 590 nm. Cytochrome d was quantified in cells grown aerobically to stationary phase in 50 ml of LB and harvested at 6000 × g for 15 min. Cells were washed with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and used to record reduced minus oxidized difference spectra and CO + reduced minus reduced difference spectra at room temperature as before (8Poole R.K. Williams H.D. Downie J.A. Gibson F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1865-1874PubMed Google Scholar), except that a SDB4 dual wavelength scanning spectrophotometer (33Kalnenieks U. Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar) was used. For cytochrome d, an absorption coefficient ε (622 minus 644 nm) of 12.6 mm−1 cm−1 (34Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in CO difference spectra. For c-type cytochromes, periplasmic fractions were isolated as described above to minimize interference by other cytochromes with overlapping spectral features. Reducedminus oxidized difference spectra at room temperature were recorded as in Ref. 10Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar but in the SDB4 dual wavelength scanning spectrophotometer. Correction for base-line drift in the Soret region was accomplished by dropping a vertical from the absorption peak at ∼423 nm (NrfA has a maximum in absolute spectra at 420.5 nm; Ref. 35Bamford V.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) to a base line drawn between 404 and 450 nm. The absorption coefficient ε used was 146 mm−1 cm−1 (10Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), determined by using the absorption coefficient ε551–540for the α-band (10Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a γ/α ratio of 7.5 measured in spectra of concentrated periplasmic fractions. Protein contents of cell suspensions and periplasmic fractions were assayed using the method of Markwell et al. (36Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5327) Google Scholar). Up to 6 liters of culture was grown aerobically at 37 °C to the mid-exponential phase of growth (A 600 = 0.6) in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with lactose and LB. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet washed with pre-cooled 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 140 mm choline chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v) followed by resuspension in the same buffer (5 vol/g of wet cells). Everted vesicles were prepared by the method of Ambudkar et al. (37Ambudkar S.V. Zlotnick G.W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6142-6145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were disrupted by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 4000 p.s.i. (34.5 megapascals). Pancreatic DNase and MgCl2 were added at final concentrations of 0.1 mg ml−1 and 2.5 mm, respectively, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h or until the viscosity decreased significantly. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, vesicles were sedimented from the supernatant by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Vesicles were gently washed once in the same buffer, collected by centrifuging and resuspended to15–20 mg of protein ml−1. Aliquots (100 μl) were diluted with an equal volume of glycerol before snap-freezing and storage at −20 °C. [14C]Lactose (2109 MBq mmol−1) and [35S]cysteine (3145 MBq mmol−1; Amersham Biosciences) were added to final concentrations of 0.06 and 0.5 mm, respectively, in the transport assay. In addition, non-labeled lactose and cysteine were added at final concentrations of 1.94 and 0.5 mm, respectively. Everted vesicles were thawed slowly on ice and diluted to 1.0 mg of protein ml−1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 140 mm choline chloride and 5 mm MgCl2. Vesicles were added to glass tubes containing buffer (pre-equilibrated at 30 °C) to a final volume of 200 μl, and were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min without shaking.to initiate [14C]lactose transport, vesicles were energized for 15 min prior to lactose addition with 20 mm d-lactate. [35S]Cysteine transport was initiated by the addition of cysteine for 5 min prior to the addition of 10 mm ATP. Vesicles were de-energized with either CCCP (2 μm) to dissipate the proton gradient (15Cook G.M. Poole RK Microbiology. 2000; 146: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), or sodium orthovanadate (50 μm), an analogue of inorganic phosphate that mimics the γ-phosphate of ATP in the transition state for ATP hydrolysis (38Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Transport was terminated by rapidly pouring the contents onto cellulose-nitrate filters (0.45-μm pore size), which were washed twice with 4 ml of 100 mm LiCl, and dried. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To minimize nonspecific binding of substrate to filters, the filters were pre-soaked in 100 mm LiCl. The periplasm of a cydC mutant is more oxidized than that of a wild-type strain (12Goldman B.S. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6338-6347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems plausible, therefore, that candidate substrates for the CydDC transporter are any reducing or oxygen-scavenging agents. Interestingly, the cydDC operon is adjacent to thetrxB (thioredoxin reductase) gene (9Poole R.K. Hatch L. Cleeter M.W.J. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Wu G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 421-430Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) on the E. coli chromosome but trxB mutants do synthesize cytochromes c and bd (10Poole R.K. Gibson F. Wu G. FEMS Lett. 1994; 117: 217-224Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), ruling out TrxB as a candidate substrate. Mutants defective in trxA (encoding thioredoxin) and grx (glutaredoxin) also synthesize cytochrome bd (15Cook G.M. Poole RK Microbiology. 2000; 146: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although trxA mutants are unable to assemble c-type cytochromes unless complemented with 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (40Reid E. Eaves D.J. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this demonstrates that TrxA is not essential for cytochrome bd assembly either. However, a redox protein other than TrxB, thioredoxin, or glutaredoxin remains an intriguing candidate, as this would explain the plethora of redox-associated phenotypes of cydDC mutants. We therefore sought a protein that might be transported by CydDC by using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing to analyze periplasmic fractions of wild-type and cydD strains. Marker enzyme assays on both periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions revealed <5% contamination by cytoplasmic and periplasmic enzymes, respectively (results not shown). Comparison of two-dimensional gels (Fig.1 and TableI) revealed several major differences, and, of the spots chosen for excision and subsequent Edman degradation, all were found to be periplasmic proteins, the determined sequences of which began after a signal sequence. This strongly suggests that all proteins identified were exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by a Sec-dependent mechanism (41Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins represented by spots 1 and 9 were identified as OppA (42Andrews J.C. Blevins T.C. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 428-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AnsB (43Bonthon D.T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), respectively, and were expressed at significantly higher levels in the periplasm of the wild type than that of the mutant (Fig. 1). A minor spot (number 8) was also OppA and may result from post-translational alteration or modification of lysine residues during electrophoresis (44Gooley A.A. Packer N.H. Proteome Research: New Frontiers in Functional Genomics. Springer, Berlin1997: 63-69Google Scholar). Proteins OsmY (45Yim H.H. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3637-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and HisJ (46Kustu S.G. McFarland N.C. Hiu S.P. Esmon B. Ames G.F. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 218-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (spots 5 and 6, respectively) were expressed at slightly more elevated levels in the cydDmutant periplasm compared with that of the wild type (Fig 1). The remaining five sequenced proteins (MalE, GlnH, ProX, HisJ, and DppA) were expressed at slightly higher levels in the wild type compared with the cydD mutant periplasm and are the periplasmic binding-proteins of secondary type transport systems in E. coli (see Ref. 47Boos W.

https://openalex.org/W2024775285,"It has been well documented that Mdm2 and its homologue MdmX not only are critical negative regulators of the tumor suppressor p53 but that both Mdm2 and MdmX interact to affect the function of the other. The mechanisms through which these effects are manifested, however, remain unclear. Although Mdm2 has been established as a RING finger ubiquitin ligase, MdmX has not been shown to possess this activity despite the extensive sequence homology between their respective RING finger domains. Here we demonstrate that MdmX acts as a ubiquitin ligase in vitro, being capable of autoubiquitination, as well as mediating the ubiquitination of p53. The addition of Mdm2 to in vitro ubiquitination assays containing MdmX results in a synergistic increase of ubiquitin conjugation. Analysis of the resulting ubiquitin conjugates reveals that this observed synergy reflects an increase in Mdm2 ubiquitination. This study also suggests that ubiquitination of Mdm2 and MdmX may not serve as a signal for degradation, as we show that each are capable of synthesizing non-lysine 48 polyubiquitin chains and, in fact, utilize multiple lysine linkages. Taken together, these findings suggest a more active role for MdmX in the Mdm2-MdmX-p53 regulatory network than has been proposed previously.

Taken together, these findings suggest a more active role for MdmX in the Mdm2-MdmX-p53 regulatory network than has been proposed previously. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cellular function and is achieved through three enzymatic steps (1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6952) Google Scholar, 3Pickart C.M.

In an ATP-dependent process, the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPEN, tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine; Ub, ubiquitin catalyzes the formation of a reactive thiolester bond with ubiquitin, followed by its subsequent transfer to the active site cysteine of a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2). The specificity of ubiquitin ligation arises from the association of the E2-ubiquitin thiolester with ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), which facilitates the formation of the isopeptide linkage between ubiquitin and its target protein. Eukaryotes possess a single ubiquitin activating enzyme and several families of E2 isoforms that are easily identified by conservation of a bipartite E2 consensus motif (1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that RING finger proteins often exhibit ubiquitin ligase activity has led to the rapid identification of numerous novel ligases (5Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 6Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). One of the first of these RING finger ubiquitin ligases to be characterized was the oncoprotein Mdm2 (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The mdm2 gene is amplified in a broad range of tumors including breast carcinomas, lung cancers, and osteosarcomas with the highest frequency (20%) in soft tissue tumors (9Momand J. Jung D. Wilczynski S. Niland J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3453-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). It is well established that Mdm2 regulates the p53 tumor suppressor protein by inhibiting p53-mediated transactivation and by promoting its degradation (10Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar, 11Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). For both of these mechanisms, elevated levels of Mdm2 can inhibit the protective functions of p53 and lead to oncogenesis. The ability of Mdm2 to negatively regulate p53 has sparked much interest in understanding how Mdm2 levels within the cell are controlled, demonstrated by numerous studies aimed at developing therapies designed to attenuate Mdm2 activity (12Bottger A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1921-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One obvious mechanism to control Mdm2 function is regulation of protein stability. Like several other RING finger ligases, Mdm2 is capable of catalyzing its own ubiquitination thus providing a possible mechanism for autoregulation (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The Mdm2-related protein MdmX shares several regions of homology with Mdm2 including the p53 binding domain, a zinc finger motif, and a C-terminal RING finger domain (16Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although the RING finger domains of MdmX and Mdm2 are very similar (46% identity over 52 residues), with the residues implicated in zinc chelation being absolutely conserved, there has been no reported ubiquitin ligase activity by MdmX. This apparent lack of ligase activity has contributed to the ambiguity surrounding the biological role of MdmX. Although structurally similar, genetic evidence demonstrates that MdmX cannot compensate for the loss of Mdm2 expression during embryonic development in mouse (17Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 18Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) nor can Mdm2 compensate for the loss of MdmX expression (19Finch R.A. Donoviel D.B. Potter D. Shi M. Fan A. Freed D.D.

Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two proteins have non-overlapping functions. The fact that the embryonic lethal phenotype displayed by MdmX null mice can be rescued in a p53 null genetic background has further demonstrated the importance of MdmX as a negative regulator of p53 function (19Finch R.A. Donoviel D.B. Potter D. Shi M. Fan A. Freed D.D. Wang C.Y. Zambrowicz B.P. Ramirez-Solis R. Sands A.T. Zhang N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3221-3225PubMed Google Scholar, 20Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The suggestion from these genetic studies that elevated MdmX levels may contribute to oncogenesis correlates with the recent reports of increased MdmX expression in tumor cell lines and malignant gliomas (21Riemenschneider M.J. Buschges R. Wolter M. Reifenberger J. Bostrom J. Kraus J.A. Schlegel U. Reifenberger G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6091-6096PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ramos Y.F. Stad R. Attema J. Peltenburg L.T. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1839-1842PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Mdm2 and MdmX form both homo- and hetero-oligomers in vitro and in vivo, with hetero-oligomers exhibiting a more stable association; in addition, deletions that include the RING finger domain of either protein abrogate this interaction (23Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the half-life of Mdm2 is increased when co-transfected with MdmX and that this stabilization is dependent on the RING finger of MdmX, suggesting a requirement for hetero-oligomer formation (16Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). One current model proposes that this observed stabilization of Mdm2 is the result of the Mdm2-MdmX interaction inhibiting the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2, thereby preventing its efficient ubiquitination and stabilizing Mdm2 protein levels. Here we demonstrate that MdmX possesses ubiquitin ligase activity requiring the Ubc4/5 family of E2 isozymes and that the RING finger domain of MdmX is necessary for this activity. We further show that in addition to its capacity for autoubiquitination, MdmX catalyzes the ubiquitination of p53 in vitro. Our investigation into the proposed ability of MdmX to inhibit Mdm2 ubiquitination has revealed that the interaction between Mdm2 and MdmX results in a synergistic increase in Mdm2 ubiquitination. That MdmX autoubiquitination, as well as the MdmX-mediated increase in Mdm2 ubiquitination, may not target these proteins for degradation is suggested by our demonstration that both Mdm2 and MdmX are capable of forming non-lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains. These observations challenge the current hypothesis that the MdmX-mediated stability of Mdm2 reflects a decrease in Mdm2 ubiquitination and support the classification of MdmX as a new member of the RING finger family of ligases. Bovine ubiquitin, creatine phosphokinase, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. Thrombin, purified from bovine plasma, was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The ubiquitin was purified to apparent homogeneity (24Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and then radiolabeled by the chloramine T method (25Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Alternatively, some of the purified ubiquitin was modified by reductive methylation (26Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Carrier-free Na125I and [2,8-3H]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Human E1 from outdated human erythrocytes was purified to apparent homogeneity by modifying affinity chromatography and FPLC methods (27Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then quantitated by125I-ubiquitin thiolester assays and confirmed by the stoichiometric formation of ubiquitin [3H]adenylate (28Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of human MdmX was amplified from a full-length cDNA (expressed sequence tag clone 177586) by polymerase chain reaction using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). Appropriate primers were used during this amplification to allow for the in-frame insertion of the MdmX cDNA into the pGEX 4T-1 vector at the BamHI and XhoI sites. The construction of pGEX-MdmXΔ394 was achieved by digesting pGEX-MdmX with EcoRI and XhoI and blunting the 5′-overhangs with Klenow fragment, followed by re-ligation. This resulted in the deletion of the 96 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of MdmX. As was done with MdmX, the entire open reading frame of human p53 was amplified from a full-length p53 cDNA (expressed sequence tag clone 610186) utilizing appropriate primers to allow for the in-frame insertion of the p53 cDNA into the pGEX 4T-1 vector at theBamHI and XhoI sites. A full-length human Mdm2 cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a pGEX-Mdm2 cDNA construct kindly provided by Dr. Allan Weissman. Primers used in this amplification facilitated the insertion of this Mdm2 cDNA into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of a modified pGEX4T-1 vector containing a FLAG epitope fused to the C terminus of the GST coding sequence. The production and purification of human recombinant E2 proteins was performed as described previously (30Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The concentration of active E2 protein in each preparation was determined by quantitation of the E1-catalyzed stoichiometric formation of the corresponding125I-ubiquitin thiolester. Ubiquitin lysine to arginine point mutants were produced and purified as described previously (24Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

DNA sequencing of the open reading frame of each plasmid, as well as mass spectrometry of each of the purified polypeptides, were performed to confirm that the expressed protein contained the appropriate lysine to arginine mutation. The human MdmX, MdmXΔ394, and FLAG-Mdm2 were expressed as N-terminal GST fusions in logarithmic phase Escherichia coli (Rosetta™; Novagen, Madison, WI) grown at 30 °C. Expression at 30 °C for 2 h was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following purification by glutathione affinity chromatography, the fusion proteins were further purified by FPLC. The fusion proteins were adsorbed to a Mono Q HR5/5 anion exchange FPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and then eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (12.5 mm/min). Fractions containing the fusion protein, as determined by immunoblotting, were pooled and concentrated using an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filtration device with a 5-kDa molecular mass exclusion (Millipore). The GST-FLAG-Mdm2 fusion protein was digested with thrombin (30 units/ml) for 3 h at room temperature to cleave the GST moiety, which was subsequently removed by glutathione affinity chromatography. Quantitation of GST-MdmX, GST-MdmXΔ394, and FLAG-Mdm2 was performed by silver staining using known concentrations of bovine serum albumin as standards. Conjugation reactions were adapted from earlier kinetic methods (30Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reaction volumes of 25 μl contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 20 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 nm human ubiquitin activating enzyme, 400 nm of the indicated ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and the indicated concentration of Mdm2 or MdmX. Reactions were initiated by addition of either 125I-ubiquitin (typically ∼104 cpm/pmol) or unlabeled ubiquitin and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 3 min. The conditions for conjugation reactions containing GST-p53 were similar to those stated above with the following modifications. Reaction volumes of 50 μl containing 40 nmhuman ubiquitin activating enzyme, 150 nm HsUbc5A, 400 nm GST-p53, 4 nm FLAG-Mdm2, and 400 nm GST-MdmX were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C either in the absence or presence of 10 μm unlabeled ubiquitin. Reactions were quenched with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 3 min. Commercially available mouse monoclonal antibodies were used for immunodetection of human Mdm2 (Ab-1; Oncogene Research Products) and human p53 (IgG2a, clone BP53–12; Upstate Biotechnology). A ubiquitin-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody produced previously in the laboratory was used for detection of ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains (32Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An MdmX-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced against the peptide 142ESSTSRKRTTEDDIP156synthesized on a four-branch multiple antigenic peptide resin (33Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Following confirmation that this antiserum was immunospecific for MdmX, the antiserum was purified by peptide ligand affinity chromatography and used subsequently for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of MdmX-Ub conjugates was performed by incubating 20% of a ubiquitin conjugation reaction with a final concentration of 150 μg/ml anti-MdmX antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin. The antibody-bound protein was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin. Bound protein was eluted from the beads by boiling briefly with Laemmli sample buffer followed by resolution by SDS-PAGE. Although there has been no E3 activity ascribed to MdmX to date, the high degree of homology between the RING finger domains of Mdm2 and MdmX suggested that MdmX might also function as a RING finger ubiquitin ligase. To investigate this possibility, we performedin vitro ubiquitin conjugation assays using a bacterially expressed GST-MdmX fusion protein as the only source of ubiquitin ligase activity. Previous studies have reported that E2 isoforms from the Ubc4/5 2In this and subsequent papers, we shall use the empirical functional/phylogenetic family classification and systematic nomenclature for the E2/Ubc isoforms presented earlier (1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). and HsUbc7 families interact with RING finger ligases, with Mdm2 displaying specificity for HsUbc5 family members (5Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 34Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We assayed the ability of selected recombinant human E2 isoforms to support MdmX-catalyzed E3 activity. As expected, we observed no E3-mediated ligase activity in reactions containing HsUbc2B, HsUbc3, or HsUbc7A as the source of E2 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4, 7, and 8); however the ability of HsUbc3 to catalyze its own monoubiquitination is demonstrated by the presence of a band migrating at ∼42 kDa (Fig. 1 A,lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, assays containing HsUbc5A, a member of the Ubc4/5 family of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), displayed robust ubiquitin ligation activity in the presence of GST-MdmX (Fig. 1 A, lane 5 versus lane 6). As has been documented with other RING finger ligases, these ubiquitin conjugates were polyubiquitinated and migrated at the top of the gel (6Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). That the conjugates contained polyubiquitin chains was demonstrated by the complete abrogation of the high molecular weight adducts when 125I reductively methylated ubiquitin was substituted for wild-type radiolabeled ubiquitin (data not shown). We next addressed the nature of the ubiquitin conjugates by determining whether they represented MdmX autoubiquitination or the ubiquitination of trace contaminating proteins present in the enzyme preparations. After repeating the conjugation reaction of Fig. 1 A(lane 6), we isolated GST-MdmX by immunoprecipitation with an anti-MdmX polyclonal antibody and found that GST-MdmX-Ub conjugates represented the majority (∼70%) of the total ubiquitin conjugates in the reaction (Fig. 1 B). Because antibody concentrations were empirically optimized in all instances to ensure quantitative immunoprecipitation, the inability quantitatively to immunoprecipitate the ubiquitin adducts suggests MdmX either is capable of catalyzing the formation of free polyubiquitin chains, as found for E225K(35Pickart C.M. Haldeman M.T. Kasperek E.M. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14418-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or mediates conjugation to contaminating proteins present in the assay. After we established that MdmX possessed E3 activity, we sought to confirm that this property was associated with its RING finger. Toward this end, we generated a truncated MdmX construct (MdmXΔ394) in which translation was terminated at codon 394, deleting the 96 C-terminal residues of the wild-type protein in which the RING finger is located (Fig. 2 A). MdmXΔ394 was expressed as an N-terminal GST fusion and compared with the full-length GST-MdmX to confirm the deletion of 11 kDa (Fig.2 B, lane 2 versus lane 3). MdmX has been reported to migrate at ∼80 kDa contrary to its theoretical mass of 54 kDa (36Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is similar to the aberrant migration of Mdm2 (∼90-kDa apparent versus 54-kDa theoretical) (37Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The apparent relative molecular masses of full-length GST-MdmX and of GST-MdmXΔ394 corresponding to 110 and 97 kDa, respectively, are consistent with the predicted anomalous migration for deletion of the RING finger domain from GST-MdmX. The ligase activity of MdmXΔ394 relative to that of full-length MdmX was assayed using biochemically defined in vitro ubiquitin conjugation reactions. Although full-length MdmX displayed ligase activity, we observed no ubiquitin conjugates formed in the presence of an equal concentration of MdmXΔ394 or in the presence of MdmXΔ394 at a level three times greater than the full-length protein (Fig.2 C, lane 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). In an effort to determine whether less drastic alterations to MdmX would also abrogate its E3 activity, we attempted to selectively disrupt its RING finger. Because Zn2+ stabilizes RING finger domains (38Lai Z. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. McLendon G.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17005-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), we sequestered Zn2+ from our MdmX protein preparations using the specific Zn2+ chelator TPEN (40Shumaker D.K. Vann L.R. Goldberg M.W. Allen T.D. Wilson K.L. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which abrogates the E3 activity of Mdm2 (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). When MdmX was treated with 2 mm TPEN, we observed a biphasic decrease in ligase activity over time, presumably reflecting the time-dependent removal of Zn2+ from the RING finger domain (Fig. 2 D). Disruption of either Zn2+ within the RING finger results in loss of ubiquitin ligase activity (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biphasic kinetics for loss of MdmX activity most likely reflects different affinities for the two positions, the loss of either of which abrogates activity. Unlike Mdm2, whose activity is quantitatively restored after TPEN treatment by addition of ZnCl2 (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), similar reconstitution of MdmX activity resulted in only a 4-fold increase in ubiquitin ligase activity (11% of the initial activity) after an overnight incubation in the presence of 3 mm ZnCl2, data not shown. These observations are consistent with an intact RING finger motif being required for MdmX-mediated ubiquitin ligase activity. The ability of GST-MdmX to catalyze autoubiquitination suggests a mechanism for autoregulation. Because polyubiquitin chains linked via lysine 48 are the principle signal for targeting proteins for degradation (41Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) we sought to determine the linkage utilized by MdmX for chain formation. For this determination, we utilized our collection of ubiquitin lysine point mutants (24Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), each of which had one of the seven lysine residues contained within human ubiquitin mutated to arginine. These Lys → Arg point mutants have been used successfully in the past to demonstrate formation of unique chain linkages by ScUbc2/Rad6 and HsE2epf (24Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Using a ubiquitin-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody to detect the formation of polyubiquitin conjugates, we reconfirmed the ability of MdmX to form large molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 3 A,lane 2). That these conjugates reflected the formation of polyubiquitin chains was confirmed by their elimination when reductively methylated ubiquitin, which is unable to form chains (24Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), was used (Fig. 3 A, lane 3 versus lane 2). Substitution of ubiquitin Lys → Arg point mutants in these conjugation reactions revealed that GST-MdmX was capable of using each mutant to catalyze polyubiquitin chain formation (Fig. 3 A,lanes 4–10). This experiment demonstrates not only that MdmX is capable of synthesizing non-Lys48 chains but that MdmX does not use one lysine exclusively for chain formation. Given the homology between Mdm2 and MdmX, we asked whether Mdm2 could also utilize multiple lysine residues for chain formation. Using both wild-type and reductively methylated ubiquitin we were able to show that FLAG-Mdm2 catalyzed the formation of large molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates that were the result of polyubiquitin chain formation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). Just as was seen with MdmX, when the ubiquitin Lys → Arg point mutants were substituted, Mdm2 was able to catalyze polyubiquitin chain formation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–10). Recent reports have shown that HsUbc5A has been associated with the catalysis of Lys29- and Lys48-linked chains (42Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 43You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); however, the signaling function of Lys29 ubiquitin chains remains unclear. It is worthwhile to note that other members of the RING finger family of ligases have been shown to generate non-Lys48 ubiquitin chains, although their ability to utilize multiple lysine linkages have not been examined (44Chen A. Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Ouchi T. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22085-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

A gain-of-function point mutation (T108E) conferred upon Apoptin the ability to accumulate in the nucleus and kill normal cells, implying that phosphorylation is a key regulator of the tumor-specific properties of Apoptin. An activity that could phosphorylate Apoptin on threonine 108 was found specifically in tumor and transformed cells from a variety of tissue origins, suggesting that activation of this kinase is generally associated with the cancerous or pre-cancerous state. Moreover, analyses of human tissue samples confirm that Apoptin kinase activity is detectable in primary malignancies but not in tissue derived from healthy individuals. Taken together, our results support a model whereby the dysregulation of the cellular pathway leading to the phosphorylation of Apoptin contributes to human tumorigenesis.

Such versatility is typified by oncogenic agents like human papillomavirus and SV40, which have evolved convergently to express proteins that bind to the cellular effectors p53 and pRb. This virus-host interaction results in deregulation of the cell cycle, thus facilitating viral replication (1Tommasino M. Crawford L. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the diverse strategies employed by the viruses that infect higher organisms, it is therefore no surprise that studies into the mechanisms by which the host machinery is subverted during infection have unearthed a wealth of information about a wide variety of cellular processes. Chicken anemia virus (CAV),1an endemic and agriculturally important global pathogen, induces apoptosis and thereby severe depletion of cortical thymocytes and erythroblastoid cells in the bone marrow of newborn chickens, often with fatal consequences (3Yuasa N. Taniguchi T. Noguchi T. Yoshida I. Avian Dis. 1980; 24: 202-209Crossref Google Scholar, 4Gelderblom H. Kling S. Lurz R. Tischer I. von Bulow V. Arch.

CAV encodes three proteins, one of which is Apoptin (also known as VP3 (7Noteborn H.M.H. de Boer G.F. van Roozelaar D.J. Karreman C. Kranenburg O. Vos J.G. Jeurissen S.H. Hoeben R.C. Zantema A. Koch G. van Ormondt H. van der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Apoptin is a small protein of 121 amino acids. Although it has no known cellular endogenous counterpart or homologous regions, it does contain two putative nuclear localization signals and a hydrophobic stretch reminiscent of a nuclear export signal (6Noteborn M.H.M. Koch G. Avian Pathol. 1995; 24: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In transformed chicken cells in vitro, the ectopic expression of Apoptin is sufficient to recapitulate the apoptosis seen during virus infection (8Noteborn M.H.M. Todd D. Verschueren C.A. de Gauw H.W. Curran W.L. Veldkamp S. Douglas A.J. McNulty M.S. van der Eb A.J. Koch G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 346-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent overexpression studies in human cells led to an unexpected finding; namely, in human tumor or transformed cells, Apoptin translocated rapidly to the nucleus and induced apoptosis, whereas in primary, untransformed cells, it remained dispersed predominantly in the cytoplasm and did not kill the cell (9Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F. Grimbergen J.M. Klein B. Zhuang S. Falkenburg J.H. Backendorf C. Quax P.H. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This intriguing correlation ultimately held true in a wide variety of cell types, with no known exceptions to date (>70 cell types tested; see Ref.10Noteborn M.H.M. La Thangue N. Bandara L.

Moreover, Apoptin has also demonstrated long term survival benefits with negligible toxicity when delivered with an adenovirus vector in mice using a xenografted human hepatoma model (11Pietersen A.M. van der Eb M.M.

Tumor formation requires the acquisition of a discrete collection of genetic lesions, including disruptions in the processes of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and telomere maintenance (13Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22075) Google Scholar), and it is likely that more pathways remain to be elucidated in this complex process (14Hahn W.C. Dessain S.K. Brooks M.W. King J.E. Elenbaas B. Sabatini D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2111-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). We have therefore been investigating the mechanism of action of Apoptin with the goal of uncovering novel pathways and processes involved in human neoplasia. Apoptin was shown to induce apoptosis independently of functional p53 (15Zhuang S.-M. Shvarts A. van Ormondt H. Jochemsen A.G. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 486-489PubMed Google Scholar), and its activity could be enhanced rather than inhibited by the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 (16Danen-Van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Zhang Y.-H. Erkeland S.J. Fischer D.F. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Leukemia. 1999; 13: S75-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that Apoptin relies on downstream effector caspase activation to induce apoptosis and stimulates cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. These results indicate that Apoptin execution likely feeds into the classical apoptosis pathway (17Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7072-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the upstream activation requirements of Apoptin have remained unknown, and up until this point, none of the mechanistic information reported has explained the tumor specificity of Apoptin. One logical regulation of the tumor-specific action of Apoptin could lie in its provocative differential nuclear trafficking behavior. However, whereas nuclear localization in tumor cells seems to be necessary for the apoptotic activity of Apoptin, it is not sufficient, as forcing Apoptin into the nucleus of normal cells does not result in apoptosis (18Zhuang S.-M.

Seelen, M. Bolk, A. van Zon, S. Erkeland, J. P. Abrahams, D. Mumberg, and M. Noteborn, manuscript in preparation.Therefore, we postulated that a further tumor-specific activation step was required. Because phosphorylation is known to regulate the function of many proteins (20Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), and because Apoptin is rich in serines and threonines, we sought to determine whether the behavior of Apoptin could be explained by such modification. Here, we show that Apoptin is regulated by a kinase activity present in cancer cell lines from a variety of tissue origins, as well as in clinical tumor samples, but negligibly in healthy cells and tissues. These studies reveal the existence of a common tumor-specific pathway that may be involved in the complicated process of tumorigenesis. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) except human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BioWhittaker Europe SPRL, Belgium), which were grown as recommended in their accompanying medium MSCGM Bulletkit and used between passages 2 and 4, and keratinocyte-based cultures, which were grown at CO2 levels of 7.5% in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (3:1) supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum, 10−6m isoproleronol, 10−6mhydrocortisone, and 10−7m insulin and used below passage 2. All diploid neonatal foreskin-derived fibroblasts were used below passage 14. Wild-type Apoptin (also known as VP3) was overexpressed either using pCMV-VP3 (9Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F.

All in-frame green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused deletion mutants of Apoptin were constructed with standard linker and restriction enzyme strategies using the vector phGFPS65T (Clontech) as a backbone and pCMV-VP3 as the source of various inserts; in these constructs, GFP was positioned at the N terminus, followed by a four-amino acid tether sequence and then the relevant portions of Apoptin (refer to Fig. 3 E for the amino acid numbering system used). All alanine and glutamic acid substitution mutants of Apoptin were constructed in the sAPO background using a standard linker substitution strategy. In experiments using these mutants, sAPO was employed as a positive control, and pCMV-VP3 was used in all other cases. Use of the constructs encoding desmin and p53 for transfection assays has been described (17Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7072-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All new constructs were confirmed by standard automated nucleotide sequence analysis. Precise details of the construction and content of all constructs used are available on request. MBP-Apoptin, MBP, and Apoptin bearing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (Apoptin-His) proteins were a kind gift from Rutger Leliveld and have been described. 4S. R. Leliveld, Y.-H. Zhang, J. Rohn, M. Noteborn, and J. P. Abrahams, submitted for publication. Briefly, MBP-Apoptin was expressed and purified by standard methods inEscherichia coli from a construct comprised of a modified vector pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) encoding an N-terminal maltose-binding protein, a ten-Asn linker, and a thrombin cleavage site, followed by Apoptin based on pCMV-VP3 in the same reading frame. Apoptin-His was cloned and purified by standard methods in E. coli from a construct comprised of the vector pET22b (Novagen), which provides a six-histidine tag and a stop codon C-terminal to Apoptin based on pCMV-VP3. GST-Apoptin was cloned using a standard restriction enzyme strategy using the pGEX-T vector (AmershamBiosciences), providing an in-frame glutathioneS-transferase tag on the N terminus, and sAPO as the Apoptin insert in-frame downstream. Precise details of the construction, expression, and purification of all proteins used are available on request. Cell cultures were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, β-glycerol phosphate, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium fluoride, all at standard concentrations), and supernatants were clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations, when required, were performed with protein A-agarose-coupled antibodies; this procedure, along with SDS-PAGE, Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon), immunostaining, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection, was performed using standard methodology (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibodies used were VP3-C (a polyclonal rabbit serum against the C terminus of Apoptin (17Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7072-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)), α108-P (see below), 111.3 (a mouse monoclonal antibody against the N terminus of Apoptin (9Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F. Grimbergen J.M. Klein B. Zhuang S. Falkenburg J.H. Backendorf C. Quax P.H. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 11: 5843-5847Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar)), DO-1 (against p53; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-GFP (against green fluorescent protein; a gift from Bob van de Water), and MBP-probe (against maltose-binding protein; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). For the p53 controls shown in Fig. 2, the empty vector-transfected samples were immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant antibody (VP3-C) so as not to pull down endogenous p53 from VH10 cells as a better comparison for ectopic p53 expression in the adjacent lanes. Exponentially growing cell cultures, or sections (ranging from 5 to 20 μm) cut from blocks of fresh tissue snap-frozen in isopentane, were lysed by repeated freeze-thawing in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and standard inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases, the same as used for radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysis (see above), as well as the phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma)). Rectal cancer tissues were chosen based on previous TNM 5TNM classification system (31Sobin L.H. Wittekind C. TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1992Google Scholar) is as follows: T, the extent of the primary tumor; N, condition of the regional lymph nodes; M, the absence or presence of distant metastases.-based classification. Flanking sections were re-analyzed by standard hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the tumor cell index was calculated by multiplying the approximate percentage of tumor material in the section by the approximate percentage of tumor cells in the involved area. Equal amounts (10–20 μg, depending on the experiment) of protein from clarified supernatants were added to equal amounts of recombinant Apoptin substrate (0.5–3.0 μg, depending on the experiment) in the presence of 50 μm ATP, 0.15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (when radioactive label was used), and 2 mm dithiothreitol. In some cases control reactions were performed without ATP and in the presence of EDTA to inhibit kinase activity. Phosphorylated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis before autoradiography (for radioactive ATP) or immunoprobing with purified α108-P, α-MBP, or anti-Apoptin 111.3 antibodies. The preservation of general kinase activity in normal cell material was generally confirmed by analyzing the sample supernatants for the presence of radiolabeled cellular phosphoproteins. Transfected cultures were pre-treated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with dialyzed serum (Sigma) for 10 min before metabolic labeling with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. After lysis in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, proteins were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies VP3-C, α-GFP, or DO-1 as appropriate. Purified immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, and the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were subjected to autoradiography and then immunostained with 111.3 or anti-GFP for precise overlaying of the radioactive signal with the antibody signal. All films were exposed along with fluorescent marks to facilitate subsequent orientation for band isolation (see below). Radioactive bands corresponding to phosphorylated Apoptin or negative controls were excised from polyvinylidene difluoride, digested with Tpck-trypsin, and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis using the method of Hunter and co-workers (22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Briefly, thin-layer electrophoresis was performed with 1.5 kV for 20 min in pH 1.9 buffer in the first dimension; the plates were rotated 90° and run at 1.3 kV for 16 min in pH 3.5 buffer in the second dimension. The phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma) were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and the plates were subjected to phosphorimaging analysis to detect the radioactive spots. Samples split off from the above assay were subjected to parallel tryptic mapping, also using the method of Hunter and co-workers (22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar); thin-layer electrophoresis was performed in the first dimension at 1 kV for 25 min in pH 1.9 buffer and PhosphoChromo liquid chromatography in the same orientation for the second dimension. Dried plates were subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. In vitro phosphorylated GST-Apoptin protein was purified from lysates by standard glutathione-Sepharose purification, carboxymethylated, and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and following resuspension it was digested with Tpck-treated trypsin. The peptides were eluted, and the radioactive fractions were identified using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The fractions containing radiolabeled phosphate additions were then subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) analysis on a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems). Phosphorylated peptides were analyzed by electron spray ionization collision-induced dissociation on a QSTAR (Applied Biosystems) to assign the phosphorylated modification to a particular amino acid residue. Production and purification of the α108-P phosphospecific antibody were performed by EuroGentec (Belgium) using standard methods. Briefly, the phosphopeptide SLITT(pT)PSRPRTA (corresponding to Apoptin residues 103–115) was inoculated into rabbits, and resultant sera were tested for specific reactivity to the phosphorylated peptide by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and column-purified against the phosphorylated peptide. Next, those recovered antibodies were passed over a non-phosphopeptide column. The flow-through of the second column was designated α108-P, and its phosphospecificity was confirmed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests using pre-incubations with various phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides as appropriate. As a control, antibody that bound to the second column, which presumably represented species recognizing the peptide regardless of phosphorylation state, was able to detect tumor- or normal cell-derived Apoptin equally well. DNA constructs (50 ng/μl) were introduced into the nuclei of normal VH10 diploid fibroblasts growing on glass-bottomed plates (MatTek) using standard nuclear microinjection techniques. Cells were fixed sequentially with 1% formaldehyde (10 min), cold methanol (5 min), and cold 80% acetone (2 min) and then stained and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for Apoptin (using antibody 111.3) and 2,4-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for the morphological appearance of apoptosis essentially as described (9Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F. Grimbergen J.M. Klein B. Zhuang S. Falkenburg J.H. Backendorf C. Quax P.H. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 11: 5843-5847Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Microinjected DNAs were mixed with dextran-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine (1 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) to help trace the injected cells. At least 100 Apoptin-positive cells were scored per experiment, and several independent experiments were performed. For visualizing phosphorylated Apoptin in intact tumor cells, Saos-2 cells growing on glass coverslips in six-well plates were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-VP3 DNA using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), fixed with fresh methanol:acetone (1:1) (5 min at room temperature), and stained and analyzed as above, except cells were incubated simultaneously with the antibodies 111.3 to detect all Apoptin regardless of phosphorylation state and with α108-P to detect Apoptin phosphorylated on Thr-108. To determine whether tumor cell lysates contained an activity that could phosphorylate Apoptin, we developed a radioactive in vitro kinase assay using a bacterially produced recombinant Apoptin protein possessing an N-terminal MBP tag as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1, the Apoptin portion of this substrate was phosphorylated robustly by a lysate derived from the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 but negligibly by one from primary human mesenchymal stem cells. These results were extended with additional tumor or transformed cell lines (including human Jurkat T lymphoma, U2OS osteosarcoma, HT29 colon carcinoma, LCL Epstein-Barr transformed B lymphoma, and COS-1 SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblasts)versus normal cells (two independent sources of human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts, including VH10 (23Klein B. Pastink A. Odijk H. Westerveld A. van der Eb A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as well as low passage mouse embryo fibroblasts) (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with different E. coli-produced recombinant fusion proteins, including Apoptin bearing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (Apoptin-His) and an N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase tag (GST-Apoptin) (data not shown). These results indicate that an activity enriched in tumor or transformed cells, but not in healthy primary cells, can phosphorylate Apoptin. To determine whether Apoptin becomes phosphorylated differentially in live cells, we transfected Apoptin into various tumor cells versus normal VH10 fibroblasts and assessed the incorporation of radiolabel using immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE after metabolic [32P]orthophosphate labeling. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells did indeed harbor phosphorylated Apoptin, whereas in low passage VH10 cells there was no detectable radiolabel on a comparable amount of Apoptin protein. As a control, expression and phosphorylation of ectopically expressed p53 were detectable in both cell types (Fig. 2 B). In vivo phosphorylation of Apoptin also occurred in U2OS cells and H1299 lung carcinoma cells (Fig. 2 A). This specific difference in phosphorylation state was not trivially because of cell type, as an SV40-transformed version of VH10 fibroblasts (VHSV), but not its untransformed primary counterpart, was able to phosphorylate Apoptin in vivo (Fig. 2 C). A similar result was seen for the SV40-transformed keratinocyte line SVK14 versus a non-transformed passage one breast-derived keratinocyte culture (data not shown). These results suggest that Apoptin becomes modified specifically in a tumor or transformed environment. Because phosphorylation of Apoptin correlated with the transformed or tumorigenic state of the cell both in vitro and in vivo, we set out to map the modified residue to aid further exploration into the possible functional significance. Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vivo labeled protein derived from pCMV-VP3-transfected Saos-2 tumor cells versusvector-transfected controls revealed that specific phosphorylation occurred strongly on threonine(s) (Fig. 3 A). A similar result was obtained using U2OS cells (data not shown). We also saw a fainter phosphoserine signal, but this activity occurred in vector-transfected samples, as well, and was therefore likely derived from a closely migrating cellular contaminant. Parallel analyses using tryptic phosphopeptide mapping in Saos-2 cells showed that only a single tryptic fragment was radiolabeled, indicating that the complexity of Apoptin phosphorylation was fairly low (Fig. 3 B). To narrow the region of phosphorylation further, we transfected Saos-2 cells with a series of N-terminal GFP-fused deletion mutant constructs of Apoptin and assessed the phosphorylation status of their expressed products using the in vivo orthophosphate labeling assay. As shown in Fig. 3 C, whereas the N-terminal half of Apoptin (GFP-1-69) was not phosphorylated over the background of the assay (GFP alone), the C-terminal half (GFP-70–121) was as strongly phosphorylated as the full-length fusion protein (GFP-1–121). The analysis of smaller truncation mutants showed that the minimal domain required for phosphorylation resided between residues 100 and 121 (GFP-100–121), although including the region from 80 to 99 (GFP-80–121) resulted in more robust modification. The sequence between amino acids 100 and 121 contains only four threonine residues, a triple Thr run (106–108) on one predicted tryptic fragment and a lone Thr (position 114) on a separate fragment (Fig. 3 E). To distinguish between these two loci, as well as to assess the contribution to robust phosphorylation of other regions between 80 and 121, we tested a series of five-alanine scanning mutants in the ortholabeling assay. As shown in Fig. 3 D, abolishing the triple Thr run with a stretch of alanines from 106 to 110 (mutant Ala-106) completely eliminated phosphorylation of Apoptin in Saos-2 cells in vivo, whereas replacing the sequence including the lone Thr by five alanines at 111–115 (mutant Ala-111) had no effect. Taken together with the phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping data, this result suggests that phosphorylation of wild-type Apoptin occurs in the triple Thr region (106–108). Our experiments also demonstrated that replacement of region 91–95 with alanine residues (mutant Ala-91) reduced the phosphorylation efficiency reproducibly (Fig. 3 D). This result is consistent with the reduced phosphorylation seen with GFP-100–121 compared with GFP-80–121. Most likely the domain including 91 through 95 is required for efficient phosphorylation at the triple Thr region, perhaps contributing directly to the kinase docking site or indirectly to conformation at the phosphorylation site, but does not itself contain a modified residue. Five alanine replacements elsewhere between 86 and 121 had no effect on phosphorylation (data not shown; Ala-81 to Ala-85 could not be assessed, because these mutations abolish the immunoprecipitation epitope). To identify the phosphorylation site(s) conclusively, recombinant GST-Apoptin protein was phosphorylated by Saos-2 lysates in the radioactive in vitro kinase assay. After purification, the phosphorylated substrate was digested with trypsin, and the radiolabeled fragments were identified using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Afterward, these radioactive peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This experiment showed that Apoptin was phosphorylated solely on threonine 108 (Fig. 4). To confirm that Thr-108 was indeed phosphorylated in living cells, we raised and purified a rabbit polyclonal antibody (α108-P) against a short peptide phosphorylated at position 108 and determined its reactivity against ectopically expressed Apoptin in various tumor cells versus"

They are not only membrane components, but they also have important functions in regulation of cellular events (1Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sphingolipids are involved in stress responses, calcium homeostasis, regulation of cell growth, cell cycle control, and membrane traffic (1Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev.

They are modified post-translationally with a glycolipid anchor in the ER, which provides an alternative mechanism to a transmembrane domain for membrane insertion. In yeast, the ER to Golgi transport of GPI-anchored proteins has requirements distinct from that of other secretory proteins (2Horvath A. Sütterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J.

This requirement has been identified by the observation of impaired trafficking of these proteins in several mutants defective at different steps of sphingolipid biosynthesis. These mutants includelcb1-100, which have a temperature-sensitive serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis (3Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schroder S.

These results suggest strongly that certain sphingolipids are required specifically for the efficient transport of GPI-anchored proteins, but so far the relevant sphingolipids have not been identified. GPI-anchored proteins also are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in distinct vesicles from other secretory proteins (11Muñiz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The sorting of GPI-anchored proteins is dependent on the proper functions of the Rab GTPase Ypt1p and the tethering factors Uso1p and COG complex (Sec34/35p) (12Morsomme P. Riezman H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to these protein factors, sphingolipid/sterol-enriched detergent-insoluble microdomains, also known as lipid rafts, may also function in the sorting of GPI-anchored proteins. Rafts may function in several cellular events such as signal transduction, protein sorting, and lipid traffic (13Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). In yeast, raft-like structures have been proposed to play several roles in protein sorting (14Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9104-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was shown that GPI-anchored proteins are detergent-insoluble in the ER, and thus, rafts have been proposed to have a sorting function there (14Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Defining the precise function of sphingolipids in GPI-anchored protein transport in yeast may unravel the sorting mechanism of GPI-anchored proteins in the ER and the significance of raft structure in their transport. In this study, we show that ceramide and/or inositol sphingolipids are indispensable for GPI-anchored protein transport to the Golgi compartment. Interestingly, we found that in the absence of ceramide, a significant fraction of GPI-anchored proteins is no longer associated tightly with the ER membrane but behaves like peripheral membrane protein. This loose membrane association was neither because of the lack of a GPI-anchor attachment nor to the retention of the GPI-anchored proteins in the ER. The lack of tight membrane association is likely to be one of the reasons for the inefficient transport of GPI-anchored proteins to the Golgi. The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. RH5465 was obtained by crossing RH2043 with RH3804. Yeast cells were grown overnight in semi-synthetic medium, SDYE (2Horvath A. Sütterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To express wild-type and mutant Gas1p (L526R) in gas1 knock-out strains, we used plasmids YEplac195-GAS1 and PCNYG-(L526R) (16Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), respectively. To construct YEplac195-GAS1, a 2.4-kbp fragment of theGAS1 gene including the promoter region was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GCTCGGGCATGCGAATTCACAGGCCAGCCCTGGCTA and 5′-GCTCGGGAGCTCCAGCTGATATTATGGAGAAAGTACATA. The fragment was subcloned into YEplac195 (2 μm; URA3) using SphI and SacI sites in the fragment and the vector. To induce Gap1p expression we precultured strains in SUD (1.6 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids, 20 g/liter glucose, and 1.0 g/liter urea plus required supplements) overnight before starting cultures in SDYE. Stereoisomers of dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and phytosphingosine (PHS) were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA) and Sigma, respectively, and were dissolved in 100% ethanol at 10 mm as stock solutions.Table IStrains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceRH1638Matα gas1::LEU2 his4 ura3 bar1–1(16Nuoffer C.

Briefly, cells were grown overnight in SDYE at 24 °C to 0.5–2 × 107/ml, harvested, and suspended in S.D. medium without inositol. 2 × 108 cells were used for each sample and were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the absence or presence of 50 μm DHS stereoisomers and then labeled with 25 μCi of [3H]myo-inositol (10–25 Ci/mmol in H2O; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v). After removal of the insoluble fraction by centrifugation, the supernatant was dried. Half of the dried sample was treated by mild alkaline hydrolysis with 0.6 m NaOH in methanol to degrade glycerolipids, and lipids were re-extracted and desalted byn-butanol partitioning. The lipids were separated by TLC using Silica gel 60 plates (5553; Merck) in solvent system I (chloroform:methanol:0.25% KCl (55:45:10) per vol), and radiolabeled lipids were visualized using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard). Ceramide synthesis was assayed in vitro using stereoisomers of [3H]DHS as described previously (18Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The d-erythro andl-erythro stereoisomers of [4,5-3H]DHS were synthesized as described (19Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes and cytosol from wild-type cells were incubated with [4,5-3H]DHS (2,000,000 cpm) at 24 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 100 μm fumonisin B1, a specific inhibitor of acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide synthesis (20Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted as described above and analyzed by TLC in solvent system II (chloroform:acetic acid (9:1) (v/v)). Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation to measure Gas1p maturation were performed as described previously (3Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in SDYE at 24 °C to 0.5–2 × 107/ml, harvested, and resuspended in SD medium without methionine and cysteine. 5 × 107 cells were used for each time point and preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the absence or presence of the individual stereoisomer of DHS or PHS or the specific inhibitors and labeled with 100 μCi of EasyTAGTM express protein labeling mix, [35S] (1175 Ci/mmol in aqueous solution; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 min. The chase was initiated by addition of cold methionine and cysteine in 0.3 m(NH4)2SO4 to 1% final concentration, respectively. The reactions were terminated by adding both NaN3 and NaF to 10 mm final concentration. The radiolabeled cells were suspended in TEPI (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) and lysed with glass beads. The lysates were boiled in the presence of 1% SDS for 5 min and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was diluted four times with TNET (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and used for immunoprecipitation of Gas1p with anti-Gas1p rabbit antiserum and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed and quantified using the Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard). The percentage of mature Gas1p was determined by calculating the ratio of the 125-kDa mature form to the total signal (125- and 105-kDa ER form) and multiplying by 100. GPI anchor attachment was examined as described (3Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, crude cell extracts from radiolabeled cells were solubilized with Triton X-114 at a final concentration of 1%. After two rounds of partitioning into detergent and aqueous phases, the detergent phase was diluted 10 times with TEPI and divided into two fractions, which were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 unit of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 30 °C for 3 h. Triton X-114 phase separation was repeated, and proteins were precipitated from the final detergent and aqueous phases using 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were resuspended and boiled in 1% SDS for 5 min, and samples were processed for Gas1p immunoprecipitation. Unanchored Gas1p segregated into the primary aqueous phase. The anchored Gas1p partitioned into the primary detergent phase and shifted into the aqueous phase after PI-PLC treatment. The measurement of Gas1p released into the medium was done as described previously. Pulse-chase experiments were done in the presence of 0.125 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin in the medium (16Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To follow the membrane association of transport intermediates, we pulse-labeled cells for 6 min and chased for 15 min as described above. The radiolabeled cells were suspended in TEPI and lysed with glass beads. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min, the crude cell extracts were divided into three fractions. One was mixed with an equal amount of TEPI, one was mixed with 0.2m Na2CO3, pH 12, in TEPI (to give final pH of 11), and one was mixed with 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in TEPI and incubated on ice for 30 min. Soluble and pellet fractions were prepared by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fractions from 0.1 mNa2CO3 treatment were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and other fractions were solubilized directly at 55 °C for 5 min by addition of SDS to 1%. All were processed for immunoprecipitation using the corresponding rabbit antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. To better define the role of sphingolipids in GPI-anchored protein transport from the ER to the Golgi compartment, we first investigated the structural requirements for sphingolipid synthesis using stereoisomers of the ceramide precursor, DHS, whose structures are shown in Fig.1 A.d-erythro-DHS is the naturally occurring form. To analyze sphingolipid synthesis, we preincubated wild-type andlcb1-100 mutant cells at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence of each DHS isomer and then labeled sphingolipid by adding [3H]myo-inositol for 60 min. As described previously (17Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), lcb1-100 has an extremely low level of sphingolipid synthesis (Fig. 1 B,lane 4) at 37 °C when compared with wild-type cells (lane 2). Addition of d-erythro-DHS restored the biosynthesis of all sphingolipids inlcb1-100 mutant cells at 37 °C (lane 6). l-threo-DHS restored sphingolipid biosynthesis in lcb1-100 mutant cells to the same extent as d-erythro-DHS (lane 8 versus lane 6), but the other two stereoisomers,l-erythro- andd-threo-DHS, could not restore sphingolipid synthesis (lanes 10 and 12). Next, to determine the stereospecificity of ceramide synthesis, we measured ceramide synthase activity using microsomal membranes in the presence of d-erythro andl-erythro forms of 3[H] DHS, as described previously (18Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We found that dihydroceramide was synthesized from the d-erythro but not thel-erythro form of [3H] DHS (Fig.1 C), suggesting that ceramide synthesis is stereospecific. We observed that the synthesis of dihydroceramide was fumonisin B1-sensitive, confirming we are measuring acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide synthesis activity (20Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we studied GPI-anchored protein transport (Fig.2 A) under the same conditions we used to assay sphingolipid biosynthesis. After a 15-min preincubation of lcb1-100 mutant cells at 37 °C in the presence or absence of individual DHS stereoisomers, we labeled cells with 35[S]-labeling mix for 6 min and chased for the indicated time. We analyzed maturation of Gas1p, whose ER form migrates at 105 kDa and whose mature form, produced after arrival at the Golgi, migrates at 125 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Mutantlcb1-100 cells show a severe delay of Gas1p maturation (Fig. 2 A, EtOH) (3Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only the two DHS stereoisomers, d-erythro andl-threo, that can be incorporated into ceramide and sphingolipids could restore ER to Golgi GPI-anchored protein transport completely (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that ceramide and/or inositol sphingolipids are required for transport. To confirm this, we studied the effects of inhibitors specific for syntheses of ceramide and inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC). In the presence of the ceramide synthesis inhibitor australifungin (21Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. et al.J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the restoration by d-erythro-DHS was reduced significantly, suggesting that ceramide synthesis is necessary for GPI-anchored protein transport. The IPC synthesis inhibitor aureobasidin A (22Zhong W. Murphy D.J. Georgopapadakou N.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also affected the restoration efficiency somewhat, suggesting that inositol sphingolipids may play a role in transport. The incomplete inhibition by both inhibitors could be because of incomplete inhibitions of ceramide and IPC synthases under these conditions (high DHS concentration) or could be because of a partial restoration by DHS. To provide additional evidence for a requirement for ceramide synthesis, we tested transport efficiency under the condition when ceramide synthesis is eliminated almost completely by other means. The mutant lcb3, ysr3 double knock-out mutants, which are defective for dephosphorylation of phosphorylated sphingoid base, combined withlcb1-100, produce very little ceramide and inositol sphingolipid from exogenous DHS (17Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 23Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We compared the concentration of DHS that efficiently restored transport defect in these cells versus that needed for thelcb1-100 mutant (Fig. 2 B). Forlcb1-100 cells, 10 μm d-erythro-DHS restored GPI-anchored protein transport considerably. In contrast, in lcb1/3,ysr3 cells, transport was not restored significantly even at 50 μm d-erythro-DHS. From these results, we conclude that ceramide and/or inositol sphingolipid synthesis is necessary for GPI-anchored protein transport. To address the possibility that other DHS derivatives, specifically phosphorylated sphingoid bases or PHS, might be required for GPI-anchored protein transport, we used two other mutant strains. Mutant lcb4, lcb5 double knock-out cells also carrying the lcb1-100 allele cannot produce DHS-1P from exogenous d-erythro-DHS (17Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and sur2-disrupted cells, combined with thelcb1-100 allele, are defective for hydroxylation of exogenous DHS to form PHS (17Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored protein transport was clearly restored by exogenous d-erythro-DHS in lcb1/4/5 mutant cells and by bothd-erythro form of DHS or PHS inlcb1/sur2 mutant cells (Fig. 2 C). These results show that phosphorylation of sphingoid bases and their interconversion between DHS and PHS are not required for GPI-anchored protein transport. To understand the role of sphingolipids in GPI-anchored protein transport, we attempted to use an in vitro assay that measures the efficiency of packaging of proteins into ER-derived vesicles, sorting from other secretory proteins, and the efficiency of delivery of cargo proteins to the Golgi structure (11Muñiz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). During the course of this study, we noticed that a significant fraction of GPI-anchored proteins was released specifically fromlcb1-100 mutant membranes to the soluble fraction. This release was cytosol-independent (data not shown) and was enhanced at elevated temperature (30 °C) and by addition of an energy source (ATP and GTP; data not shown). Therefore, we investigated the membrane association of GPI-anchored proteins inlcb1-100 cells using conventional fractionation methods. We preincubated mutant or wild-type cells for 15 min at 37 °C, pulse-labeled for 6 min, and chased for 15 min. Then, we prepared crude cell extracts and assessed membrane association of two GPI-anchored proteins under three different conditions, buffer alone, high pH, and detergent (Fig.3 A). Inlcb1-100 mutant cells, but not in wild-type cells, a significant fraction of Gas1p was no longer associated with membranes even under the buffer conditions (39% versus7.7%). More Gas1p was released from the membrane by Na2CO3, pH 11, treatment (54%versus 7.2%). Gas1p has been proposed to associate with detergent-insoluble structures in the ER (26Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, Gas1p was solubilized poorly by 1% Triton X-100 from wild-type cells. However, Gas1p was solubilized almost completely fromlcb1-100 mutant cells (91% versus53%). We also observed a similar weak membrane association of another GPI-anchored protein, Yps1p, in lcb1-100 cells. In contrast to wild-type cells, most of Yps1p was in the ER form after a 15-min chase in lcb1-100 cells, confirming that the general maturation delay of GPI-anchored proteins inlcb1-100 cells. We also noticed that the small amount of mature forms of Gas1p and Yps1p seen inlcb1-100 cells were associated more tightly with membranes than were the ER forms. As controls for these experiments, we examined membrane association of α−COP (peripheral protein) and Gap1p (integral membrane protein). Both proteins behaved as expected in these cell types. From these results, we conclude that the binding of GPI-anchored proteins to the ER membrane is weakened severely inlcb1-100 mutant cells. To rule out the possibility that prolonged ER retention is the cause of the weakened membrane association of GPI-anchored proteins inlcb1-100 mutant cells, we assayed membrane association in sec18 mutant cells, which shows a block in all ER to Golgi protein transport. The ER forms of Gas1p and Yps1p accumulated in sec18 mutant cells were not released like those in the lcb1-100 mutant. The results confirmed that the weak membrane association inlcb1-100 cells was not because of its retention in the ER. Next, to investigate the possibility that loose membrane association might be because of inefficient GPI-anchor assembly or addition inlcb1-100 cells, we examined the partitioning behavior of Gas1p using Triton X-114 (16Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We labeled cells as in Fig.3 A, prepared cell extracts, solubilized extracts in Triton X-114 at 4 °C, and subjected them to phase partitioning at 32 °C. Fig. 3 B shows that Gas1p from wild-type andlcb1-100 cells partitions into the Triton X-114 detergent phase with the same efficiency (left columns). In addition, the Gas1p found in the detergent phase could be shifted completely to the aqueous phase by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to remove the diacylglycerol moiety of GPI-anchor (right columns). Thus we confirmed that GPI-anchoring efficiency was not affected inlcb1-100 cells, in agreement with previous observations (3Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally to test whether the weakened membrane association of GPI-anchored proteins reflects a general defect in membrane association of lipid-anchored proteins, we assessed membrane association of the prenylated protein, Ypt1p (27Jiang Y. Rossi G. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1993; 366: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C shows that membrane association of Ypt1p is similar in wild-type andlcb1-100 cells, suggesting that the weak membrane association is specific for GPI-anchored proteins. As exogenous DHS restores GPI-anchored protein transport we checked whether it also restored membrane association of GPI-anchored proteins. d-erythro-DHS clearly restored membrane association, as well as maturation, to a wild-type levels. On the other hand, l-erythro-DHS, which was not incorporated into ceramide, did not restore membrane association of Gas1p (data not shown). These results lead to the conclusion that ceramide and/or inositol sphingolipid are necessary for stable membrane association of GPI-anchored proteins. These results also suggest that the weak membrane association could be the reason for the transport defect in lcb1-100 cells. To test whether weak membrane association of Gas1p could cause the transport delay of Gas1p in wild-type cells, we used a mutant Gas1p containing a point mutation (L526R) in the hydrophobic stretch of the carboxy-terminal sequence that is required for GPI-anchor a"
https://openalex.org/W2102297296,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that play important roles in bone formation, embryonic patterning, and epidermal-neural cell fate decisions. BMPs signal through pathway specific mediators such as Smads1 and 5, but the upstream regulation of BMP-specific Smads has not been fully characterized. Here we report the identification of SANE (Smad1 AntagonisticEffector), a novel protein with significant sequence similarity to nuclear envelop proteins such as MAN1. SANE binds to Smad1/5 and to BMP type I receptors and regulates BMP signaling. SANE specifically blocks BMP-dependent signaling inXenopus embryos and in a mammalian model of bone formation but does not inhibit the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway. Inhibition of BMP signaling by SANE requires interaction between SANE and Smad1, because a SANE mutant that does not bind Smad1 does not inhibit BMP signaling. Furthermore, inhibition appears to be mediated by inhibition of BMP-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, blocking ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of Smad1.

Because then BMP family members have been identified in diverse organisms from Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans to mammals and, in addition to their roles in bone formation, have been shown to play critical roles in embryonic patterning and neural induction (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 3Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 4Massague J. Chen Y.G.

Biol. 1997; 13: 611-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar).The importance of BMP-related factors in embryonic development has been elucidated by extensive analysis in model organisms. For example, inDrosophila, the BMP orthologue decapentaplegic(dpp) plays a critical role in dorsal-ventral patterning of the embryo as well as patterning of the imaginal discs (8Gelbart W.M. Development. 1989; 107 suppl.: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar). In C. elegans, BMPs regulate the size of the organism as well as patterning of the male tail (9Padgett R.W. Das P. Krishna S. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A role for BMPs in vertebrate development was first suggested by observations that ectopic expression of BMPs causes expansion of ventral tissues and reduction of dorsal and anterior structures in Xenopus embryos (10Dale L. Howes G. Price B.M.J. Smith J.C. Development. 1992; 115: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jones C.M. Lyons K.M. Lapan P.M. Wright C.V.E. Hogan B.J.M. Development. 1992; 115: 639-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ectodermal explants (12Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In support of this, BMP-4 is expressed in a ventral-lateral crescent in the marginal zone of gastrula stage embryos (12Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). BMPs have also been implicated in neural cell fate determination in Xenopus (13Sasai Y., Lu, B. Steinbeisser H. Derobertis E.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 14Wilson P.A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Nature. 1995; 376: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar).The importance of BMP signaling in bone formation and in vertebrate development has been confirmed by genetic analyses in mouse and zebrafish (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 3Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 5Whitman M.

Thus, mutation of the BMP-5 (short ear mutant) and BMP-7 genes in mice disrupt multiple aspects of skeletal development (16Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking BMP-2,BMP-4, or the BMP type I receptor, ALK-3, diein utero prior to the onset of bone formation, supporting an additional role for BMPs in earlier developmental processes, including mesoderm induction and neural-epidermal cell fate decisions (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, a forward genetic screen for defects in early embryonic development yielded a series of dorsalized mutants, including mutations in genes encoding BMP 2b and 7 (swirl andsnailhouse), the BMP receptor ALK8 (lost-a-fin), and other extracellular and intracellular components of this tightly regulated signaling pathway (e.g. Smad5/somitabunand tolloid/mini-fin) (15Schier A.F.

Phosphorylated Smad proteins form a multimeric complex that translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription through interaction with DNA binding proteins or through direct DNA binding.Smad proteins can be divided into three broad groups, the pathway-restricted Smads, the common-mediator Smads, and the antagonistic Smads (4Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Miyazono K. ten Duke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway restricted Smads are regulated by specific TGF-β superfamily members (20Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). For example, Smad1 and Smad5 are specifically activated by BMPs, which lead to phosphorylation of these Smads on carboxyl-terminal serines (21Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Similarly, activin/nodal/TGF-β ligands cause phosphorylation of analogous serines in Smad2 and Smad3 (22Abdollah S.

Overexpression of Smad1 inXenopus mimics ectopic BMP signaling, inducing ventral mesoderm from ectodermal explants (24Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A.

Development. 1996; 122: 2359-2366PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Smad2 can induce dorsal mesoderm, similar to the effect of activin- or nodal-related proteins (reviewed in Ref. 5Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).BMP signaling is highly regulated in Drosophila and in vertebrates (20Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar), as evidenced by the marked defects in embryonic development observed when these regulatory components are mutated in flies, zebrafish, or mice (2–5,15). Thus extracellular signaling by BMPs is regulated by a number of secreted proteins, including BMP binding factors such as chordin, noggin, follistatin, gremlin, and cerberus (4Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as upstream molecules that regulate chordin function, such as twisted gastrulation and tolloid (15Schier A.F. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In addition, intracellular regulators of BMP signaling have been identified, including inhibitory Smads, BAMBI, Smurf1, and a number of nuclear proteins, including Tob and OAZ (4Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T.

Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).To identify novel molecules that regulate the intracellular BMP/Smad1 signaling pathway, we have undertaken a yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen using Smad1 as bait. In this work, we describe the Smad1 interacting protein SANE (Smad1Antagonistic Effector), which is expressed in early vertebrate embryos in a pattern that overlaps Smad1, binds to type I BMP receptors as well as Smad1, and specifically antagonizes BMP/Smad1 signaling in embryos as well as in a mammalian model of bone formation. Our data show that SANE functions by inhibiting BMP-dependent Smad1 phosphorylation and thus blocking the nuclear translocation of Smad1.DISCUSSIONOur data show that SANE specifically interacts with and regulates the BMP pathway. In support of this, SANE binds directly to BMP pathway-specific Smads1 and 5, but weakly, if at all, with activin/TGF-β-specific Smad2 and 3; binds strongly to type I BMP-specific receptors (ALK-3 and ALK-6); inhibits BMP signaling (but not activin or TGF-β) in multiple established assays of BMP signaling; and is expressed in a pattern consistent with a role in BMP/Smad1 signaling. Furthermore, the dorsalizing effects of SANE are reversed by co-expression of Smad1, indicating that the effect of SANE is specific to the BMP/Smad1 pathway and acts at or upstream of Smad1. Although ALK-2 is also a BMP receptor, the sequence of ALK-2 is sufficiently distinct from ALK-3 and -6 that it was not recognized as a BMP receptor until recently, suggesting that its structure is significantly different than ALK-3 and -6 (23Macias-Silva M.

ALK-3 and ALK-6 are type I receptors for BMP4 and BMP7, and ALK-2 is a type I receptor for BMP6 and 7 but not BMP4, which may suggest that ALK-3 and -6 have biological roles that are similar to each other but distinct from ALK-2 (48ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Macias-Silva M.

This is consistent with our observation that SANE interacts with ALK-3 and ALK-6 and not with ALK-2.BMP signaling is highly regulated by a number of extracellular inhibitors, including chordin, noggin, follistatin, and gremlin, which were first identified in Xenopus as dorsalizing factors that specifically inhibit BMP function (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 3Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 4Massague J. Chen Y.G.

Similar to these proteins, SANE blocks BMP-mediated ventral mesoderm induction and leads to formation of a partial secondary dorsal axis when expressed in ventral cells. In addition, SANE, like these other inhibitors (51Harland R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 52Weinstein D.C. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Annu. Rev.

Res. 2001; 16: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), induces neural tissue in ectodermal explants and blocks BMP function in mammalian cells as well.SANE bears superficial similarity to other proteins that interact with the TGF-β and BMP pathways. The BMP and activin membrane bound inhibitor (BAMBI) is a transmembrane pseudoreceptor that antagonizes both activin and BMP receptors and, like SANE, mimics other BMP inhibitors when overexpressed in Xenopus embryos (54Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, unlike SANE, BAMBI is not specific for the BMP pathway and is not known to interact with Smads. SARA, like SANE, interacts with both receptors and Smads but is specific for the activin/TGF-β pathway and does not interact with BMP pathway-specific Smads or BMP receptors (55Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SARA shows no sequence similarity to SANE, and ectopic SARA expression does not inhibit TGF-β signaling, whereas SANE inhibits BMP signaling. Smurf1 and Tob, like SANE, specifically bind BMP pathway Smads and antagonize BMP signaling (29Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T.

Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, unlike SANE, Smurf1 and Tob do not interact with BMP receptors and do not inhibit Smad1 nuclear translocation; Smurf1 acts by accelerating Smad1 protein turnover and Tob sequesters Smads in nuclear bodies.Intracellular Smad antagonists, such as Smads 6 and 7, are induced in response to BMP or TGF-β signaling and are proposed to act as feedback inhibitors of the respective pathways (57Casellas R.

Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to mediate their effects by binding to type I receptors and preventing pathway-specific Smad activation, although Smad6 has also been reported to sequester Smad1 in a nonfunctional complex (60Imamura T.

Thus, while SANE and Smad6 do not share obvious sequence similarity, they appear to have similar activities in the regulation of BMP signaling.SANE shows no apparent sequence similarity to other proteins that interact with BMP-pathway specific Smads or BMP receptors, including BAMBI, Tob, Smurf1, OAZ, and BRAM1 (29Yoshida Y.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, SANE does show sequence similarity with the nuclear envelope protein MAN1 (37Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Like MAN1, SANE has an LEM domain near the amino terminus. In other LEM domain proteins, this region has been shown to interact with the DNA binding protein BAF (barrier toautointegration factor) and with DNA (65Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Except for the LEM domain, however, much of the N-terminal domain of MAN1, which is required for localization of the protein to the inner nuclear membrane, diverges significantly from the corresponding region of SANE (66Wu W. Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, unlike MAN1, the hydropathy analysis of SANE is more consistent with a single transmembrane domain, placing the SANE amino terminus topologically outside the cell. The greatest sequence similarity between MAN1 and SANE is found in the carboxyl-terminal region, which includes the Smad1 binding domain of SANE, suggesting that this may represent a functionally conserved domain, and it is interesting to consider that the MAN1 carboxyl-terminal region could also interact with Smad1 to regulate BMP signaling, perhaps in the nucleus. Indeed, regulation of transcription has been suggested as a possible function for other LEM domain proteins (67Wilson K.L. Zastrow M.S. Lee K.K. Cell. 2001; 104: 647-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The presence in mouse and Xenopus of several expressed sequence tags encoding related, but distinct genes raises the intriguing possibilities that SANE is one of a family of TGF-β/Smad interacting genes and that other SANE-like molecules may regulate the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway.SANE is expressed in cells that are likely to respond to BMP signaling, because the expression of SANE parallels Smad1 expression in most tissues. However, at the gastrula stage SANE is enriched in the dorsal marginal zone, similar to other BMP antagonists, such as chordin, noggin, andfollistatin, whereas Smad1mRNA is ubiquitous at this stage, consistent with a role for SANE as an inhibitor of BMP signaling in the dorsal marginal zone.Our model for the mechanism of SANE action suggests that SANE interacts with the BMP type I receptor through its amino-terminal domain and with Smad1 through its carboxyl-terminal domain to inhibit BMP signaling. Inhibition of BMP signaling by SANE is supported by biochemical data, analysis in cultured cells and embryonic explants, and phenotypic analysis in intact embryos. Thus, biochemically, we have shown that SANE blocks phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1 by the BMP type I receptor. As a consequence, SANE prevents translocation of Smad1 to the nucleus and blocks BMP-dependent gene expression. This inhibition is clearly specific to the BMP/Smad1 pathway, because Smad2 translocation and Smad2-dependent transcriptional activation are not affected by SANE. We have also demonstrated that SANE antagonizes BMP-induced bone formation in C2C12 cells, BMP-induced ventral mesodermal gene expression and neural to epidermal cell fate specification in embryonic explants, and endogenous ventral mesoderm formation in intact embryos, but that it does not inhibit biological responses to activin or TGF-β. This evidence for SANE as an inhibitor of BMP signaling comes from gain-of-function studies inXenopus and mammalian cells, similar to analysis of other BMP antagonists. However, these experiments do not rule out the possibility that SANE could act as an adaptor that mediates interaction between BMP type I receptor and Smad1 and that could either positively or negatively regulate signaling. In this scenario, SANE could recruit Smad1 to the type I receptor for its subsequent activation, thus acting in a positive role in BMP signaling. This adaptor model would predict that expression of SANE at lower doses may potentiate BMP signaling if endogenous SANE is limiting. However, we have not detected any enhancement of BMP-4 activity over a wide dose range of SANERNA in the induction of mesodermal markers such as Xbra andXWnt8 or in the induction of Xvent.2-luciferase. 2G. P. Raju, P. S. Klein, and H.-C. Huang, unpublished data.Similarly, expression of SANE in dorsal blastomeres does not ventralize Xenopus embryos at any dose tested (Table I and data not shown). These data do not support a role for SANE as a positive regulator of BMP signaling; however, further studies, including loss-of-function experiments, will be needed to validate this hypothesis.In summary, SANE interacts with two components of the BMP pathway, is expressed in the embryo in a pattern that closely parallels Smad1 expression, and specifically inhibits Smad1-dependent signaling in Xenopus embryos and mammalian cells. Inhibition by SANE in Xenopus embryos is functionally similar to the effects of other BMP inhibitors, such as chordin, noggin, follistatin, gremlin, and tob, yet SANE defines a new class of genes to regulate this pathway that uniquely interacts with both BMP receptors and BMP pathway specific Smads. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)1 are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that were first identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone formation in the soft tissue of rats (1Urist M.R. DeLange R.J. Finnerman G.A.M. Science. 1983; 220: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Because then BMP family members have been identified in diverse organisms from Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans to mammals and, in addition to their roles in bone formation, have been shown to play critical roles in embryonic patterning and neural induction (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 3Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 4Massague J. Chen Y.G.

Biol. 1997; 13: 611-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The importance of BMP-related factors in embryonic development has been elucidated by extensive analysis in model organisms. For example, inDrosophila, the BMP orthologue decapentaplegic(dpp) plays a critical role in dorsal-ventral patterning of the embryo as well as patterning of the imaginal discs (8Gelbart W.M. Development. 1989; 107 suppl.: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar). In C. elegans, BMPs regulate the size of the organism as well as patterning of the male tail (9Padgett R.W. Das P. Krishna S. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A role for BMPs in vertebrate development was first suggested by observations that ectopic expression of BMPs causes expansion of ventral tissues and reduction of dorsal and anterior structures in Xenopus embryos (10Dale L. Howes G. Price B.M.J. Smith J.C. Development. 1992; 115: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jones C.M. Lyons K.M. Lapan P.M. Wright C.V.E. Hogan B.J.M. Development. 1992; 115: 639-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ectodermal explants (12Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In support of this, BMP-4 is expressed in a ventral-lateral crescent in the marginal zone of gastrula stage embryos (12Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). BMPs have also been implicated in neural cell fate determination in Xenopus (13Sasai Y., Lu, B. Steinbeisser H. Derobertis E.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 14Wilson P.A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Nature. 1995; 376: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The importance of BMP signaling in bone formation and in vertebrate development has been confirmed by genetic analyses in mouse and zebrafish (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 3Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 5Whitman M.

Thus, mutation of the BMP-5 (short ear mutant) and BMP-7 genes in mice disrupt multiple aspects of skeletal development (16Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking BMP-2,BMP-4, or the BMP type I receptor, ALK-3, diein utero prior to the onset of bone formation, supporting an additional role for BMPs in earlier developmental processes, including mesoderm induction and neural-epidermal cell fate decisions (2Hogan B.L.

However, it only exhibited serine/threonine kinase activity in autophosphorylation reactions or with added substrates.

In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, PP1C is encoded by GLC7(DIS2) and has over 80% sequence identity with mammalian PP1C (1Feng Z.H. Wilson S.E. Peng Z.Y. Schlender K.K. Reimann E.M. Trumbly R.J.

R subunits directly restrict activity of PP1C and target the enzyme to a specific subcellular location or substrate. Well known R subunits include the GM/GL subunit, which targets PP1C to glycogen particles (14Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

In the yeast,GLC8 encodes a protein resembling mammalian Inh2, although there is only 28% identity in primary sequence (8Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics J. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular localization and isolation of Inh2 and PP1 (27Tung H.Y. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Vandenheede J.R. Agostinis P.

Protein Phosphatases. 1991; 6: 375-390Google Scholar) raised questions as to whether Inh2 is bound to PP1 or might associate with other partners besides PP1. To address these questions, we performed the yeast two-hybrid study using Inh2 as bait. KPI-2 is one of the proteins we identified, cloned, expressed, and characterized. Here we describe the biochemical properties of this novel transmembrane protein, which has a kinase domain and a C-terminal domain that associates with PP1C. KPI-2 is a serine/threonine kinase that can autophosphorylate and also phosphorylate PP1C at Thr320 and inactivate its phosphatase activity. KPI-2 interacts with Inh2 in conjunction with PP1, and this forms a complex where PP1 is associated with two different regulators. Calf thymus Histone H1 and Microcystin-LR were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. [32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel were obtained from Sigma. Mouse anti-PP1C monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Phospho-Thr-Pro monoclonal antibody and phospho-PP1α(Thr320) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Phospho-Ser antibody was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sf9 cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. The library screen was performed by using human Inh2 as bait. Residues 1–197 of Inh2 were inserted into a pGBT10 vector, a derivative of pGBT9 that contains the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The library was a 9-day embryonic mouse cDNA cloned into pVP16 vector, which contains the Gal4 activation domain (created by Dr. S. Hollenberg, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). The screening was done by using the large-scale, sequential transformation method (30Zhu L. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 173-196PubMed Google Scholar). 2 × 106 clones were screened. Positive clones were tested first for expression of the HIS3 gene (His+) by growth of the clones on the plates lacking histidine (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His). The positives of those were tested for expression of the reporter gene, lacZ, using an assay for β-galactosidase activity. Clones were rescued by electroporation intoEscherichia coli HB101 and grown on M9 plates lacking leucine, which allowed for analysis of positives by transformation tests and DNA sequencing. For protein-protein interaction, we used an alternative yeast two-hybrid system. Inh2 or PP1Cα gene was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT10 vector, and KPI-2 C-terminal wild type (residues 1099–1503), AA-mutant, or IB-4 (KPI-2 fragment from two-hybrid screen) was fused to the Gal4-activation domain in a pVP16 vector. Both bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into HF7c cells. Protein-protein interaction was determined by checking the growth of clones on the plate lacking histidine (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His). mRNA was isolated from HeLa cells with a QuickPrepTM Micro mRNA purification kit (AmershamBiosciences). N- and C-terminal portions of KPI-2 cDNA were synthesized separately using a One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Primers were designed according to the sequence of KIAA1079 cDNA, and the following primers were used (Fig. 1 A): for N-terminal, forward primer containing BamHI site 5′-TAT AATGGATCC ACC ATG CCG GGG CCG CCG GCG TT-3′, reverse primer containing HindIII site 5′-TGT GTT CTT TGC TGG ACA ATG AAGCTT TTA GTA AGT-3′; for C-terminal, forward primer containing HindIII site 5′-ACT TAC TAA AAGCTT CAT TGT CCA GCA AAG AAC ACA-3′, reverse primer containing XhoI site 5′-CACTCGAGG TCC TTT TCT CCG TCT TCG CTG CTT CC-3′. The amplified C terminus was subcloned into a pCMV myc-tagged vector with an HindIII-XhoI site. The full-length KPI-2 was created by inserting the N-terminal portion into the plasmid containing the C-terminal portion at theBamHI-HindIII site. The construct of KPI-2 full-length was named pCMV-KPI-2-full-length. The HindIII site was repaired to original sequence by using a Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. pCMV-KPI-2-N-terminal was constructed by inserting an N-terminal fragment (1–703 residues, amplified by PCR) into pCMV myc-tagged vector with a BamHI-XhoI site. GST-PKI-2 was constructed by inserting a C-terminal cDNA fragment (amplified by PCR), including PP1C binding motif (residues 1099–1503) into pGEX-Parallel3 vector, and was named pGEX-KPI-2-wt. We also mutated the PP1C binding motif (VTF) of KPI-2 by substituting Val1355 and Phe1357 with Ala to produce pGEX-KPI-2-AA-mut, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. FLAG-tagged KPI-2-wt and KPI-2-AA-mut were constructed by ligating aBamHI-XhoI fragment from pGEX-KPI-2-wt or AA-mut into pcDNA3-Flag2AB vector. The fragments of KPI-2 C-terminal wild type-(1099–1503) and AA-mutant were also subcloned into yeast expression vector pVP16; we named these pVP16-KPI-2-wt and pVP16-KPI-2-AA-mut. pFastBac-His6-KPI-2-kinase plasmid was constructed for use in the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). The KPI-2 fragment, including a kinase domain (residues 94–600), was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pFastBac HTb vector with aBamHI-EcoRI site to form a recombinant pFastBac donor plasmid. All the constructs are shown in Fig. 1 B. All DNA sequences above were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing in the Biomolecular Research Facility of the University of Virginia. Northern blotting was performed using Clontech human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) Blots according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The membrane was probed with32P-labeled cDNA corresponding to the kinase domain (280–1800 nt) of KPI-2. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain (3295–4509 nt). After washing, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen for 72 h at −70 °C. COS7, HeLa, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 10-cm plates in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and subcultured every 2–3 days. Cells were transfected by using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Pefabloc-sc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For Western blotting, equal amount of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG, anti-PP1C, or anti-Inh2 antibody. COS7 cells transfected with pCMV-KPI2-N-terminal for 24 h were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmPefabloc-sc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. The cells were disrupted by homogenization, and the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized again, and the supernatants were pooled and then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 0.25m sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and concentrated by using Centricon Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore). The membrane pellets were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The protein concentration was measured, and an equal amount of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-myc antibody. The donor plasmid pFastBac-KPI-2 kinase-(94–600) was transformed into DH10Bac-competent cells for transposition into Bacmid. The recombinant Bacmid DNA was identified by PCR and transfected into Sf9 cells and incubated for 5 days at 27 °C. The recombinant baculoviruses were harvested to obtain the P1 viruses and then amplified with P1 viruses to produce high titer P2, P3 viruses. The virus titer was measured by the cell culture center of the University of Virginia. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses, and cells were collected 60 h later by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitors as above), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then subsequently thawed on ice. The samples were sonicated to lyse all the cells. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 1 h at 4 °C and transferred to a column. The column was washed with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitors. The proteins were eluted with 150 mm imidazole, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. An aliquot of 10 μl from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and anti-His immunoblotting. The fractions containing recombinant kinase were pooled and were further purified by Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography using an NaCl gradient from 100 to 600 mm. A lysate from Sf9 cells transfected with wild type baculovirus was processed in parallel. Autophosphorylation was performed by incubating purified recombinant KPI-2 kinase at 30 °C for 20 min in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4 mm Pefabloc-sc, and 100 μm [32P]ATP (10 μCi). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 6× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and quantitated by excising the band corresponding to the protein and measuring the radioactivity with a scintillation counter. The substrate phosphorylation used 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP), Histone H1, recombinant His6-Inh2, or poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) under the same conditions. The eluant from Sf9 cells transfected with wild type baculovirus was used as negative control for all the kinase assays. Following kinase reaction and autoradiography, the band corresponding to the KPI-2 kinase and MBP were excised. The samples were digested by trypsin overnight followed by acid hydrolysis for 1 h in 6 m HCl at 100 °C. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out using one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis at pH 2.5 (31Jelinek T. Weber M. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 629-630Google Scholar). The phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid standards were included in the samples, and their locations were determined by Ninhydrin staining. Both GST-KPI-2-wt and GST-KPI-2-AA-mut were expressed in E. coli DH5α and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST-KPI2-wt or AA-mut fusion protein (2 μg) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with HeLa cell lysates at 4 °C for 1 h as described previously (32Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The beads were washed extensively, and PP1C binding was detected by immunoblotting with anti-PP1C antibody. The content of the GST fusion protein was determined by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. PP1C activity was assayed by the release of 32P phosphate from32P-labeled phosphorylase A as described in Shenolikar and Ingebritsen (33Shenolikar S. Ingebritsen T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 102-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Activity of PP1C purified from rabbit skeletal muscle was determined in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15 μm32P-labeled phosphorylase A at 30 °C for 15 min. Acid-soluble 32P was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. To identify binding proteins for Inh2, we employed yeast two-hybrid analysis with human Inh2 (residues 1–197) as bait. One of six independent clones was a fragment of an uncharacterized protein encoded by the human open reading frame of KIAA1079 (NM-011575). The fragment identified in the Inh2 screen, called IB-4, was the region of residues 1344–1450, including the PP1C binding motif VTF (Fig.1 A). We cloned the cDNA from HeLa cells by using RT-PCR and named it KPI-2 (Kinase/Phosphatase/Inhibitor-2). Our KPI-2 cDNA clone was 4512 nucleotides in length encoding a 1503-amino acid residue protein (GenBankTM accession numberAY130988) and matched with human chromosome 7q21.3-q22.1. The KIAA1079 sequence differs from KPI-2 by missing 94 nucleotides that were thought to be an intron with a mismatched splicing junction. The domain structure of KPI-2 protein is shown in Fig. 1 A. There are two predicted transmembrane helices (available at www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/) that extend between amino acid residue ranges 11–29 and 46–63 near the N terminus. There is one kinase domain (residues 137–407) (www.kinase.com), which contains an ATP binding motif (residues 143–168) and has about 60% sequence identity with mouse apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATYK) (34Gaozza E. Baker S.J. Vora R.K. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Raghunath M. Patti R. Bannerman P. Lee C. Baker S. Sutton L. Phil P. Damodar R. Mol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal region, there is a predicted PP1C binding motif KKAVTFFD that contains key Val and Phe at amino acid residue 1355 and 1357. This site was recovered in the two-hybrid clone IB-4. To examine the expression of KPI-2 in different tissues, we probed a Clontech Human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot with a KPI-2 kinase domain (280–1800 nt). KPI-2 mRNA was detected as a single band at size ∼10 kb, which was expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, with low level expression in brain and pancreas (Fig.1 C). The result was confirmed by reprobing the same membrane with a cDNA corresponding to the KPI-2 C-terminal domain (3295–4509 nt, not shown). Because KPI-2 is expressed mostly in skeletal muscle, we checked by RT-PCR the expression of KPI-2 in C2C12 cells, a mouse myoblast cell line. Consistent with the Northern blot, KPI-2 was expressed in C2C12 cells, but its expression level did not change before and after induction of muscle differentiation (not shown). The full-length KPI-2 protein and its N-terminal (1–703 residues) were expressed in HEK293T cells and detected by Western blotting with anti-myc antibody. Recombinant KPI-2 protein was ∼210 kDa, and the N-terminal-(1–703) was an ∼90-kDa protein as expected from their sequences (Fig.2 A). Because of the predicted transmembrane helices in the N terminus, we expected the KPI-2 protein to be membrane-bound. To test this, we expressed KPI-2 N-terminal-(1–703) in COS7 cells, and prepared soluble and membrane fractions from these cells. The myc-tagged KPI-2-(1–703) protein was recovered entirely in the membrane fraction solubilized by 1% Nonidet P-40 and did not appear in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). Phospholemman was used as a plasma membrane protein marker, and protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit was used as cytosolic protein marker. The results show that KPI-2 N-terminal-(1–703) is a membrane protein. Fusion of KPI-2 residues 7–139 to green fluorescent protein (GFP) also resulted in predominant distribution of fusion protein into membrane fraction (not shown). This suggests that the predicted transmembrane helices are sufficient for targeting KPI-2 or fusion proteins to membranes. We expressed the KPI-2 kinase domain (residues 94–600) as a His6-tagged fusion protein in Sf9 cells. Following metal-ion affinity chromatography, one major protein of ∼75 kDa was detected in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig.3 A, left panel), and this protein also reacted with anti-His antibody (Fig.3 A, right panel). The 75-kDa KPI-2 kinase from Sf9 cells was purified by Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography (not shown), and an autophosphorylation assay was performed. The purified recombinant kinase was incubated with [32P]ATP, and autophosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3 B, left panel). We also performed a kinase assay using different substrates. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was phosphorylated efficiently, but Histone H1 and His6-Inh2 were relatively poor substrates under the same conditions (Fig. 3 B, right panel). The tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) was not phosphorylated at all, even with prolonged incubation (data not shown). A lysate from Sf9 cells transfected with wild type baculovirus was processed in parallel, and the corresponding Mono Q eluant was used as negative control for all the kinase assays. These results showed that purified KPI-2 protein is an active kinase. We next determined the residues phosphorylated by KPI-2 kinase. After autoradiography, the bands corresponding to the autophosphorylated KPI-2 kinase and the phosphorylated substrate MBP were excised, and phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out using one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis. The results showed that both KPI-2 autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation were mostly located at serine, with a trace at threonine. No tyrosine phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3 C). Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Thr-Pro and anti-phospho-Ser antibody also showed reactivity with autophosphorylated KPI-2. This evidence shows that KPI-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase. KPI-2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase with a PP1 binding motif in the C-terminal domain that would bring the kinase and phosphatase together. We checked whether KPI-2 could phosphorylate PP1C and alter its activity. Purified PP1C was incubated with or without purified KPI-2 kinase-(94–600). Reactions contained 100 μm ATPγS, which was used instead of ATP to retard dephosphorylation of PP1C during the reaction. Phosphatase assays were performed using [32P]phosphorylase a as substrate. PP1C activity was reduced 70% by reaction with KPI-2 kinase compared with incubation without kinase (Fig.4 A). PP1C is known to be inactivated by phosphorylation at Thr320 (38Dohadwala M. da Cruz Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PP1C was inhibited by incubation with 1 μm microcystin-LR and incubated with ATP plus/minus KPI-2 kinase. Western blotting using anti-phospho-PP1Cα(Thr320) antibody showed that PP1C was phosphorylated at Thr320 by KPI-2 kinase (Fig.4 B). Thiophosphorylated PP1C did not react with the phospho-specific antibody. Thus, KPI-2 phosphorylated Thr320 in PP1C, which reduces phosphatase activity. There is a consensus PP1C binding motif VTF in the C-terminal domain of KPI-2. To check PP1C binding, we prepared GST-KPI-2-(1099–1503) and used HeLa cell lysates as a source of PP1C in a pull-down assay. Wild type (wt) GST-KPI-2-(1099–1503) bound PP1C, but GST alone as a"

Whereas much is known regarding mitochondrial protein import (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 2Koehler C.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), little is known at the molecular level about mitochondrial import of phospholipids (3Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial lipid import is thought to be essential for biogenesis of this organelle in all eukaryotic organisms. In addition to importing lipids, mitochondria also export significant quantities of PtdEtn to other organelles. Elucidation of the mechanisms of lipid import into and export out of mitochondria and the gene products that participate in the process remains a fundamental problem of cell biology and biochemistry. Our approach to understanding mitochondrial lipid traffic has been to focus on aminoglycerophospholipid transport events in the de novo biosynthetic pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fig. 1 depicts the synthesis of aminoglycerophospholipids in S. cerevisiae. PtdSer1 is synthesized from serine and CDP-diacylglycerol by PtdSer synthase 1 (Pss1p) in the ER and MAM (4Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Subsequently, PtdSer is transported to the site of PtdSer decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is converted to phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (5Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E. Kohlwein S. Perktold A. Zellnig G.

J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 901-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This routing of PtdSer appears true for all eukaryotes. In yeast, PtdSer can also be decarboxylated at the locus of PtdSer decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) in the vacuole and Golgi compartments (9Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We have chosen to name the PtdSertransport pathways PSTA and PSTB to designate traffic to the mitochondria and the Golgi/vacuole, respectively. PtdEtn can be exported from the loci of Psd1p and Psd2p, and we have named these pathways PEEA and PEEB (denoting PtdEtnexport), respectively. The exported PtdEtn can be used for membrane synthesis directly, or it can be methylated in the ER by thePtdEtn methyltransferase enzymes, Pem1p and Pem2p, to form phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) (11Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). PtdEtn and PtdCho can also be synthesized via the Kennedy pathways from the precursors ethanolamine or choline (3Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both PtdEtn and PtdCho are thought to be essential for S. cerevisiae growth in medium that contains glucose or nonfermentable carbon sources (5Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Psd1p is the major PtdSer decarboxylase, producing most of the cellular PtdEtn in the absence of an ethanolamine precursor (10Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Whereas PtdEtn made by Psd1p appears to be important for mitochondrial function, it is also important for other cellular functions. For example, a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant defective in intramitochondrial transport of PtdSer has significantly reduced cell surface PtdEtn levels, resulting in a defect in contractile ring disassembly during cytokinesis (15Emoto K. Umeda M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PtdEtn is also the donor of ethanolamine phosphate to glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, whose synthesis is essential for yeast cell viability (17Menon A.K. Stevens V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15277-15280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PtdEtn plays a central role in S. cerevisiaelysosome/vacuole autophagy by covalently conjugating to Apg8p (19Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Hence, the question of how PtdSer is transported from the ER to the inner mitochondrial membrane for PtdEtn production is also an issue of major importance for cellular functions other than mitochondrial biogenesis. Transport of PtdSer from the ER/MAM to mitochondria is thought to occur through close physical association of the membranes of the organelles (6Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E.

The exact mechanism of translocation is unknown, but previous studies suggested transport is mediated by MAM and involves proteins (4Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim.

At present, no protein or gene product has been identified that mediates or regulates ER to mitochondria membrane association and/or transport of PtdSer between these organelles. Hence, the goals of our study were to 1) isolate new aminophospholipid transport mutants in the PSTA pathway, 2) characterize these transport mutants biochemically, and 3) identify the gene that complements transport-defective mutants. In this paper, we describe the isolation of a new ethanolamine auxotrophic yeast strain, in a psd2Δ genetic background, with the characteristics of a pstA mutation. Biochemical analyses demonstrate the presence of a defect in the transport of PtdSer to the mitochondria. The pstA defect is complemented by the MET30 gene encoding an essential protein in yeast that has a key role in the ubiquitination of specific substrates. Media components for yeast and bacterial growth were purchased from Difco, U. S. Biological, Sigma, and Fisher. The radioisotopes, l-[3-3H]serine andl-[1-14C]serine, were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Phosphatidyl[1′-14C]serine was synthesized from l-[1-14C]serine and CDP-diacylglycerol (5Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid standards and CDP-diacylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Thin layer silica gel H plates were obtained from Analtech Corp. Yeast strains were cultured in YPLAUE (containing per liter: 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, 2% dl-lactic acid, 20 mg of adenine, 20 mg of uracil, 3 mm ethanolamine, pH 5.5), or SL (containing per liter: 6.67 g of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2%dl-lactic acid, standard amino acids, pH 5.5) or SC (same as SL except 2% glucose as carbon source). Ethanolamine was added to SL medium to a final concentration of 3 mm. For the isolation of mitochondria, strains were grown in semi-synthetic lactate medium as described by Glick and Pon (25Glick, B. S., and Pon, L. A. (1995) 260,213–223Google Scholar). The absorbance of liquid cultures was measured on a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. The parental strain MSY30 (MATα ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r ) was derived from a homozygous psd2Δ mutant diploid strain, RGYd34800, obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. The pstA1-1mutant strain, EAL18, was isolated as an ethanolamine auxotroph from the ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenized parental strain MSY30 (26Lawrence C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). EAL18 (MATα ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r met30-P522L) was first outcrossed with MSY35 (MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r ) and then outcrossed with MSY34 (MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r ). Progeny from the second outcrossing used in this study include MSY54 (MATαura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r met30-P522L) and MSY57 (MATα ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r dpl1Δ::HIS3 met30-P522L). MSY34 and MSY35 were also derived from the homozygous psd2Δ mutant diploid RGYd34800. The presence ofpsd2Δ::KAN r in MSY30, MSY34, and MSY35 was verified by PCR. Yeast strains were grown in synthetic lactate plus ethanolamine medium to midlog phase. Cultures were then washed twice with sterile water and suspended in SL medium minus serine to an A 600of 0.2 in a volume of 2 ml. Radiolabeling was initiated by adding 10 μCi/ml l-[3-3H]serine (32 Ci/mmol). Labeling proceeded at 30 °C for 4 h with vigorous shaking. Growth and metabolism were arrested by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% (w/v), along with ∼10 mg of unlabeled carrier cells. Cell pellets were washed twice by centrifugation with ice-cold water. Lipids were extracted as previously described (5Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Phospholipid standards were visualized by spraying the TLC plates with 0.1% 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, followed by exposure to UV light. Separated lipid spots were scraped into 0.5 ml of H2O with 4.5 ml of ScintiSafe 30% scintillation fluid. (Fisher). Radioactivity of the samples was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman catalog no. LS6500). Crude mitochondria were prepared as described (25Glick, B. S., and Pon, L. A. (1995) 260,213–223Google Scholar) from 1-liter cultures grown to early log phase in semisynthetic lactate medium supplemented with uracil (20 mg/liter),l-leucine (100 mg/liter), l-histidine (20 mg/liter), l-lysine (30 mg/liter), and ethanolamine (3 mm) at 30 °C. Crude mitochondrial pellets were suspended in buffer B (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mmK+MES, pH 6.0) and assayed immediately for protein (Bio-Rad protein assay). Intactness of the outer membrane was assessed by measuring cytochrome c oxidase activity (27Wojtczak L. Zaluska H. Wroniszewska A. Wojtczak A.B. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1972; 19: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar). Pss1p and Psd1p enzyme activities of the crude mitochondrial preparations were assayed as described previously (5Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Reconstituted aminophospholipid synthesis and transport were measured using [3-3H]serine incorporation into lipids as outlined by Achleitner et al. (6Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E. Kohlwein S. Perktold A. Zellnig G. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, crude mitochondria were diluted in buffer C (0.6 msorbitol, 20 mm K+HEPES, pH 7.4) to a protein concentration of 1 μg/μl. The reaction contained 50 μl of crude mitochondria, 16.7 μl of 6 mm MnCl2/buffer C, and 113.3 μl of buffer C. Samples were equilibrated to 30 °C in a shaking water bath before initiating the reaction by adding 20 μCi (1 μCi/μl) of l-[3-3H]serine (32 Ci/mmol). After 15 min, 4 μl of 0.2 m EDTA in buffer C was added (final concentration ∼4 mm). Reactions were stopped after an additional 75 min by the addition of 1.5 ml of methanol, 1.5 ml of chloroform, and 1.2 ml of 0.2 m KCl. Zero time points were made by adding l-[3-3H]serine and methanol simultaneously to the above mixture. Lipids were extracted by vortexing the samples, followed by centrifugation to separate organic and aqueous phases. The chloroform phase was washed twice, each time with 2.8 ml of practical upper phase solution (500 ml of methanol plus 450 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, saturated with 50 ml of chloroform). The chloroform phase was collected and dried under a nitrogen stream. Samples were suspended in chloroform and separated by TLC on silica Gel H plates. The radiolabeled lipid analog 1-acyl-2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-aminocaproyl-phosphatidyl[1′-14C]serine (NBD-Ptd[1′-14C]Ser) was used to assess transport between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. The analog was synthesized as described previously (28Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12185-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were prepared on Nycodenz gradients (25Glick, B. S., and Pon, L. A. (1995) 260,213–223Google Scholar). The transport reactions contained 0.5–8 μg of mitochondrial protein and 0.02 μCi of NBD-Ptd[1′-14C]Ser (55 μCi/μmol) in a volume of 400 μl. The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min in a sealed tube containing 2 m KOH-impregnated filter paper for trapping 14CO2. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.25 mH2SO4 through the gas-tight seal with a syringe and needle. The 14CO2 released from the reaction that was trapped on the filter paper was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Crude mitochondria were isolated from 4.5 liters of culture as described above. Subsequent isolation of purified mitochondria and MAM was performed as described by Achleitner et al. (6Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E. Kohlwein S. Perktold A. Zellnig G. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude mitochondria suspended in buffer B were layered on a density gradient composed of 20–50% sucrose constructed in 1-ml steps differing in 3.3% sucrose increments in buffer B. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using an SW 41 rotor. Mitochondria were harvested from the lower third of the gradient, diluted 3–4-fold in buffer B, and pelleted for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. MAM was collected from the top of the gradient, diluted 3–4-fold in buffer B, and pelleted for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Resulting mitochondrial and MAM pellets were suspended in buffer B and buffer C, respectively, and thoroughly homogenized with a plastic pestle. Freshly isolated mitochondria and MAM were immediately assayed for protein and l-[3-3H]serine incorporation into aminophospholipids as outlined by Achleitner et al. (6Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorfer E. Kohlwein S. Perktold A. Zellnig G. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Freshly purified mitochondria were also assayed for intactness of the outer membrane by measuring cytochromec oxidase activity. In a 200-μl reaction, MAM and purified mitochondria were reconstituted at final protein concentrations of 0.05 and 0.85 mg/ml, respectively. Radiolabeling was conducted in the presence of 0.2 mm CDP-diacylglycerol. Subsequent lipid analysis was performed as described above. For measuring mitochondrial phospholipids, cells were first grown to log phase in synthetic lactate medium plus ethanolamine at 30 °C. The cells were next washed twice with sterile water, suspended in synthetic lactate medium without ethanolamine, and incubated with shaking at 30 °C, for 14–18 h before harvesting for mitochondrial isolation. Crude mitochondria were prepared by the method of Glick and Pon (25Glick, B. S., and Pon, L. A. (1995) 260,213–223Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from ∼2 mg of crude mitochondrial protein, in 4 ml of methanol, 4 ml of chloroform, 3.2 ml of 0.2 m KCl. The chloroform phase was washed twice with 7.6 ml of practical upper phase without phosphate solution (500 ml of methanol plus 450 ml of 0.2m KCl, saturated with 75 ml of chloroform). The organic phase was collected and dried under a nitrogen stream. Phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional TLC on Silica 60 plates. The first solvent system contained chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (13/5/2 by volume), and the second solvent system contained chloroform/methanol/formic acid (13/5/2 by volume). Lipids were visualized by staining with iodine vapor and scraped into glass tubes. Phosphorus was quantified using the method of Rouser et al.(29Rouser G. Siakatos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were prepared from parental and pstA1-1 strains grown in semisynthetic lactate medium supplemented with 3 mm Etn using the methods of Glick and Pon (25Glick, B. S., and Pon, L. A. (1995) 260,213–223Google Scholar). Protein import was measured using the methods of Rospert and Schatz (30Rospert S. Schatz G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 277-285Google Scholar). The Psd1p was expressed with a carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope, from a pYES plasmid (Invitrogen), under T7 promoter regulation. The Su9-DHFR was expressed from a plasmid under SP6 promoter regulation. Both proteins were synthesized in vitro using the appropriate TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled protein mixtures were incubated with isolated mitochondria in either the absence or presence of valinomycin (1 μg/ml) in an import buffer containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 50 mmHEPES-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 0.75 mg/ml methionine, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mmKH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.0. The reactions also contained 2 mm ATP and 10 mm NADH and were conducted for 3 or 10 min at 30 °C. The nonimported proteins were removed from the reactions by treatment with 100 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 0 °C. The action of trypsin was arrested with 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Following the trypsin treatment, the mitochondria were harvested by centrifugation, precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid, heat-inactivated, and finally resuspended for loading onto electrophoretic gels. The samples were electrophoresed using 10% Tricine polyacrylamide gels (Novex). The gels were processed through 5% boiling trichloroacetic acid, neutralized, and impregnated with 1 m salicylate before drying. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Quantification of protein import was performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software from Amersham Biosciences. The MET4 gene modified to contain multiple C-terminal myc epitope tags was expressed from the chromosome under control of its endogenous promoter (31Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I.

Kaiser (University of California, Irvine). In addition, we constructed the strains JCY474 (MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r trp1::HIS3 MET4-(18myc)::TRP1) and JCY475 (MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ0 psd2Δ::KAN r trp1::HIS3 met30-P522L MET4-(18myc)::TRP1) from MSY30 and EAL18, respectively. The yeast strains examined were grown in either SC or SL medium containing 5 mm methionine and supplemented with Etn as indicated. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and 5% boiling trichloroacetic acid was added to the pellet followed by vortex mixing for 5 s. The acid-treated cells were chilled on ice and sedimented by centrifugation. The resultant pellets were washed twice by resuspension in distilled water and centrifugation. The final pellets were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C prior to further processing. For processing, the cell pellets were suspended in an extraction buffer consisting of 8 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and an aliquot of Sigma anti-protease mixture (5 μl/100 mg, wet cell weight). Glass beads were added to the samples, and the mixture was homogenized in a bead beater for 70 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g × 15 min at 20 °C. The samples were next diluted to 4 m urea before separation on 8% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels. The mycepitope-tagged Met4p was detected using the mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (COVANCE) and a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad). Antibody reactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluninescence. Isoforms of Met4p were quantified using image scanning and NIH Image 1.62 software. Yeast strains that have apsd2Δ::KAN r allele depend on Psd1p for the majority of PtdEtn and PtdCho synthesis in the absence of exogenous ethanolamine or choline (see Fig. 1). We reasoned that mutants with defects in PtdSer import into and PtdEtn export from the locus of Psd1p in the inner mitochondrial membrane would require ethanolamine for growth in apsd2Δ::KAN r genetic background. To generate mitochondrial phospholipid transport mutants, we mutagenized apsd2Δ::KAN r strain, MSY30, and selected for ethanolamine auxotrophs on medium containing lactate as a carbon source. Lactate medium was used to avoid selection of respiration-deficient petites. Screening of the first 10,000 colonies yielded eight ethanolamine auxotrophs, of which two werepsd1 mutants and one was an apparent pss1 mutant, as determined by genetic complementation and biochemical enzyme assay. One of the remaining strains, EAL18, displayed a definitive requirement for ethanolamine for growth in liquid SL medium at 30 °C, as shown in Fig. 2. In the absence of Etn, the EAL18 strain undergoes two doublings and then arrests. In the presence of ethanolamine, the mutant, EAL18, grows similarly to the parental strain, MSY30, although somewhat slower. The growth of the parental strain is essentially the same in the presence and absence of Etn. At 36 °C, EAL18 shows very little or no growth in synthetic lactate medium, regardless of ethanolamine supplementation. In addition, EAL18 is not an ethanolamine auxotroph in synthetic glucose medium at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 3, choline supplementation does not rescue the growth defect of EAL18 in synthetic lactate medium at 30 °C, indicating a stringent requirement for Etn under these conditions. Tetrad analysis yielded a 2:2 segregation of ethanolamine auxotrophy consistent with a mutation at a single locus. Diploids that are heterozygous for the mutation are not ethanolamine auxotrophs, indicating the mutation is recessive. The above properties of the mutant are similar but not identical topsd1Δpsd2Δ strains and are consistent with defects in PtdEtn synthesis.Figure 3Choline (Cho) does not support the growth of the mutant EAL 18 strain. Mutant EAL 18 and parental MSY30 strains were grown to early log phase in SL medium containing 3 mm Etn. The cells were harvested, washed, and reinnoculated in SL medium either with (▪, ●) or without (■, ○) 3 mm choline, at an A 600 of 0.02. Growth at 30 °C was monitored by A 600.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the ethanolamine auxotrophic mutant had a defect in the formation of aminoglycerophospholipids, cells were labeled with [3H]serine in SL medium. Incorporation of the radiolabel into aminophospholipids was analyzed by thin layer chromatography of the lipid extract. Both the turnover of radiolabeled PtdSer and the appearance of radiolabel in PtdEtn serve as a measure of PtdSer transport to and import into the mitochondria. Fig. 4 shows that the mutant strain, EAL18, has a 53% decreased accumulation of radiolabel in PtdEtn and 16% increased labeling in PtdSer relative to the parental strain, MSY30. Radiolabeling of the PtdCho pool also occurs in both the mutant and the parental cells. Since the cells are pregrown in Etn-containing medium, significant pools of PtdEtn and phosphoethanolamine accumulate. The resultant PtdEtn serves as a substrate for the methyltransferase enzymes (Pemlp and Pem2p) in the synthesis of PtdCho. The [3H]serine used to label the PtdSer and PtdEtn pools can also radiolabel the one-carbon pool that is used for the synthesis of PtdCho. As a result of this one-carbon metabolism, the labeling of the PtdCho pool often appears unusually high (10Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text"
https://openalex.org/W2069910272,"Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) is one of the mechanisms by which phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation protects neurons from apoptosis. Here, we report that inhibition of ERK1/2 increased the basal activity of GSK3β in cortical neurons and that both ERK1/2 and PI3K were required for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) suppression of GSK3β activity. Moreover, cortical neuron apoptosis induced by expression of recombinant GSK3β was inhibited by coexpression of constitutively active MKK1 or PI3K. Activation of both endogenous ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways was required for BDNF to block apoptosis induced by expression of recombinant GSK3β. Furthermore, cortical neuron apoptosis induced by LY294002-mediated activation of endogenous GSK3β was blocked by expression of constitutively active MKK1 or by BDNF via stimulation of the endogenous ERK1/2 pathway. Although both PI3K and ERK1/2 inhibited GSK3β activity, neither had an effect on GSK3β phosphorylation at Tyr-216. Interestingly, PI3K (but not ERK1/2) induced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9. Significantly, coexpression of constitutively active MKK1 (but not PI3K) still suppressed neuronal apoptosis induced by expression of the GSK3β(S9A) mutant. These data suggest that activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway protects neurons from GSK3β-induced apoptosis and that inhibition of GSK3β may be a common target by which ERK1/2 and PI3K protect neurons from apoptosis.

It has become increasingly evident that there is a complex balance between survival and apoptotic signaling pathways in neurons that determines whether they survive or die.

This suggests that GSK3β-induced apoptosis may be inhibited by these signaling pathways via GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9. Indeed, cAMP protects cerebellar granule cells from trophic withdrawal-induced apoptosis via protein kinase A-dependent Ser-9 phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3β (13Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K.

In this report, we present data supporting the hypothesis that ERK1/2 protects neurons from GSK3β-induced apoptosis and that inhibition of GSK3β may be a common mechanism by which ERK1/2 and PI3K protect neurons from apoptosis.

The rabbit anti-phospho-Ser-9 GSK3β and anti-phospho-Tyr-279 GSK3α/phospho-Tyr-216 GSK3β polyclonal antibodies were from BIOSOURCE, International (Camarillo, CA). PD98059 and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. BDNF was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). SL327 was a gift from DuPont. Cortical neurons were prepared from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats and transiently transfected at day 3 or 4 in vitro (DIV3/4) after seeding using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation protocol (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In Fig. 7, cortical neurons were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were seeded at 500,000/well in 24-well plates. At DIV3–4, the conditioned medium were removed and saved. Cells were placed in serum-free basal Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 0.8 μg of DNA mixed with 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000/well. After a 2-h incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, the transfection medium were replaced with conditioned medium. Cells were fixed and immunostained 2 days after transfection. PD98059, LY294002, and SL327 were dissolved in Me2SO, and Me2SO was used as a vehicle control for these drugs. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%. When cultures were cotreated with PD98059 and LY294002 or with SL327 and LY294002, the final concentration of Me2SO was 0.4%. BDNF was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin before addition to the cells. When cells were stimulated with BDNF in serum-free and MK801 (dizocilpine maleate)-containing medium (see Fig. 2), they were washed twice with serum-free basal Eagle's medium and incubated in serum-free basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 35 mm glucose, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μm cytosine arabinoside, and theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 (10 μm). To visualize nuclear morphology, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the DNA dye Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide, Sigma) at 2.5 μg/ml (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was quantitated by scoring the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology at the single cell level after Hoechst staining. Uniformly stained nuclei were scored as healthy, viable neurons. Condensed or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. To obtain unbiased counting, slides were coded, and cells were scored blind without knowledge of their prior treatment. GSK3β activity was quantitated using an immune complex kinase assay (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-phospho-GSK3β antibodies and immunostaining for β-galactosidase were performed as described (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 28Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J.

Transfected cells were detected by immunostaining with an antibody against β-galactosidase and Texas Red-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit IgG. Cells transfected with the hemagglutinin epitope-tagged constructs (MKK1 and PI3K) were also immunostained with an antibody to hemagglutinin followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG. Site-directed mutagenesis to replace Ser-9 of rat GSK3β with alanine was performed using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mutagenesis primers were 5′-ccgagaaccacggcctttgcggagagctgc-3′ (sense) and 5′-gcagctctccgcaaaggccgtggttctcgg-3′ (antisense). The primers were purchased from Sigma. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post hoc tests. To test the hypothesis that ERK1/2 antagonizes GSK3β-induced apoptosis in cortical neurons, we first determined whether GSK3β activity is negatively regulated by ERK1/2 in these cells. We previously showed that LY294002 treatment, which inhibits PI3K activity, activates GSK3β (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used LY294002 treatment as a positive control for the assessment of GSK3β activity. To inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway, we applied PD98059, an inhibitor of MKK1 and MKK2 (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), which are upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2. The effect of these inhibitors on ERK1/2 or PI3K activity was indirectly measured by Western analysis using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated and activated ERK1/2 or Akt, respectively. The effect of these inhibitors on GSK3β activity was directly measured by an immune complex kinase assay. Cortical neurons maintained in the presence of 10% serum under normal culture conditions had high basal ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt activities (Fig.1 A). LY294002 inhibited the basal phosphorylation of Akt, but not ERK1/2 (Fig. 1 A), and activated GSK3β (Fig. 1 B), consistent with previous observations (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PD98059 specifically inhibited basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation without affecting Akt phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). It also caused a 40% increase in GSK3β activity (Fig. 1 B). The combination of LY294002 and PD98059 was more effective than either drug alone and caused a 63% increase in GSK3β activity (Fig. 1 B). This supports the notion that ERK1/2, like PI3K, negatively regulates GSK3β activity in central nervous system neurons. Activation of GSK3β induced by trophic deprivation was counteracted by BDNF treatment (Fig. 2) (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because BDNF activates both ERK1/2 and PI3K in cortical neurons, we tested whether BDNF-driven ERK1/2 activation contributes to BDNF inhibition of GSK3β. Cortical neurons were incubated with BDNF under trophic deprivation in the presence of various inhibitors (Fig. 2). Trophic deprivation was achieved by serum withdrawal in the presence of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LY294002 completely blocked BDNF stimulation of Akt phosphorylation. PD98059 significantly inhibited BDNF stimulation of ERK1/2 without affecting Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). However, PD98059 and LY294002 together caused a greater inhibition of ERK1/2 than PD98059 alone. This is consistent with the observation that some isoforms of neuronal PI3K activate the ERK1/2 pathway (31LopezIlasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The effects of these inhibitors on BDNF suppression of GSK3β activity were also examined (Fig. 2 B). Although PD98059 or LY294002 caused some increase in GSK3β activity, the combination of the two caused a significant increase in GSK3β activity compared with either drug alone. This suggests that ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling contributes to BDNF suppression of GSK3β. Expression of wild-type GSK3β is sufficient to induce apoptosis in cortical neurons (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional significance of ERK1/2 inhibition of GSK3β, we determined whether apoptosis induced by expression of wild-type GSK3β is blocked by coexpression of constitutively active MKK1 (MKK1CA), which selectively activates ERK1/2 (Fig.3 A). Cortical neurons were cotransfected with a wild-type expression vector for GSK3β and MKK1CA. The empty cloning vectors and kinase-dead dominant-negative MKK1 (MKK1KIN) were used as controls. Basal cell death in cells transfected with vectors only was 16%. Expression of GSK3β increased apoptosis to 34%. Coexpression of constitutively active MKK1 (but not dominant-negative MKK1) reduced GSK3β-induced apoptosis to 23% (p < 0.01). Similarly, GSK3β-induced apoptosis was partially suppressed when the PI3K pathway was selectively activated by transient expression of an active form of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110*), but not a kinase-dead mutant of p110 (p110*KIN) (Fig.3 B). To determine whether stimulation of endogenous ERK1/2 is sufficient to suppress cortical neuron apoptosis due to expression of recombinant GSK3β, cortical neurons were treated with BDNF to activate endogenous ERK1/2 and PI3K (Fig. 4). BDNF completely inhibited GSK3β-induced cortical neuron apoptosis. Neuroprotection afforded by BDNF was inhibited by cotreatment with LY294002, PD98059 (Fig. 4 A), or SL327 (Fig. 4 B). SL327 is a water-soluble structural homolog of the specific MKK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (32Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat.

The data in Fig. 4 suggest that activation of both endogenous ERK1/2 and PI3K contributes to BDNF neuroprotection against expression of recombinant GSK3β. Because both ERK1/2 and PI3K can negatively regulate GSK3β activity and inhibit GSK3β-induced apoptosis, it was important to determine whether these pathways are redundant neuroprotective pathways. We transfected cortical neurons with a wild-type expression vector for GSK3β to induce apoptosis and treated these cultures with BDNF to activate both endogenous ERK1/2 and PI3K (Fig. 5). A combination of LY294002 and PD98059 or SL327 was used to block both ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling. As reported in Figs. 3 and 4, expression of wild-type GSK3β by itself was sufficient to increase basal cortical neuron apoptosis from 20 to 40–50% under normal culture conditions (Fig. 5). Cotreatment with LY294002 and PD98059 or SL327 greatly exacerbated GSK3β expression-induced apoptosis, which was now seen in 80% of the GSK3β-expressing cells (Fig. 5). This suggests that under normal culture conditions, apoptosis induced by expression of wild-type GSK3β is attenuated by the endogenous basal ERK1/2 and PI3K activities. As shown earlier, addition of BDNF completely suppressed apoptosis induced by expression of GSK3β. Neuroprotection provided by BDNF was totally reversed by cotreatment with PD98059 and LY294002 (Fig. 5 A) or with SL327 and LY294002 (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that coactivation of ERK1/2 and PI3K provides combinatorial neuroprotection against GSK3β. We previously reported that addition of LY294002 to cortical neuron cultures maintained in the presence of serum inhibits the endogenous PI3K/Akt pathway, activates endogenous GSK3β, and induces apoptosis in cortical neurons (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical neuron apoptosis induced by LY294002 was significantly blocked by expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of rat GSK3β or inhibitory GBP (p < 0.001) (Fig.6 A). This confirms that endogenous GSK3β plays a significant role in apoptosis induced by LY294002. To determine whether apoptosis induced by activation of endogenous GSK3β is blocked by ERK1/2, cortical neurons were treated with LY294002 in the presence of SL327, BDNF, or SL327 plus BDNF (Fig.6 B). LY294002-induced apoptosis was prevented by cotreatment with BDNF (p < 0.001). Because LY294002 directly inhibited PI3K, and BDNF did not activate PI3K in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 2 A), BDNF protection against LY294002 is very likely mediated by ERK1/2 signaling. Moreover, BDNF protection against LY294002 was reversed by cotreatment with SL327 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 B), further supporting a role for endogenous ERK1/2 in neuroprotection against activation of GSK3β. Cortical neurons were also transfected with MKK1CA or its vector control and treated with LY294002. Expression of MKK1CA was sufficient to inhibit cortical neuron apoptosis induced by LY294002 treatment (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6 C). Together, these data suggest that apoptosis induced by activation of endogenous GSK3β is blocked by ERK1/2 signaling. GSK3β activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-9. To elucidate mechanisms by which PI3K and ERK1/2 inhibit GSK3β activity and GSK3β-induced apoptosis in cortical neurons, we carried out experiments to determine whether these signaling pathways regulate GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9. This was accomplished by Western analysis using a phosphopeptide-specific antibody that recognizes GSK3β phosphorylated at Ser-9 (Figs. 1 and 2). Under normal culture conditions (i.e. in the presence of serum), LY294002 treatment inhibited Ser-9 phosphorylation by 70% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast, PD98059 treatment caused a slight reduction in Ser-9 phosphorylation that was statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, cotreatment with PD98059 and LY294002 did not inhibit Ser-9 phosphorylation more than LY294002 treatment alone. Because both PD98059 and LY294002 treatment caused an increase in GSK3β activity under the same conditions (Fig. 1 B), these data suggest that serum-activated PI3K (but not ERK1/2) inhibits GSK3β activity in primary cortical neurons via Ser-9 phosphorylation. Trophic deprivation stimulated GSK3β activity, which was reversed by BDNF (Fig. 2 B) (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, basal GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9 was suppressed upon trophic deprivation and restored upon BDNF addition (Fig. 2 D). Treatment with LY294002 (but not SL327 or PD98059) inhibited BDNF-induced GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9 by 85% (Fig. 2, E andF). This suggests that BDNF-activated PI3K (but not ERK1/2) induces GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9 in primary cortical neurons. A GSK3β mutant was then generated in which Ser-9 was replaced with a non-phosphorylatable Ala residue (GSK3β(S9A)). Like wild-type GSK3β, expression of GSK3β(S9A) was sufficient to induce apoptosis in cortical neurons (Fig. 7). Significantly, GSK3β(S9A)-induced apoptosis was suppressed by coexpression of constitutively active MKK1, but not PI3K. Together, the data from Figs. 1, 2, and 7 indicate that inhibition of GSK3β by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in neurons is not mediated by inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser-9. Another possible mechanism for ERK1/2 inhibition of GSK3β in neurons is through inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation at Tyr-216, a phosphorylation that may activate GSK3β (14Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, there was no significant change in Tyr-216 phosphorylation following BDNF treatment, inhibition of ERK1/2, or inhibition of PI3K in cortical neurons (Figs.1 D and 2 E). Thus, inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation at Tyr-216 is an unlikely mechanism for ERK1/2 inhibition of GSK3β in neurons. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that neuronal apoptosis induced by activation of GSK3β may be suppressed by stimulation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. We report that ERK1/2 negatively regulated GSK3β activity in cortical neurons and that this regulation did not involve the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9. In addition, this regulation probably does not require the activating phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr-216. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active MKK1, which directly activated ERK1/2, suppressed cortical neuron apoptosis induced by expression of recombinant wild-type GSK3β or the GSK3β(S9A) mutant. MKK1 also suppressed cortical neuron apoptosis induced by activation of endogenous GSK3β caused by LY294002 inhibition of PI3K. Moreover, ERK1/2 contributed to BDNF neuroprotection against LY294002 or GSK3β expression. Maximal BDNF neuroprotection against GSK3β expression-induced apoptosis was dependent upon activation of both ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways. Our data provide the first example of a functional consequence of ERK1/2 inhibition of GSK3β. Mechanisms for ERK1/2 inhibition of GSK3β in neurons are still unclear. Both Akt and protein kinase A have been shown to directly phosphorylate GSK3β at Ser-9 (13Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 15Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), an inhibitory phosphorylation site. Studies in non-neuronal cells suggest ERK1/2 activation of p90rsk, which also phosphorylates GSK3β at Ser-9 (21Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 22Eldar-Finkelman H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that this mechanism is not operative in primary neurons. This conclusion is based on the observation that the level of GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9 was not significantly affected by inhibitors of the ERK1/2 pathway. This is in contrast to the profound effect of PI3K inhibitors on phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9. In addition, MKK1 (but not PI3K) could still suppress GSK3β(S9A)-induced apoptosis. Our data do not support the hypothesis that ERK1/2 inhibition of GSK3β in neurons is mediated by inhibition of the activating GSK3β phosphorylation at Tyr-216. Alternatively, ERK1/2 may increase the expression or improve the function of the GSK3β inhibitory protein GBP. Regardless, it seems that in cortical neurons, ERK1/2 inhibits GSK3β activity by an unknown and novel mechanism, which most likely does not involve Ser-9 and Tyr-216 phosphorylation. We conclude that ERK1/2 may inhibit GSK3β by a mechanism that is distinct from that utilized by PI3K and protein kinase A. The existence of different regulatory mechanisms for ERK1/2 and PI3K inhibition of GSK3β may explain why cotreatment of neurons with inhibitors of both signaling pathways activates GSK3β more effectively than a single inhibitor alone. GSK3β was first discovered as a pro-apoptotic signaling molecule in PC12 cells (11Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) and subsequently in primary cortical neurons (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in sympathetic neurons (12Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34266-34271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). GSK3β-induced apoptosis is suppressed by activation of the PI3K/Akt and cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathways (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that GSK3β-induced apoptosis is also repressed by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Therefore, inhibition of GSK3β may be a point of convergence for several survival pathways. In this context, it is also interesting that activation of the PI3K, cAMP, and ERK1/2 signal transduction pathways results in BAD phosphorylation and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic activity of BAD (3Bonni A.

This suggests that seemingly divergent anti-apoptotic signaling pathways may converge on a small group of target molecules (including GSK3β and BAD) that are key regulators of neuronal apoptosis. Since the initial discovery that stimulation of ERK1/2 protects differentiated PC12 cells from apoptosis after nerve growth factor withdrawal (29Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), additional evidence has accumulated demonstrating the anti-apoptotic function of ERK1/2 in various non-neuronal cells (47Gardner A.M.

For example, ERK1/2 activation protects central nervous system neurons against DNA (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and oxidative (1Skaper S.D. Floreani M. Negro A. Facci L. Giusti P. J.

Here, we have discovered that ERK1/2 antagonizes cortical neuron apoptosis induced by GSK3β, adding another function to its anti-apoptotic repertoire. Furthermore, although trophic promoted neuronal survival is largely mediated by PI3K (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), the data presented here indicate that when PI3K activity is inhibited by LY294002, BDNF stimulation of ERK1/2 is sufficient to compensate for the loss of PI3K activity and to promote cortical neuron survival. Similar to drug inhibition of PI3K, serum deprivation alone or in combination with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 also activates GSK3β and induces apoptosis in cortical neurons (5Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ERK1/2 activation protects cortical neurons against LY294002, but not against serum deprivation (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) or against serum deprivation plus MK801. 2M. Hetman and Z. Xia, unpublished data. In addition, ERK1/2 activation does not play a major role in BDNF protection against serum deprivation (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). It seems likely that other pathways, in addition to PI3K and ERK1/2, may also contribute to the neuronal survival provided by serum or BDNF. These may include protein kinase C (54Behrens M.M. Strasser U. Koh J.Y. Gwag B.J. Choi D.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), ERK5 (55Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,56Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and isoforms of p38 MAPKs (57Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although ERK1/2 alone does not promote survival against serum deprivation, which presumably down-regulates all these pathways, it is sufficient to antagonize LY294002-induced apoptosis, which specifically targets PI3K inhibition. Mechanisms downstream of ERK1/2 activation that lead to neuronal survival are not clearly defined. Activation of p90rsk and the subsequent phosphorylation of CREB as well as increased CREB-mediated gene expression are potential mechanisms (3Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 58Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ERK1/2 may activate p90rsk, which phosphorylates and inactivates BAD (3Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Our discovery that activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway protects against GSK3β-induced apoptosis suggests another novel downstream target for the ERK1/2 survival pathway. Why are there multiple downstream effectors mediating the anti-apoptotic activity of ERK1/2? Activation of CREB-mediated transcription and inhibition of BAD or GSK3β may function as parallel downstream targets of the anti-apoptotic ERK1/2 pathway. Alternatively, ERK1/2 neuroprotection may employ different downstream targets depending on the nature of the apoptotic insult. For example, camptothecin, a DNA-damaging agent, induces cortical neuron apoptosis, which is blocked by ERK1/2 (2Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, expression of either GBP or dominant-negative GSK3β did not protect cortical neurons against camptothecin,2 excluding GSK3β inhibition as a mechanism for ERK1/2 neuroprotection against camptothecin. Finally, there may be cross-talk between the various downstream targets of ERK1/2. For instance, inhibition of GSK3β may contribute to ERK1/2 activation of CREB (59Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In summary, our data suggest that ERK1/2 negatively regulates GSK3β activity in neurons via a novel mechanism that is independent of phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 and likely does not involve phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr-216. Furthermore, activation of ERK1/2 suppresses GSK3β-induced neuronal apoptosis. Our data suggest a new mechanism for the anti-apoptotic action of the ERK1/2 pathway in neurons and implicate GSK3β inhibition as a convergence point for several pro-survival signal transduction systems in neurons.

https://openalex.org/W1996525958,"Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) is a membrane metalloprotease that generates endothelin from its direct precursor big endothelin. Four isoforms of ECE-1 are produced from a single gene through the use of alternate promoters. These isoforms share the same extracellular catalytic domain and contain unique cytosolic tails, which results in their specific subcellular targeting. We investigated the distribution of ECE-1 isoforms in transfected AtT-20 neuroendocrine cells. Whereas ECE-1a and 1c were present at the plasma membrane, ECE-1b and ECE-1d were retained inside the cells. We found that both intracellular isoforms were concentrated in the endosomal system: ECE-1d in recycling endosomes, and ECE-1b in late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. Leucine-based motifs were involved in the intracellular retention of these isoforms, and the targeting of ECE-1b to the degradation pathway required an additional signal in the N terminus. The concentration of ECE-1 isoforms in the endosomal system suggested new functions for these enzymes. Potential novel functions include redistribution of other isoforms through direct interaction. We have showed that ECE-1 isoforms could heterodimerize, and that in such heterodimers the ECE-1b targeting signal was dominant. Interaction of a plasma membrane isoform with ECE-1b resulted in its intracellular localization and decreased its extracellular activity. These data demonstrated that the targeting signals specific for ECE-1b constitute a regulatory domain per se that could modulate the localization and the activity of other isoforms.

Whereas ECE-1a and 1c were present at the plasma membrane, ECE-1b and ECE-1d were retained inside the cells. We found that both intracellular isoforms were concentrated in the endosomal system: ECE-1d in recycling endosomes, and ECE-1b in late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. Leucine-based motifs were involved in the intracellular retention of these isoforms, and the targeting of ECE-1b to the degradation pathway required an additional signal in the N terminus. The concentration of ECE-1 isoforms in the endosomal system suggested new functions for these enzymes. Potential novel functions include redistribution of other isoforms through direct interaction. We have showed that ECE-1 isoforms could heterodimerize, and that in such heterodimers the ECE-1b targeting signal was dominant. Interaction of a plasma membrane isoform with ECE-1b resulted in its intracellular localization and decreased its extracellular activity. These data demonstrated that the targeting signals specific for ECE-1b constitute a regulatory domain per se that could modulate the localization and the activity of other isoforms. endothelin adrenocorticotropic hormone big endothelin endothelin-converting enzyme neutral endopeptidase trans-Golgi network phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Endothelins (ET1-1, ET-2, and ET-3) are 21-residue peptides derived from three distinct genes (1Inoue A.

Endothelins are also crucial developmental factors as demonstrated by the targeted disruption of the genes coding for the precursors of ET-1 and ET-3, and of the genes coding for their receptors, ETA and ETB (4Kurihara Y.

In order to fulfill such a wide spectrum of physiological functions, endothelins act through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Their biosynthesis thus requires tight local control. Endothelins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as precursors that undergo a two-step proteolytic maturation. Pro-endothelins are first processed at conserved multibasic sites by furin or a furin-like enzyme, in order to release an intermediate called big endothelin (big-ET) (11Denault J.B. Claing A.

Commun. 1990; 171: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Big-ET is then processed by endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) at a Trp-Val/Ile bond, which releases the biologically active peptide. This latter proteolytic step can occur in the extracellular medium and in the secretory pathway, so that cells secrete either big-ETs alone or together with endothelins (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A.

Endothelial cells co-express the precursor, the converting enzyme and the receptor, thus implying autocrine function of endothelin. On the other hand, luteal cells (17Levy N. Gordin M. Mamluk R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), demonstrating the paracrine function of endothelin through extracellular processing of big-ET. The cellular distribution of ECE thus plays a central role in controlling the biosynthetic pathway of endothelins.ECE is a type II membrane protein of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) family, with an N-terminal cytosolic tail and a catalytic ectodomain. Unlike other proteases of this family, ECE is expressed as covalent dimers (20Schmidt M. Kroger B. Jacob E. Seulberger H. Subkowski T. Otter R. Meyer T. Schmalzing G. Hillen H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi M. Fukuda K. Shimada K. Barnes K. Turner A.J. Ikeda M. Koike H. Yamamoto Y. Tanzawa K. Biochem.

Two genes coding for ECE-1 and ECE-2 have been cloned (20Schmidt M. Kroger B. Jacob E. Seulberger H. Subkowski T. Otter R. Meyer T. Schmalzing G. Hillen H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). ECE-1 has a broader tissue distribution and is always expressed at higher levels than ECE-2. The targeted disruption of the ECE-1 gene resulted in a lethal phenotype that combined both the phenotypes of the inactivation of ET-1 or ETA and of ET-3 or ETB, thus demonstrating the central role of ECE-1 in the endothelin system (25Yanagisawa H. Yanagisawa M. Kapur R.P. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Clouthier D.E. de Wit D. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Development. 1998; 125: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the inactivation of the ECE-2 gene did not result in significant modification of the mouse phenotype unless it was combined with the ECE-1 gene inactivation (26Yanagisawa H.

ECE-1 is expressed in the endothelium of all organs as well as in nonvascular cells of many tissues including brain and neuroendocrine tissues (Refs. 14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C.

Four isoforms of ECE-1 have been identified (Refs. 29Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and 30Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.B.

Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ECE-1 isoforms result from the use of alternate promoters located upstream of specific exons (29Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 30Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.B.

Med. 1997; 75: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the 4 ECE-1 isoforms share the same catalytic domain and only differ in their N terminus, which codes for their cytosolic tails (Fig. 1 A). As these domains are responsible for their targeting, the specificity of ECE isoforms resides in their subcellular distribution. Considering the importance of the intracellular and extracellular biosynthesis of endothelins, the subcellular distribution of ECE isoforms may play a central role in the regulation of the endothelin system and constitutes an important factor for the efficient inhibition of ECE in pathological conditions.Extensive work aimed to define the intracellular localization of ECE-1 has been done in endothelial cells (21Takahashi M. Fukuda K. Shimada K. Barnes K. Turner A.J. Ikeda M. Koike H. Yamamoto Y. Tanzawa K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Barnes K. Shimada K. Takahashi M.

Most of these studies were however non relevant to isoform specificity due to the lack of antibodies that can distinguish between ECE-1b, 1c, and 1d. More recent work was based on the expression of ECE-1 isoforms in transfected fibroblasts or epithelial cells. In these models, ECE-1a and ECE-1c were targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas ECE-1b was localized to intracellular organelles, and ECE-1d displayed an intermediate distribution (30Valdenaire O.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neuroendocrine cells constitute another major cell type expressing ECE-1 in vivo (28Barnes K. Turner A.J. Neurochem Res. 1997; 22: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Korth P. Bohle R.M. Corvol P. Pinet F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In these cells, precursors and peptides, as well as processing enzymes, are sorted between the constitutive and the regulated secretory pathways. We used the neuroendocrine AtT-20 cells as a model. These are corticotrope pituitary cells that are specialized in the synthesis and regulated secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In these cells, we investigated the subcellular distribution and the heterodimerization of ECE-1 isoforms, as the function of intracellular ECE-1 is a matter of debate, and the role of dimerization is still unknown.DISCUSSIONECE-1 belongs to the family of NEP metalloproteases. Among these enzymes, ECE-1 has two unique characteristics: first, it is present and active both at the cell surface and in intracellular organelles; second, it exists as covalent dimers. In the present paper, we have investigated these two aspects of ECE-1 cell biology. Our experiments provided the first extensive analysis of the intracellular distribution of the 4 ECE-1 isoforms in the secretory pathway and in the endosomal system. The two isoforms localized in intracellular compartments, ECE-1b and 1d, displayed distinct but complementary patterns of distribution in the endosomal system: ECE-1d was present in the recycling endosomes and ECE-1b in the late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. Using biochemical methods, we could show that ECE-1 isoforms exist as heterodimers. The discovery of such heterodimers suggested a novel role for the isoform-specific targeting of ECE-1. We showed that the targeting signal responsible for the intracellular distribution of ECE-1b could redirect the plasma membrane ECE-1a to the endosomal system. These data demonstrated that the specific N terminus of ECE-1b constitutes a regulatory domain that is able to modify the distribution of other ECE-1 isoforms. Such a regulatory mechanism could be physiologically relevant as many cell types, including endothelial cells, co-express endogenously several ECE-1 isoforms (37Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 30Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.B. Eur J Biochem. 1999; 264: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Our study was undertaken in the AtT-20 cell line due to the important function of endothelins in regulating the activity of neuroendocrine cells through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (Ref. 49Kanyicska B. Lerant A. Freeman M.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5164-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; for review see Ref. 3Masaki T. Endocr. Rev.;. 1993; 14: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Endothelins have been detected in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells (50Suzuki H. Yamamoto T. Kikuyama S. Uemura H. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1997; 107: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that ECE-1 was targeted to the secretory granules, like common neuroendocrine endopeptidases. Our results rejected the possibility that big-ET was processed in secretory granules, as none of the intracellular isoforms were detected in the secretory granules. Our data thus suggested that the mature endothelin detected in the secretory granules might result from processing in the TGN. Processing of pro-endothelin by furin in this compartment is the first step that is required for ECE-1 to release endothelin from its precursor (51Kido T. Sawamura T. Hoshikawa H. D'Orleans-Juste P. Denault J.B. Leduc R. Kimura J. Masaki T. Eur J Biochem. 1997; 244: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Even though we did not find that ECE-1 was concentrated in the TGN, like furin is (45Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Van Slyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), ECE-1 is transported through this compartment during biosynthesis. The intracellular processing of big-ET in the TGN would thus not be a specialized function for any ECE-1 isoform. Indeed, we have already shown that ECE-1a, a plasma membrane isoform, could generate endothelin in the secretory pathway as well as in the extracellular medium (16Parnot C., Le Moullec J.M. Cousin M.A. Guedin D. Corvol P. Pinet F. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas ECE-1b and ECE-1d could generate endothelin in the secretory pathway, these isoforms should not be considered more specific than ECE-1a or 1c for this processing. In support of this, big-ET is the main species secreted from cells that co-express pre-pro-endothelin and an intracellular isoform of ECE-1, thus indicating the low efficiency of intracellular processing of big-ET by ECE-1 (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ECE-2 could specifically fulfill this role as it displays the acidic optimum pH required for efficient conversion of precursors in the lumen of the TGN and the secretory vesicles (24Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and as 2 of the 4 recently identified isoforms of ECE-2 were found in intracellular compartments (33Ikeda S. Emoto N. Alimsardjono H. Yokoyama M. Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Previous studies aimed at identifying the intracellular compartments containing ECE-1b have produced controversial results. ECE-1b was detected in the Golgi apparatus, where it was co-localized with the Golgi marker wheat germ agglutinin in endothelial cells (35Barnes K. Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Turner A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 919-928PubMed Google Scholar) and with TGN38 in transfected fibroblasts (37Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Valdenaire O. Barret A. Schweizer A. Rohrbacher E. Mongiat F. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of ECE-1b in late endosomes/multivesicular bodies has been described in transfected epithelial cells and fibroblasts (38Azarani A. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Valdenaire O. Barret A. Schweizer A. Rohrbacher E. Mongiat F. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results were in agreement with these latter studies. In addition, we demonstrated that ECE-1d was also present in the endosomal system, but concentrated in the recycling endosomes. We showed that ECE-1b and 1d were cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes using three different lines of evidence: first, extracellular activity was detected from cells expressing ECE-1b and 1d; second, cells expressing these isoforms were able to capture antibodies directed against the ectodomain; third, expression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin, which blocks internalization of proteins, retained these ECE-1 isoforms at the plasma membrane, but had no effect on furin and on TGN38. In agreement with these results, ECE-1b was co-localized with rab5, a marker for early endosomes, which is the first intracellular compartment where endocytic vesicles fuse (38Azarani A. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The ECE-1b-specific di-leucine motif was responsible for the intracellular retention of this isoform (52Cailler F. Zappulla J.P. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Valdenaire O. Barret A. Schweizer A. Rohrbacher E. Mongiat F. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that the intracellular localization of ECE-1d also relies on the presence of a specific leucine-based motif (Val8-Leu9). We had shown that a second leucine-based motif (Leu31-Val32), common to ECE-1b, 1c and 1d, was also involved in ECE-1b intracellular retention (39Valdenaire O. Barret A. Schweizer A. Rohrbacher E. Mongiat F. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we found that this signal is not involved in ECE-1b degradation. On the other hand, the ECE-1b specific di-leucine motif (Leu12-Leu13) was responsible for the rapid degradation of this isoform. This motif alone was however not sufficient. Even though leucine-based motifs have been implicated at multiple steps of intracellular sorting in the TGN, the endosomes and the plasma membrane (for review see Ref. 53Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the determinants responsible for the specificity of the transport steps involved remain to be identified (54Sandoval I.V. Martinez-Arca S. Valdueza J. Palacios S. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39874-39885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggested that the sorting of ECE-1b relied on additional signal to the LL motif: first, the mutation of the ECE-1b LL motif only slightly increased the plasma membrane localization, compared with the mutation of ECE-1d VL motif; second, exchanging the VL and LL motifs modified ECE-1d degradation and localization, but not that of ECE-1b; third, the chimera containing the N-terminal residues of ECE-1b upstream of the VL motif of ECE-1d resulted in the rapid degradation of this construct. Our results suggested that ECE-1b N terminus encodes another complementary signal that does not reside in the primary structure. The additional signal could correspond to a secondary structure or to a post-translational modification that would increase the affinity of the di-leucine motif for an associated protein responsible for sorting to the degradation pathway. In the case of bovine isoforms of ECE-1, Emoto et al. (55Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have provided evidence for the targeting of bovine ECE-1b to the plasma membrane, and for the sorting of bovine ECE-1a to lysosomes (55Emoto N. Nurhantari Y. Alimsardjono H. Xie J. Yamada T. Yanagisawa M. Matsuo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It should be noted that bovine ECE-1b corresponds to human ECE-1c, which we also found targeted to the plasma membrane, and that bovine ECE-1a is poorly conserved with human ECE-1a. Indeed, the targeting signals responsible for bovine ECE-1a sorting are not present in human ECE-1.The detection of ECE-1 isoforms in the endosomal system could correspond to some novel physiological function of this enzyme, as big-ET is not present in these compartments. Endosomal ECE-1 could constitute an intracellular pool that could be rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of the cells, as suggested by the cycling of ECE-1b and ECE-1d between endosomes and plasma membrane. Alternatively, the intracellular retention of some ECE isoform could regulate the distribution of other isoforms through direct protein interaction. ECE-1 is expressed as disulfide-linked dimers, but the role of ECE-1 dimerization has not yet been found (20Schmidt M. Kroger B. Jacob E. Seulberger H. Subkowski T. Otter R. Meyer T. Schmalzing G.

We have already showed that ECE-1 is present only as dimers on the plasma membrane of endothelial cells (56Muller L. Valdenaire O. Barret A. Korth P. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S15-S18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present analysis of ECE-1 biosynthesis demonstrated that the complete dimerization of ECE-1 is a feature common to the 4 isoforms. Dimerization occurs rapidly after synthesis, most probably in the endoplasmic reticulum as we could observe the transient appearance of dimer intermediates that most likely corresponded to incompletely glycosylated or unfolded ECE-1. The Cys412 residue, present in the catalytic domain, is responsible for the dimerization (22Shimada K. Takahashi M. Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The role of ECE-1 dimerization has been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis of this cysteine. Mutation into a serine did not modify the glycosylation and the subcellular distribution of ECE-1. However, this mutation slightly modified the enzymatic characteristics of ECE-1 (22Shimada K.

The investigation of the formation of heterodimers in these cells was however limited due to the low level of expression of ECE-1a, and to the lack of antibodies specific for either ECE-1b or 1c or 1d. Therefore, we generated AtT-20 cell lines that co-expressed ECE-1a, the isoform with the higher plasma membrane expression, and ECE-1b, which displays the more stable intracellular localization. In double transfected cells we could confirm the presence of heterodimers. Both isoforms were colocalized in intracellular vesicles and the extracellular activity of ECE-1a was decreased. In addition, triple labeling experiments demonstrated that ECE-1a was translocated to the late endosomes/multivesicular bodies that contained ECE-1b. Importantly, heterodimerization of these isoforms did not increase the expression of ECE-1b at the plasma membrane, thus demonstrating the dominant role of"

Using the GPCR subtypes for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRHR1 and TRHR2), the aim of this study was to determine if subtype-specific differences exist in the trafficking process. If so, we wished to determine the impact of homo- and hetero-oligomerization on TRHR subtype trafficking as a potential mechanism for the differential cellular responses induced by TRH. Expression of either β-arrestin 1 or 2 promoted TRHR1 internalization. In contrast, only β-arrestin 2 could enhance TRHR2 internalization. The preference for β-arrestin 2 by TRHR2 was supported by the impairment of TRHR2 trafficking in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from either a β-arrestin 2 knockout or a β-arrestin 1/2 knockout, while TRHR1 trafficking was only abolished in MEFs lacking both β-arrestins. The differential β-arrestin-dependence of TRHR2 was directly measured in live cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Both BRET and confocal microscopy were also used to demonstrate that TRHR subtypes form hetero-oligomers. In addition, these hetero-oligomers have altered internalization kinetics compared with the homo-oligomer. The formation of TRHR1/2 heteromeric complexes increased the interaction between TRHR2 and β-arrestin 1. This may be due to conformational differences between TRHR1/2 hetero-oligomers versus TRHR2 homo-oligomers as a mutant TRHR1 (TRHR1 C335Stop) that does not interact with β-arrestins, could also enhance TRHR2/β-arrestin 1 interaction. This study demonstrates that TRHR subtypes are differentially regulated by the β-arrestins and also provides the first evidence that the interactions of TRHRs with β-arrestin may be altered by hetero-oligomer formation.

These molecular interactions are involved in receptor recognition, activation, and desensitization and are targets for the majority of current therapeutic compounds utilized to treat a variety of disorders. More recently, the escalating body of evidence for GPCR oligomerization also adds another level of complexity in understanding how GPCRs are activated and signal and traffick in the cell. GPCR hetero-oligomerization may explain the diverse physiological responses obtained from a single ligand. Indeed, a number of GPCR subtypes such as the somatostatin, opioid, angiotensin, and β-adrenergic receptors have been shown to form hetero-oligomers that result in a receptor unit with either altered ligand specificity, signaling, or internalization rates (1Gomes I.

GPCR activation is also regulated by receptor-protein interactions involved in desensitization and internalization. For the majority of GPCRs, the mechanism of internalization is via the β-arrestin and dynamin-dependent pathway where agonist-activated phosphorylated receptors interact with the β-arrestins (β-arrestin 1 and 2). Receptors are then targeted to clathrin-coated pits by β-arrestins and subsequently undergo endocytosis (6Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 7Claing A. Laporte S.A.

It has been established that TRHR1 internalizes via clathrin-coated pits and follows a β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway (22Groarke D.A. Wilson S. Krasel C. Milligan G. J. Biol.

We have also demonstrated homo-oligomerization of the TRHR1 using a biophysical method, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) (30Kroeger K. Hanyaloglu A.C. Seeber R.M. Miles L.E.M.

BRET represents a powerful technique to study protein-protein interactions in living cells and has been used to provide evidence for homo and heterodimerization of other GPCRs (4Lavoie, C., Mercier, J.

We also investigated how each of the two TRHR subtypes utilize the arrestins to promote internalization and found that TRHR subtype internalization was differentially regulated by β-arrestin 1 and 2, in that TRHR2 internalization was insensitive to β-arrestin 1. Additionally, formation of TRHR hetero-oligomers affects internalization kinetics, and through using BRET and confocal microscopy this may be a consequence of altered interactions with β-arrestin. Our findings suggest that TRHR oligomerization results in the creation of novel receptor units that can be differentially regulated by β-arrestins.DISCUSSIONIt is not yet understood how different GPCR subtypes, which are activated by the same ligand, induce differential cellular responses. Multiple receptor signals could be achieved by differential regulation of receptor subtypes by intracellular proteins or formation of new functional units through GPCR hetero-oligomerization. Ultimately, these effects would alter receptor trafficking properties and cell responsiveness to the agonist, thus serving a crucial role in generating the diversity of responses required for regulating cellular function in living systems.The TRHR subtypes (TRHR1 and TRHR2) are activated by the same ligand and are expressed in both unique and overlapping brain regions (14O'Dowd B.F.

Walker P. Bauer K. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To analyze subtype-specific differences in TRH-stimulated receptor internalization, we performed comparative studies of the cellular processes involved in receptor internalization by examining the role of β-arrestin isoforms. In addition, we explored the potential of TRHR1 and TRHR2 to hetero-oligomerize and analyzed the functional consequences of this hetero-oligomeric unit on receptor trafficking.We observed TRHR2 internalizes slower than TRHR1 in two different cell lines. In contrast, another study, which also compared the rates of internalization for the TRHR subtypes in COS-1 cells and more recently in HEK293 cells, reported a different rate for both TRHR1 and TRHR2 (14O'Dowd B.F.

However, as the rate for TRHR1 internalization obtained by us is in agreement with that previously published by others (20Ashworth R., Yu, R. Nelson E.J. Dermer S. Gershengorn M.C. Hinkle P.M. Proc.

Interestingly, the TRHR subtypes displayed a differential ability for β-arrestin-promoted internalization, both β-arrestin isoforms promoted TRHR1 internalization while β-arrestin 2, and not β-arrestin 1, promoted TRHR2 internalization.These observations were strongly supported by experiments measuring the ability of the TRHRs to internalize in MEFs derived from β-arrestin knockout mice (40Kohout T.A. Lin F.T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization of TRHR1 was impaired when both β-arrestins were absent. Importantly, internalization of TRHR2 was not affected in MEFs lacking β-arrestin 1 but was impaired in MEFs lacking β-arrestin 2 (either β-arr2-KO or β-arr1/2-KO). Similar results in MEF β-arrestin KO cells were also obtained for the internalization of angiotensin 1A receptor, which utilizes both β-arrestins, and the β2-adrenergic receptor, which preferentially utilizes β-arrestin 2 (40Kohout T.A. Lin F.T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). A classification has been proposed where GPCRs that preferentially utilize β-arrestin 2 for internalization are Class A receptors while GPCRs that utilize both β-arrestins equally are Class B receptors (8Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Therefore, TRHR2 is a Class A receptor, and TRHR1 is a Class B receptor.The Class A and B classification is further defined by the ability of β-arrestins to co-internalize with receptor, β-arrestin 2 remains at the cell surface for Class A receptors, but internalizes with Class B receptors (56Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that following prolonged activation of TRHR2 by TRH, β-arrestin 2/GFP remained at the cell surface. In contrast, prolonged activation of TRHR1 by TRH, redistributed β-arrestin 2/GFP into punctate vesicles. It has been shown that the receptor determinants for formation of these stable arrestin/receptor complexes are due to the presence of serine/threonine clusters in receptor carboxyl-terminal tails (C-tails) (56Oakley R.H.

For TRHR1, two such clusters exist in the C-tail, while for TRHR2 there are none, providing a possible explanation for determining whether co-internalization of receptor/β-arrestin complexes occurs for each of the TRHR subtypes.BRET, is a highly sensitive, quantitative approach to measure protein-protein interactions in living cells, in real time, and has been used by our group and others to detect GPCR interactions with β-arrestin (30Kroeger K.

In this study, by utilizing BRET, we demonstrated an agonist-dependent interaction between TRHR2 and β-arrestin 2, which is in agreement with our findings using more conventional techniques such as confocal microscopy. In addition, the highly sensitive BRET method provided evidence of a small, but consistent interaction between TRHR2 and β-arrestin 1 which may play a role in TRHR2 desensitization, as shown for other Class A receptors (40Kohout T.A.

As TRHR subtypes are found to be co-expressed in various regions of the brain (14O'Dowd B.F. Lee D.K. Huang W. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Liu Y. Wang B. Gershengorn M.C. George S.R. Mol.

Similar to TRHR1 (30Kroeger K. Hanyaloglu A.C. Seeber R.M. Miles L.E.M. Eidne K.A. J. Biol.

This increase in BRET ratio could represent either an increase in the number of oligomers and/or a change in the conformation of pre-existing complexes following ligand binding that results in a more favorable orientation of Rluc and EYFP moieties. BRET analysis also demonstrated constitutive receptor hetero-oligomerization between TRHR1 and TRHR2, which increased with TRH stimulation.

However, while we observed no effect on TRH binding or signaling, the internalization kinetics in cells co-expressing TRHR1 and TRHR2 was significantly different from that in cells expressing either TRHR1, or TRHR2 alone. Likewise, heterodimers of the β2-adrenergic receptor and kappa opioid receptors do not have significantly altered ligand binding or G-protein coupling properties of either receptor, but, the resulting heterodimer does display altered trafficking properties (61Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar).We wished to further understand the mechanisms underlying the altered trafficking of TRHR hetero-oligomers versus homo-oligomers. As the BRET demonstrated that TRHR subtypes differentially interacted with β-arrestin 1 and 2, this provided us with a strategy for addressing a possible mechanism underlying the altered kinetics of TRHR hetero-oligomers trafficking. We found that the TRHR2/β-arrestin 1 interaction as measured by BRET was enhanced by co-expression of TRHR1. This effect was not due to the ability of TRHR1 to efficiently interact with β-arrestin 1, as a TRHR1 mutant (TRHR1 C335Stop) that does not interact with arrestins (26Heding A. Vrecl M.

Furthermore, cells co-expressing TRHR2 and TRHR1 C335Stop were able to rapidly translocate β-arrestin 1/GFP. As neither receptor alone could induce a translocation of β-arrestin 1, we suggest that formation of the TRHR1/TRHR2 hetero-oligomer resulted in a more favorable conformation that increased binding of β-arrestin 1 to TRHR2, which may explain the change in internalization kinetics of the hetero-oligomeric unit. In addition, the TRHR1/2 hetero-oligomer also has Class A receptor characteristics in that β-arrestin 1 remained at the cell membrane and did not redistribute into vesicles. To our knowledge this is the first observation that GPCR hetero-oligomers may have altered associations, compared with homo-oligomers, with intracellular regulatory proteins.Overall, this study provides evidence that the TRHR subtypes are able to form hetero-oligomers in live cells and that this association may affect receptor trafficking by altering the association of TRHRs with β-arrestins. A further understanding of the regulation and function of TRHR2 and the TRHR hetero-oligomeric complex may aid in explaining the diverse responses generated by a single ligand and assist in the design of therapeutic agents, which could selectively target the homo or heteromeric G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes. G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 function is underpinned by the formation of protein-protein interactions and complexes that are dynamically regulated by a variety of stimuli. These molecular interactions are involved in receptor recognition, activation, and desensitization and are targets for the majority of current therapeutic compounds utilized to treat a variety of disorders. More recently, the escalating body of evidence for GPCR oligomerization also adds another level of complexity in understanding how GPCRs are activated and signal and traffick in the cell. GPCR he"

In an immunoaffinity purification using anti-HDAC3, transcription factor TFII-I copurified with HDAC3. Specificity of the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins, GST pull-down assays, and protein colocalization with indirect immunofluorescence. An anti-TFII-I immunoprecipitate contained histone deacetylase enzymatic activity. Mutational analyses revealed that the carboxyl-terminal of HDAC3 (residues 373–401) and residues 363–606 of TFII-I were required for the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction. Transcriptional activation by TFII-I was severely reduced by overexpression of HDAC3. These results suggest that HDAC3 modulates some of the functions of TFII-I and provides a link between histone deacetylase and a multifunctional transcriptional activator.

Whether chromatin is transcriptionally active or repressed is determined, at least in part, by the modification of nucleosomal histones. Of the many possible post-translational modifications of histones, the most common are acetylation and deacetylation. In humans, about 20 histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 enzymes have been identified whose functions are primarily to regulate the acetylation status of histones and maintain regions of chromatin in transcriptionally inactive states. The first human histone deacetylase, HDAC1, was cloned by Schreiber and colleagues (1Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) using a deacetylase inhibitor affinity matrix. The second human histone deacetylase, HDAC2, was identified in our laboratory in a yeast two-hybrid experiment with the YY1 transcription factor as bait (2Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). HDAC1 and HDAC2 bear a high degree of sequence homology to the yeast protein RPD3, and both enzymes typically coexist in the same protein complexes. The third human histone deacetylase, HDAC3, was cloned based on sequence similarities to HDAC1 and HDAC2 (3Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol.

Unlike HDAC1/2, HDAC3 is present in a unique large multisubunit protein complex that contains proteins different from those identified in HDAC1/2 complexes (6Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W.

Also, unlike HDAC1 or HDAC2, HDAC3 is essential for cell viability and is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (10McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L., Lu, J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 11Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Biol.

Although HDAC3 clearly plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, the challenge has been to understand the exact mechanisms by which HDAC3 modulates gene expression and affects the functions of the transcriptional machinery. More importantly, there is a need to address the functional differences between HDAC3 and HDAC1/2 and, possibly, other HDACs. The identification and characterization of HDAC1/2-binding proteins has been tremendously useful in elucidating the mechanisms of action and functions of these two HDACs. Following similar strategies, we isolated an endogenous HDAC3-containing multisubunit complex using anti-HDAC3 immunoaffinity chromatography (9Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Besides HDAC3, this complex also contains NCoR/SMRT co-repressors plus several unidentified proteins. In parallel, using anti-NCoR/SMRT combined with conventional chromatography, four laboratories independently isolated complexes containing NCoR/SMRT, HDAC3, the WD-40 repeat-containing protein TBL1, SWI/SNF-related proteins, the co-repressor KAP-1, and multiple not-yet characterized proteins (6Guenther M.G.

We found that transcriptional repression by NCoR is mediated by its interaction with HDAC3 and that NCoR augments the enzymatic activity of HDAC3. Although these earlier findings confirm and extend the concept that HDAC3 is a major player in transcriptional repression, they raise several important questions. What other proteins are present in the HDAC3 complex? Do these proteins increase or antagonize HDAC3 activity? Does HDAC3 reciprocally modify the function of these HDAC3-binding proteins? We have now identified an additional component of the HDAC3 complex. We show that the protein originally designated p130 (9Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) is the transcription factor TFII-I (14Roy A.L., Du, H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TFII-I was earlier shown to be a basal transcription factor that binds to and activates transcription from the initiator element (16Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that TFII-I is also an inducible multifunctional factor that selectively regulates gene expression when activated by a variety of extracellular signals (17Roy A.L. Gene. 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that TFII-I interacts specifically with HDAC3, suggesting that HDAC3 may be a natural mediator of TFII-I functions. Consistent with the ability of these two proteins to interact, HDAC3 can also alter the transcriptional activity of TFII-I.

Plasmids that express HA-TFII-I deletions were constructed by digestion of pcDNA3-HA-TFII-I with various restriction enzymes, followed by religation. The plasmid expressing an enzymatic-deficient HDAC3 mutant (H134Q/H135A/A136S) was generated using the Kunkel mutagenesis procedure as outlined in the Muta-Gene system (Bio-Rad). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Polyclonal anti-TFII-I antibody has been described (22Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2, monoclonal anti-GST, and polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Immunoprecipitations were performed in a solution of PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors as previously described (23Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were washed six times with the same buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were removed from protein A beads by either boiling in gel loading buffer or by elution with excess peptide antigens. For Western blot analyses, proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with nonfat dried milk, the membranes were treated with diluted primary antibodies, followed by diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary IgG. The blots were then developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. For intracellular localization of HDAC3 and TFII-I, COS1 cells were grown on acid-etched coverslips in 100-mm tissue culture plates for about 24 h and transfected with 0.5 μg of pFLAG-HDAC plasmid as described below. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized overnight in PBS containing 1% glycine and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-FLAG coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Upstate) and anti-TFII-I antibodies. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to tetramethyl rhodamine (Sigma). The cells were then washed extensively with PBS, and coverslips were applied with 40% glycerol before analyzing under a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope. GST and GST-HDAC3 were expressed and purified as described (3Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). 35S-TFII-I was prepared using the coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Equal molar quantities of GST and GST-HDAC3, both conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads, were incubated with radiolabeled TFII-I. Binding reactions, washing conditions, and analysis by electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography were performed as previously described (3Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Deacetylase activity was determined using hyperacetylated core histones purified from HeLa cells (24Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.-P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D.

After incubation at room temperature overnight, the reactions were quenched with 1 m HCl and 0.16 m acetic acid (50 μl in each sample). Released [3H]acetic acid was extracted with 600 μl of ethyl acetate by vortexing and centrifugation (5 min at 14,000 rpm). The ethyl acetate supernatants (250 μl from each sample) were quantified by scintillation counting. COS1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids directing the synthesis of various effector proteins and a luciferase reporter using the FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche). Each transfection contained 0.5 μg each of effector and reporter DNAs, and all transfections were normalized to equal amounts of DNA with parental expression vectors. For the c-fos-luciferase assay, cells were refed with medium containing 10% serum 24 h after transfection. Twelve hours later, the cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Sigma). Epidermal growth factor treatment was not necessary for the Vβ-luciferase assay. Cells were collected and luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). We previously purified an endogenous HDAC3 complex from a total extract prepared from HeLa cells using an anti-HDAC3 immunoaffinity column (9Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A.

We found that in addition to HDAC3, eight proteins (p215, p205, p195, p130, p125, p54, p52, and p35) specifically co-eluted with histone deacetylase activity. When the 215K, 205K, and 195K polypeptides were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion followed by sequencing by microcapillary HPLC ion trap mass spectrometry, the resulting peptide sequences were shown to be derivatives of the nuclear receptor co-repressors, NCoR and SMRT (9Wen Y.D.

We have now shown that protein microsequencing of p130 has identified this HDAC3-associated polypeptide as the transcription factor TFII-I (TableI).Table ISequence of tryptic fragments of p130 (TFII-I)FAQALGLTEAVKDQSAVVVQGLPEGVAFKTPTQTNGSNVPFKPRAPSYLEISSMRGPVTIPYPLFQSHVEDLYVEGLPEGIPFRFEAHPNDLYVEGLPENIPFRSPTWFGIPREFSFEAWNAKSPSWYGIPREQVNDLFSRVPYPVFESNPEFLYVEGLPEGIPFRRPFLEPKWILENKHPENYDLATLK Open table in a new tab To ensure that the co-purification of TFII-I with anti-HDAC3 was not a result of antibody cross-reactivity, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids expressing either HA-TFII-I or GST-TFII-I and FLAG-HDAC fusion proteins. Extracts prepared from transfected cells were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG or anti-GST antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, top panel, FLAG-HDAC3 interacted with HA-TFII-I and GST-TFII-I (lanes 3and 8), whereas FLAG alone, FLAG-HDAC4, FLAG-HDAC5, and FLAG-HDAC6 did not (lanes 1, 4–6,9–11). Interestingly, HA-TFII-I or GST-TFII-I also bound, to a limited extent, both FLAG-HDAC1 and FLAG-HDAC2 (lanes 2and 7). To support the observation that HDAC3 and TFII-I interact, we tested whether a GST-HDAC3 affinity matrix would capture TFII-I. Bacterially expressed GST-HDAC3 was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled TFII-I produced by in vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate. The beads were then washed and boiled in sample buffer, and the proteins released from the beads were analyzed by electrophoresis in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. TFII-I was captured by the GST-HDAC3 fusion protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) but not by the GST polypeptide alone (lane 2). Colocalization studies were performed to confirm the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction in mammalian cells. COS1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-HDAC3, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and immunostained with an anti-FLAG antibody. Consistent with our previous findings, images obtained with a confocal laser scanning system showed that HDAC3 was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2). TFII-I was regionally dispersed throughout the nuclei of COS1 cells. Importantly, numerous distinct nuclear regions in which TFII-I and HDAC3 colocalized were identified (middle panel), in agreement with the observation that the two proteins physically interact in vivo. As expected, TFII-I also colocalized with HDAC1 (left panel). In contrast, HDAC5 did not colocalize with TFII-I, acting as a negative control (right panel). To identify the domain of HDAC3 that interacts with TFII-I, we coprecipitated HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-TFII-I with plasmids expressing FLAG fused to full-length HDAC3 or various C-terminal truncated forms of HDAC3. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, full-length HDAC3 (1–428) and HDAC3 (1–401) clearly bound TFII-I (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas fragments corresponding to HDAC3 residues 1–373, 1–313, 1–265, and 1–180 did not bind TFII-I (lanes 3–6). These data suggest that residues 401–428 of HDAC3 are not necessary for HDAC3-TFII-I association and that the minimal interaction region is located in residues 373–401. In a reciprocal experiment, we identified the region of TFII-I that interacts with HDAC3. C-terminal deletions of TFII-I (1–781 and 1–606) bound HDAC3 (Fig. 4 A; Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that residues 606–958 of TFII-I are not important for HDAC3-TFII-I interaction. In contrast, TFII-I (1–363) did not associate with HDAC3 (lane 3). Further deletion analyses show that TFII-I (133–958 and 133–781) interacted with HDAC3, whereas TFII-I (133–363) did not (lanes 4–6). Taken together, these results suggest that the minimal HDAC3-binding domain is located between residues 363–606 of TFII-I but that the interaction domain may extend from residues 133 to 606. To determine whether the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction results in the recruitment of HDAC enzymatic activity by TFII-I, we expressed GST-TFII-I in COS1 cells, prepared immunoprecipitates from extracts using an anti-GST antibody, and assayed for HDAC activity. On average, HDAC activity was nearly 50-fold higher in immunocomplexes containing GST-TFII-I when compared with GST alone (Fig. 5). The TFII-I-associated HDAC activity was greatly reduced by Trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of deacetylases. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that HDAC1/2 (in addition to HDAC3) may contribute to the HDAC activity associated with TFII-I, this result unequivocally confirms that TFII-I interacts with HDACs. To determine whether HDAC3 affects the transcriptional activity of TFII-I, we examined its effect on the activity of the c-fospromoter, which is regulated by TFII-I (20Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As predicted, overexpression of TFII-I significantly activated the c-fospromoter (Fig. 6 A). More importantly, overexpression of HDAC3 substantially inhibited the activation of the c-fos promoter by TFII-I, consistent with the premise that HDAC3 can modulate the activity of TFII-I. The expression of TFII-I was not affected by HDAC3 (Fig. 6 A,right panel), ruling out the possibility that HDAC3 down-regulates the human EF-1α promoter used to express TFII-I. Activation of the c-fos promoter by TFII-I was not affected by an HDAC3 mutant (H134Q/H135A/A136S) lacking deacetylase activity or by HDAC3 mutants that do not bind TFII-I (1–373, 1–313, 1–265, 1–180) (Fig. 6, A and B). Recently, it was found that TFII-I can activate the c-fospromoter through a Src-dependent mechanism (26Cheriyath V. Desgranges Z.P. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether HDAC3 represses Src-dependent TFII-I activation, we expressed TFII-I and c-Src, together with HDAC3, in the presence of the c-fos reporter. As shown in Fig. 6 C, activation of c-fos by TFII-I plus c-Src was completely abolished by HDAC3. In addition to c-fos, TFII-I is required for the transcription of the naturally TATA-less but initiator-containing Vβ promoter (19Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, HDAC3 inhibited the ability of TFII-I to activate the Vβ promoter (Fig. 6 D). However, neither the HDAC3 mutant (H134Q/H135A/A136S) nor HDAC6 had an effect on the activation of the Vβ promoter by TFII-I. Taken together, these results unambiguously show that the transcriptional activity of TFII-I is modulated by interaction with the HDAC3 protein. To confirm that the inhibition of activation by the TFII-I protein is not due to a general inhibitory effect of HDAC3 overexpression, we transfected cells with pGal4-VP16 and pGal4-TKLuc. As shown, overexpression of HDAC3 did not affect transcriptional activation of the Gal4-TK promoter by the Gal4-VP16 protein (Fig. 6 E). Thus, our data strongly suggest that HDAC3 is not a general cytotoxic protein but rather is a specific cellular inhibitor of TFII-I. The two best studied human histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2, regulate gene expression, at least in part, by forming complexes with other cellular factors. To obtain a greater mechanistic and functional understanding of HDAC3, we previously purified and attempted to identify proteins capable of forming heterologous complexes with HDAC3 (9Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Here, we identify one of the previously isolated HDAC3-binding proteins as the transcription factor, TFII-I. Three lines of evidence confirmed that TFII-I is a genuine HDAC3-associated protein. First, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that TFII-I interacts with HDAC3 but not HDAC-4, -5 or -6. Second, using a GST-HDAC3 fusion protein, biochemical evidence was obtained indicating that HDAC3 and TFII-I interact in vitro. Finally, immunocytochemical methods revealed a similar subcellular distribution of HDAC3 and TFII-I in mammalian cells. Although the present experiments rely on overexpression of HDAC3 or TFII-I, we believe that they accurately reflect true in vivointeractions, in part because TFII-I copurifies with HDAC3 in an anti-HDAC3 immunoaffinity column using a whole cell extract without overexpression of either protein (9Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition to its interaction with HDAC3, TFII-I also interacts very weakly with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in coprecipitation experiments. Although this observation is not surprising considering that several proteins that bind HDAC1/2 also partner with HDAC3 (3Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E. Proc. Natl.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that there are multiple affinity levels of interaction, with HDAC3-TFII-I forming the most stable complex. Also, at least four isoforms of TFII-I exist (15Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and at this time, our protein microsequencing data do not exclude the possibility that HDAC3 binds more than one isoform of TFII-I. Analysis of HDAC3 deletion mutants revealed that residues 373–401 of HDAC3 are required for the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction. Although the importance of this region with respect to mechanisms and functions of HDAC3 is unknown at this time, this area is known to be outside both the HDAC3 nuclear export sequence and the oligomerization domain and contributes to the deacetylase and transcriptional activity of HDAC3 (12Yang W.M. Tsai S.C. Wen Y.D. Fejer G. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9447-9454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In future studies, it will be important to determine whether this TFII-I-interacting domain binds other cellular factors or associates with TFII-I exclusively. An unusual feature of the TFII-I protein is the presence of six highly conserved 90-residue repeats (R1-R6), and a striking feature of these repeats is the presence of HLH motifs, which have been implicated in protein-protein interactions. Our deletion mutational studies indicate that residues 363–606 of TFII-I are essential for the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction. This region encompasses a portion of R2 and nearly the entire R3 and R4 I-repeats. Although hetero- and homo-dimerization mediated through HLH motifs is a well known phenomenon, it is presently unclear how the HLH domain of TFII-I forms a complex with HDAC3, which does not appear to contain an HLH domain. It is possible that HDAC3 and TFII-I interact via a third protein that contains both an HLH motif and an HDAC3 interaction domain. Further experiments using highly purified HDAC3 and TFII-I will resolve this issue. The biological and functional significance of the HDAC3-TFII-I interaction remains in question. One possibility is that, in addition to its many other functions, TFII-I also recruits HDAC activity to promoters containing TFII-I binding sites. By doing so, it may help modulate the overall transcriptional activity from TFII-I-regulated promoters. If so, TFII-I then joins a rapidly growing list of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate transcription by recruitment of HDAC activity. In support of this model, we show that TFII-I immunoprecipitates contain HDAC activity and that HDAC3 inhibits the activity of the c-fos and Vβ promoters. The crucial question that needs to be addressed now is whether the recruitment of HDAC3 by TFII-I is a regulated process and, if so, how to identify the signal involved. It is also conceivable that HDAC3 blocks the ability of TFII-I to activate transcription without tethering itself to the transcription complex. Finally, the possibility that TFII-I may be a substrate for HDAC3, and possibly for HDAC1/2 as well, cannot yet be ruled out. Experiments designed to explore each of these possibilities are now in progress.

It undergoes a Ca2+-myristoyl switch when Ca2+ binds to EF-hand 2 and 3. We investigated the mechanism of this switch by the use of point mutations in EF-hand 2 (E85Q) and 3 (E121Q) that impair their Ca2+ binding. EF-hand 2 and 3 display different properties and serve different functions. Binding of Ca2+to recoverin is a sequential process, wherein EF-hand 3 is occupied first followed by the filling of EF-hand 2. After EF-hand 3 bound Ca2+, the subsequent filling of EF-hand 2 triggers the exposition of the myristoyl group and in turn binding of recoverin to membranes. In addition, EF-hand 2 controls the mean residence time of recoverin at membranes by decreasing the dissociation rate of recoverin from membranes by 10-fold.

A well-known system represents the light absorbing pigment rhodopsin and the corresponding kinase, rhodopsin kinase, or GRK-1, which phosphorylates (and thus desensitizes) photobleached rhodopsin. Arrestin then binds to phosphorylated rhodopsin and thereby stops any further activation of the G-protein transducin (2Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Illumination causes the decrease in the concentration of the intracellular transmitters of excitation and adaption, cGMP and cytoplasmic [Ca2+], respectively. The decrease in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] is sensed by Ca2+ sensor proteins such as recoverin (4Dizhoor A.M. Nekrasova E.R. Philippov P.P. Biokhimia. 1991; 56: 225-228PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dizhoor A.M.

The Ca2+-dependent control of rhodopsin kinase via recoverin belongs to at least nine different mechanisms in vertebrate photoreceptor cells that control adaptation to background light intensities (10Pugh E.N., Jr. Nikonov S.

Cornwall M.C. Koutalos Y. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 117-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Of particular importance for recoverin as a Ca2+ sensor of rhodopsin kinase is its Ca2+-myristoyl switch (14Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 15Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A combination of biochemical and structural 1H-NMR approaches has deciphered some of the molecular details of this switch mechanism; recoverin has a compact structure and consists of two domains. Each domain harbors two EF-hand structures but only EF-hand 2 and 3 can bind Ca2+ ions. Retinal recoverin is heterogeneously acylated (mainly myristoylated) at its N terminus (16Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The myristoyl group is sequestered within a hydrophobic pocket when no Ca2+ ions are bound to recoverin. Extrusion of the myristoyl group is triggered by binding of Ca2+, which then enables recoverin to associate with phospholipid membranes (17Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M.

Myristoyl switches are not restricted to recoverin and its homologue neuronal calcium sensor proteins (reviewed in 20Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar); instead, myristoyl switches are also found in other signal transduction proteins. For example, a Ca2+-myristoyl/palmitoyl switch mechanism operates in the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and translocates a 24-kDa Ca2+-binding protein to the flagellar membrane (23Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another type of myristoyl switch works in ADP-ribosylation factors, which control the assembly and disassembly of transport vesicle coats. These small GTP-binding proteins undergo GDP/GTP-exchange, which triggers the exposure of the myristoyl group (24Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A phosphorylation-dependent myristoyl switch is present in myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrates and Src kinases, where phosphorylation triggers the release of these proteins from the membrane (26McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, myristoyl switches operate in a wide range of signaling systems, but they share common themes in their mechanisms: a trigger such as Ca2+ ions, GDP/GTP exchange, or phosphorylation induces exposition of the fatty acyl group and consequently translocation of the protein. To understand the mechanism of the Ca2+-myristoyl switch in greater molecular detail, we used recoverin mutants with impaired EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites (27Alekseev A.M. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Zinchenko D.V. Shulga-Morskaya S.A. Suchkov D.V. Vaganova S.A. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Lipkin V.M. Akhtar M. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we introduced the substitutions E85Q (mutant RcE85Q) and E121Q (mutant RcE121Q) in EF-hand 2 and EF-hand 3 of recoverin, respectively, because we know that substitutions in the Z position of the loop of the EF-hand motif decrease the affinity of the Ca2+-binding site for Ca2+ by about 1000-fold (28Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The structure of myristoylated RcE85Q with one Ca2+ ion bound was recently published and represents an intermediate state between the structures of recoverin with zero and two Ca2+ ions bound (30Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The myristoyl group in RcE85Q is partially buried, and it was predicted that the mutant RcE85Q would not exhibit any considerable binding to membranes (30Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The importance of the positions Glu-85 and Glu-121 was also described for S-modulin in a study by Matsuda et al. (31Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Tokunaga F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These authors reported on sequential Ca2+ binding and showed that the S-modulin mutant E85M bound only one Ca2+, but it associated with membranes similar to the wild type. These data were in contrast to the prediction based on the three-dimensional structure of RcE85Q. We used the recoverin mutants RcE85Q and RcE121Q to study the Ca2+-myristoyl switch in more detail and measured binding of WT1-recoverin and the mutants to rod outer segment (ROS) membranes and liposomes; in particular, we studied the dynamics of the binding to liposomes by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. 45CaCl2 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were obtained from Merck, Sigma, Amersham Biosciences, and Fluka. Bovine brain phosphatidylcholine, bovine brain phosphatidylserine and egg yolk phosphatidylethanolamine were from Sigma and 98% pure. Polycarbonate filter membranes (type GTTP) were from Millipore. All other reagents and buffers were at least analytical grade. Bovine ROS were prepared from fresh bovine retinae and stored at −80 °C as described previously (32Koch K.-W. Lambrecht H.-G. Haberecht M. Redburn D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Urea-washed ROS membranes were obtained by the homogenization of ROS in 5 m urea and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the dark (33Shichi H. Somers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7040-7046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then ROS were incubated on ice for 5 min and were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and washed three times with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −80 °C. Mutagenesis of recoverin was described previously (27Alekseev A.M. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Zinchenko D.V. Shulga-Morskaya S.A. Suchkov D.V. Vaganova S.A. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Lipkin V.M. Akhtar M.

Recombinant nonmyristoylated and myristoylated forms of recoverin and its mutants were expressed in the E. coli strains pET11d rec/BL21 and pET11d rec/pBB131/BL21C, respectively. Cells were lysed in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA) including 0.05 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 15000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was adjusted to 2 mm or 20 mm CaCl2 for WT-recoverin and RcE121Q, respectively, and was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with buffer B containing 2 mm or 20 mm CaCl2. Recoverin was eluted with buffer B containing 2 mm EGTA. In the case of mutant RcE85Q, a gel filtration on a Superose 12 (AmershamPhamacia Biotech) was used instead of chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose. The fraction containing recoverin was loaded on a Mono-Q (5/5) column that was equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nonmyristoylated and myristoylated recoverin were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–400 mmNaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purity of recoverin was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The degree of myristoylation was determined by analytical high performance liquid chromatography and was, in most cases, more than 95%. Only WT recoverin showed a lower degree of myristoylation (70–80%) and was purified to a homogeneous myristoylated form by high performance liquid chromatography. Denatured protein was refolded as described in Ref. 34Neubert T.A. Walsh K.A. Hurley J.B. Johnson R.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. All buffers and protein solutions used in Ca2+ titration experiments were passed over a Chelex column (Bio-Rad) to remove residual amounts of Ca2+. Chelex resin was prepared and equilibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of45Ca2+ was performed as described previously (17Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (0.5 ml) that contained 50 or 100 μm protein were dissolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and were transferred to Centricon 10 devices (Amicon). A solution of 10 μl of 0.2 mm45CaCl2 (0.4–0.5 μCi) solution was added and centrifuged for 1 min at 30 °C (7000 rpm) in a tabletop centrifuge (model TJ-6; Beckman Coulter). After centrifugation, the radioactivity in 15 μl of the filtrate (free Ca2+) and an equal volume of protein sample (total Ca2+) were determined by liquid scintillation counting. On the next steps, nonradioactive CaCl2 was added and the centrifugation procedure above was repeated. Protein-bound Ca2+ versus free Ca2+ was determined from the excess Ca2+ in the protein sample over that present in the ultrafiltrate. The data were analyzed as follows: Ca2+free =Rf/Rp × Ca2+total, where Rf is the radioactivity in the filtrate, Rp is radioactivity in protein sample, and Ca2+totaland Ca2+free are the total and free Ca2+ concentration, respectively. Free Ca2+concentrations of buffer solutions were calculated using the program Webmax 2.0 (Stanford University). We used dibromo-BAPTA as Ca2+ buffer in Ca2+ titration experiments (35Harrison S.M. Bers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The free Ca2+ concentration of buffer solutions was checked with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) using calibration standards in the range from 10−8 to 10−1m free [Ca2+]. Binding of recoverin to ROS membranes was performed according to a published procedure (14Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μm recoverin or its mutants were mixed with bleached, urea-washed ROS membranes (50 μm rhodopsin) and incubated at 37 °C (Eppendorf Thermomixer 5436, 1000 rpm) for 15 min in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm dibromo-BAPTA, and 0–50 mmCaCl2 (total volume 75 μl). Membranes were separated by centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 rpm; Eppendorf model 5415 tabletop centrifuge) and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using a recoverin calibration curve. SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Liposomes were prepared as described previously (38Lange C. Koch K.-W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12019-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with slight modification. A mixture of 4 mg of lipids (40% (w/w) phosphatidylethanolamine, 40% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine, 15% (w/w) phosphatidylserine; 5% (w/w) cholesterol corresponding to the lipid composition in bovine ROS membranes in CHCl3 was dried down by vacuum in a SpeedVac concentrator. The sample was resuspended in 2 ml of degassed buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 3 mm EGTA) and sonified for 2 × 15 min (Branson B12; cup; 100 W). Large unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) were produced using the extrusion technique. The suspension was soaked for 15–20 min and extruded through polycarbonate filter with a pore diameter of 1 μm (first step) and 0.4 μm (second step). Binding of recoverin to liposomes and ROS membranes was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) as described previously (38Lange C. Koch K.-W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12019-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The running buffer contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and Ca2+ buffers as indicated. Liposomes were immobilized on a sensor chip with a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiols or, alternatively, by binding on a hydrophobic sensor chip (pioneer L1; BIAcore). Nonspecific binding was tested by application of bovine serum albumin. Interaction of recoverin with immobilized liposomes or ROS vesicles was tested by applying 2–75 μm protein in running buffer at different [Ca2+]. Free [Ca2+] was adjusted with dibromo-BAPTA as Ca2+ buffer. The flow rate was 5 μl/min. Resonance signals at equilbrium were determined and normalized to the amount of immobilized phospholipids that allows the direct comparison of recordings obtained with different surfaces. Data evaluation was performed with the software BIAevaluation 3.1. Sensorgrams were evaluated by nonlinear curve fitting according to a model of two parallel reactions. Using this procedure, we determined relative kinetics of a fast and slow component in the dissociation phase. The Ca2+-dependent development of the slower component in the dissociation phase was analyzed by comparing the relative response at 10 s after start of the dissociation process. The amplitude of each sensorgram at that time was determined and was assigned RUt. The maximal amplitude of the corresponding sensorgram was RUmax. We first tested the binding of45Ca2+ to myristoylated forms of WT-recoverin and mutants RcE85Q and RcE121Q, which were obtained as homogeneous protein preparations. At saturating Ca2+ concentrations (above 100 μm), WT-recoverin bound two Ca2+, RcE85Q bound 1.1 Ca2+ and RcE121Q did not bind Ca2+(Fig. 1). Binding of Ca2+ to WT-recoverin was half-maximal at 17.6 μm (Hill coefficient, n H = 1.9). Ca2+-binding data for RcE85Q reached a plateau (i.e.apparently saturated) above 100 μm; however,when we increased the Ca2+ concentration to 2–10 mm, an additional increase in Ca2+ binding was observed (Fig. 1). We interpret the last finding to indicate binding of Ca2+ to the mutated second EF-hand with low affinity. Binding of Ca2+ to RcE85Q was half-maximal at 34.6 μm (Hill coefficient, n H = 1.0). Our results on Ca2+ binding to WT-recoverin were in agreement with previous work (17Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The binding experiments with the mutants showed that impairment of the second EF-hand leads to binding of one Ca2+, whereas impairment of the third EF-hand prevents binding of Ca2+ to both sites. Initial characterization of the mutants had proven that their general structure had not changed (39Permyakov S.E. Cherskaya A.M. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Alekseev A.M. Zinchenko D.V. Lipkin V.M. Philippov P.P. Uversky V.N. Permyakov E.A. Protein. Eng. 2000; 13: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, mutants RcE85Q and RcE121Q can serve as selective tools to study the Ca2+-myristoyl switch. One approach to study the Ca2+-myristoyl switch of recoverin is to determine the amount of membrane-associated recoverin under varying Ca2+ concentrations. Myristoylated forms of WT-recoverin and the mutants were incubated with washed ROS membranes at different free [Ca2+] from 117 nm to 50 mm. Non-bound recoverin was removed by centrifugation, and the amount of bound recoverin was determined by densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. A representative example is displayed in Fig. 2 A for WT-recoverin and mutants RcE85Q and RcE121Q. The relative intensity of recoverin bands is shown as a function of free [Ca2+] in Fig. 2 B. Half-maximal binding of WT-recoverin and RcE121Q to ROS membranes was at 4.7 μm and 5 mm, respectively. The binding of RcE121Q to ROS membranes with an EC50 of 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B) is far beyond the working range of the Ca2+-myristoyl switch in WT-recoverin and might reflect the low-affinity binding of Ca2+ to the mutated EF-hand 3 (39Permyakov S.E. Cherskaya A.M. Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Shulga-Morskoy S.V. Alekseev A.M. Zinchenko D.V. Lipkin V.M. Philippov P.P. Uversky V.N. Permyakov E.A. Protein. Eng. 2000; 13: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which allows Ca2+ to fill the native EF-hand 2 and to trigger binding of the mutant to the membranes. A special observation was made with RcE85Q. Binding of this mutant to ROS membranes occurred in two steps, reaching a first plateau around 100 μm and full saturation above 10 mm(Fig. 2 B). The data profile was reminiscent of45Ca2+ binding to nonmyristoylated recoverin (i.e. binding to two independent sites; see Fig. 2A in Ref. 17Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data were well-fit according to a model of two independent binding sites yielding two EC50 values of half-maximal binding of RcE85Qto ROS membranes equal to 9 μm and 2.6 mm. In a second approach to studying the Ca2+-myristoyl switch of recoverin, we applied SPR spectroscopy to record binding of myristoylated WT-recoverin and mutants RcE85Q and RcE121Q to phospolipid liposomes. SPR spectroscopy allows the quantification of the affinity of a binding reaction and, in addition, can provide insight into the kinetics of a binding reaction. We immobilized phospholipid liposomes using a hydrophobic sensor chip (pioneer L1; BIAcore) to capture phospholipids that were injected over the flow cell. Immobilized liposomes were stable over the time course of a typical experiment and could be used to monitor association and dissociation of recoverin by SPR-spectroscopy. First, we tested whether the system was suitable for our application. When myristoylated WT-recoverin was supplied in the mobile phase, binding of recoverin to immobilized liposomes on the sensor chip caused a change in resonance units (RU) and was recorded as a sensorgram (Fig. 3 A). The black barin Fig. 3 A indicates the association phase of the sensorgram. The association phase attained a plateau during injection of recoverin, which indicates that the binding of recoverin to liposomes had reached equilibrium. Dissociation of recoverin from liposomes was triggered by flushing the flow cell with running buffer without recoverin (Fig. 3, open bar). Complete dissociation of recoverin from liposomes was achieved by a short pulse of 10 mm Ca2+ chelator EGTA during the dissociation phase (not shown). Sensorgrams were recorded at different concentrations of recoverin (Fig. 3 A). At all concentrations used, sensorgrams showed rapid association and dissociation of recoverin. Thus, myristoylated recoverin did not permanently stay on the membrane; instead, there was a rapid equilibrium between the bound and soluble states. Because a bulk refractive index change could lead to an increase in RU without reflecting any true binding to immobilized liposomes, we performed three control experiments to exclude this possibility. 1) We applied 30 μm calmodulin or protein G to measure the change in bulk refractive index that might be caused by a protein solution of comparable concentration (Fig. 3 B). Injection of calmodulin and protein G both caused a change of 70–80 RU or 8.5–9.8 RUnorm (normalized to the amount of immmobilized lipids). 2) When we used a running buffer that contained the Ca2+chelator EGTA instead of Ca2+, we observed signals with amplitude between 67 and 89 RU (data not shown). Amplitudes did not differ much when we used either WT-recoverin or recoverin mutants in EGTA buffer. 3) When nonmyristoylated WT-recoverin was injected, the recorded change was 107–115 RU and 116–125 RU in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively. Thus, nonmyristoylated WT-recoverin did not undergo a specific Ca2+-dependent binding to membranes, which is consistent with previous observations (14Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38Lange C. Koch K.-W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12019-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Together, these control recordings showed that a change in bulk refractive index of a protein solution is similar to the signal obtained with myristoylated recoverin forms in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, a Ca2+-dependent change in RU, which is below 70–80 RU, reflects unspecific binding to immobilized lipids. Half-maximal binding of myristoylated WT-recoverin to immobilized lipids was determined from a plot of the normalized amplitude at equilibrium (RUnorm) as a function of the recoverin concentration (Fig. 3 C). We estimated an EC50 of 26 μm for myristoylated WT-recoverin, which is similar to the value obtained by Lange and Koch (38Lange C. Koch K.-W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12019-12026Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with ROS liposomes and a different immobilization strategy. Therefore, our experiments showed that 1) a Ca2+-dependent association of recoverin with membranes can be recorded on a sensor chip surface with immobilized liposomes, 2) the association is reversible, and 3) the binding proceeds in a recoverin concentration-dependent manner with moderate affinity. These experimental observations therefore reflect the Ca2+-myristoyl switch of recoverin. We next tested by SPR spectroscopy whether myristoylated recoverin mutants bind to liposomes immobilized on a sensor chip surface by the same protocols as described above for WT-recoverin. First, binding was tested at 100 μmCa2+, 1 mm Ca2+, and no Ca2+ present and second, in the case of binding, the apparent affinity of mutants for membranes was determined. Myristoylated mutant RcE121Q showed small signals of the same amplitude at 100 μm Ca2+, 1 mm Ca2+, and 0 Ca2+ (data not shown). In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, injection of RcE121Q elicited a response of ∼80 RU. Because this maximal amplitude was identical to changes in RU obtained in control recordings, we conclude that RcE121Q does not show a Ca2+-myristoyl switch in the range of free Ca2+from 0 to 2 mm. It was impossible to monitor Ca2+-dependent binding of RcE121Qto immobilized liposomes by SPR spectroscopy at higher Ca2+concentrations like it was tested in the equilibrium centrifugation assay (above). We observed in several independent experiments that recordings at high [Ca2+] (≥1–2 mm) were less accurate than when we used lower concentrations of Ca2+. Amplitudes increased because of some nonspecific matrix effects. Myristoylated mutant RcE85Q exhibited properties different from those of RcE121Q: binding amplitudes at 100 μm Ca2+ were higher than in the absence of Ca2+, and the amplitude further increased when Ca2+ was 1 mm (for example, see Figs.4 and5 A). The amplitudes (240–250 RU) were also significantly higher than control recordings with calmodulin or protein G (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we conclude that in mutant RcE85Q, in contrast to RcE121Q, the Ca2+-myristoyl switch is operative.Figure 5Difference in dissociation kinetics of WT-recoverin and RcE85Q.

Recently we found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibited anoikis of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-signaling pathway. However, the anti-apoptotic effectors that were regulated by the ERK-signaling pathway were unknown. Here we report that HGF-mediated inhibition of anoikis was dependent on activator protein-1 activity through the activation of the ERK-signaling pathway. Using a combination of microarray analysis and Northern blot analysis, we found that an anti-apoptotic gene cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) was induced by HGF in an activator protein-1-dependent fashion. Inhibition of Cox-2 activity partially abolished HGF-mediated cell survival, and overexpression of Cox-2 in HNSCC cells provided resistance against anoikis. Moreover, HNSCC cells stably expressing Cox-2 had aggressive tumor growth in a nude mouse model compared with control cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Cox-2 plays an important role in HGF-mediated anoikis resistance. HGF may stimulate the progression and growth of HNSCC in vivo by induction of Cox-2.

HGF, 1The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; Cox-2, cyclooxygenase-2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; HNSCC, head and neck SCC; MF, mouse fibroblast; AP-1, activator protein-1; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase also known as a scatter factor, is a mesenchymal-derived cytokine that stimulates cell proliferation, migration, survival, and invasion (1–12). These diverse biological functions of HGF are mediated through its high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, c-met proto-oncogene (8Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). Importantly, a number of studies demonstrate that abnormal expression of HGF and/or c-Met is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. c-Met/HGF is found to be overexpressed in renal, breast, and prostate cancer (4Xiao G.

We found that HGF strongly suppressed anoikis in HNSCC cells, which provided a new explanation for growth and metastasis of HNSCC mediated by HGF (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we identified that HGF-induced anoikis resistance was dependent on both ERK- and Akt-signaling pathways. Inhibition of either ERK or Akt activity with a specific chemical inhibitor was sufficient to abolish HGF-mediated anoikis resistance (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the current study, we further examined the anti-apoptotic effectors, regulated by the ERK-signaling pathway, to determine which were responsible for HGF-mediated anoikis resistance. The ERK-stimulated AP-1 activity was found to be important in HGF-mediated survival. Inhibition of AP-1 activity with the dominant negative mutant of c-Jun abolished HGF-mediated survival function. Furthermore, using microarray analysis, we found that the anti-apoptotic gene Cox-2 was induced by HGF in an AP-1-dependent manner. Inhibition of Cox-2 activity with a specific chemical inhibitor NS398 attenuated HGF-mediated survival function. To extend our findings in vivo, we xenografted HNSCC cells stably expressing Cox-2 into nude mice. We found that, compared with control cells, HNSCC cells expressing Cox-2 had aggressive tumor growth in vivo. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which HGF promotes growth and progression of HNSCC. Human HNSCC cell lines UMSCC1 and other UMSCC cells were derived from SCC of the head, neck, and oral cavity at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). UMSCC1 cells, c-fos−/− and c-fos+/+ mouse neonatal fibroblasts (MFs; Ref. 31Demiralp B. Chen H. Koh A.J. Keller E.T. McCauley L.K. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4038-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A chemical inhibitor used in this study for MEK1/2 (U0126) was purchased from Promega. The cDNA encoding TAM67 was subcloned into the retroviral vector pBabe-puro. Retroviral vector encoding the full-length Cox-2 cDNA was constructed as described previously (29You Z. Saims D. Chen S. Zhang Z. Guttridge D.C. Guan K. MacDougald O.A. Brown A.M.C. Evan G. Kitajewski J. Wang C.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Retroviruses were generated by transfecting the retroviral plasmids encoding TAM67 or Cox-2 into 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method. Retrovirus-containing supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and stored at −70 °C. To stably express TAM67 or Cox-2, cells were infected with retroviruses in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene. For control, cells were infected with retroviruses expressing empty vector. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were selected with puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) for 1 week. The resistant clones were pooled, and cells expressing Cox-2 or TAM67 were confirmed by the Western blot analysis. To induce anoikis, cells were plated on 0.6% soft agar with or without HGF (40 ng/ml) (R&D Systems) in the presence of growth medium, as described previously (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Forty-eight to seventy-two hours after cell suspension, cells were harvested, and any cell aggregates were dispersed by trypsinization. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion analysis. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted. Whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1:100 protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts were subjected to 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, 1× TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C and probed with primary antibodies for 1 h and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. The immune complexes were visualized using the SuperSignal kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For internal control, the blots were stripped with Tris buffer (62.5 mm, pH 8.0) containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h and re-probed with an anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody. Primary antibodies were purchased from the following commercial sources: polyclonal antibodies against Cox-2 from Santa Cruz; polyclonal antibodies against c-Jun from Calbiochem; monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (1:7500) from Sigma; and secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG (1:7500) from Promega. UMSCC1 cells were treated with human HGF (40 ng/ml, R&D Systems) for 1 h. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen) and further purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Twenty-microgram aliquots of total RNAs were subsequently labeled with biotin as recommended by Affymetrix. cRNA was fragmented and used for hybridization to Affymetrix human U133 genechips. Data were analyzed using Affymetrix Genechip software. To confirm the results from microarray analysis, Northern blot analysis was performed. Briefly, 15-μg aliquots of total RNA were separated on a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and cross-linked with a UV cross-linker. The membranes were hybridized overnight with random-primed 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 0.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.25% Ficoll, 5 mm EDTA, and 150 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA. Probes were made with a random-primed labeling kit (AmershamBiosciences) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (ICN) and purified with a micro G-50 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization, the blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42 °C and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 42 °C. For the internal control, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. To determine tumor growth, both UMSCC1Cox-2 and UMSCC1V cells (2 × 106 cells) were injected subcutaneously into the back of 8-week-old male nude mice (Taconic). Tumor growth was monitored every 3–4 days for 40 days (32Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals (Ann Arbor, MI). Recently, we found that HGF inhibited anoikis in HNSCC cells through the activation of the ERK-signaling pathway (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We were interested in identifying the downstream anti-apoptotic effectors that were regulated by the ERK-signaling pathway. Because the AP-1 transcription factor is a direct target of the ERK-signaling pathway (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar, 34Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Xia Z. Dickens M.

Lynch K.R. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that AP-1 activity might play a role in HGF-mediated survival. Because the ERK activation can directly stimulate AP-1 activity via induction of c-fos(33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar), we performed Northern blot analysis to examine whether HGF induced c-fos expression in HNSCC cells. As shown in Fig.1, c-fos mRNAs were rapidly induced 1 h after HGF stimulation in UMSCC1 cells. Consistent with previous findings, pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor, U0126, significantly inhibited c-fos expression induced by HGF. Additionally, we also found that c-fos mRNA was induced in other HNSCC cell lines (data not shown). It is well known that c-Fos interacts with c-Jun to form a stable heterodimer that binds to AP-1 sites of the promoter region of target genes to stimulate transcription (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Next, we sought to determine whether inhibition of AP-1 activity interfered with HGF-mediated cell survival using the dominant negative mutant of c-Jun TAM67. TAM67 is a deletion mutant that lacks the transactivation domain of c-Jun. It retains DNA binding activity but fails to activate transcription (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). UMSCC1 cells were stably transduced with retroviruses expressing TAM67 or control viruses. Cells were selected with puromycin for 2 weeks, and the resistant clones were pooled. As shown in Fig.2 A, UMSCC1 cells expressing TAM67 (UMSCC1TAM67) and control cells (UMSCC1V) were obtained as confirmed by Western blot analysis. To determine whether HGF-mediated inhibition of anoikis was dependent on AP-1 transcription, both UMSCC1TAM67 and UMSCC1V cells were cultured in suspension and treated with or without HGF for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 2 B, similarly to parent cells in our previous studies (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), more than 70% of UMSCC1V cells were dead 72 h after deprivation of matrix contact, whereas only 30% of cells were dead in the presence of HGF. In contrast, regardless of HGF treatment, the majority of UMSCC1TAM67 cells were dead, indicating that HGF-mediated survival was dependent on AP-1 transcription. The role of AP-1 in apoptosis has been controversial (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). In contrast to our findings mentioned above, some studies have reported that AP-1 is involved in induction of apoptosis by stress stimuli. For example, c-Fos was persistently induced in the brains of mice treated with kainic acid, a potent activator of glutamate receptors that induces apoptosis of hippocampal neurons (37Smeyne R. Nature. 1993; 363: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). To rule out the nonspecific effect of TAM67, c-fos−/− MFs were utilized. As shown in Fig. 2 C, more than 80% of c-fos+/+ or c-fos−/− MFs were dead 48 h after a loss of matrix contact. However, cell death in c-fos+/+ MFs was significantly suppressed in the presence of HGF, whereas HGF could not provide protection against anoikis in c-fos−/− cells. Taken together, our genetic and dominant negative approaches suggest that AP-1 played an essential role in anoikis resistance induced by HGF. Next, we were interested in identifying AP-1-dependent anti-apoptotic genes induced by HGF. Because Bcl-XL has been implicated in HGF-mediated protection against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (25Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Cao Y. Laterra J.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2212-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we performed Western blot analysis to determine whether HGF modulated the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, the protein level of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and A1 remained unchanged after HGF stimulation. Additionally, the pro-apoptotic protein Bid was also unmodified by HGF stimulation in HNSCC cells. To further identify anti-apoptotic genes induced by HGF, the microarray analysis was performed. Interestingly, we found that the anti-apoptotic genecox-2 increased 4-fold upon HGF stimulation in UMSCC1 cells (Fig. 4 A). To further confirm this finding, Northern blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig.4B, Cox-2 mRNA in UMSCC1V cells was rapidly induced 1 h after HGF stimulation. However, HGF could not induce Cox-2 expression in UMSCC1TAM67 cells, indicating that Cox-2 expression was dependent on AP-1 transcription. Additionally, MEK inhibitor U0126 also inhibited Cox-2 expression induced by HGF (data not shown). Consistently, Western blot analysis also demonstrated that Cox-2 expression was induced by HGF in UMSCC1V cells but not in UMSCC1TAM67 cells (Fig.4 C).Figure 4Cox-2 expression induced by HGF is dependent on AP-1 transcription. A, Cox-2 expression in UMSCC1 cells was induced by HGF, as detected by microarray analysis. UMSCC1 cells were treated with HGF (40 ng/ml) for 1 h, and total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagents and further purified with RNeasy column. The profile of gene expression was systemically analyzed with Affymetrix U133 genechips. B, induction of Cox-2 mRNA by HGF was dependent on AP-1, as detected by Northern blot analysis. Both UMSCC1V cells and UMSCC1TAM67 cells were treated with HGF (40 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods, and total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagents. Ten-microgram aliquots of total RNA were separated on 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and blots were hybridized with the32P-labeled human Cox-2 cDNA probe. For loading control, the membrane was stripped and rehybridized with the32P-labeled human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) probe. C, induction of Cox-2 by HGF was dependent on AP-1 transcription, as detected by Western blot analysis. Both UMSCC1V and UMSCC1TAM67 cells were treated with HGF (40 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods, and whole cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer. Fifty-microgram aliquots of extracts were probed polyclonal antibodies against Cox-2 (1:1000). For internal control, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (1:7500).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cox-2 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli (38Turini M.E. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cox-2 was involved in HGF-mediated inhibition of anoikis, the specific Cox-2 inhibitor NS398 was utilized. As shown in Fig. 5 A, pretreatment of NS398 significantly attenuated HGF-mediated protection against anoikis. To rule out the nonspecific effect of NS398, we also determined whether overexpression of Cox-2 inhibited anoikis. UMSCC1 cells were stably transduced with retroviruses expressing Cox-2 or control viruses. Cells were subjected to puromycin selection for 1 week, and the stable clones were pooled to prevent clone variation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, both UMSCC1Cox-2 and UMSCC1V cell lines were established, as confirmed by Western blot analysis. Subsequently, both UMSCC1Cox-2 cells and UMSCC1V cells were deprived of matrix contact for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 5 C, more than 70% of UMSCC1V cells were dead after loss of adhesion, whereas only 40% of UMSCC1Cox-2 cells were dead, indicating that Cox-2 indeed promoted anoikis resistance. The addition of NS398 totally abolished Cox-2-mediated survival. However, the protective level of Cox-2 was relatively weaker than that of HGF, indicating that other unidentified anti-apoptotic genes induced by HGF are likely involved in HGF-mediated survival function. As listed in TableI, several other genes, some of which had previously been found to play a role in cell survival (39Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M.

We are determining whether these genes are responsible for HGF-mediated inhibition of anoikis.Table IHGF-induced genes by microarray analysisGenesDescriptionFold inductionMn-SODManganese superoxide dismutase3p21Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21)3.5junBjunB proto-oncogene5PAI2Plasminogen activator inhibitor 27VEGFVascular endothelial growth factor3IL-8Interleukin-88PDGFPlatelet-derived growth factor3AW572909Unknown3AK025862Unknown3 Open table in a new tab Cox-2 has been found to be overexpressed in human HNSCC and, thus, has been considered as an important target for chemoprevention of HNSCC (41Gallo O.

Pilz B. Dell J. Swerdel M. Kiguchi K. Muga S. Klein R. Fischer S.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2516-2521PubMed Google Scholar) generated transgenic mice that overexpressed Cox-2 under control of the human keratin 14 promoter, which allowed for expression in epidermis and some other epithelia. Unexpectedly, they found that Cox-2 overexpression protected, rather than sensitized, mice to skin tumor development induced by tumor promoters. Therefore, whether HGF-induced Cox-2 played a role in tumor development of HNSCC cells in vivo was determined. UMSCC1Cox2 cells and control UMSCC1V cells were subcutaneously xenografted into nude mice. As shown in Fig. 6 A, UMSCC1Cox-2 cells had more aggressive tumor growth in mice than control UMSCC1V cells 40 days after injection. Although both cells formed equivalent numbers of tumors at injection sites, the average size of tumors from UMSCC1Cox-2 cells was three to four times larger than that from UMSCC1V cells (Fig.6 B). These results suggest that HGF-induced Cox-2 plays an important role in the development and progression of HNSCC. Emerging evidence indicates that c-Met/HGF plays a pivotal role in tumor invasion, progression, and metastasis of HNSCC (13Uchida D. Kawamata H. Omotehara F. Nakashiro K. Kimura-Yanagawa T. Hino S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To explore the molecular mechanism by which c-Met/HGF promotes development and progression of HNSCC, we recently established an in vitro anoikis model (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We identified that the ERK-signaling pathway activated by HGF provided protection against anoikis. In the current study, we extended our previous observation and found that the ERK-dependent AP-1 activity was critical for HGF-mediated survival. Importantly, we found that AP-1-dependent anti-apoptotic Cox-2 was induced by HGF. According to our studies using a nude mouse model, our results suggest that HGF may promote HNSCC growth and development by induction of Cox-2. AP-1 is a stress-responsive transcription factor composed of members of the Jun and Fos family proteins. It can be activated by multiple extracellular stimuli including cytokines, growth factors, and UV irradiation. The role of AP-1 in apoptosis has been controversial. Both c-Jun and c-Fos have been found to be induced by multiple apoptotic stimuli. Inhibition of c-Jun or c-Fos expression has been found to protect neuronal cells and lymphoid cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal or genotoxic stimuli, indicating that AP-1 is a pro-apoptotic factor (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, there are some studies reporting that AP-1 is required for cell survival. For example, c-Jun was found to play an essential role in hepatocyte survival, and hepatocytes derived c-jun−/− embryos underwent massive apoptosis (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). AP-1 activity was also involved in protection in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated apoptosis and c-jun−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts were sensitive to TNF killing (44Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the role of AP-1 in apoptosis may be cell type- or stimulus-dependent. Because the inhibition of AP-1 activity with TAM67 abolished HGF-mediated anoikis resistance, our work suggests that AP-1 plays an anti-apoptotic role in anoikis. Additionally, our results from c-fos−/− MFs also support this conclusion. AP-1 has been implicated in tumor development and metastasis by inducing collagenase expression or promoting cell cycle progression (33Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the AP-1-mediated anti-apoptotic function is also important for the development and progression of HNSCC. Using microarray analysis, unexpectedly, Cox-2, but not the Bcl-2 proteins, was identified as an anti-apoptotic gene induced by HGF. Because Cox-2 is involved in development of many human cancers, the regulation of Cox-2 expression is under intensive investigation (38Turini M.E. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar,45Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Inves. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The promoter region of Cox-2 contains multiple NF-κB-binding sites. A great number of studies have demonstrated that the induction of Cox-2 by pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors is dependent on NF-κB transcription in monocytes and keratinocytes (38Turini M.E. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Studies by Chen et al. (46Chen W. Tang Q. Gonzales M.S. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) demonstrate that p38 kinase, but not ERK kinase, played a critical role in the regulation of Cox-2 expression induced by UVB. According to our previous study, HGF did not induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB or NF-κB transcription in HNSCC cells (26Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We also found that HGF did not induce the activation of p38 in HNSCC cells (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that Cox-2 expression induced by HGF is dependent on NF-κB or p38 in HNSCC cells. Our dominant negative approach demonstrated that Cox-2 expression induced by HGF was dependent on AP-1 transcription. Additionally, we found that inhibition of the ERK-signaling pathway also blocked the induction of Cox-2 by HGF (data not shown). These results indicate that the regulation of Cox-2 is complex and that Cox-2 can be regulated by different transcription factors and signaling pathways, which may be dependent on the tumor types. Also, this may be a reason why Cox-2 is found to be overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers. In contrast to other human cancer cell lines, many types of human HNSCC cell lines develop tumors very slowly in the ectopic subcutis compared with the orthotopic site (23Myers J. Holsinger F.C. Jasser S.A. Bekele B.N. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the tumor environment and paracrine factors produced by stromal cells in vivo may be critical for the survival and progression of HNSCC. In the current study, overexpression of Cox-2 significantly promoted HNSCC growth in the ectopic subcutis, indicating that HGF-induced genes play an important role in tumor development and progression. According to this study, the inhibition of anoikis by Cox-2 may be one of the potential mechanisms. There are many studies reporting that Cox-2 expression is associated with the progression and development of HNSCC. For example, Gallo et al. (41Gallo O. Franchi A. Magnelli L. Sardi I. Vannacci A. Boddi V. Chiarugi V. Masini E. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) evaluate the role of Cox-2 in head and neck cancers by analyzing Cox-2 expression in relation to tumor angiogenesis and lymph node metastasis. They found that Cox-2 activity was correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and protein expression. Cox-2 mRNA and protein expression was higher in tumor samples than in normal mucosa. Specimens from patients with lymph node metastasis exhibited higher levels of Cox-2 protein than specimens from patients without metastasis. Mestreet al. (42Mestre J.R. Chan G. Zhang F. Yang E.K. Sacks P.G. Boyle J.O. Shah J.P. Edelstein D. Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 889: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) also find that Cox-2 was overexpressed in HNSCC compared with adjacent control tissue, and retinoids exhibited their chemopreventive effect by inhibiting Cox-2 expression. Despite these studies, the molecular mechanism that up-regulates Cox-2 expression in HNSCC is unknown. According to the current study, the constitutive activation of the c-Met/HGF-signaling pathway may be responsible for the abnormal expression of Cox-2 in HNSCC. In this regard, the inhibition of the c-Met/HGF-signaling pathway with biological or pharmacological inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on suppression of Cox-2 activity in the treatment of HNSCC (38Turini M.E.

At present, the nature of the Glut4 storage compartment is unclear. According to one model, this compartment represents a population of preformed small vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation. Alternatively, Glut4 may be retained in large donor membranes, and insulin stimulates the formation of transport vesicles that deliver Glut4 to the cell surface. Finally, insulin can induce plasma membrane fusion of the preformed vesicles and, also, stimulate the formation of new vesicles. In extracts of fat and skeletal muscle cells, Glut4 is predominantly found in small insulin-sensitive 60–70 S membrane vesicles that may or may not artificially derive from large donor membranes during cell homogenization. Here, we use a cell-free reconstitution assay to demonstrate that small Glut4-containing vesicles are formed from large rapidly sedimenting donor membranes in a cytosol-, ATP-, time-, and temperature-dependent fashion and, therefore, do not represent an artifact of homogenization. Thus, small insulin-responsive vesicles represent the major form of Glut4 storage in the living adipose cell. Fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane may be largely responsible for the primary effect of insulin on glucose transport in fat tissue. In addition, our results suggest that insulin may also stimulate the formation of Glut4 vesicles and accelerate Glut4 recycling to the plasma membrane.

Insulin regulates postprandial blood glucose levels by reversible translocation of the glucose transporter isoform 4 (Glut4) 1The abbreviations used are: Glut4, glucose transporter isoform 4; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: Glut4, glucose transporter isoform 4; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. to the plasma membrane in fat and skeletal muscle cells (1Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this process is not completely understood. It is not known, in particular, whether insulin stimulates plasma membrane fusion of the pre-existing Glut4-containing vesicles, formation of new transport vesicles from an intracellular storage compartment, or both.Previously, we reported that, in extracts of adipose cells, the majority of Glut4 is present in two distinct populations of small membrane vesicles, one of which contains cellugyrin, whereas another lacks this protein (2Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis suggested that cellugyrin-positive vesicles transport Glut4 from early to recycling endosomes, whereas cellugyrin-negative vesicles may represent a specialized insulin-responsive population of vesicles that derive from recycling endosomes (3Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Google Scholar). These data (see also Refs. 4Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar, 5Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Google Scholar, 6Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Google Scholar) indicate that insulin-responsive 60–70 S vesicles may represent the major form of Glut4 storage in vivo. It is possible, however, that large tubular membrane structures, such as endosomes, may be artificially shattered during cell homogenization into rather homogeneous vesicular population. Therefore, it is unclear whether the Glut4 storage compartment in the living cell is represented by small vesicles or by large fragile membrane structures. To address this question, we broke rat adipocytes open without homogenization by centrifugation only. We found that endosomes were not visibly affected by homogenization and that the major pool of Glut4 was still compartmentalized in small cellugyrin-positive and -negative vesicles, which, therefore, were not likely to represent an artifact of homogenization (3Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Google Scholar).We have now established a cell-free reconstitution assay for cellugyrin-positive and -negative Glut4-containing vesicles, and we show here that these vesicles can be formed in vitro in a physiological process. This result supports our previous conclusion and suggests that small 60–70 S insulin-responsive vesicles and not large donor membranes represent the major form of Glut4 storage in the living adipose cell. In addition, we found that insulin stimulated formation of Glut4 vesicles in vitro by ∼50%. Thus, although fusion of the preformed vesicles with the plasma membrane should mainly account for the initial effect of insulin on glucose transport in adipocytes, Glut4 recycling through intracellular compartments may also be expedited by insulin.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3T3-L1 adipocytes were homogenized in a ball-bearing homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Google Scholar and 14Malide D. Ramm G. Cushman S.W. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4203-4210Google Scholar) including our own (15Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Google Scholar) demonstrate that, under basal conditions, there is practically no Glut4 in the plasma membrane. In addition, it was shown by several independent approaches that, upon homogenization of rat adipocytes, the plasma membrane has the right-side-out orientation and, therefore, cannot possibly serve as a donor compartment for the formation of any type of vesicles (12Hedo J.A. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11083-11089Google Scholar, 16Jarett L. Smith R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7024-7031Google Scholar). Although these studies were performed in primary rat adipocytes and not in 3T3-L1 cells, the plasma membrane isolated from primary and cultured adipocytes may have the same topology in vitro. The amount of Glut4 in the endoplasmic reticulum is negligibly small in comparison with its total pool (17Roh C. Roduit R. Thorens B. Fried S. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35990-35994Google Scholar). That leaves Golgi apparatus and endosomes as a possible source of Glut4 in the heavy membrane fraction.This fraction was washed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated at 4 °C or at 37 °C with and without brain cytosol and ATP regeneration system in budding buffer for the indicated periods of time. Heavy membranes were then re-pelleted at 16,000 × g for 20 min (donor fraction), and de novo formed vesicles were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. Both donor and vesicle fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1).We found that both cellugyrin and Glut4 are re-distributed from heavy membranes into the vesicle fraction in a cytosol-, ATP-, time-, and temperature-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). It is seen in Fig. 1A that the amount of Glut4 re-distributed to the vesicle fraction is directly proportional to the concentration of brain cytosol, whereas the amount of cellugyrin in this fraction reaches its maximum at 2 mg/ml cytosol and is not increased any further. Also, the yield of Glut4 in the vesicle fraction is decreased after 20 min of incubation, probably due to fusion of de novo formed vesicles with other membranes present in the reaction mixture. On the contrary, the yield of cellugyrin-containing vesicles steadily increases with time. This suggests that Glut4 and cellugyrin may be localized in different types of vesicle formation, which may be controlled by different molecular mechanisms.In agreement with this hypothesis, the sedimentational analysis shows that two types of vesicles are formed in vitro. These vesicles exactly correspond to cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative vesicles present in cell extracts (Fig. 2). Together with our previous results showing that these vesicles do not represent an artifact of cell homogenization (3Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Google Scholar, 4Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar), these data suggest that small Glut4 vesicles exist in the living adipose cell and represent the major Glut4-storing compartment in vivo. Such a conclusion is consistent with results of immunoelectron microscopy, demonstrating that, in adipocytes, Glut4 resides in small vesicles and short tubules with an average diameter of 50–70 nm (13Slot S.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Google Scholar, 18Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Google Scholar).Figure 2The sedimentational distribution of small vesicles formed in vitro and in vivois identical. In vitro formed vesicles (combined from 18 individual assays described in the legend to Fig. 1) were pooled, pelleted at 200,000 × g for 60 min, re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and fractionated in a 10–30% continuous sucrose gradient for 55 min at 48,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-55 rotor at 4 °C. 16,000 × g supernatant from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (0.55 mg) was fractionated in parallel. Each gradient was separated into 25 fractions that were analyzed by Western blotting with 1F8 antibody and with polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin. The arrow indicates the direction of sedimentation. A representative result of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It is known that vesicle budding requires GTP binding to Arf (19Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Google Scholar), so that this reaction is often stimulated in vitro by GTPγS. Indeed, we have determined that GTPγS increases recruitment of the adaptor complex AP1 onto donor membranes (results not shown). This, however, does not significantly change the yield of small vesicles (Fig. 3). We believe therefore that, under our experimental conditions, GTP-bound Arf does not limit the budding reaction. Also, addition of wortmannin does not significantly affect the formation of Glut4- and cellugyrin-containing vesiclesin vitro (Fig. 3). BFA demonstrates some inhibitory activity at concentrations that dramatically exceeds its ID50 and even LD50 in vivo (20Torii S. Banno T. Watanabe T. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11574-11580Google Scholar). Since BFA does not block the formation of Glut4 vesicles in vivo (21Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Google Scholar), a small inhibitory effect of BFA in vitro may not be specific. Aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin (Fig. 3) and Geneticin (not shown) significantly inhibit formation of vesicles, suggesting that phospholipase D may be involved in regulation of vesicle budding (see also Ref. 22Emoto M. Klarlund J.K. Waters S.B. Hu V. Buxton J.M. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7144-7151Google Scholar). In our experiments, the inhibitory effect of aminoglycosides in vitro does not exceed 50%. This may be related to the fact that these compounds not only block vesicle budding, but also inhibit vesicle fusion with endosomes (23Jones A.T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25301-25309Google Scholar), thus maintaining an equilibrium between small vesicles and donor membranes in the reaction mixture.Figure 3Formation of small vesicles in vitro in the presence of inhibitors. In vitro budding assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence (Control) and presence of wortmannin, GTPγS, BFA, or neomycin taken at indicated concentrations. In vitro formed vesicles were analyzed by Western blot with 1F8 antibody (A) and with polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin (B). The figure shows mean values ± S.E. of three independent experiments (wortmannin, GTPγS) or a representative result of three independent experiments (BFA, neomycin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We believe that our data are, in general, consistent with recent results of Lim et al. (9Lim S.-N. Bonzelius F. Low S.H. Wille H. Weimbs T. Herman G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 981-995Google Scholar) who studied the formation of Glut4-containing vesicles in vitro using brain cytosol and donor membranes from Myc-Glut4-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. In both systems, formation of Glut4 vesicles is inhibited by neomycin, whereas BFA does not have any major effect. Moreover, Limet al. (9Lim S.-N. Bonzelius F. Low S.H. Wille H. Weimbs T. Herman G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 981-995Google Scholar) also found that the yield of Glut4 vesicles formed de novo was decreased after the first 15 min of incubation due to fusion with other membranes present in the reaction mixture. A notable inconsistency in our results is that in their experiments, GTPγS powerfully inhibits vesicle budding. At present, the reason for this discrepancy is not clear.We have determined that adipocyte cytosol can support the formation of small vesicles in vitro to the same extent as brain cytosol that is routinely used in budding assays (Fig. 4). Thus, we decided to explore whether or not insulin administration has any effect on the formation of small vesicles in vitro. Since it is not known whether or not insulin changes the amount of Glut4 and cellugyrin in donor membranes, we figured that the direct comparison of vesicle formation in extracts of insulin-treated and not treated cells would be difficult to interpret. Therefore, we isolated the heavy membrane fraction and the cytosol from basal and insulin-treated adipocytes, and we used these fractions in the budding reaction in different combinations (Fig. 5). We found that insulin, indeed, stimulated the formation of Glut4 vesicles in vitro by ∼50%. A similar result was recently reported by Kristiansen and Richter (24Kristiansen S. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E374-E382Google Scholar) who studied the formation of Glut4 vesicles in the extracts of skeletal muscle cells. This increase, although rather modest in in vitro experiments, may still be indicative of a potentially larger effect in vivo, so that the stimulatory effect of insulin on vesicle budding in the living cell may be more pronounced. This hypothesis is consistent with recent results of Fosteret al. (25Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Google Scholar) who showed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, that insulin accelerates inter-endosomal traffic of Glut4 in the L6 cell line. Thus, the results obtained in vitro with the help of the vesicle reconstitution assay suggest that fusion of small preformed Glut4 vesicles with the plasma membrane may account for the initial stimulation of glucose transport by insulin in adipose cells. In addition, insulin may stimulate the formation of Glut4 vesiclesde novo and thus increase the rate of Glut4 recycling through its intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane.Figure 4Adipocyte cytosol supports the formation of small vesicles in vitro. Reconstitution assay was performed in vitro for the indicated periods of time as described in the legend to Fig. 1 in the presence of adipocyte cytosol (AC, 2 mg/ml), brain cytosol (BC, 2 mg/ml), or budding buffer (BB) alone.

Cytosol from insulin-treated adipocytes significantly increased the formation of small Glut4 vesicles from donor membranes isolated from basal (p < 0.05) and from insulin-treated (p < 0.01) cells. The effect of insulin on the formation of cellugyrin-containing vesicles was not statistically significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Insulin regulates postprandial blood glucose levels by reversible translocation of the glucose transporter isoform 4 (Glut4) 1The abbreviations used are: Glut4, glucose transporter isoform 4; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: Glut4, glucose transporter isoform 4; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. to the plasma membrane in fat and skeletal muscle cells (1Bryant N.J.

J. 1995; 307: 383-390Google Scholar), these data suggest that small Glut4 vesicles exist in the living adipose cell and represent the major Glut4-storing compartment in vivo. Such a conclusion is consistent with results of immunoelectron microscopy, demonstrating that, in adipocytes, Glut4 resides in small vesicles and short tubules with an average diameter of 50–70 nm (13Slot S.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Google Scholar, 18Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Google Scholar).It is known that vesicle budding requires GTP binding to Arf (19Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Google Scholar), so that this reaction is often stimulated in vitro by GTPγS. Indeed, we have determined that GTPγS increases recruitment of the adaptor complex AP1 onto donor membranes (results not shown). This, however, does not significantly change the yield of small vesicles (Fig. 3). We believe therefore that, under our experimental conditions, GTP-bound Arf does not limit the budding reaction. Also, addition of wortmannin does not significantly affect the formation of Glut4- and cellugyrin-containing vesiclesin vitro (Fig. 3). BFA demonstrates some inhibitory activity at concentrations that dramatically exceeds its ID50 and even LD50 in vivo (20Torii S. Banno T. Watanabe T. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11574-11580Google Scholar). Since BFA does not block the formation of Glut4 vesicles in vivo (21Martin S. Ramm G. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Stoorvogel W. James D.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 652-660Google Scholar), a small inhibitory effect of BFA in vitro may not be specific. Aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin (Fig. 3) and Geneticin (not shown) significantly inhibit formation of vesicles, suggesting that phospholipase D may be involved in regulation of vesicle budding (see also Ref. 22Emoto M. Klarlund J.K. Waters S.B. Hu V. Buxton J.M. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7144-7151Google Scholar). In our experiments, the inhibitory effect of aminoglycosides in vitro does not exceed 50%. This may be related to the fact that these compounds not only block vesicle budding, but also inhibit vesicle fusion with endosomes (23Jones A.T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25301-25309Google Scholar), thus maintaining an equilibrium between small vesicles and donor membranes in the reaction mixture.Figure 3Formation of small vesicles in vitro in the presence of inhibitors. In vitro budding assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence (Control) and presence of wortmannin, GTPγS, BFA, or neomycin taken at indicated concentrations. In vitro formed vesicles were analyzed by Western blot with 1F8 antibody (A) and with polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin (B). The figure shows mean values ± S.E. of three independent experiments (wortmannin, GTPγS) or a representative result of three independent experiments (BFA, neomycin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We believe that our data are, in general, consistent with recent results of Lim et al. (9Lim S.-N. Bonzelius F. Low S.H. Wille H. Weimbs T. Herman G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 981-995Google Scholar) who studied the formation of Glut4-containing vesicles in vitro using brain cytosol and donor membranes from Myc-Glut4-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. In both systems, formation of Glut4 vesicles is inhibited by neomycin, whereas BFA does not have any major effect. Moreover, Limet al. (9Lim S.-N. Bonzelius F. Low S.H. Wille H. Weimbs T. Herman G.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 981-995Google Scholar) also found that the yield of Glut4 vesicles formed de novo was decreased after the first 15 min of incubation due to fusion with other membranes present in the reaction mixture. A notable inconsistency in our results is that in their experiments, GTPγS powerfully inhibits vesicle budding. At present, the reason for this discrepancy is not clear.We have determined that adipocyte cytosol can support the formation of small vesicles in vitro to the same extent as brain cytosol that is routinely used in budding assays (Fig. 4). Thus, we decided to explore whether or not insulin administration has any effect on the formation of small vesicles in vitro. Since it is not known whether or not insulin changes the amount of Glut4 and cellugyrin in donor membranes, we figured that the direct comparison of vesicle formation in extracts of insulin-treated and not treated cells would be difficult to interpret. Therefore, we isolated the heavy membrane fraction and the cytosol from basal and insulin-treated adipocytes, and we used these fractions in the budding reaction in different combinations (Fig. 5). We found that insulin, indeed, stimulated the formation of Glut4 vesicles in vitro by ∼50%. A similar result was recently reported by Kristiansen and Richter (24Kristiansen S. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E374-E382Google Scholar) who studied the formation of Glut4 vesicles in the extracts of skeletal muscle cells. This increase, although rather modest in in vitro experiments, may still be indicative of a potentially larger effect in vivo, so that the stimulatory effect of insulin on vesicle budding in the living cell may be more pronounced. This hypothesis is consistent with recent results of Fosteret al. (25Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Google Scholar) who showed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, that insulin accelerates inter-endosomal traffic of Glut4 in the L6 cell line. Thus, the results obtained in vitro with the help of the vesicle reconstitution assay suggest that fusion of small preformed Glut4 vesicles with the plasma membrane may account for the initial stimulation of glucose transport by insulin in adipose cells. In addition, insulin may stimulate the formation of Glut4 vesiclesde novo and thus increase the rate of Glut4 recycling through its intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane.Figure 4Adipocyte cytosol supports the formation of small vesicles in vitro. Reconstitution assay was performed in vitro for the indicated periods of time as described in the legend to Fig. 1 in the presence of adipocyte cytosol (AC, 2 mg/ml), brain cytosol (BC, 2 mg/ml), or budding buffer (BB) alone.

Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved overnight and treated or not treated with insulin (100 nm) for 15 min. The heavy membrane fraction (Donor membranes) and cytosol were prepared from insulin-treated (+) and non-treated (−) adipocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used in reconstitution assays in different combinations. In vitro formed vesicles were analyzed by Western blot with 1F8 antibody and with polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin.

The effect of insulin on the formation of cellugyrin-containing vesicles was not statistically significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were homogenized in a ball-bearing homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Google Scholar and 14Malide D. Ramm G. Cushman S.W. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4203-4210Google Scholar) including our own (15Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25210-25217Google Scholar) demonstrate that, under basal conditions, there is practically no Glut4 in the plasma membrane. In addition, it was shown by several independent approaches that, upon homogenization of rat adipocytes, the plasma membrane has the right-side-out orientation and, therefore, cannot possibly serve as a donor compartment for the formation of any type of vesicles (12Hedo J.A. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11083-11089Google Scholar, 16Jarett L. Smith R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7024-7031Google Scholar). Although these studies were performed in primary rat adipocytes and not in 3T3-L1 cells, the plasma membrane isolated from primary and cultured adipocytes may have the same topology in vitro. The amount of Glut4 in the endoplasmic reticulum is negligibly small in comparison with its total pool (17Roh C. Roduit R. Thorens B. Fried S. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35990-35994Google Scholar). That leaves Golgi apparatus and endosomes as a possible source of Glut4 in the heavy membrane fraction. This fraction was washed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated at 4 °C or at 37 °C with and without brain cytosol and ATP regeneration system in budding buffer for the indicated periods of time. Heavy membranes were then re-pelleted at 16,000 × g for 20 min (donor fraction), and de novo formed vesicles were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. Both donor and vesicle fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1). We found that both cellugyrin and Glut4 are re-distributed from heavy membranes into the vesicle fraction in a cytosol-, ATP-, time-, and temperature-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). It is seen in Fig. 1A that the amount of Glut4 re-distributed to the vesicle fraction is directly proportional to the concentration of brain cytosol, whereas the amount of cellugyrin in this fraction reaches its maximum at 2 mg/ml cytosol and is not increased any further. Also, the yield of Glut4 in the vesicle fraction is decreased after 20 min of incubation, probably due to fusion of de novo formed vesicles with other membranes present in the reaction mixture. On the contrary, the yield of cellugyrin-containing vesicles steadily increases with time. This suggests that Glut4 and cellugyrin may be localized in different types of vesicle formation, which may be controlled by different molecular mechanisms. In agreement with this hypothesis, the sedimentational analysis shows that two types of vesicles are formed in vitro. These vesicles exactly correspond to cellugyrin-positive and cellugyrin-negative vesicles present in cell extracts (Fig. 2). Together with our previous results showing that these vesicles do not represent an artifact of cell homogenization (3Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Google Scholar, 4Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem.

However, these networks converge on a common machinery, of which the caspase cysteine proteases are key components. Diverse apoptotic stimuli release holocytochrome c from mitochondria, allowing holocytochrome c to bind apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), which in turn binds caspase-9 both activating this caspase and forming an Apaf-1/caspase-9 holoenzyme. Cytochromec lacking heme (the apo form) cannot support caspase activation, although the reason for this has not been studied. Here we show that apocytochrome c still binds Apaf-1 and that it can block holo-dependent caspase activation in a cell-free system. In addition we show that overexpression of apocytochromec blocks Bax-induced apoptosis in cells. Thus it is possible to modulate cell survival by interfering with the Apaf-1/cytochrome c interaction. Given the key role played by Apaf-1/cytochrome c in the apoptotic process, and the role of apoptosis in degenerative disease, this interaction may serve as a novel therapeutic target.

As a consequence, there are efforts to manipulate the machinery that drives the apoptotic process for therapeutic gain. Central to the death machinery are a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. These proteases are expressed as inactive precursors (zymogens) that are activated by proteolytic cleavage (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). Caspases can cleave and thereby activate other caspases, but inactive caspases can also undergo autocatalytic activation when recruited into multiprotein complexes (reviewed in Ref. 2Herr I. Debatin K.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). For example, ligands such as Fas or TNFα1 bind to their cognate receptors causing the formation of a protein complex called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that contains and activates caspase-8 (3Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) or -10 (4Wang J. Chun H.J. Wong W. Spencer D.M. Lenardo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13884-13888Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Once active these “initiators” can, in turn, activate “effector” caspases (such as caspase-3, -6, and -7) (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar) that cleave a wide range of cellular substrates (5Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). It is this second wave of proteolysis that brings about the morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis. Although in some instances caspase-8 can apparently activate capase-3 directly, in other cases caspase-8 acts indirectly by activating Bid, which releases cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Like caspase-8, caspase-2, which is activated by different apoptotic stimuli, can also generate as yet unknown factors that release cytochrome c (6Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29803-29809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In the cytosol cytochromec interacts with apoptotic proteaseactivating factor-1 (Apaf-1), which then binds and activates caspase-9 (8Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar), forming an Apaf-1/caspase-9 holoenzyme that activates the effector caspases (9Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Thus activation of the Apaf-1/caspase-9 holoenzyme may play a critical role in integrating and amplifying the signals from diverse apoptotic stimuli. Apaf-1 is a 130-kDa protein with several recognizable domains. At the N terminus there is a caspase interaction domain (or CARD) and a nucleotide binding domain, whereas at the C terminus there are a series of WD40 repeats (10Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic signals cause the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol, allowing it to bind Apaf-1. Indirect data indicate that cytochromec binds to a region within the WD40 repeats (11Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the WD40 repeats hinder caspase-9 binding by interacting with the CARD and that this inhibition is relieved by cytochrome c binding, allowing Apaf-1 to form a large complex (the apoptosome) that recruits and activates caspase-9 (13Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,14Adrain C. Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20855-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that the apoptosome contains seven Apaf-1 molecules, arranged radially, with their CARDs forming a central hub where caspase-9 binds (12Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of Apaf-1 to cytochrome c is a key step in caspase-9 activation. Cytochrome c is encoded by a nuclear gene and following synthesis, the apo form (lacking heme) is imported into mitochondria where heme lyase catalyzes heme addition, making the holoprotein.In vitro studies have shown that apocytochrome ccannot support caspase activation (15Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar), presumably a mechanism for preventing inadvertent caspase activation in cells. In mitochondria the heme group of cytochrome c allows the protein to shuttle electrons, but several studies indicate that this activity is not relevant for caspase activation. First, the redox state of cytochromec does not affect caspase activation (16Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and second; holocytochrome c in which the iron is replaced with zinc still activates caspases (17Purring-Koch C. McLendon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11928-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of cytochromec indicates that there are several sites necessary for cytochrome c-induced caspase activation (18Yu T. Wang X. Purring-Koch C. Wei Y. McLendon G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13034-13038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Kluck R.M. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Naiem S. Yaffe M.P. Margoliash E. Bredesen D. Mauk A.G.

These data suggest that the role of heme is to constrain cytochrome cstructure and so correctly present multiple binding sites to Apaf-1. It is clear that from a biological standpoint that cytochromec-dependent apoptosis can be regulated at several different stages. For example, bcl-2 blocks cytochromec release (15Yang J. Liu X.

Thus, synthetic caspase inhibitors have been used in attempts to ameliorate cell death in experimental models of several diseases (29Nuttall M.E. Lee D. McLaughlin B. Erhardt J.A. Drug Discov. Today. 2001; 6: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date the reason apocytochrome c cannot drive caspase activation has not been studied. Using a cell-free system, we show here that, although apocytochrome c cannot activate caspases, it still binds Apaf-1. Moreover, the apo form blocks caspase activation by the holo form of cytochrome c. Extending our cell-free studies, we show that overexpression of cytochrome c in cells leads to an accumulation of the apo form of cytochromec in the cytosol of transfected cells and inhibition of Bax-induced apoptosis. Thus the cytochrome c/Apaf-1 interaction may serve as a novel therapeutic target. Human Super Fas ligand, human recombinant TNFα, and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma. A rat monoclonal antibody (18H2), a gift from D. Huang (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research), against Apaf-1 was used. Monoclonal anti-caspase-9 antibody (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar, 2Herr I. Debatin K.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) was from Novus Biologicals Inc. Monoclonal antibodies against denatured (catalogue number 556433) and native (holo, catalogue number 556432) cytochrome c were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Antibody against caspase-3 (RDI-CPP32Abm) was from Research Diagnostics Inc. The human cytochrome c coding sequence was cloned into EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pHA-tat vector that provides an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tat fragment tag (pHA-tat-Cyt. c). To obtain GST-tagged forms of cytochrome c, its coding sequence was cloned into BamHI/EcoRI sites on pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). For calmodulin binding protein (CBP)-tagged forms, it was cloned into SmaI/EcoRI sites of Cal-n vector (N-terminal tag) or Cal-c vector (C-terminal tag, Stratagene). Human heme lyase cDNA was cloned intoBamHI/XhoI sites on pET 33b(+) (pET-heme lyase) for bacterial expression. pEBB-XIAP was kindly provided by Dr. C. Duckett (University of Michigan Medical School). Cytochrome c cDNA was cloned intoBamHI/NotI sites of pEBB to construct a vector that allows mammalian expression of a GST-tagged form of cytochromec. pcDNA3.1-Bax, pCMV-CD20, and pCMV-Puma were obtained from Dr. K. Vousden (Cancer Research UK, Beatson Laboratories, Glasgow, UK) BL21 bacteria was transformed with either pHA-tat-Cyt. c alone (to express the apo form) or in combination with pET-heme lyase (to express the holo form). Positive clones were selected for expression of the recombinant proteins. For cytochrome c production 80 ml of LB media was inoculated and grown overnight at 37 °C to saturation. That culture was diluted to 4 liters and grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) and incubation continued for 16 h at 30 °C. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (6000 ×g for 15 min) and resuspended in native lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and pepstatin A (all 2 μg/ml)). Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw and sonicated (3 × 10-s bursts) to sheer DNA. Tagged recombinant proteins were purified using the appropriate affinity resins (Ni2+-NTA-agarose, Qiagen; glutathione-agarose, AmershamBiosciences; calmodulin-agarose, Stratagene) according to the manufacturers' instructions followed by cation-exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose fast flow, Amersham Biosciences). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. 293 and U2-OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, in 10% CO2. 2 × 108 293 cells were used to prepare S-100 extracts essentially as described previously (30Fearnhead H.O. McCurrach M.E. O'Neill J. Zhang K. Lowe S.W. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed in PBS. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of extract buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged, and excess buffer was immediately removed. Cells were then lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain an S-100 extract (∼30 mg/ml protein by Bradford assay). 293 cell extract was depleted of endogenous cytochrome c essentially as described (31Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, extract (30 mg/ml) underwent three, 2-h rounds of batch incubation with 0.25 volume of SP-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C. After each incubation, extract was recovered by centrifugation (100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Depletion of cytochrome c was confirmed by immunoblotting and assaying for caspase activation. Equine (Sigma) or recombinant cytochrome c was then added at the indicated concentrations, and extracts were incubated with 1 mm ATP or dATP as indicated at 37 °C for 60 min. After this time caspase activity was determined by mixing 2 μl of extract with 200 μl of assay buffer (PBS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 μm Ac-DEVD-afc (BIOMOL)) and measuring the change in fluorescence (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 508 nm) at 30 °C using a Cytofluor 2000. The rate of AFC formation was used to calculate the caspase-3-like activity in the extract, expressed as AFU generated/minute. For transfection experiments, 1 × 105 U2-OS cells per 6-cm dish were seeded and incubated overnight. LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells with Bax (0.25 μg/plate), GST, or GST cytochrome c (0.5–5 μg/plate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h the incidence of apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. To test whether apocytochrome c blocked Fas- or TNFα-induced apoptosis, U2-OS cells were first co-transfected with cytochrome c and a CD20 expression vector. CD20 expression was used to assess apoptosis in only transfected cells. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with Fas ligand (10 ng/ml) for 12 h to induce apoptosis. After this time, adherent and floating cells were pooled and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. To test whether apocytochrome c blocked TNFα-induced apoptosis co-transfected U2-OS cells were treated 24 h after transfection with TNFα (10 ng/ml) + CHX (10 μg/ml) for 3 h, washed, and further incubated for 10 h with fresh medium. After this time adherent and floating cells were pooled and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Floating cells were recovered and pooled with adherent cells harvested by trypsinization. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and RNase A and stained for 30 min at room temperature. After this time the percentage of cells with hypodiploid DNA content was determined by flow cytometry. In experiments using TNFα or Fas, CD20 staining was used to identify cytochrome c-transfected cells. In this case, adherent and floating cells were pooled and incubated with anti-CD20 antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (50 μg/ml in PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then fixed with 100% methanol for 16 h and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in the presence of RNase A and the percentage of CD20-positive cells with hypodiploid DNA content determined by flow cytometry. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride, and membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 and 4% milk powder. Immunoblotting for Apaf-1 (antibody 18H2), caspase-9 (Novus antibody 1–2), caspase-3 (RDI-CPP32Abm), or cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen, 556433) was carried out using the primary antibody at 1:1000, and the appropriate secondary coupled to horseradish peroxidase was used at 1:3000. Bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). U2-OS cells were grown on glass coverslips prior to transfection with GST or GST cytochromec. 48 h post-transfection mitochondria were labeled by incubation with 100 nm of the cell permeable probe Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated with either an anti-native (diluted 1:100, recognizes only the holo form) or anti-denatured (diluted 1:100, recognizes apo and denatured holocytochrome c) cytochromec antibody. A secondary antibody coupled to Alexa Green (Molecular Probes) and diluted 1:500 in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 was used to label cytochromec. In the current model of Apaf-1-dependent caspase activation, caspase-9 binding to the caspase interaction domain of Apaf-1 is inhibited by the Apaf-1 WD40 domains. Cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1 relieves this inhibition, allowing caspase-9 to bind and autoactivate (13Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Adrain C. Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20855-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, a cell-free system was used to study the ability of cytochrome c to activate caspases. This cell-free system consists of a 293 cell extract that is depleted of endogenous cytochrome c as previously described (31Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Depletion of cytochrome c is achieved by incubating cell extracts with a cation-exchange resin; because of the basic nature of cytochromec, this protein binds the resin, whereas Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 do not (Fig. 1 A). This depleted extract has no detectable caspase-3-like activity but activates caspase-3 in a ATP/dATP- and cytochrome c-dependent fashion when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 1 B). To further investigate this mechanism our initial goal was to better define the cytochrome c binding sites on Apaf-1. To accomplish this, His-tagged forms of cytochrome c were expressed in bacteria to produce a protein to use as an affinity reagent to capture Apaf-1. Because the holo form of cytochromec is competent for caspase activation but the apo form is not, cytochrome c was either transfected alone (to produce the apo form) or co-transfected with heme-lyase (to produce the holo form) (32Pollock W.B. Rosell F.I. Twitchett M.B. Dumont M.E. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In both cases the apo form, and the holo form were expressed and affinity-purified. The purity of affinity-purified holo and apocytochrome c was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). In both cases a doublet of ∼21 kDa was observed. This is larger than the calculated molecular mass of 17 kDa but was consistently observed in over five independent preparations. In addition, the holo preparation was clearly red in color (data not shown), consistent with the addition of heme to the polypeptide. A doublet was also consistently seen in all preparations whether apo or holo was purified. Moreover, a similar doublet was observed when we prepared GST-tagged cytochromec, although in this case the doublet was ∼36 kDa as expected (data not shown). The ability of recombinant cytochromec to activate caspases while bound to their respective affinity resins was tested in a cell-free system. The holo form of cytochrome c activated caspases as well as commercially available, purified cytochrome c (Fig. 2 B). The apo form did not activate caspases as previously reported (15Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Caspase activation by the holo form indicates an interaction with Apaf-1, and this was confirmed by co-purifying Apaf-1 from the extract with tagged cytochrome c bound to nickel-agarose beads and immunoblotting for Apaf-1 (Fig. 2 C). To our surprise, we observed that, although the apo form cannot support caspase activation, it still bound Apaf-1 (Fig. 2 C). If Apaf-1 was incubated with comparable amounts of immobilized holo or apocytochromec at 4 °C the holo form bound more Apaf-1 than the apo form, indicating a difference in affinity. However, this difference was minimized if the temperature was increased to 37 °C (Fig. 2 C). Thus, under conditions where holocytochromec drives caspase activation, apocytochrome cbinds to Apaf-1 as well as holo, even though caspase activation fails. To control for effects mediated by the His6 tag, a number of other tagged forms of cytochrome c (GST andcalmodulin binding protein (CBP)) were produced, and their ability to bind Apaf-1 and activate caspases was tested (Table I). Although quantitative differences in both binding and activation were observed, qualitatively different tags did not alter how holo- or apocytochromec behaved in activation assays, i.e. holo forms promoted caspase activation while apo forms did not. In binding assays the tags did affect the amount of Apaf-1 precipitated; a C-terminal CBP tag markedly decreased the ability of apo and holocytochromec to bind Apaf-1 below the limit of detection compared with an N-terminal CBP-cytochrome c fusion protein.Table IEffect of different tags and tag position on cytochrome c ability to promote caspase activation and on Apaf-1 bindingTagApoHoloActivityBindingActivityBindingHis-tat (N-term)−++++GST (N-term)−+/−++CBP (C-term)−−+−CBP (N-term)−++++ Open table in a new tab Although apocytochrome c is unable to support caspase activation, its ability to bind Apaf-1 suggests that apocytochrome c may be able to modulate Apaf-1-dependent caspase activation. To test this possibility, the ability of the apo form to affect holo-dependent caspase activation was assessed. To accomplish this, apocytochrome c was added to extracts either before or after the extract was incubated with the holoprotein. His-tagged apocytochrome c effectively blocked holo-induced caspase-3 activation assessed using a fluorogenic substrate (Fig. 3 A) and caspase-9 processing (Fig. 3 B) when added to 293 cell extracts before incubation. In contrast, the apo forms did not inhibit caspase-3 activity if added to an extract 20 min after the holo form, when caspases had already activated (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the apocytochrome cacted on the activation step and not on activated caspases, consistent with binding to, and inhibition of Apaf-1. Furthermore, titration of the amount of apocytochrome c required for inhibition showed that the concentration of the apo form necessary for inhibition of caspase activation was less than the holocytochrome cconcentration required for activation (Fig. 4 A). Increasing the concentration of holocytochrome c decreased the ability of the apo form to block caspase activation (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that apo inhibition of Apaf-1 is reversible.Figure 4Titration of apocytochrome cinhibition of holocytochrome c promoted caspase activation. A, increasing amounts of recombinant soluble apocytochrome c were added with equine holocytochrome c (1 μm) to a 293 extract depleted of cytochrome c at the same time and incubated at 37 °C with 1 mm ATP. B, holocytochromec was titrated in a parallel assay against a fixed concentration of apocytochrome c (100 nm) (open circles) or buffer (closed circles). Caspase activity is expressed as cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-afc in arbitrary fluorescence units per minute (AFU/min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having established that the apo form bound to Apaf-1 and blocked caspase activation, in a cell-free system, we tested whether the apo form could block apoptosis in cells. To test the effect of apo on apoptosis in cells, Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 family was transiently expressed in an osteosarcoma cell line, U2-OS (which is readily transfectable). Bax can trigger cytochromec release from mitochondria (33Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consistent with this activity, Bax expression induced rapid apoptosis in U2-OS cells (assessed by quantifying the sub-G1 population after propidium iodide staining) that was blocked by expression of the caspase inhibitor XIAP (35Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Vandongen J.L. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2685-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Co-expression of GST-cytochrome c inhibited this death in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 B). This protection from death was as good as that afforded by expression of a caspase inhibitor, XIAP (Fig. 5 A). Cytochrome ctagged with green fluorescent protein also blocked Bax-induced apoptosis, although it was less efficient than GST-tagged cytochromec (data not shown). In addition, GST-cytochrome calso blocked death induced by expression of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) (data not shown), another pro-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 family (36Nakano K.

Here we show that ERK1 associates with αvβ3 integrin following the addition of platelet-derived growth factor to serum-starved Swiss or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in an interaction that is mediated by the central region of the β3 integrin cytodomain. αvβ3·ERK1 association occurred prior to focal complex formation and was seen to initiate in small punctate complexes primarily in the peripheral regions of the plasma membrane. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of ERK1 (but not ERK2) significantly reduced the spreading of cells on vitronectin, whereas cell spreading on fibronectin was unaffected by inhibition of ERK1. In contrast, inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 had no effect on the platelet-derived growth factor-regulated Rab4-dependent flux of αvβ3integrin from early endosomes to the plasma membrane, an event that is also necessary for cells to spread efficiently on vitronectin. We propose that αvβ3 integrin must recycle to the plasma membrane via the Rab4 pathway and recruit active ERK1 in order to function efficiently.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The distal stretches of many of these signaling pathways are reasonably well defined. For instance, ligation of integrins is well established to both activate the MEK/ERK1 signaling axis and to prolong the activation of the pathway in response to growth factors and thereby confer anchorage-dependent growth (2Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, precise descriptions of the upstream events in integrin signaling remain elusive. Much of the evidence that kinases associate physically with integrins is controversial. The integrin-linked kinase was identified as a ligand for the cytodomain of β1 integrin by yeast two-hybrid analysis, and engagement of β1 integrins has been shown to activate integrin-linked kinase (3Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). However, recent work inDrosophila suggests that the main function of integrin-linked kinase is that of an adaptor rather than a kinase (4Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). On the other hand pp125FAK is well established to be activated by ligation of integrins and to be a key activator of numerous downstream signaling cascades (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether pp125FAK associates physically with integrins. Recently, however, good data have been obtained indicating that the tyrosine kinase, Syk, associates with β3 integrin cytodomains, and activation of Syk by clustering of αIIbβ3integrin is likely to be a key upstream event in the activation of platelets and locomotion of hemopoietic cells (6Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Leng L. Wilsbacher J.L. Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1799-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The transmembrane and extracellular domains of integrins also form so-called “lateral associations,” and these are proposed to couple integrins to key signaling kinases. The α5β1, αvβ3, and α1β1 heterodimers associate with caveolin (7Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar), most probably via their transmembrane stretches. There is no evidence that this interaction is direct, but it is likely to be important in linking integrins to the tyrosine kinase, Fyn, and the adaptor protein, Shc. The recruitment of Shc may be a critical link between integrins and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and the regulation of anchorage-dependent growth (7Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). Integrins are now well established to form stable complexes with proteins of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (8Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These tetraspannins have been shown to bind tyrosine kinases (9Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D. Iida J. Skubitz A.P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3617-3626PubMed Google Scholar), phosphotidylinositol 4-kinase (10Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and conventional protein kinase C (11Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and the observed modulatory effects of integrin-tetraspannin complexes on adhesion-dependent signaling may involve these associations. Prior to engagement with the extracellular matrix, integrins must be rendered competent to bind ligand via a process termed “inside-out” signaling (12Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There are several ways in which the availability of ligand-competent integrin may be increased. Growth factors have recently been shown to regulate delivery of αvβ3 from endosomal compartments to the plasma membrane, and this process is necessary for efficient integrin function (13Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Once upon the cell surface, conformational changes in an individual heterodimer may increase its affinity for monovalent ligand (12Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This is well documented to be a key event in the activation of αIIbβ3 following treatment of platelets with thrombin. In addition to affinity modulation, the avidity of an integrin for a multivalent matrix ligand may be increased by regulating the clustering of active heterodimers (14Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For example, clusters of αvβ3 integrin form at early stages during cell spreading and clearly prior to the assembly of focal complexes (15Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several growth factor-activated signaling pathways have been implicated in the activation of integrins prior to focal complex assembly. For instance, the small GTPase, Rab4 regulates delivery of αvβ3 to the plasma membrane (13Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (16Nagel W. Zeitlmann L. Schilcher P. Geiger C. Kolanus J. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14853-14861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and H-Ras (17Kinashi T. Katagiri K. Watanabe S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Downward J. Takatsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22590-22596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) are clearly involved in integrin affinity modulation; and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain, has recently been shown to mediate integrin clustering (15Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the overall picture is far from complete. Clearly, any kinase or other signaling protein found to associate with an integrin shortly following cell activation but prior to its incorporation into focal complexes would be potentially of interest as a possible regulator of integrin function. To identify these proteins, we immunoprecipitated integrins from fibroblasts shortly following activation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and screened them for associated proteins that were rich in phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine. We report that following PDGF addition, active ERK1 is an abundant component of αvβ3 integrin immunoprecipitates. The association of ERK with αvβ3 forms in plasma membrane complexes prior to delivery of integrin to focal complexes. Moreover, we find that association of active ERK1 with αvβ3integrin is necessary for cells to spread effectively on vitronectin and thus may define a mechanism whereby a growth factor-activated signaling pathway can directly influence integrin function.

Cells were grown to 90% confluence, serum-starved for 30 min, and treated with PDGF (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (30 ng/ml), or lysophosphatidic acid (1 μg/ml) where appropriate. Following this, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 75 mm Tris-HCl pH 7, 15 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 7.5 mm EDTA, and 7.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1.14 μl/cm2 culture area; giving a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v) nonionic detergent following dilution of the lysis buffer in the PBS wetting the cells) and scraped from the dish with a rubber policeman. Lysates were passed three times through a 27-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, magnetic beads conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and then bound to anti-integrin or anti-His6 monoclonal antibodies. For pull-downs, anti-mouse magnetic beads were bound to mouse anti-rabbit IgG, followed by rabbit anti-GST and finally GST or GST-integrin cytodomain fusion proteins as appropriate. Antibody and fusion protein-coated beads were incubated with lysates for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing in lysis buffer, and specifically associated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% gels under reducing conditions for ERKs, the hexa-His epitope, phosphotyrosine, and phosphothreonine; 6% gels under nonreducing conditions for integrins) and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (20Norman J.C.

Cells were serum-starved for 30 min, transferred to ice, washed twice in cold PBS, and surface-labeled at 4 °C with 0.2 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin in PBS for 30 min. Labeled cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM at 22 °C for 15 min to allow internalization of tracer into early endosomes. Cells were returned to ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and biotin was removed from proteins remaining at the cell surface by incubation with a solution containing 20 mm sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MesNa) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, and 100 mm NaCl for 15 min at 4 °C. The internalized fraction was then chased from the cells by returning them to 37 °C in serum-free DMEM in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10 min. Cells were returned to ice, and biotin was removed from recycled proteins by a second reduction with MesNa. MesNa was quenched by the addition of 20 mmiodoacetamide for 10 min, and the cells were lysed in 200 mm NaCl, 75 mm Tris, 15 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 7.5 mm EDTA and 7.5 mm EGTA, 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.75% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were passed three times through a 27-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were corrected to equivalent protein concentration, and levels of biotinylated integrin were determined by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Maxisorb 96 well plates were coated overnight with 5 μg/ml anti-β3 integrin monoclonal antibodies in 0.05m Na2CO3, pH 9.6, at 4 °C and blocked in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 5% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Integrins were captured by overnight incubation of 50 μl of cell lysate at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed by extensive washing with PBS-T, and wells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase in PBS-T containing 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. Following further washing, biotinylated integrins were detected by chromogenic reaction with ortho-phenylenediamine. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and grown to 50–70% confluence over 3 days. Cells were serum-starved for 30 min and treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated times prior to fixation in PBS containing 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (PBS-FCS) for 1 h, and cells were incubated with hamster anti-mβ3 monoclonal antibody at 5 μg/ml in PBS-BSA at room temperature for 1 h. Following this, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then reblocked in PBS-FCS.

Where appropriate, the actin cytoskeleton was counterstained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were viewed on a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope, and images were presented either as an extended focus projection (using the Leica “maxproj” algorithm) of a number of optical slices encompassing the depth of the cell (as for Figs. 4 and 6) or a single Z-section optical slice (as for Fig. 5).Figure 6PD98059 inhibits association of ERK with αvβ3integrin.

Cells were transfected with Rab4 or His-ERK constructs in conjunction with a β-galactosidase-expressing marker construct and, 24 h following transfection, were harvested by trypsinization and collected by centrifugation in the presence of 20 μg/ml soyabean trypsin inhibitor. The cell suspensions were added immediately to ligand coated wells in serum-free DMEM containing 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the presence and absence of 12 μm PD98059. Cells were allowed to attach for 60 min, and nonadherent cells were removed by washing six times with PBS. Attached cells were fixed for 1 min in 0.2% glutaraldehyde containing 5 mm EGTA, and β-galactosidase-expressing cells were visualized by incubation with 5 mm potassium ferricyanide and 1 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) overnight at 37 °C. To obtain an index of cell spreading, the area of cells expressing β-galactosidase was determined by delineation of the cell envelope using the NIH Image software. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for 10 min or allowed to remain quiescent. Cells were immediately cooled to 4 °C and surface-labeled with NHS-SS-Biotin. Labeled cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.25% (v/v) Igepal, and α5β1 and αvβ3integrin heterodimers were immunoprecipitated from lysates using monoclonal antibodies to either the mouse α5 or mouse β3 integrin chains, respectively. PDGF increased the surface expression of αvβ3 (but not α5β1) by ∼2-fold (Fig. 1A), and this is consistent with our previous work documenting the rapid stimulation of αvβ3 integrin recycling following growth factor addition (13Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To gain insight into key biochemical events that occur during the early stages of focal complex assembly, we investigated the complement of cell-signaling proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with integrins shortly following treatment of cells with growth factor. Therefore, integrin immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine. In serum-starved cells, low levels of phosphotyrosine- or phosphothreonine-containing proteins coimmunoprecipitated with either α5β1 or αvβ3integrins (Fig. 1, B and C). However, following the addition of PDGF, a 44-kDa protein (p44) that was rich in both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine was particularly abundant in immunoprecipitates of αvβ3 integrin (Fig. 1, B and C). p44 was only present at low levels in α5β1 immunoprecipitates, and, moreover, there was no phosphotyrosine signal at 120 or 70 kDa, indicating that pp125FAK and paxillin were not associated with either integrin. We were, however, able to coimmunoprecipitate small quantities of a phosphotyrosine-containing protein of 190 kDa with αvβ3, and this is likely to represent association of the PDGF receptor with the integrin (21Borges E. Jan Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39867-39873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A previous report has documented the presence of the ERKs in newly forming focal complexes (22Fincham V.J. James M. Frame M.C. Winder S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2911-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Both p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 would be expected to be rich in phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine following cell activation, so we tested for the presence of these kinases in the integrin immunoprecipitates. Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes both p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 revealed that p44 comprised ERK1, and this was associated with αvβ3 only following PDGF treatment (Fig. 1 D). A small quantity of ERK1 was found to be associated with α5β1integrin; however, this was not increased by the addition of PDGF (Fig. 1 D). Interestingly, only relatively small amounts of p42 ERK2 were associated with αvβ3, indicating that recruitment of ERK1 was isoform-specific. ERK1 must be phosphorylated on both threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 to be active, and the presence of signals for phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine in p44 implied that it was indeed active ERK1. This was confirmed by Western blotting using a phosphospecific antibody that recognized ERKs only when phosphorylated at both of these positions (Fig. 1 D). The phosphotyrosine-containing protein at 60 kDa (p60; Fig. 1 B) is likely to represent a Src family kinase. We are currently investigating the identity of p60 and the significance of its association with αvβ3 integrin. We investigated the time course over which the ERK1·αvβ3 complex was established. Tyrosine phosphorylation of protein bands corresponding to the PDGF receptor (190 kDa), pp125FAK (125 kDa), and paxillin (70 kDa) was maximal ∼4 min after PDGF addition and subsided over the following 12 min (Fig. 1 E, upper panel). Recruitment of ERK1 to αvβ3 integrin was slower than this and was maximal at 8 min following PDGF addition (Fig. 1 E,lower panel). The association persisted for at least 16 min following PDGF addition (Fig. 1 E) but abated somewhat over the following hour (data not shown). PDGF, lysophosphatidic acid, and epidermal growth factor were all able to induce substantial increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins (notably of a band corresponding to pp125FAK) (Fig. 1 F, upper panel). However, of the growth factors tested in the present study, only PDGF was able to elicit appreciable recruitment of ERK1 to αvβ3 (Fig. 1 F, lower panel). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 36-kDa protein (marked p36 in Fig. 1, E andF, upper panels) was PDGF-specific and, moreover, occurred at a rate that paralleled recruitment of ERK1 to αvβ3. Preliminary data indicate that p36 is likely to be annexin II (not shown), and the possible role of this protein in the assembly of integrin-containing complexes is discussed later. To determine whether ERK1 was also able to associate with human αvβ3 and to confirm that its presence in mouse αvβ3 immunoprecipitates was not an artifactual characteristic of the antibody employed, human integrins were transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and αvβ3 was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody that was specific for the human β3integrin chain (hβ3). Surface labeling indicated that this antibody did not precipitate mouse αvβ3 (Fig. 2 A), and accordingly we were unable to detect any phosphotyrosine/phosphothreonine-containing proteins or ERKs associated with anti-human β3 monoclonal antibody-coated beads when they were incubated with lysates prepared from mock-transfected cells even following PDGF treatment (Fig. 2,B–D). Following transfection of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with the human αv and β3 integrin chains, surface-labeled proteins corresponding to the αvβ3 heterodimer were prominent in the immunoprecipitates. These displayed increased surface expression following the addition of PDGF (Fig. 2 A), although Western blotting with an antibody recognizing the hβ3 chain revealed that the total quantity of integrin present in the immunoprecipitates was unaffected (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, in transfected cells, a profile of phosphotyrosine/phosphothreonine-containing proteins, similar to that found associated with the mouse integrin, were coimmunoprecipitated with human αvβ3 following the addition of PDGF (Fig. 2, B and C), and Western blotting revealed that the 44-kDa band (p44) comprised active ERK1 (Fig. 2 D). To confirm the ability of αvβ3 integrin to recruit ERK1 in preference to ERK2 and to further test the specificity of this interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation studies on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts following transient expression of epitope-tagged ERKs. Following the addition of PDGF, recruitment of His-ERK1 to αvβ3 immunoprecipitates was seen using a monoclonal anti-His6 antibody to detect the epitope-tagged protein (Fig. 2 E). Furthermore, Western blotting with anti-hβ3 indicated that αvβ3integrin was precipitated by immunoisolation of Hi"
https://openalex.org/W1996509113,"Abstract We report the cloning, overexpression, purification, and characterization of the Leishmania majorexopolyphosphatase (LmPPX). The product of this gene (LmPPX), the first related to polyphosphate (polyP) metabolism isolated from an eukaryotic organism different from yeast, has 388 amino acids and a molecular mass of 48 kDa. LmPPX differs from other exopolyphosphatases previously investigated. Heterologous expression ofLmPPX in Escherichia coli produced a functional enzyme that was similar to the yeast exopolyphosphatase with respect to its Mg2+ requirement, optimum pH, and sensitivity to cations, amino acids, and heparin but that, in contrast to the yeast enzyme and other exopolyphosphatases investigated before, acts on polyP of short chain lengths with higher rates and affinity. LmPPX is a processive enzyme, and it does not hydrolyze pyrophosphate, ATP, orp-nitrophenylphosphate. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified antibodies against the recombinant enzyme indicated an acidocalcisomal and cytosolic localization. High levels of short chain (21.4 ± 3.0 mm) and long chain polyP (55.9 ± 5.6 mm) were detected in L. major promastigotes. The unique characteristics of LmPPX andL. major polyP metabolism may facilitate the development of novel antileishmanial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2149707185,"We investigated the regulation of the proteolytic activity of human adamalysin 19 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 19, hADAM19). It was processed at Glu586(P1)-Ser587(P1′) site in the cysteine-rich domain as shown by protein N-terminal sequencing. This truncation was autolytic as illustrated by its R199A/R200A or E346A mutation that prevented the zymogen activation by furin or abolished the catalytic activity. Reagents that block furin-mediated activation of pro-hADAM19, decRVKR-CMK, A23187, and brefeldin A abrogated this processing. The sizes of the side chains of the P1 and P1′ residues are critical for the processing of hADAM19. The amount of processing product in the E586Q or S587A mutant with a side chain almost the same size as that in the wild type was almost equal. Conversely, very little processing was observed when the size of the side chain was changed significantly, such as in the E586A, E586G, or S587F mutants. Two mutants with presumably subtle structural distinctions from wild type hADAM19, E586D and S587T, displayed rare or little processing and had very low capacities to cleave α2-macroglobulin and a peptide substrate. Therefore, this processing is necessary for hADAM19 to exert its proteolytic activities. Moreover, a new peptide substrate, Ac-RPLE-SNAV, which is identical to the processing site sequence, was cleaved at the E-S bond by soluble hADAM19 containing the catalytic and disintegrin domains. This enzyme cleaved the substrate with Km, kcat, andkcat/Km of 2.0 mm, 2.4/min, and 1200 m−1min−1, respectively, using a fluorescamine assay. Preliminary studies showed that a protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, promoted the cellular processing of hADAM19; however, three calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine, W7, and calmidazolium, impaired this cleavage, indicating complex signal pathways may be involved in the processing.

Ectodomain shedding is a process in which a wide variety of transmembrane proteins, such as growth factors and growth factor receptors, cytokines and their receptors, amyloid precursor protein (APP), 1The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid precursor protein; Ab, antibody; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs; α2-M, α2-macroglobulin; CaM, calmodulin; decRVKR-CMK, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDC, metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; MT-MMPs, membrane-type MMPs; NRG, neuregulin; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TACE, tumor necrosis factor α convertase; TAPI, tumor necrosis factor-α proteinase inhibitor; TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor- α; TRANCE, TNF-related activation-induced cytokine; W7, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide. 1The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid precursor protein; Ab, antibody; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs; α2-M, α2-macroglobulin; CaM, calmodulin; decRVKR-CMK, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDC, metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; MT-MMPs, membrane-type MMPs; NRG, neuregulin; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TACE, tumor necrosis factor α convertase; TAPI, tumor necrosis factor-α proteinase inhibitor; TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor- α; TRANCE, TNF-related activation-induced cytokine; W7, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide. adhesion molecules, and enzymes, proteolytically release their extracellular domains.

Although the signal pathways regulating ectodomain shedding remain poorly understood, numerous studies have shown that structurally different proteins share common pathways (5Hooper N.M. Karran E.H.

Other signals, such as calcium, calmodulin (CaM), tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatase, also play roles in certain shedding processes (9–23). On the other hand, the shedding process, in most cases, is hindered by hydroxamate-based inhibitors of metalloproteinases, such as BB94, GM6001, and tumor necrosis factor-α proteinase inhibitor (TAPI) (5Hooper N.M.

Inhibitor studies have shown that TIMP-3, not TIMP-1 or TIMP-2, impairs many shedding processes, indicating that the proteins comprising theadisintegrin andmetalloprotease (ADAM)/adamalysin/metalloprotease, disintegrin,cysteine-rich (MDC) family, rather than the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, are the predominant sheddases (27Borland G.

ADAM17/TACE, a major sheddase, has a role in the shedding of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), l-selectin, both TNF receptors, interleukin-1 receptor II, HER4, Notch, and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE). It also acts as a PMA-induced APP α-secretase (1Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Google Scholar, 2Kheradmand F. Werb Z.

It can cleave the Notch ligand Delta, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), TNF-α, L1 adhesion molecule, and ephrin A2 and is an APP α-secretase (1Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J.

ADAM9 is believed to participate in the PMA-stimulated shedding of HB-EGF (34Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Google Scholar) and can function as an APP α-secretase (35Koike H. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Okuyama A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 371-375Google Scholar). ADAM19/MDC β has been linked to shedding of the epidermal growth factor receptor-ligand neuregulin-β1 (36Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Google Scholar). ADAM12/MDC α has recently been shown to be responsible for endogenous shedding of HB-EGF in the heart (37Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Google Scholar). In addition, MMP7 has a functionally relevant role in shedding of TNF-α and FasL (38Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J.

However, not many proteinases responsible for ectodomain shedding of proteins have been identified. Adamalysin 19/ADAM19/MDC β, cloned from mice (42Inoue D. Reid M. Lum L. Kratzschmar J. Weskamp G.

Ruben S. Sang Q.-X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 744-755Google Scholar), is a type I membrane-bound protein containing the basic domains of ADAMs, such as the prodomain, metalloprotease and disintegrin domain, cysteine-rich domain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain (3Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Google Scholar). In addition to the processing of neuregulin (NRG) (36Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Google Scholar), human adamalysin 19 (hADAM19) is believed to play a role in osteoblast differentiation, in the distinction between macrophages and dendritic cells, and as a marker for the differentiation and characterization of dendritic cells (44Fritsche J. Moser M. Faust S. Peuker A. Buttner R. Andreesen R. Kreutz M. Blood. 2000; 96: 732-739Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that hADAM19 is activated by furin in the secretory pathway and that the intracellular removal of the prodomain is required for its proteolytic activity, which was assessed with an α2-macroglobulin (α2-M) trapping assayin vitro (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar). Emerging evidence indicates that metalloproteinase activity is regulated by the process of shedding or truncation, as in the cases of MT1-MMP, MT5-MMP, ADAM13, and ADAMTS4 (40Toth M.

Here we show that autolytic processing at Glu586 ↓ Ser587 of hADAM19 within its cysteine-rich domain is required for its endopeptidase activity and that efficient processing of hADAM19 is mainly dependent on the sizes of both Glu586 and Ser587. We also show that PKC, CaM, and calcium signals may regulate the hADAM19 processing, which is not sensitive to GM6001 or TIMP-3. Moreover, we present a peptide substrate that mimics the processing site and may be used to determine the activity of soluble hADAM19 by a fluorescamine assay. All common laboratory chemicals, proteinase inhibitors, PMA, trifluoperazine,N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W7), calmidazolium, PD98059, wortmannin, LY290042, pervanadate, and anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and its agarose conjugates were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The CMK-based furin inhibitor, dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (decRVKR-CMK), and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, ilomastat (GM6001), were purchased from Bachem (Philadelphia, PA). TIMP-3 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) or Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). COS1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and its derivatives were maintained as described (45Wei P. Zhao Y.-G. Zhuang L. Ruben S. Sang Q.-X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 744-755Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Fetal bovine serum, penicillin G, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). α2-M was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Rabbit polyclonal hADAM19 antibodies pAb361 (anti-metalloproteinase domain, anti-Cat) and pAb362 (anti-disintegrin domain, anti-Dis) were generated by our laboratory as reported previously (50Zhao Y.G. Wei P. Sang Q.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 288-294Google Scholar). All inserts tagged with FLAG at their C terminus were cloned into pCR3.1uni, including wild type hADAM19 (F46), soluble hADAM19 (D52),199RA-D (described in Ref. 46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar), and all mutants used in this study. The primer sequences for full-length (E346A-F) and soluble (E346A-D) Glu346 → Ala mutants were: forward primer, 5′-C ATG GCC CAC GCG ATG GGC CAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTG GCC CAT CGC GTG GGC CAT G-3′. For deletion from the cysteine-rich domain to the end of the C terminus (D-CR): forward primer, 5′-ACC ATG CCA GGG GGC GCA GGC GCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGT ACC ATC CAT CTG GTA GAA G-3′.

COS1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates for 16–24 h at 80% confluence and transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE2000 according to the instructions provided by Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). After 6–10 h, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and the indicated reagents were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 24 h. The conditioned media and cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar). The same transfection procedure was performed to generate stable MDCK cell lines, and the selection for hADAM19 was begun in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) after transfection for 24 h. The conditioned media and/or cell lysates of the clones were subjected to Western blotting to confirm the expression of hADAM19 (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out as described previously (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 80% confluence and were treated as indicated. After centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C to clear any debris, the serum-free media were collected and prepared for SDS-PAGE. The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μmGM6001, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E64, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 15 min on ice. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, probed with anti-FLAG-M2 or anti-hADAM19, and developed as before (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar). All proteins were purified on anti-FLAG-M2 affinity columns as described previously (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar); however, HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 25 μmZnCl2, 0.05% Brij-35) was used instead of TBS buffer for the purpose of determining the activity of hADAM19 by a fluorescamine assay. Briefly, cells from stable lines expressing soluble hADAM19, D52-5, E586D-D, S587T-D, and d-CR, were grown to 100% confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 48 h. in serum-free media. The conditioned media were collected, centrifuged to clear any debris, and loaded onto an anti-M2 immunoaffinity column (1 ml of resuspended agarose) that had been prewashed with HEPES buffer. The bound materials were extensively washed with HEPES buffer, eluted with FLAG peptides, and collected in 500-μl fractions. The fractions were analyzed by Western blot using anti-hADAM19 antibodies or anti-FLAG-M2, and the protein was quantified by its UV absorbance at 280 nm. The fractions containing the most wild type or mutant hADAM19 proteins were used for the α2-M trapping assay and fluorescamine assay. In the case of D52-5, the most concentrated fraction was also prepared for protein N-terminal sequencing to determine the shedding site. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the samples were transferred to a PVDF membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. After destaining, the hADAM19 bands were excised and sent to Margaret Seavy at the Bioanalytical Core Facility at the Florida State University for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The detailed experimental procedure was previously reported (46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar, 50Zhao Y.G. Wei P. Sang Q.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 288-294Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of purified wild type and mutated soluble hADAM19 were mixed with 24 μl of α2-M (0.2 unit/ml), respectively, adjusted to a total volume of 100 μl with HEPES buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. A 20-μl aliquot of the mixture was removed at the indicated times, put in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled. Following SDS-PAGE, the protein bands in the gels were visualized by silver staining. The N-terminal acetylated peptide (Ac-RPLESNAV) was synthesized by Dr. Umesh Goli at the Biochemical Analysis, Synthesis, and Sequence Service Laboratory at Florida State University. The stock solutions of the peptide substrates were prepared in 0.05 mHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01 mCaCl2, and 0.01% Brij-35. The peptide concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 4.0 mm, and the enzyme concentration was 160 nm. N-terminal sequencing for this released peptide was performed after overnight hydrolysis by the enzyme. Hydrolysis of the peptide by the enzyme was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity (51Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.-X. Moore W.G.I. Narve M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Google Scholar). After incubation for the indicated times, the hydrolytic reaction was quenched by adding 20 μl of 100 mm1,10-phenanthroline into 100 μl of reaction mixture. For the control sets, the 1,10-phenanthroline solution was added at the start of incubation. After the reaction was quenched, 100 μl of 0.1% fluorescamine in 10% Me2SO/90% assay buffer was added into each reaction mixture. Relative fluorescence of the product coupled with fluorescamine was determined on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 386 nm and an emission wavelength of 477 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were both 10 nm. Relative fluorescence was converted to nanomoles of product using a standard curve obtained with arginine. The final solution was diluted further with the assay buffer, if it was necessary. The values of kcat andKm were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. A molar extinction coefficient of 33,120m−1 cm−1, which was calculated by using Genetic Computer Group (GCG) software, was used to determine the concentration of soluble hADAM19. Shedding or truncation is increasingly being recognized as a key regulator of the activity of some metalloproteinases (40Toth M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Osenkowski P. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Shimura Y. Meroueh O. Kotra L.P. Galvez B.G. Arroyo A.G. Mobashery S. Fridman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26340-26350Google Scholar, 47Wang X. Pei D. J. Biol.

Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11043Google Scholar). It was intriguing to investigate the possibility of shedding or truncation in hADAM19. As shown in Fig. 1A, in addition to the pro and active forms of hADAM19, we detected a doublet of protein of about 58 kDa by anti-FLAG-M2 in the lysate of the transfected COS1 cells expressing full-length hADAM19 with C-terminal FLAG tags (F46). We did not detect the doublet using antibodies against the catalytic and disintegrin domains of hADAM19, indicating that the 58-kDa protein is the processed C-terminal fragment lacking the metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains of hADAM19. On the other hand, another doublet of around 72 kDa was detected in the same lysate by these two hADAM19 antibodies but not anti-FLAG-M2 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the 72-kDa protein is the processed N-terminal fragment containing the metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains of hADAM19. Taken together, a cellular processing occurs in hADAM19 after its disintegrin domain in the COS1-transfected cells. Notably, the doublets result from different forms of glycosylation as verified by glycosidase F treatment (Ref. 46Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Google Scholar and data not shown). To probe the domain in which the processing occurs, we made two deletion forms of hADAM19 with C-terminal FLAG tags, soluble hADAM19 (D52), which lacked the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain, and a form that lacked the cysteine-rich domain through the cytoplasmic domain (D-CR) (see Fig. 4). When D52 and D-CR were transfected into COS1 cells, we were able to detect several proteins in the conditioned media using both anti-FLAG-M2 and the antibody against the disintegrin domain, including the soluble pro and active forms of hADAM19. However, a 26-kDa protein in the conditioned medium from D52-transfected cells was clearly detectable using anti-FLAG-M2, but not the disintegrin domain antibody, suggesting that the 26-kDa protein is the processed C-terminal fragment of soluble hADAM19. In contrast, a doublet at 60–65 kDa was detected in the medium by the anti-disintegrin domain antibody, but not anti-FLAG-M2, indicating that the 60- to 65-kDa protein is the processed N-terminal fragment of soluble hADAM19 (Fig. 1B). There were no additional proteins detectable in the conditioned medium from the cells transfected with D-CR (data not shown); therefore, the processing of hADAM19 might be accounted for by shedding within its cysteine-rich domain.Figure 4A schematic illustration of the wild type expression vector pCR3.1hADAM19 and its mutant constructs.

https://openalex.org/W2089474349,"Abstract LIGHT is a member of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, and its receptors have been identified as lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM)/ATAR/TR2, both of which lack the cytoplasmic sequence termed the “death domain.” The present study has demonstrated that LIGHT inhibits TNFα-mediated apoptosis of human primary hepatocytes sensitized by actinomycin D (ActD), but not Fas- or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, LIGHT does not prevent some cell lines such as HepG2 or HeLa from undergoing ActD/TNFα-induced apoptosis. This protective effect requires LIGHT pretreatment at least 3 h prior to ActD sensitization. LIGHT stimulates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcriptional activity in human hepatocytes like TNFα. The time course of NF-κB activation after LIGHT administration is similar to that of the pretreatment required for the anti-apoptotic effect of LIGHT. LIGHT inhibits caspase-3 processing on the apoptotic protease cascade in TNFα-mediated apoptosis but not Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, increased caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in ActD/TNFα-treated cells are effectively blocked by LIGHT pretreatment. However, LIGHT does not change the expression of TNFRp55, TNFRp75, and Fas. These results indicate that LIGHT may act as an anti-apoptotic agent against TNFα-mediated liver injury by blocking the activation of both caspase-3 and caspase-8."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Mutations in TGF-β receptors or their intracellular signaling molecules have been described in association with tumorigenesis and the human disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is an autosomal dominant disease in which the primary defect is vascular dysplasia resulting in telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations. Clinically this disorder results in telangiectases of the skin, recurrent epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding as well as shunting phenomena and neurological sequela because of arteriovenous malformations in the pulmonary and central nervous system (2Guttmacher A.E. Marchuk D.A. White R.I., Jr. New Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The pathological lesions of HHT consist of dilated vessels, lined by a single layer of endothelium attached to a continuous basement membrane, that are thought to form from dilation of postcapillary venules. Genetic linkage studies of families with HHT identified the genes for two receptors in the TGF-β family, endoglin and ALK-1 (a type I receptor in the TGF-β family) as the genes responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-1 and -2, respectively (3McAllister K.A. Grogg K.M. Johnson D.W. Gallione C.J. Baldwin M.A. Jackson C.E. Helmbold E.A. Markel D.S. McKinnon W.C. Murrell J. et al.Nat.

Endoglin and ALK-1 are expressed specifically on endothelial cells, and endoglin production is increased in proliferating endothelium (5Burrows F.J. Derbyshire E.J. Tazzari P.L. Amlot P. Gazdar A.F. King S.W. Letarte M. Vitetta E.S. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1623-1634PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking endoglin or ALK-1 died at embryonic day 10.5–11.5 because of defects in angiogenesis (6Li D.Y. Sorensen L.K. Brooke B.S. Urness L.D. Davis E.C. Taylor D.G. Boak B.B. Wendel D.P.

Histochemical studies of the embryos revealed primary defects in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the developing blood vessels, confirming an essential role for these TGF-β receptors in angiogenesis. ALK-1 and endoglin mutations in HHT result in similar phenotypes: both have similar affinity and specificity for TGF-β (with preference for the TGF-β1 and -3 isoforms) and have been shown to associate with one another, suggesting that both receptors transduce similar signals essential for endothelial cell function (11Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the signaling pathway downstream from these receptors is unknown. To establish the signaling pathway downstream of ALK-1 and endoglin, yeast two-hybrid screens utilizing the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors were performed. Here we report the identification of the nuclear receptor LXRβ as a protein that specifically binds to the cytoplasmic domain of activated ALK-1. ALK-1 alters LXRβ cellular localization and phosphorylates LXRβ, primarily on serine residues, and LXRβ is able to modulate ALK-1 signaling, establishing LXRβ as a potential member of the ALK-1 signaling pathway. The mating system of James, Halladay, and Craig was utilized (12James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a human lung library (Clontech) was screened with baits composed of the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 and mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 (ALK-1-Q200D and ALK-K229R) cloned into pGBD, in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Yeast containing bait and the prey library cloned in pGAD, in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain, were mated overnight in YPAD (yeast extract, peptone, adenine, and dextrose) media at 30 °C, plated on Trp−, Leu−plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days to select for yeast containing both bait and prey vectors. Colonies were replica-plated on His− or His−, Ade− plates to assay for interaction as assessed by growth under these conditions. Interacting clones were tested for ability to repeat, bait, and prey dependence and specificity with other baits (lamin, myc, endoglin, ALK-2) to screen out false positives. Clones that passed these screens were sequenced and further analyzed. Appropriate strains of yeast (a strain for bait, α strain for library) were transformed with pGBD control vector or pGBD-ALK-1, -ALK-1Q-D, -ALK-1K-R, -ALK-2, or -END (containing the cytoplasmic domain of these respective proteins) and pGAD-LXRβ (encoding LXRβ lacking the first 14 amino acids). These yeast were mated overnight in YPAD media at 30 °C, plated on Trp−, Leu− plates, and incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days to allow diploid cells to form visible colonies. Colonies were replica-plated on His−, Ade− plates to assay for interaction as indicated by colony growth. COS-7 or 293T cells expressing HA- or FLAG-tagged LXRβ or HA-tagged LXRα were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and precleared with glutathione-agarose beads. Equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with GST fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 (GST-ALK-1), activated ALK-1 (GST-ALK-1Q-D), or GST alone complexed with glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. Binding proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with αHA or αFLAG antibody as appropriate. THP-1 macrophage cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% leupeptin. The lysates was precleared by centrifugation, and 500-μl aliquots were incubated with polyclonal preimmune serum, polyclonal αALK-1 antibody (made to the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1, peptide KREPVVAVAAPASSESSST), or αLXR antibody (Affinity BioReagents) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were harvested by addition of Protein A beads. The pellets were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. 50 μl of 2× sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled and loaded on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by Western blot analysis with αALK-1 antibody. Transfected HEK-293 cells were split onto collagen-coated 35-mm plastic dishes with glass bottoms (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and cultured overnight. GFP images were generated and collected using single line excitation (488 nm) and a 505-nm emission filter with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510). COS-7 cells were transfected with various TGF-β receptors and HA-tagged LXRβ or -α. After 48 h, the cells were washed in phosphate-free medium and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1.0 mCi/ml) for 4 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with RIPA lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with αHA antibody and Protein G-Sepharose, and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels; phosphorylation was detected by phosphoimager analysis of the dried gels. In vivo 32P-labeled LXRβ was immunoprecipitated with αHA antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was washed, and the 32P-labeled LXRβ was detected by autoradiography and excised from the membrane. The protein was hydrolyzed to completion by placing in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 1 h, dried down, resuspended, and spotted on a TLC plate along with unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards. The TLC was wet with 66% (pH 1.9, electrophoresis buffer (0.58 m formic acid, 1.36m acetic acid)): 34% (pH 3.5, electrophoresis buffer (0.5% (v/v) pyridine, 0.87 m acetic acid, 0.5 mm EDTA)) and electrophoresed for 1 h at 1.5 kV. The plate was dried at 50 °C, sprayed with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone, reheated to visualize the standards, and then analyzed by phosphoimager analysis. In vivo 32P-labeled LXRβ was resolved by SDS-PAGE, detected by autoradiography, and excised from the dried gel. The gel was rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.3, and the proteins were serially extracted by addition of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% SDS until over 60% of labeled protein was extracted by Cerenkov counting. 20 μg of Rnase (carrier protein) was added; the mixture was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, oxidized in cold performic acid, dried, and digested overnight in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. with 10 μg of trypsin. The digested peptides were lyophilized, resuspended in pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer: pH 3.5 electrophoresis buffer (2:1), and spotted on a TLC plate. The TLC was electrophoresed in the first dimension for 20 min at 1.0 kV, then air dried, rotated 90° counterclockwise, and separated in the second dimension by chromatography in standard chromatography buffer until the buffer was 2 cm from the top of plate. The plate was dried at 65 °C and analyzed by phosphoimager analysis. P19 or L6 cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 20,000 cells/ml 1 day prior to transfection. The cells were transiently transfected using FuGene 6 reagent (Roche) with 300 ng/well of total DNA (100 ng of XVent-Lux or pE2.1-Lux, 100 ng of LXRβ or -α expression vectors, and 100 ng of ALK-1 Q-D or -2 Q-D expression vectors). The following morning the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and were immediately incubated in α-MEM (minimum essential medium) with 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 18–24 h at 37 °C. Afterward, cells were lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) and 25 μl used for luciferase assays (Promega). Data are from experiments done in triplicate and are presented as the mean -fold stimulations (± S.E.) of the luciferase induced by ALK-1 Q-D or -2 Q-D relative to samples transfected with control vector. To elucidate potential downstream signaling molecules for ALK-1, the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 was utilized as a bait to screen for interacting proteins with the yeast two-hybrid system of James, Halladay, and Craig (12James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial screens of a murine embryonic library (day 10.5) and a human lung library with the entire cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 did not yield any specific clones, whereas screens with the entire cytoplasmic domain of ALK-2 done in parallel revealed numerous clones of FKBP12 as has been previously reported (13Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 contains a serine/threonine protein kinase and constitutively active ALK-1 has been reported to activate BMP-responsive promoters (14Macias-Silva M.

The ALK-1 K229R bait again did not yield any specific clones; however, the screen with the ALK-1 Q200D bait yielded 17 specific clones. Three of these isolates encoded two separate clones, both encompassing nearly the entire open reading frame of the nuclear receptor LXRβ (Fig. 1 A). LXRβ has been previously identified as an orphan nuclear receptor that forms obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor to bind and regulate promoters with a unique hormone response element (LXRE) (16Shinar D.M.

LXRβ contains an amino-terminal PEST domain followed by a DNA binding domain and then a ligand binding domain containing an activation function (AF-2) (Fig. 1 A). More recently the oxysterols 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S) hydroxycholesterol, have been identified as potential endogenous ligands for LXRβ and the closely related nuclear receptor LXRα (21Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

In addition, LXRα has been established as a sensor of dietary cholesterol, consistent with its restricted expression in tissues rich in lipid metabolism (23Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of LXRβ, which is ubiquitously expressed, remains to be established. Significantly, unlike LXRα knockout mice, LXRβ knockout mice lack a metabolic/lipid metabolism phenotype (24Alberti S. Schuster G. Parini P. Feltkamp D. Diczfalusy U. Rudling M. Angelin B. Bjorkhem I. Pettersson S. Gustafsson J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Association of ALK-1 Q200D with LXRβ was specific because LXRβ was not isolated in screens with ALK-1, -1 K229R, or -2 (data not shown). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 Q200D could interact with LXRβ in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, whereas the cytoplasmic domains of ALK-1, -1 K229R, -2, or endoglin could not (Fig. 1 B). To confirm the interaction of ALK-1 with LXRβ, GST fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 and -1 Q200D and an HA-tagged LXRβ lacking the first 14 amino acids of the coding sequence (corresponding to the longer yeast two-hybrid clone isolated, Fig. 1 A) were made. HA-tagged LXRβ was efficiently expressed in COS-7 cells and was specifically pulled down by GST-ALK-1 Q200D as well as by GST-ALK-1 (Fig. 1 C, top panel, lanes 7 and8) but not by GST alone (Fig. 1 C, lane 6). The interaction between ALK-1 and LXRβ in the GST affinity binding assay was unexpected because this interaction could not be detected in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that ALK-1 may be activated in mammalian cell extracts. To further investigate the interaction of ALK-1 and LXRβ, a FLAG-tagged (amino-terminal) full-length LXRβ was made and utilized in the GST affinity binding assay. FLAG-tagged LXRβ was efficiently expressed in 293T cells and specifically pulled down by GST-ALK-1 Q200D (Fig. 1 C, second panel, lane 8) but not by GST-ALK-1 or GST alone (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6 and7), suggesting that the first 14 amino acids of LXRβ may regulate the interaction of ALK-1 and LXRβ. Next, the interaction of ALK-1 with the closely related nuclear receptor, LXRα, was assessed. Neither GST-ALK-1 Q200D nor -ALK-1 was able to pull down LXRα (Fig. 1 C, top panel, lanes 3 and4). Taken together these results confirm a specific interaction between ALK-1 and LXRβ in vitro. To determine the regions important for the interaction between ALK-1 and LXRβ, we examined the sequences of each protein for potential interaction motifs. This examination revealed an LXXLL motif in the cytoplasmic domain of ALK-1 (amino acids 174–178) known to mediate interaction of proteins with the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors (25Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether this LXXLL motif was responsible for mediating interaction of ALK-1 with the AF-2 of LXRβ, the LXXLL motif was mutated in GST-ALK-1 Q200D and the mutant assessed for interaction with full-length LXRβ. Mutation of LXXLL (LGDLL to LAAAA) of ALK-1 did not alter the ability of ALK-1 Q200D to bind LXRβ (data not shown). In addition, mutation or deletion of the AF-2 of LXRβ did not alter the ability of LXRβ to bind ALK-1 Q200D (Fig. 1 C,third panel, lanes 7 and 8, data not shown), confirming that these were not the regions responsible for interaction of ALK-1 and LXRβ. We then analyzed the ability of specific regions of LXRβ to bind to ALK-1 Q200D in vitro. These studies revealed that the ligand binding domain of LXRβ (amino acids 286–461) was unable to bind ALK-1 Q200D in vitro(data not shown), suggesting that the binding motif resides in the first 286 amino acids of LXRβ. Attempts to directly confirm binding of amino acids 1–286 of LXRβ containing the DNA binding domain were unsuccessful because constructs of LXRβ (amino acids 1–286) could not be stably expressed (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether this interaction occurred in vivo and without overexpression of ALK-1 and LXRβ (i.e. with physiological levels of expression of ALK-1 and LXRβ), we screened cells known to express LXRβ for expression of ALK-1. This survey revealed that the THP-1 macrophage cell line known to express LXRβ (26Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Goodwin B. Galardi C.M. Maglich J.M. Wilson J.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43509-43515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) also expressed ALK-1 (Fig. 1 D,lane 2). Therefore, we used the THP-1 cell line to perform co-immunoprecipitation studies with antibodies to LXRβ and ALK-1. An antibody to LXRβ was able to co-immunoprecipitate ALK-1 in THP-1 cell lysates (Fig. 1 D, lane 3), whereas preimmune serum was not (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). Conversely, an antibody to ALK-1 co-immunoprecipitated LXRβ in THP-1 cell lysates (data not shown). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a physiological interaction between ALK-1 and LXRβ. Because the nuclear receptor LXRβ is thought to reside primarily in the nucleus and ALK-1 is a membrane-bound receptor, we explored how these receptors might interact in vivo. To address this issue, we examined the localization of LXRβ in vivo. We constructed and expressed a GFP fusion protein of LXRβ in HEK-293 cells with or without ALK-1 Q-D and examined localization of GFP-LXRβ in live cells by confocal microscopy. In the absence of ALK-1, GFP-LXRβ was predominately, but not exclusively, expressed in the nucleus in most cells (Fig. 2, A andB), whereas GFP alone was uniformly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm as previously reported (27Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (data not shown), and β−arrestin 2-GFP was expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 G). However, in some cells in the absence of ALK-1 (∼5%), GFP-LXRβ was more uniformly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of ALK-1 Q-D, localization was altered so that GFP-LXRβ was predominately expressed in the nucleus in only a minority of cells (∼20%), (Fig. 2 D), whereas in the majority of cells, GFP-LXRβ was uniformly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2 E). In addition, in some cells (∼5%), a predominant membrane localization of GFP-LXRβ was observed (Fig. 2 F,arrow), suggesting that ALK-1 Q-D results in a nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of LXRβ and that ALK-1 has access to LXRβ in the cytoplasm. To investigate the potential physiological relevance of the interaction of ALK-1 and LXRβ, we surveyed the expression patterns of ALK-1 and LXRβ by performing virtual Northern blot analysis of SAGE and EST databases and by examining published Northern blot analysis of ALK-1 (28Attisano L.

These surveys confirmed that LXRβ is widely expressed, whereas ALK-1 has a more limited pattern of expression, primarily in vascular tissues (Table I).

Because LXRβ specifically interacts with activated ALK-1 (ALK-1 Q-D), we explored whether LXRβ was a substrate for the ALK-1 serine/threonine kinase. HA-tagged LXRβ was expressed in COS-7 cells in the presence and absence of either wild type, activated, or kinase-dead ALK-1. The cells were labeled with orthophosphate, and LXRβ was immunoprecipitated with αHA antibody. Activated ALK-1 was able to specifically phosphorylate LXRβ (Fig. 3 A, lane 4), whereas ALK-1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) and ALK-1 K-R (Fig. 3 A, lane 5) were not. To characterize the phosphorylation of LXRβ by activated ALK-1, LXRβ phosphorylatedin vivo by activated ALK-1 was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. In vivo phosphorylated LXRβ was primarily phosphorylated on serine residues, with a trace amount of threonine phosphorylation and no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (ratio of pSer:pThr:pTyr of 12:1:0), (Fig. 3 B). To identify the number of phosphorylation sites, phosphopeptide mapping was performed. LXRβ was phosphorylated in vivo on at least two distinct sites, with one major phosphopeptide (Fig. 3 C). ALK-1 has been proposed to form a signaling complex with the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) and endoglin in endothelial cells (11Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of phosphorylation of LXRβ by activated ALK-1, we investigated the ability of wild type ALK-1 to phosphorylate LXRβ in the presence of TβRII or TβRII and endoglin in the presence and absence of TGF-β1. Although activated ALK-1 phosphorylated LXRβ (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), wild type ALK-1 could not (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) even in the presence of TβRII (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), TβRII and TGF-β1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), or TβRII, endoglin, and TGF-β1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5), suggesting that an uncharacterized ligand stimulates ALK-1 to phosphorylate LXRβ in vivo. Because TβRII was also HA-tagged (like LXRβ), autophosphorylated TβRII was immunoprecipitated in these experi"

The expression of tenascin-R by oligodendrocytes and small interneurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum is highly regulated during development of these regions. This complex glycoprotein displays both adhesive and anti-adhesive properties that contribute to the formation and maintenance of synapses. We have determined that tenascin-R associated with Purkinje cell bodies and their dendrites in the molecular layer of the cerebellum bears N-linked oligosaccharides terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4, whereas tenascin-R in other regions of the cerebellum does not bear this modification.

Formation and maintenance of the vast array of synapses and other structural features that is required for neurological function depends on specific interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM)1and cell membrane components. Carbohydrates in the form of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids play a critical role in a number of these interactions by enhancing either the adhesive or anti-adhesive properties of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs), often through interactions with carbohydrate-specific binding proteins or receptors. Several lines of evidence suggest that addition of uniqueN-linked carbohydrates to CAMs in the nervous system is essential for their in vivo function. For example, the addition of α2,8-linked polysialic acid (PSA) to theN-linked oligosaccharides on the neural adhesion molecule NCAM reduces its adhesive properties and promotes neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and dendritic arborization during development and regeneration following injury (1Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Roth J. Rutishauser U. Troy F.A.I. Polysialic Acid: from Microbes to Man. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1993Google Scholar). Another unique carbohydrate epitope, HNK-1 (SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc) is found on glycolipids as well as on a number of CAMs, including NCAM, L1, myelin-associated glycoprotein, tenascin-R (TN-R), and tenascin-C. HNK-1 is thought to play a role in modulation of neurite outgrowth, adhesion between neurons and glial cells and/or the ECM, and synaptic plasticity (1Schachner M. Martini R.

J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). HNK-1 may fulfill these roles by binding to specific proteins and receptors such as SBP-1 in the cerebellum (7Nair S.M. Zhao Z. Chou D.K. Tobet S.A. Jungalwala F.B. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The addition of PSA and HNK-1 to CAMs in the brain is both temporally and spatially regulated (1Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Sasaki T. Endo T. Glia. 1999; 28: 236-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, only a fraction of any CAM is modified with either of these carbohydrate structures, indicating the synthesis of these glycoproteins and the carbohydrate structures that modify them are regulated independently. Thus, the extent to which a CAM is modified with different carbohydrate structures likely reflects its functional role in vivo. Structural and behavioral changes that are observed when glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of PSA (9Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Google Scholar) and HNK-1 (10Yamamoto S. Oka S. Inoue M. Shimuta M. Manabe T. Takahashi H. Miyamoto M. Asano M. Sakagami J. Sudo K. Iwakura Y.

The specific interactions required for the formation and maintenance of synapses and other structures in the nervous system make it likely that the synthesis of the unique carbohydrate structures that contribute to these interactions is highly regulated. These unique carbohydrate structures are added to a select group of key recognition molecules, indicating that their addition is protein-specific. For example, the limited number of glycoproteins in the nervous system that bear either PSA or HNK-1 indicates that the glycosyltransferases involved in their synthesis are protein-specific (1Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Rutishauser U. Curr. Opin.

We previously identified and characterized a protein-specific β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (β1,4GalNAcT) that recognizes a peptide determinant in the α- and β-subunits of the glycoprotein hormone lutropin (LH) (12Smith P.L.

This enzyme in the pituitary accounts for the protein-specific addition of β1,4-linked GalNAc to N-linked oligosaccharides on LH and other glycoproteins (14Manzella S.M. Hooper L.V. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12117-12120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The β1,4-linked GalNAc is subsequently modified with SO4 by a GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase (GalNAc-4-ST1) (14Manzella S.M. Hooper L.V. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

The terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 on LH is critical for embryo implantation (16Mi Y.L. Shapiro S.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Clin.

In addition to pituitary, we have observed high levels of GalNAc-4-ST1 mRNA and activity in the cerebellum and other regions of the brain (15Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.-G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in cerebellum indicates that specific glycoproteins in this region of the brain are modified with terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. We report here that terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 is present on N-linked oligosaccharides of cerebellar TN-R, an extracellular matrix CAM. TN-R that is modified with GalNAc-4-SO4 is specifically associated with Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites. In addition, we found that the expression of these structures increases dramatically during the synaptic phase of cerebellar development. The temporal and spatial regulation of expression of this unique carbohydrate structure strongly supports the possibility that terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 on TN-R is important for cerebellar development and function in vivo. The chimeric protein Cys-Fc consisting of the cysteine-rich domain of the Man/GalNAc-4-SO4-receptor and the Fc domain of human IgG1 was obtained from CHO-Tag 30A cells that were selected for stable expression of Cys-Fc following transfection with pIG1-Man/S4GGnM(Mu11) (18Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CHO-Tag 30A cells were adapted to low serum/low protein media, Ultra CHO (BioWhittaker), and propagated in a Cell Max artificial capillary system (Spectrum Labs). Cys-Fc was purified from Ultra CHO media by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose and eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0. The eluted protein was immediately neutralized with Tris, pH 7.8, and dialyzed against 20 mmNaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Biotinylated Cys-Fc was prepared by adding 12% (v/v) aminohexanoylbiotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (2.5 mg/ml in Me2SO) to 100 μg of Cys-Fc (1 mg/ml) in 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 8.4, and incubated for 4–24 h at 4 °C. Free biotin was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Rat cerebella were removed and immediately frozen in Tissue-Tek (Miles, Elkhart, IN). Sagittal 10-μm sections were cut at −20 °C with a cryostat. Frozen sections were fixed in methanol for 6 min at −20 °C. Sections were incubated in 5% goat serum in TNB (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% casein) for 20 min at 25 °C to inhibit nonspecific binding. Cys-Fc biotin, 5–10 ng/ml, in TNB was incubated with sections for 4–16 h at 4 °C. Slides were washed with TNT (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with Cy3-conjugated Streptavidin (Jackson Labs) for 1 h at 4 °C. Sections were washed, and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 at 10 μg/ml. For inhibition studies, Cys-Fc biotin was incubated with 500 μmGalNAc-4-SO4 or GalNAc-6- SO4 for 15 min prior to staining sections. Frozen rat cerebella (50–100 g) were minced with a scalpel. The minced tissue, at 0.5 g/ml in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6, 1.25 m NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), was homogenized with two or three 5-s bursts at 5,000 rpm on a Polytron homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by sedimentation at 4,000 × g for 30 min. Soluble and peripheral membrane proteins were separated from integral membrane proteins by sedimentation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was designated as the RCS. The membrane pellet was washed three times by resuspension in 10–25 ml of buffer A and sedimentation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. These supernatants were pooled and designated as the RCW fraction. The membrane pellet was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 10 ml of TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl), plus 2% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Pefabloc, and sedimented at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The proteins remaining in the supernatant following incubation with Triton X-100 were designated as the RCM. The RCS fraction was dialyzed overnight against TBS, plus 0.2% hydrogenated Triton X-100+(TBS-TX+) at 4 °C and designated as the RCSD fraction. Veralinx Amine Modifying Reagent (PDBA-X-NHS ester) (Calbiochem) was used to modify Cys-Fc with phenyldiboronic acid (PDBA) via primary amines. Conjugation was carried out in bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at a molar ratio of PDBA:protein of 12:1. The PDBA-Cys-Fc was incubated with salicylhydroxaminic acid-agarose (Veralinx Agarose Chromatography Medium, SHA-agarose,Calbiochem) to yield an affinity matrix with 4 mg of protein/ml of agarose. The RCSD fraction was concentrated 10-fold on an Amicon stirred cell, and 15 ml of the concentrated material was incubated with 250 μl of Cys-Fc-agarose for 4–16 h at 4 °C. After washing the Cys-Fc-agarose with 6 ml of TBS-TX+, bound proteins were eluted with 2.5 ml of 500 μm GalNAc-4-SO4 in TBS-TX+ and followed by 2 ml of 500 μmGalNAc-4-SO4 and 1 m NaCl in TBS-TX+.

Multivalent ligands terminating with GalNAc-4-SO4 bind to immobilized Cys-Fc virtually irreversibly due to the slow off-rate (21Roseman D.S. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17052-17057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As a result the rate of increase in bound glycoproteins is proportionate to their concentration in the injected solution. The concentration of GalNAc-4-SO4-bearing glycoproteins present in each cerebellar fraction was therefore estimated from the rate of increase in surface plasmon resonance per minute as compared with that of LH, a glycoprotein known to bear multiple oligosaccharides terminating with GalNAc-4-SO4. Backgrounds were determined by comparisons to flow cells that did not have coupled Cys-Fc and/or to the decrease in signal seen in the presence of 500 μmGalNAc-4-SO4. One-dimensional protein gel bands were visualized with Colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250. The relevant bands were excised, using a Proteome Works Spot-cutter (Bio-Rad). The gel pieces were digested with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega). The recovered tryptic peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Automated data acquisition and automated data base searching were performed with Applied Biosystems Proteomics Solution 1 (PS1) software. Samples were incubated in NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer with 0.05 mdithiothreitol, heated for 10 min at 70 °C, and separated on 7.0% Tris acetate acrylamide gels (Novex/Invitrogen). Proteins were either visualized using silver staining or electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Following transfer, PVDF membranes were treated with 1% casein prior to incubation with anti-TN-R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Cys-Fc-biotin in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2–16 h at 4 °C. After removing excess primary reagent, the blots were incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) or horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at 4 °C. Western and ligand blots were visualized using chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prior to immunoprecipitation with specific antisera, the RCSD fraction was incubated with normal goat serum for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein G-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. The protein G-Sepharose was removed by sedimentation. Anti-TN-R was added, and the sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added for 1 h and washed extensively with TBS-TX+. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in LDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Protein in the RCSD fraction were denatured by boiling in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were cooled, adjusted to 0.35% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 8.6, 10 mm EDTA. The denatured proteins were then treated with 1–2 units of PNGase-F (Glyko) or incubated in buffer alone for 4–20 h at 37 °C. LDS sample buffer was then added, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Mouse and rat cerebellum express significant levels of a protein-specific GalNAc-transferase and a GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase (GalNAc-4-ST1) (15Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.-G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U.

We used the Cys-Fc chimera, which binds terminal GalNAc-4-SO4, to probe rat and mouse brains for the presence of glycoproteins bearing terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. The Purkinje cell and molecular layers of adult rat cerebellum were intensely stained by biotinylated Cys-Fc followed by Cy3-Streptavidin (Fig. 1 A). No staining was observed when sections were incubated with biotinylated human IgG1 (not shown). Staining with Cys-Fc was inhibited by incubation with 500 μm GalNAc-4-SO4 (Fig. 1 B) but not by incubation with 500 μm GalNAc-6-SO4 (Fig. 1 C), consistent with the specificity of the Cys-rich domain of the Man/GalNAc-4-SO4-receptor for GalNAc-4-SO4 (18Fiete D.J.

Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) also stained the Purkinje cell and molecular layers (not shown). Taken together with the presence of both the protein-specific GalNAc-transferase and GalNAc-4-ST1 in the cerebellum, this suggested that one or more glycoproteins that are associated with Purkinje cell bodies and their dendrites bear oligosaccharides terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4. The developmental expression pattern of Cys-Fc-reactive material in rat cerebellum was examined by probing sections from postnatal day 5 (P5), P14, and P21 rats with biotinylated Cys-Fc (Fig. 1, D–F) as described with the adult. Purkinje cell bodies reacted with Cys-Fc upon their arrival at the interface between the internal granular and molecular layers on P5 (Fig. 1 D). There is a significant increase in Cys-Fc-reactive material after P5 that peaks between P14 and P21 (Fig. 1, E and F). This time period corresponds with expansion of the molecular layer due to growth and synaptogenesis of Purkinje cells. The staining pattern seen in the adult is attained by P21, when development is largely complete. The presence of Cys-Fc-reactive carbohydrate moieties in cerebellum throughout development as well as in the adult suggests a role in regulation of Purkinje cell growth, synapse formation, and/or maintenance. The protein specificity of the β1,4-GalNAc-transferase makes it likely that only a limited number of glycoproteins in the cerebellum are selectively modified with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4. Identification of the glycoproteins bearing terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 may potentially provide insight into the function of this unique modification in the cerebellum. We therefore established conditions for the isolation and characterization of Cys-Fc-reactive glycoproteins as summarized in Table I. The amount of material present in the different fractions obtained following solubilization of the cerebellum was estimated by monitoring ligand binding to immobilized Cys-Fc using surface plasmon resonance. The major fraction of Cys-Fc-reactive material, roughly 60% of the total, was present in the RCS fraction (Table I, Fraction 2). Additional washing steps did not release significant additional protein (Table I, Fraction 4). The RCM fraction accounted for 30% of the Cys-Fc-reactive material in cerebellum (TableI, Fraction 5). The concentrated RCSD fraction was incubated with immobilized Cys-Fc, and bound glycoproteins were eluted with GalNAc-4-SO4, followed by GalNAc-4-SO4 with NaCl. The material eluted from the immobilized Cys-Fc chimera displayed a 36-fold increase in specific activity (change in surface plasmon resonance/μg) as compared with starting material or the unbound fraction (Table I, Fraction 3b). The marked increase in specific activity indicated that glycoproteins bearing terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 had been enriched by the affinity step. The proteins in the fraction eluted from the immobilized Cys-Fc column were characterized by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 2. Silver staining revealed the presence of a number of unique high molecular weight species enriched in the GalNAc-4-SO4-eluted fractions that represented minor components in the input or unbound fractions (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6–8). Following electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membranes, glycoproteins reactive with biotinylated Cys-Fc were identified as shown in Fig. 2 B. Four proteins with molecular weights between 120,000 and 200,000 could be identified as well as two higher molecular weight species with molecular weights of >200,000. The proteins reactive with biotinylated Cys-Fc appeared to correspond with the bands identified by silver staining. Thus, as predicted, a limited number of glycoproteins reactive with Cys-Fc were present in the cerebellar extracts. The most abundant affinity-purified protein, migrating with M r 160,000 (Fig. 2 A,arrow), was digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Twenty peptides were obtained that had masses corresponding to predicted tryptic fragments for rat TN-R (TableII). The peptides identified correspond to different regions distributed across the entire length of the protein (see Fig. 3). TN-R is a large, multidomain protein that contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, four complete and one partial EGF-like repeats, eight fibronectin type III repeats, one alternatively spliced fibronectin type III repeat, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (22Erickson H.P. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 9-19PubMed Google Scholar). TN-R is a soluble, extracellular matrix CAM that is expressed only in the central nervous system and is highly modified with both N- andO-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 3). Based on both in situ analyses and immunohistological stains, TN-R expression is characteristic of the hippocampus and the cerebellum (23Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J.

Whereas elongation is well documented, microtubule nucleation remains poorly understood because of difficulties in isolating molecular intermediates between tubulin dimers and microtubules. Based on kinetic studies, we have previously proposed that the basic building blocks of microtubule nuclei are persistent tubulin oligomers, present at the onset of tubulin assembly. Here we have tested this model directly by isolating nucleation-competent cross-linked tubulin oligomers. We show that such oligomers are composed of 10–15 laterally associated tubulin dimers. In the presence of added free tubulin dimers, several oligomers combine to form microtubule nuclei competent for elongation. We provide evidence that these nuclei have heterogeneous structures, indicating unexpected flexibility in nucleation pathways. Our results suggest that microtubule nucleation in purified tubulin solution is mechanistically similar to that templated by γ-tubulin ring complexes with the exception that in the absence of γ-tubulin complexes the production of productive microtubule seeds from tubulin oligomers involves trial and error and a selection process.

The microtubule building block is the tubulin αβ heterodimer. Within the microtubule, tubulin dimers aggregate through longitudinal interactions into protofilaments. Protofilaments are associated laterally to form a 25-nm-diameter cylindrical structure. Microtubule assembly from purified tubulin involves both microtubule nucleation and microtubule elongation (for a review, see Ref. 1Valiron O. Caudron N. Job D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2069-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In fully assembled microtubule solutions, individual polymers exhibit spontaneous length fluctuations involving polymer assembly and disassembly events. Microtubule elongation and disassembly are both well documented at the structural level (2Simon J.R. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 571-582PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

By comparison, microtubule nucleation is still poorly documented, mainly because the molecular species that form during nucleation are small sized and short-lived. The earliest structures observed by time-resolved electron microscopy during microtubule assembly are two-dimensional sheets of protofilaments (reviewed in Ref.6Erickson H.P. Stoeffler D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which subsequently close to form integral microtubules. Earlier steps of microtubule nucleation have hitherto been deduced from kinetic data (7Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Flyvbjerg H.

J. 1997; 73: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the interpretation of which is model-dependent. A salient feature of microtubule nucleation is that its rate depends on the high power of the initial GTP-tubulin concentration. This power currently varies from 6 to12 (7Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Flyvbjerg H. Jobs E. Leibler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E. 1995; 51: 5058-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In classical models, nucleation exponents are supposed to correspond to the number of tubulin molecules that assemble to form a filament from which a tubulin sheet arises. A compelling prediction of these models is that microtubule nucleation should rapidly drop to undetectable levels during tubulin assembly because of the resulting drop in the free GTP-tubulin concentration, and, a fortiori, of the 6th–12thpower of this concentration. This prediction has been tested only recently by systematic measurements of microtubule length and number concentration during tubulin assembly (13Caudron N. Valiron O. Usson Y. Valiron P. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the rate of microtubule nucleation turned out to be constant during tubulin assembly, despite the large drop in the free tubulin concentration. These observations led to a model in which the building blocks of microtubule nuclei are persistent tubulin oligomers present at the onset of tubulin assembly. This model implies that microtubule nuclei contain several of these oligomers to account for the nucleation exponent, whereas in previous models microtubules were supposed to nucleate from a single tubulin oligomer (8Flyvbjerg H. Jobs E. Leibler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5975-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Carlier M.F. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Biophys.

Here we provide direct evidence that microtubules can indeed nucleate from combinations of stable tubulin oligomers. Our data indicate that there is not a unique and fully determined way to integrate oligomers in microtubule nuclei. Instead the nucleation process appears to be flexible with a nucleation exponent that represents an average between alternative pathways. Tubulin purification from bovine brain was performed as described (13Caudron N. Valiron O. Usson Y. Valiron P. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified tubulin (100–150 μm) was incubated in PEM buffer (100 mmPipes,1 pH 6.7, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm GTP. Free nucleotides were removed using Biogel P30 chromatography. The GTP-tubulin concentration was adjusted in PEM buffer, and the aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen. Tubulin was labeled with carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester as described (15Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), with one recycling step. Microtubule assembly was carried out in PEM buffer with purified tubulin (12 μm), GTP (1 mm), and various amounts of ethylene glycol bis succinimidylsuccinate (EGS) suspension. Assembly was monitored at 350 nm, 35 °C, in a spectrophotometer. Alternatively, the microtubules were assembled from [3H]GTP-labeled tubulin (18 μm). The assembly conditions, procedures designed to measure assembled tubulin concentration, determination of microtubule mean length. and microtubule number concentration are described in Ref. 13Caudron N. Valiron O. Usson Y. Valiron P. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Vitreous ice-embedded samples were prepared as described previously (16Dubochet J. Adrian A. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 6: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 4 μl of sample (EGS suspension or microtubules assembled at 37 °C from tubulin (20 μm), GTP (1 mm), and EGS suspension (0.1 μm)) were pipetted onto a holey carbon grid, briefly blotted, and plunged quickly into liquid ethan (for microtubules, the grid was maintained in a humid atmosphere at 37 °C before blotting). The specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen and observed in a Philips CM 12. Images were recorded on Kodak S.O 163 film under low dose conditions at 28,000× and 35,000× magnifications and ∼2.3 μm underfocused. The micrographs were digitized with the UPRES-A 6026 CNRS scanner and with the Machine A Mesurer en Astronomie (M.A.M.A.) microdensitometer (Centre d'Analyse des Images Institut des Sciences de l'Univers/CNRS/Observatoire de Paris). The diameter and length of particles in the EGS suspension were measured using NIH Image software. Static light scattering (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed by means of a spectrometer equipped with an argon ion laser (Spectra Physics model 2020) operating at λ = 488 nm, an ALV-5000 correlator (ALV, Langen-Germany Instruments), a computer-controlled and stepping motor-driven variable angle detection system, and a temperature-controlled sample cell. The scattering spectrum was measured through a band pass filter (488 nm) and a pinhole (200 μm for the static experiments and 100 μm for the dynamic experiments) with a photomultiplier tube (ALV). In the SLS experiments, the excess of scattered intensityI(q) was measured with respect to the solvent, where the magnitude of the scattering wave vector q is given by the following equation.q=4πnλsinθ2Equation 1 where n is the refractive index of the solvent (1.34 for the water at 25 °C), λ is the wavelength of light in the vacuum, and θ is the scattering angle. In our experiments, the scattering angle θ varied between 20° and 150°, which corresponds to scattering wave vectors q in the range from 6 × 10−4 to 3.2 × 10−3 Å−1. The absolute scattering intensities I(q) (i.e. the excess Rayleigh ratio) were deduced using a toluene sample reference for which the Rayleigh ratio is well known. The plots of c/I(q,c)versus q 2 were extrapolated toq = 0 to give interceptsc/I(0,c), where c is the concentration of the scattering objects. If the length scaleq −1 is sufficiently large compared with the radius of gyration R G of the objects, the form factor obeys Guinier's law, and the radius of gyrationR G can be determined from the intercept and the initial slope of these plots using a scattering inverse Lorentzian law of the form (17Schmitz K.S. An Introduction to Dynamic Light Scattering by Macromolecules. Academic Press, London1990Google Scholar).KcI(q,c)=KcI(0,c)1+q2RG23if qRG〈〈1Equation 2 where K = 4π2 n 2(dn/dc)2/N Aλ4is the scattering constant, dn/dc is the refractive index increment, and N A is Avogadro's number. The apparent radius of gyration is obtained by a mean square linear fit of the inverse of the scattered intensityversus q 2. In DLS experiments, the normalized time autocorrelation functiong (2)(q,t) of the scattered intensity is measured (18Cummins H.Z. Pike E.R. Photon Correlation and Light Beating Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1974Crossref Google Scholar). The latter can be expressed in terms of the field autocorrelation function or equivalently in terms of the autocorrelation function of the concentration fluctuationsg (1)(q,t) through the following equation.g(2)(q,t)=〈I(q,0)I(q,t)〉〈I(q,0)〉2=A+β‖g(1)(q,t)‖2Equation 3 where A is the base line, and β is the coherence factor, which in our experiments is equal to 0.7–0.9. The normalized dynamical correlation functiong (1)(q,t) of concentration fluctuations is defined as follows.q(1)(q,t)=〈δc(q,0)δc(q,t)〉〈δc(q,0)2〉Equation 4 where δc(q,t) and δc(q,0) represent fluctuations of polymer concentration at time t and time 0, respectively. In our experiments, inspection of the angular dependence shows that the relaxations are diffusive with characteristic time τ inversely proportioned to q 2. It is then possible to determine diffusion constant D. The latter is related to the average hydrodynamic radius R H of the objects through the following equation.D=kT6πηsRH=1τq2q2=0Equation 5 where k is the Boltzman constant, ηs is the solvent viscosity, and T is the absolute temperature. To determine the average relaxation time τ, we used the Contin method based on the inverse Laplace transform ofg (1)(q,t) (19Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-242Crossref Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). If the spectral profile of the scattered light can be described by a multi-Lorentzian curve, then g (1)(q,t) can be written as follows.g(1)(q,t)=∞∫0G(Γ)exp(−Γt)dΓEquation 6 where G(Γ = 1/τ) is the normalized decay constant distribution. This method is appropriate for solutions characterized by several relaxation mechanisms. Various amounts of EGS suspension were incubated with GTP and [γ-32P]GTP for 15 min at 4 °C. The mix was filtered by Biogel P30 chromatography. The protein concentration and radioactivity of the eluate fraction were measured. The eluted radioactivity corresponded to the fraction of the nucleotide associated with EGS oligomers. Contours of spots were determined with a detection threshold higher than the mean background value measured around the spot. The threshold was adjusted near the sharp rise of the spot region, to reject the flat outer wings of diffused light. This strategy slightly underestimated the integrated intensity of the spot, but it minimized uncertainties caused by background fluctuations. The fluorescence intensities of spots were calculated as the sums of pixel values contained inside the selected contours after subtracting the corresponding background. To determine the number of dimers contained in individual spots, we estimated the mean fluorescence intensity value corresponding to one dimer. For this, rhodamine-labeled microtubules were assembled with the same batch of rhodamine tubulin as the one used for preparation of EGS oligomers. Measurements of fluorescence intensity per microtubule length unit yielded an estimation of the mean fluorescence intensity per tubulin dimer, assuming 1625 dimers/μm of microtubule length (20Bayley P.M. Sharma K.K. Martin S.R. Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 111-137Google Scholar). The number of tubulin dimers in a spot was determined by dividing the integrated fluorescence intensity inside the contour of the spot by the fluorescence intensity of one tubulin dimer. The number of oligomers/spot was finally deduced from the number of tubulin dimer in one EGS oligomer. It is well known that microtubule disassembly produces a profusion of oligomers of various sizes and forms (21Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Cell Movement. 2. Alan Liss, Inc., New York1989: 23-45Google Scholar, 22Wade R.H. Pirollet F. Margolis R.L. Garel J.R. Job D. Biol. Cell. 1989; 65: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To stabilize, isolate, and characterize tubulin oligomers with microtubule nucleation capacity, we developed procedures in which microtubules were cross-linked and then disassembled. Cross-linked oligomers were recovered from disassembly products. For microtubule cross-linking, we followed previously published methods (23Koshland D.E. Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Symmons M.F. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2755-2766PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fanara P. Oback B. Ashman K. Podtelejnikov A. Brandt R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purified tubulin (100 μm) was assembled for 20 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 80 mm Pipes (pH 6.7), 1 mm EGTA, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP. EGS was then added at 3.4 mm final concentration for 15 min. To quench the EGS in excess, the mixture was diluted into 9 volumes of a buffer containing 80 mm Pipes (pH 6.7), 1 mm EGTA, 50% sucrose, 10 mmglutamate, and 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet containing cross-linked microtubules was resuspended in PEM buffer. In a standard experiment, the microtubule pellet obtained from 400 μl of purified tubulin (100 μm) was resuspended in 180 μl of PEM at a final tubulin concentration of 150 μm. The resuspended microtubules were then subjected to a freezing-thawing cycle (freezing at −80 °C overnight). Following thawing, the EGS cross-linked microtubules had disassembled, and the suspension mainly contained curved filamentary structures of various size, the longest ones looking like open circles (Fig. 1 A). Suspensions also contained large protein aggregates (not shown) and, occasionally, residual microtubule fragments. To eliminate such fragments and the large protein aggregates, the suspension (diluted 1:5 in PEM) was subsequently filtered on a 0.1-μm Millipore filter to eliminate residual microtubule fragments. Approximately 5% of the protein was recovered in the filtrate, called “EGS suspension” hereafter, and could be stored at −80 °C for several weeks prior to further processing. Prior to use, the EGS suspension was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was recovered in 390 μl of PEM buffer. The EGS suspension mainly contained tubulin oligomers that appeared as curved filaments of 20–60 nm in size, whereas the longest circular tubulin assemblies were largely eliminated (Fig. 1 B). For assay of microtubule nucleation activity, aliquots of the EGS suspension were mixed with 12 μm tubulin in the presence of 1 mm GTP. Tubulin assembly was monitored by optical density measurements (Fig. 2 A). To directly verify microtubule production, 20 μl of the suspensions were centrifuged on coverslips and labeled by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-tubulin antibody. In the absence of EGS suspension, no microtubule assembly occurred. Significant microtubule nucleation was observed at a 1:120 oligomeric tubulin/total tubulin ratio (Fig. 2 A,curve observed at 0.1 μm oligomer concentration). The structure of the microtubules nucleated from the cross-linked oligomers was assessed using cryoelectron microscopy (Fig. 2 B). Most of the microtubules were composed of 13 or 14 protofilaments with a small proportion (∼5%) composed of 12 or 15 protofilaments. These proportions corresponded to those previously observed in microtubule suspensions assembled in standard conditions (26Wade R.H. Chrétien D. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Alternatively, EGS suspension was prepared as previously described, except that the experiment was performed at 4 °C. In this case, the tubulin suspension did not assemble in microtubules, and the resulting EGS suspensions did not display any microtubule nucleation activity (data not shown). Thus, active oligomers could only be obtained from disassembly of cross-linked microtubules. Electron microscopy experiments showed that EGS suspension contained oligomers in the form of small linear filaments. Quantitative information on the size of the components of EGS suspensions and on their relative concentrations was obtained using both DLS and SLS experiments. Fig. 3 A shows the results obtained from the DLS experiment. After application of the Contin method (see “Experimental Procedures”), the measured time autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity could be described by a sum of two relaxation times widely separated in time, suggesting that the EGS suspensions contained two main molecular species. The fast relaxation time corresponded to a hydrodynamic radius of 8 ± 1 nm, which is the size of the tubulin dimer. Thus, this relaxation time could be ascribed to the diffusive mode of tubulin dimers. The slow relaxation time corresponded to a hydrodynamic radius of 60 ± 6 nm. This value was in good agreement with the size of the tubulin oligomers seen in electron microscopy (20–60 nm). The radius of gyration measured using SLS experiments was found to be equal to 50 ± 10 nm. Within the error bars, this value was in good agreement with the value of hydrodynamic radius found for EGS oligomers. These experiments indicated that EGS suspensions were composed exclusively of tubulin dimers and EGS cross-linked oligomers. The relative concentrations of free tubulin dimers (c dimers) and tubulin dimers in the form of EGS oligomers (c EGS oligomers) in the solution could be deduced from the following equation (27Buhler E. Dobrynin A.V. DeSimone J.M. Rubinstein M. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 7347-7355Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar).p=MEGS oligomersMdimers=AEGS oligomersAdimersq=0cdimerscEGS oligomersEquation 7 where p is the number of tubulin dimers in EGS oligomers. Assuming that the tubulin dimer was 8 nm in length and 4 nm in width, for oligomers of 60 nm p is equal to 7.5 for longitudinally associated tubulin dimers and to 14 for laterally associated tubulin dimers. M EGS oligomers andM dimers were the weight-average molecular masses of EGS oligomers and dimers, respectively.A dimers(q) andA EGS oligomers(q) were the relative amplitudes of the relaxations associated with tubulin dimers and EGS oligomers, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Their corresponding ratio in Equation 7 extrapolated at q = 0 was equal to 100. The relative concentrations of free tubulin dimers (c dimers) versus tubulin dimers in the form of EGS oligomers (c EGS oligomers) could be calculated for two different values of pcorresponding to the possibility that the oligomers consisted of laterally or longitudinally associated tubulin dimers, respectively. In the case of EGS oligomers composed of longitudinally associated tubulin dimers, 7% of total tubulin would be in the form of free tubulin dimers, and 93% would be in the form of EGS cross-linked tubulin dimers. For EGS oligomers composed of laterally associated tubulin dimers, 13% of tubulin would be in the form of free tubulin dimers, and 87% would be in the form of EGS cross-linked tubulin dimers. We used a nucleotide exchange assay to determine whether tubulin oligomers in EGS suspensions consisted of laterally or longitudinally associated tubulin dimers. It is known from both biochemical and structural data that GTP at the exchangeable site in β-tubulin is not accessible in longitudinally associated tubulin dimers (28Mandelkow E.M. Lange G. Jagla A. Spann U. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Mitchison T.J. Science. 1993; 261: 1044-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Nogales E. Cell. Mol. Cell Sci. 1999; 59: 133-142Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast the same exchangeable sites should be fully accessible in laterally associated oligomers. For nucleotide exchange assay, filtered EGS suspension was prepared with nonradioactive GTP and then incubated in the presence of radioactive [3H]GTP. Free GTP was removed by filtration on Biogel P30 chromatography, and the stoichiometry of GTP binding to tubulin was determined. The results of three independent experiments yielded stoichiometry estimates varying from 0.91 to 0.99 (TableI), suggesting that the exchangeable GTP-binding sites were exposed in the vast majority of tubulin dimers, including those associated in oligomers. This is a strong indication that the nucleating tubulin oligomers consist of laterally associated tubulin dimers.Table INucleotide exchange between tubulin from EGS suspension and bufferEGS oligomers1-aConcentration expressed in μm tubulin dimers.GTPLinked GTPDimers having exchanged GTPmmmm%1.20.251.23 ± 0.12 (n = 4)98.42.50.252.39 ± 0.14 (n = 4)95.62.52.752.28 ± 0.09 (n = 3)91.2EGS suspensions at indicated concentrations (first column) were incubated for 15 min in PEM buffer at 4 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]-GTP (second column).

The concentration of associated radioactive nucleotide was measured after elimination of free GTP using chromatography (third column; n, number of experiments). The percentages of tubulin dimer having exchanged nucleotide had been deduced (fourth column). Taken together with the electron microscopy observations, the light scattering and nucleotide exchange experiments indicate that EGS suspensions contain tubulin dimers, a large proportion (87%) of which are laterally associated to form nucleation competent oligomers composed of ∼15 tubulin molecules. When EGS suspensions were incubated at 25 °C in the presence of GTP alone, we did not observe any modification of the spectrum shown in Fig. 3 A. Thus, EGS oligomers apparently did not aggregate in the presence of GTP alone. In the presence of added free tubulin, microtubule assembly occurred and was studied at 25 °C using SLS experiments (Fig. 3 B) and DLS experiments (Fig. 3C). The variation of the scattered intensity, I, at θ = 90° with time showed a typical microtubule assembly curve (Fig. 3 B). The normalized distribution function of decay times A(t) at θ = 90° obtained by applying the Contin method is presented in Fig. 3 C at three different times of microtubule assembly. At the beginning of the assembly (time = 0 s), Fig. 3 C shows the two diffusive modes of tubulin dimers and EGS oligomers. At time 0, the results are in agreement with the results presented in Fig. 3 A, although the percentages of diffusive mode intensities in Fig. 3 C were qualitative and not quantitative. In fact, the measurement time course was here shorter than in experiments providing Fig. 3 A, because the spectra were obtained during assembly process and in only one direction (90°). The two relaxations corresponding to tubulin dimers and EGS oligomers were still observed during tubulin assembly and in fully assembled tubulin suspensions (Fig. 3 C, time = 540 s and time = 1600 s), together with a third relaxation. The characteristic relaxation time and the corresponding amplitude of this relaxation increased with time. This relaxation was ascribed to growing microtubules. Because the size of the microtubules was larger than the scattering length scale q −1 (∼200 nm), it was not possible to determine their size using light scattering experiments. These observations mainly showed that only a proportion of the EGS oligomers were incorporated in microtubules during assembly. They did not allow detection of intermediates between oligomers and microtubules, possibly because such intermediates would yield a relaxation overlapping with the microtubule relaxation. Each EGS oligomer might be able to nucleate a microtubule (first order reaction), or several oligomers might have to be incorporated in microtubule nuclei (n th order reaction). To distinguish between these possibilities and estimate then value, we determined the relationship between the oligomer concentration and the initial rate of microtubule nucleation in the presence of GTP-tubulin complexes without GTP in excess (Fig. 4 A). The procedures for determination of microtubule concentration number from tubulin assembly data and microtubule mean lengths were as in Ref. 13Caudron N. Valiron O. Usson Y. Valiron P. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Slopes of microtubule concentration plots during the initial fast increase phase were plotted against the oligomer concentration on a log-log plot (Fig. 4 B). The slope of the regression line is an estimate of n and was equal to 4.1. This result strongly indicates that several oligomers are incorporated in a single microtubule nucleus. If several EGS oligomers associated to nucleate a microtubule, we reasoned that it could be possible to detect directly fluorescent EGS oligomers in microtubules by light microscopy and to quantify corresponding fluorescent intensities. EGS oligomers were produced from microtubules obtained using rhodamine-labeled tubulin. Rhodamine-labeled EGS oligomers (1 μm tubulin concentration) were incubated with unlabeled tubulin (18 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm GTP. The suspension was then centrifuged on coverslips and labeled by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-tubulin primary antibody and fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody. Remarkably, rhodamine-labeled oligomers formed red or yellow (by superposition of green and red colors) spots located either within or at one end of microtubules (Fig. 5 A, arrows), strongly indicating that microtubules had indeed polymerized on a seed formed by combined oligomers. The precise location of some spots at one end suggested that the stable seed inhibited microtubule disassembly from the minus end. Some red spots were unconnected with microtubules. In control experiments in which rhodamine-EGS oligomers (1 μm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in PEM buffer with GTP (1 mm) without added tubulin, such orphan spots did not form (not shown). This result suggests that in fitting with the light diffusion experiments, no oligomer complexes form in the absence of free tubulin and that orphan spots represent unproductive microtubule seeds. The apparent size of the spots showed conspicuous variability both for spots incorporated in microtubules and for orphan spots. A quantitative analysis of spot fluorescence was carried out on spots associated with microtubules (see “Experimental Procedures”). The threshold selected for spot detection was ∼10% higher than the mean background value and spot contours determined areas in the range of 1–17 pixels. The mean fluorescence intensity/spot was estimated, assuming 15 tubulin dimers/oligomer. The results indicated that the number of oligomers/spot was variable, ranging from 3 to 40 with a mean value of 14 (Fig. 5 B), much higher than the nucleation exponent estimated from kinetic data. This apparent discrepancy may in part result from technical limitations. The fluorescence intensity of pixels in small size spots (lower than 3 pixels) was close to the detection threshold. The number of such spots was therefore probably underestimated and a proportion of these spots, containing five oligomers or less, might have been neglected in our analysis. However, this difference may also result from the fact that large aggregates do not need to form in one step, by simultaneous interaction of dozens of oligomers. Rather, oligomer aggregates might grow in successive steps, and this would account for the apparent discrepancy between fluorescence and kinetic data. Taken together these data support the view that cross-linked oligomers aggregated in distinct microtubule nuclei in the presence of free tubulin molecules. They also reveal an unexpected variability in the size of such nuclei. Although suitable conditions for microtubule assembly in vitro have been discovered decades ago (31Weisenberg R.C. Science. 1972; 177: 1104-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), the pathway of microtubule nucleation in purified tubulin solutions has remained poorly understood because of the absence of suitable procedures to isolate molecular intermediates between tubulin dimers and tubulin sheets. This report describes the isolation and characterization of stabilized linear tubulin oligomers that represent such molecular intermediates. Our data indicate a lateral association of tubulin molecules in the EGS oligomers. Apparently, whereas in the absence of cross-linker microtubule breakdown in longitudinal filaments, EGS treatment preferentially stabilizes lateral dimer-dimer interactions, and microtubule disassembly by freezing-thawing procedures yields laterally associated tubulin filaments. It is possible that other types of tubulin oligomers could also nucleate microtubule assembly. We have tried a number of other procedures to derive assembly competent tubulin oligomers either from tubulin solutions kept in the cold, which contain abundant linear and circular oligomers (data not shown), or from the disassembly products of microtubules generated during complete microtubule oscillations (22Wade R.H. Pirollet F. Margolis R.L. Garel J.R. Job D. Biol. Cell. 1989; 65: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), without success. We cannot exclude the existence of nucleation centers whose structure is altered by cross-linking. It is also possible that natural non-cross-linked oligomers similar to those that we used in the present study would combine somewhat differently to form microtubule seeds. In any case, our results yield new information regarding the possibility and pathways of microtubule nucleation from tubulin oligomers. We have used the EGS oligomers for a direct test of the pertinence of a model of microtubule nucleation from stable tubulin oligomers that we have previously proposed (13Caudron N. Valiron O. Usson Y. Valiron P. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In classical nucleation models, the slow step is the aggregation of several tubulin molecules into a filament. The rapid step consists in the formation of microtubule from this filament. There is essentially no filament free in solution, and a single filament is incorporated in each polymer (14Leguy R. Melki R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21975-21980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, our model postulated that nucleation-competent tubulin filaments formed very rapidly at the onset of tubulin assembly to yield an excess pool of nucleation competent oligomers that subsequently combined slowly to form microtubule nuclei (13Caudron N. Valiron O. Usson Y. Valiron P. Job D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This study shows that the model that we proposed is sound. Light scattering experiments as well as microscopy studies showed that several EGS oligomers were needed to form a microtubule nucleus and that microtubule nucleation from these oligomers did not proceed in one step, with a pool of oligomers remaining free in solution during the assembly process. However, our study also revealed surprising features of the nucleation process. The first unexpected observation was that microtubule nuclei do not form from the oligomers themselves but from complexes of these oligomers with free tubulin dimers. Both microscopy and light scattering data provided evidence that the oligomers themselves had no tendency to combine into larger structure, in the absence of tubulin dimers. Upon the addition of tubulin dimers, the same oligomers coalesced into large nucleation complexes visible in light microscopy. It may be that the basic building blocks combining to form productive nucleation complexes are small tubulin sheets arising from one oligomer. The second surprise was the apparently conflicting flexibility and reliability of the nucleation process. Because in vitrotubulin assembly produces bona fide microtubules, it is generally thought that microtubule seeds have a rather strictly defined organization and that the nucleation exponent in the nucleation reaction has a clear structural meaning. Our data strongly support a different view. Apparently, the EGS oligomer-tubulin nucleation building blocks form all kinds of complexes, in a presumably flexible succession of association events. Some complexes are unproductive and are visible in microscopy as orphan spots. Other complexes expose a suitable shape to sustain microtubule growth, and this can happen with only a few building blocks or can need the association of a large number of building blocks. The nucleation exponent does not correspond to a strictly defined structure but is an average between many alternative association pathways. We believe that the ultimate reliability of the nucleation process producing bona fidemicrotubules from heterogeneous nuclei requires an efficient selection process. Probably, many tubulin assembly attempts occur on imperfect microtubule nuclei, but the structures formed are eliminated because of their instability. Thus, the general dynamic instability of microtubule assemblies may be as central for the reliability of microtubule assembly as for microtubule function. The lateral tubulin oligomers that nucleate microtubule assembly in our study bear obvious similarity with the tubulin assemblies that form on γ-TuRCs and can seed microtubule assembly both in vitroand in vivo. γ-TuRCs template the assembly of a laterally associated tubulin oligomer on which microtubule subsequently elongate (32Moritz M. Braunfeld M.B. Guénébaut V. Heuser J. Agard D.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Keating T.J. Borisy G.G. Nat.

However, whereas several EGS oligomers are needed for nucleation, a single oligomer is sufficient when templated on a γ-TuRC. A likely explanation is that γ-tubulin complexes specify precisely both the subunit number and the curvature of the tubulin oligomer used for microtubule seeding. With EGS oligomers, exposing laterally associated tubulin dimers with the proper arrangement in space at the surface of microtubule nuclei is apparently achieved through the association and overlap of several tubulin-oligomer complexes. Thus, ultimately, microtubule nucleation in purified tubulin solutions and from γ-TuRCs could be very similar processes, with the exception that γ-tubulin complexes render deterministic and efficient a process that involves trial and error in purified tubulin solutions.

To generate MDCK cells stably co-expressing HA epitope-tagged FAK and FRNK, MDCK cells that had already overexpressed FAK were grown on 60-mm dishes and co-transfected with 2 μg of pKH3-FRNK and 0.2 μg of pREP3 using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE following the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected in growth medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 100 units/ml Hygromycin and screened for FAK and FRNK expression by immunoblotting with anti-HA. To generate MDCK cells stably co-expressing HA epitope-tagged FAK and kd Src, MDCK cells that had already overexpressed FAK were co-transfected with 2 μg of pEVX-Src kd and 0.2 μg of pREP3. Clones were selected in growth medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 100 units/ml hygromycin and screened by in vitro Src activity assay. For soft agar colony formation assay, 5 × 103 cells were suspended in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.3% agar and 10% serum with or without 20 ng/ml HGF and added onto a layer of medium containing 0.5% agar and 10% serum in a 60-mm dish. 2 ml of medium containing 0.3% agar and 10% serum with or without 20 ng/ml HGF was added to the dish every other day. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. After 18 days, the number of colonies was measured. For the Matrigel invasion assay, MDCK cells were pretreated with 10 ng/ml HGF in 5% serum for 12 h and then collected by trypsinization. 5 × 104 cells in 250 μl of serum-free medium were added to an inner cup of the 24-well transwell chamber that had been coated with 150 μl of Matrigel (1:10 dilution in serum-free medium). 750 μl of medium supplemented with 10% serum was added to the outer cup. After 24 h, cells that had migrated through Matrigel and filter membrane with 8-μm pores were fixed, stained, and counted under a light microscope. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmNa3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and the protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots of lysates were incubated with 3 μl of various polyclonal antibodies or 6 μl of monoclonal anti-HA or anti-Src for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. For monoclonal antibodies, Protein A-Sepharose beads were coupled with rabbit anti-mouse IgG before use. The beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed with appropriate antibodies using the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence system for detection. To measure Src activity, anti-Src immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in 20 mmTris buffer. In vitro kinase reactions were carried out in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2) containing 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [r-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To measure the PI3K activity associated with ectopically expressed FAK proteins in MDCK cells, epitope-tagged FAK proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA from cell lysates and subjected to anin vitro PI3K assay as described previously (13Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). To examine whether increased expression of FAK and concomitant exposure to HGF lead to cell transformation, stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing HA epitope-tagged FAK were established and subjected to the soft agar colony formation assay and the Matrigel invasion assay in the presence or absence of HGF. The expression of ectopic FAK in MDCK cells led to a ∼3-fold increase in total FAK proteins, and the phosphorylation of FAK was increased upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). The phosphorylation of Met was increased to a similar level in Neo control cells and FAK-overexpressed cells upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). Because of no available antibody capable of recognizing canine Met in MDCK cells, Northern hybridization instead of immunoblotting was applied to analyze the expression of c-met. We found that the amount of Met transcripts was not increased by FAK overexpression in the presence or absence of HGF (data not shown). Therefore, it is less likely that FAK overexpression enhances the activation of Met upon HGF stimulation. The soft agar colony formation assay has been used to measure anchorage-independent cell growth, a hallmark of cell transformation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, FAK-overexpressed cells failed to grow in soft agar without the supplement of HGF, indicating that elevated expression of FAK by itself is not sufficient to confer an anchorage-independent phenotype to MDCK cells. Likewise, HGF stimulation alone was not sufficient to support the growth of control cells in soft agar either. However, HGF stimulation allowed FAK-overexpressed cells to grow in soft agar and finally form discrete cell colonies, indicating that the synergistic effect of FAK overexpression and HGF stimulation leads to anchorage-independent cell growth. Enhanced invasiveness is another characteristic of transformed cells. To examine whether FAK-overexpressed cells acquire invasive potential in response to HGF stimulation, stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing FAK were pretreated with HGF for 12 h and then subjected to anin vitro invasion assay (Fig. 1 C). This assay measures the capability of cells to migrate through a reconstituted basal membrane (Matrigel) and mimics aspects of tumor cell invasion during metastatic process. In the absence of HGF stimulation, MDCK cells did not exhibit any invasive properties, no matter whether FAK was overexpressed (Fig. 1 C). Although HGF has been shown to stimulate the invasiveness of various tumor cell lines (24Matsumoto K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 43Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Kiritoshi A. Tano Y. Nakamura T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3305-3313PubMed Google Scholar), it failed to promote control MDCK cells to invade Matrigel under our experimental conditions. Importantly, HGF stimulation dramatically enhanced the invasive property of MDCK cells overexpressing FAK (Fig. 1 C). In addition to MDCK cells, the synergism between FAK overexpression and HGF stimulation was examined in Chang liver cells. Similarly, FAK overexpression in Chang liver cells renders them susceptible to transformation upon HGF stimulation, judging from the two in vitro transformation assays above (data not shown). To further confirm the effect of FAK overexpression on promoting HGF-dependent cell transformation, FRNK, a dominant negative construct of FAK, was expressed in MDCK cells that had already expressed WT FAK (Fig. 2 A). Although FRNK has been reported to be cytotoxic in some cell types (44Xu L.-H. Yang X. Carven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 999-1005PubMed Google Scholar), it is not the case for MDCK cells, where FRNK only caused a decreased growth rate but not cell death (data not shown). Our result showed that the expression of FRNK significantly (∼80%) inhibited FAK-overexpressed cells to grow in soft agar and invade Matrigel upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 2 B), supporting the specific role of FAK overexpression in HGF-dependent cell transformation. To investigate the signals downstream of FAK required for HGF-dependent cell transformation, stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing HA epitope-tagged FAK mutants including D395A, Y397F, P712A/P715A, and Y925F, deficient in binding to PI3K, Src, p130 cas , and Grb2, respectively, were established. We first demonstrated that the FAK mutant stably expressed in MDCK cells was indeed specific to the intended defect in the FAK signaling (Fig. 3 A). Next, those cells were subjected to the soft agar colony formation assay and the Matrigel invasion assay. We found that the cells expressing FAK Y397F or P712A/P715A mutant failed to grow in HGF-containing soft agar and invade Matrigel upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 3, B andC), suggesting that simultaneous bindings of Src and p130 cas are required for FAK to potentiate HGF-dependent cell transformation. The potentials of cells expressing FAK D395A mutant to grow in HGF-containing soft agar and to invade Matrigel upon HGF stimulation were similar to those of cells expressing WT FAK, suggesting that the PI3K binding may be dispensable for FAK to induce cell transformation upon HGF stimulation. Interestingly, although cells expressing the FAK Y925F mutant displayed poor invasive properties after HGF stimulation, their colony forming potential in HGF-containing soft agar remained ∼60% of that of cells expressing WT FAK, suggesting that the interaction of FAK and Grb2 may differentially contribute to anchorage-independent cell growth and Matrigel invasion. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the Src/p130 cas signaling pathway is likely to be most critical for FAK to potentiate the HGF-dependent cell transformation. To examine the significance of Src in this model, kd Src, which functions as a dominant negative version of Src, was stably expressed in MDCK cells that had already overexpressed FAK (Fig. 4). Although the expression of Src kd mutant did not apparently increase the total amount of Src proteins, it significantly suppressed the total Src activity and the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK stimulated by HGF (Fig. 4 A), supporting an essential role for Src in HGF-stimulated FAK phosphorylation, as previously suggested by our laboratory (22Chen H.-C. Chan P.-C. Tang M.-J. Cheng C.-H. Chang T.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of Src kd mutant inhibited the potentials of FAK-overexpressed cells to grow in soft agar and invade Matrigel upon HGF stimulation by ∼70% (Fig. 4 B). Consistently, the selective Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 was found to completely block the transformed phenotypes of FAK-overexpressed cells upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 6 B). To examine the significance of p130 cas in this transformation model, the SH3 domain of p130 cas (CasSH3) was expressed in MDCK cells that had already expressed WT FAK (Fig. 5 A). We have previously demonstrated that the SH3 domain of p130 cas competes with endogenous p130 cas for FAK binding (8Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J. Chiu C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol.

In this study, we showed that the expression of the SH3 domain of p130 cas in FAK-overexpressed MDCK cells significantly (∼90%) inhibited their abilities to grow in soft agar and to invade Matrigel upon HGF stimulation (Fig. 5 B). Together, these results support the significance of the Src/p130 cas signaling cascade in cell transformation.Figure 6Enhancement of HGF-elicited signalings by FAK overexpression.

An initial report on the Drosophila melanogaster silver gene indicated a CPD-like protein with only two and a half carboxypeptidase-like domains with no transmembrane region (Settle, S. H., Jr., Green, M. M., and Burtis, K. C. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 9470–9474). A variety of bioinformatics and experimental approaches were used to determine that theDrosophila silver gene corresponds to a CPD-like protein with three carboxypeptidase-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail. In addition, two alternative exons were found, which result in proteins with different carboxypeptidase-like domains, termed domains 1A and 1B. Northern blot, reverse transcriptase PCR, and sequence analysis were used to confirm the presence of the various mRNA forms. Individual domains of Drosophila CPD were expressed in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. Media from domain 1B- and domain 2-expressing cells showed substantial enzymatic activity, whereas medium from domain 1A-expressing cells was no different from cells infected with wild-type virus. Domains 1B and 2 were purified, and the enzymatic properties were examined. Both enzymes cleaved substrates with C-terminal Arg or Lys, but not Leu, and were inhibited by conventional metallopeptidase inhibitors and some divalent cations. Drosophila domain 1B is more active at neutral pH and greatly prefers C-terminal Arg over Lys, whereas domain 2 is more active at pH 5–6 and slightly prefers C-terminal Lys over Arg. The differences in pH optima and substrate specificity between Drosophila domains 1B and 2 are similar to the differences between duck CPD domains 1 and 2, suggesting that these properties are essential to CPD function.

The differences in pH optima and substrate specificity between Drosophila domains 1B and 2 are similar to the differences between duck CPD domains 1 and 2, suggesting that these properties are essential to CPD function. CPD 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, carboxypeptidase D; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; EST, expressed sequence tag; FA, furylacryloyl; RT, reverse transcriptase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are: CPD, carboxypeptidase D; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; EST, expressed sequence tag; FA, furylacryloyl; RT, reverse transcriptase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid was initially discovered as a 180-kDa duck protein that bound hepatitis B viral particles and was designated gp180 (1Kuroki K. Cheung R. Marion P.L. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cloning and sequencing of gp180 cDNA (2Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it became clear that this duck protein was the homolog of the newly discovered rat and bovine enzyme named CPD (3Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the silver (svr) gene of Drosophila melanogaster(4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CPD is thought to work together with endopeptidases such as furin to process peptides and proteins that transit the secretory and endocytic pathways (5Fricker L.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1349-1351Google Scholar, 6Fricker L.D. Enzymes. 2002; 23: 421-452Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unlike carboxypeptidase E (CPE; also known as CPH) and all other members of the metallocarboxypeptidase gene family, CPD is unique in that it contains multiple carboxypeptidase domains (7Reznik S.E. Fricker L.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Human, rat, mouse, and duck CPD contain three carboxypeptidase-like domains followed by a transmembrane domain and a 58-residue cytosolic tail (2Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Of the three carboxypeptidase-like domains, only the first two have enzyme activity toward standard substrates (11Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Novikova E.G. Eng F.J. Yan L. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28887-28892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Several of the key catalytic residues are missing from the third carboxypeptidase-like domain of human, rat, and duck CPD, consistent with the observed lack of enzyme activity toward standard carboxypeptidase substrates (11Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Novikova E.G. Eng F.J. Yan L. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28887-28892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); the function of this highly conserved domain is not known.The enzymatic properties of the first and second domains of duck CPD differ in several key aspects. The first domain is more active at neutral pH than acidic values, whereas the second is more active in the pH 5–6 range than at neutral pH (11Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Novikova E.G. Eng F.J. Yan L. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28887-28892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The combination of the two domains therefore results in an enzyme with a broader pH optimum than either domain alone. This is important in that CPD is present in thetrans-Golgi network, the secretory and reuptake pathways, and transiently on the cell surface (13Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pH in these various compartments ranges from near neutral to acidic (pH 5–6), so the broad pH range presumably gives CPD the ability to function optimally in each compartment. In addition, the substrate specificities of the first and second domains also differ. Although both domains are highly specific for C-terminal basic amino acids, the first domain prefers C-terminal Arg, whereas the second domain prefers C-terminal Lys (12Novikova E.G. Eng F.J. Yan L. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28887-28892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Mutation of the Drosophila svr gene can affect viability, pigmentation, wing shape, catecholamine metabolism, and the behavioral response to light, depending on the severity of the mutation (16Wright T.R. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The gene was isolated, and the corresponding cDNA was sequenced in 1995 and found to encode a protein containing two full carboxypeptidase-like domains followed by half of a third domain and then a stop codon (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A variety of mRNA forms were identified, ranging from 1.5 to 6 kb, suggesting alternative splicing (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, a partial clone of an alternatively spliced cDNA (named the 1a form) was found, which encoded a protein with a different N-terminal sequence (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the partial sequence of this 1a form appeared to lack one of three key metal-binding residues, all of which are required for enzymatic activity, thus raising the possibility that this 1a form was inactive. Three members of the human metallocarboxypeptidase family (CPX-1, CPX-2, and AEBP-1) are also missing key metal-binding and/or other catalytic residues and do not cleave standard carboxypeptidase substrates (17Lei Y. Xin X. Morgan D. Pintar J.E. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the significance of the various carboxypeptidase-like domains of CPD, the Drosophila genome and various expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases were analyzed for CPD-like sequences. Then Northern blot analysis was performed with exon-specific probes in order to determine the forms of mRNA and the resulting proteins. The two different first carboxypeptidase-like domains (1A and 1B) and the second carboxypeptidase-like domain were individually expressed using the baculovirus expression system, and their enzymatic properties were determined. The finding that the first carboxypeptidase-like domain (the 1B form) and the second carboxypeptidase-like domain differ in their pH optima and specificities for C-terminal Lys versus Arg indicates that this is a fundamental aspect of CPD structure/function that has been conserved from Drosophila to vertebrates.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnalysis of the Drosophila Genome and EST Data BasesThe Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project Web site (www.fruitfly.org) and the FlyBase data base (flybase.bio.indiana.edu) were searched with a variety of carboxypeptidase sequences, including rat CPE, rat CPD, human carboxypeptidases A and B, and theDrosophila svr gene product. In addition to the genomicDrosophila sequence, data bases of EST clones were also screened with the various carboxypeptidase sequences. Five EST clones (LP08595, GH13060, LD23786, LD28490, and LP12324) were purchased (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was also used to confirm the predicted splicing patterns of the various exons. For the predicted C-terminal region, one of the gene prediction programs in the FlyBase data base had predicted two short introns. RT-PCR was used with oligonucleotides corresponding to regions flanking these predicted introns, and the PCR product was analyzed on agarose gels. In addition, the PCR product was subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and ∼20 clones were isolated and sequenced.The presence of an N-terminal signal peptide was predicted using the Web site www.cbs.dtu.dk/service/SignalP (20Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of each carboxypeptidase-like domain of theDrosophila CPD was analyzed using the PSSM Web site (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/∼3dpssm/). Amino acid sequence identity among various carboxypeptidases was determined using GenePro (Hoeffer Scientific).Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy protect minikit, and ∼20 μg was fractionated on an agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde. After photography of the ethidium bromide-stained gel, the RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran; Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with fly CPD riboprobes. To generate exon-specific probes, PCR was performed using oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of exons 1A, 1B, 3, 6, and 8. The template for the PCR of exon 1A was the EST clone LP12324, and the reaction product was 510 nucleotides. For PCR of exons 1B and 3, the EST plasmid LD28490 was used, and the reaction products were 380 and 485 bp, respectively. For exons 6 and 8, RT-PCR was performed usingDrosophila mRNA, and the reaction products were 470 and 465 bp, respectively. All PCR products were subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequence analysis. To generate riboprobe, the plasmids were linearized with eitherSpeI or NsiI, and the appropriate enzyme (T3 or T7 RNA polymerase) was used to generate antisense cRNA with [32P]UTP using standard procedures (21Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 152-156Crossref Google Scholar). Approximately, 5 × 106 cpm of each probe was hybridized with the nitrocellulose blot in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 60 °C overnight. After hybridization, blots were successively washed with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS buffer at 65 °C. Blots were dried and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat Blue XB-1; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 3 days at −80 °C with an intensifying screen.Expression of CPD Domains in Baculovirus and Enzyme PurificationPlasmid ConstructionFor expression in the baculovirus system, PCR was used to generate a cDNA fragment corresponding to the various carboxypeptidase domains, and this fragment was subcloned into the pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector (Pharmingen) downstream of the signal peptide sequence derived from rat CPE. This CPE signal peptide sequence has previously been found to produce high levels of secreted proteins using the baculovirus expression system (22Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TheDrosophila CPD 1A and 1B constructs were created by amplifying 1.1-kb fragments using EST clones LP12324 and LD28490, respectively, as templates with Tgo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The Drosophila CPD 2 construct was produced using Drosophila mRNA and RT-PCR SUPERSCRIPTTM II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and then Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) to amplify a 1.2-kb product. The 5′-end of each PCR product contained a restriction site (XbaI or SpeI) that was in-frame with theXbaI site immediately following the prepro-CPE sequence in the baculovirus expression construct pCPE20 (22Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 3′-end of each PCR product contained a stop codon followed by the NotI restriction site. The PCR product was purified (PCR purification kit; Qiagen), digested with XbaI or SpeI andNotI, and ligated intoXbaI/NotI-digested pCPE20. All resulting plasmids were confirmed by sequencing in both directions.Baculovirus Expression and Protein PurificationThe three baculovirus expression plasmids (2.5 μg each) were separately combined with 0.25 μg of Baculoplatinum viral DNA (Orbigen) and used to transfect 106 Sf9 cells using the standard procedure recommended by Orbigen. The recombinant virus was amplified in Sf9 cells as described (11Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For analysis of enzyme activity and subsequent protein purification, 100–300 ml of Sf9 cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml were infected with recombinant virus, and after 3 days, the cells were removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and either assayed directly (described below) or purified on ap-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin (23Plummer T.H.J. Hurwitz M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3907-3912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For domain 1B, 100 ml of supernatant was adjusted to 100 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, and applied to a 0.5-ml p-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin column. The column was washed with 50 ml of 0.1m NaAc, pH 5.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and then rinsed with 10 ml of 10 mm NaAc, pH 5.5. The resin was eluted with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.01% CHAPS and 0.05% Triton X-100 (Elute 1) and then with 5 ml of the same buffer containing 25 mm Arg (Elute 2). Enzyme activity was found in Elute 2. For domain 2, 300 ml of supernatant was dialyzed for 48 h against several changes of 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, and applied to a 5-mlp-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin column. The column was washed with 0.1 m NaAc, pH 5.5, containing 0.5m NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100; rinsed with 10 mm NaAc, pH 5.5; and eluted with 5 × 10 ml of Elute 1 buffer (above) and then 5 × 10 ml of Elute 2 buffer (above). Most of the enzyme was found in Elute 2. Domain 1A was also tested with thep-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin but was not found to bind under any of the above conditions, even when 1 mm ZnCl2 was included in the binding buffer (data not shown).Western Blot AnalysisProteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Optitran; Schleicher & Schuell). The nitrocellulose blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were probed with 1:1000 dilutions of polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against either duck CPD (AE 178) or rat CPD (AE 142). Following exposure of the blot to primary antiserum, the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce) was used to detect bound antiserum.Enzyme AssaysCarboxypeptidase Assay with Fluorescent SubstratesEnzyme activity was typically assayed in triplicate with 200 μmdansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, buffer (for domain 1B) or pH 5.7 buffer (for domain 2) containing 0.01–0.1% Triton X-100 in a final volume of 250 μl. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 0.5 n HCl after 30–45 min at 37 °C, 2 ml of chloroform was added, and the tubes were mixed and centrifuged at 150 × g for 2 min. The amount of product (dansyl-Phe-Ala) was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the lower chloroform phase (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 500 nm). The pH optima of purified enzymes were determined using 100 μmdansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer at various pH values at 37 °C. To examine the effect of inhibitors and metals, purified enzymes were preincubated with the inhibitor for 15 min at room temperature. After the preincubation, substrate (dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg) was added to 200 μm final concentration, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 h. For kinetic analysis, the purified enzymes were dialyzed (Centricon 30) to remove traces of Arg and incubated with substrate (final concentration 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mm) for a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. K m andK cat were calculated using SigmaPlot 2001 Enzyme Kinetic Module (Jandel Scientific).Furylacryloyl AssaysEnzymes were prepared as for dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg kinetics. Either 0.1 μg of domain 1B or 0.5 μg of domain 2 were added to 100 μm furylacryloyl-Ala-Arg (FA-Ala-Arg), furylacryloyl-Ala-Lys (FA-Ala-Lys), or furylacryloyl-Gly-Leu (FA-Gly-Leu) in 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 7.4 or 5.7, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C, and absorption was monitored at 336 nm in a spectrophotometer.RESULTSAnalysis of the Drosophila genomic and EST data base sequences as well as RT-PCR and sequencing revealed that the CPD gene is comprised of eight exons (Fig. 1). There are three alternatively spliced first exons. Exon 1A encodes the sequence previously found as a partial cDNA sequence and named 1a (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), exon 1B corresponds to a cDNA sequence previously named 1b (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and exon 1C corresponds to an EST clone (discussed further below). The original sequence report of the svr gene had a missing nucleotide, which led to a frameshift and the introduction of a stop codon in the middle of the third carboxypeptidase-like domain (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of EST data base sequences confirmed that the previously reported svr gene sequence was incorrect and that there is a long open reading frame encoding three carboxypeptidase-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and cytosolic tail. The size of genomicBamHI and EcoRI fragments previously identified (4Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) match those predicted from the Drosophila genomic sequence (Fig. 1).Exon-specific probes were generated to examine the mRNA forms ofDrosophila CPD. Northern blot analysis revealed a common 6.5-kb form of CPD mRNA that was detected with all exon probes (Fig. 2). In addition, probes for exons 1B and 3 showed major bands of 3.4, 2.8, 1.7, and 1.5 kb (Fig. 2). These same species were also detected upon longer exposure of the blot probed with exon 1A (not shown), although the levels were much weaker relative to the 6.5-kb form. The exon 6 and 8 probes did not detect any of the smaller forms of CPD mRNA (Fig. 2). The forms of CPD mRNA were also examined by EST data base searches. A number of cDNA clones encoding Drosophila CPD were identified, and several of these were obtained and fully sequenced in both directions. The results of this analysis, together with the Northern blot data, are indicated in Fig. 3. The 1A and the 1B exons are found in both “long” and “short” forms. The N-terminal regions of the proteins encoded by the first ATGs in exons 1A and 1B are predicted to encode signal peptides. There is no apparent “pro” region following the signal peptide of the proteins encoded by either the 1A or 1B form of Drosophila CPD, which is consistent with the lack of a pro region in vertebrate CPD. In addition to the 1A and 1B forms, a third exon 1 (designated 1C) was found in a single EST cDNA sequence. The protein encoded by the 1C form of the mRNA does not contain a N-terminal signal peptide and has a truncated carboxypeptidase-like domain.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of CPD mRNA.RNA from adult wild-type Drosophila was hybridized with cRNA probes corresponding to the indicated exon, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The positions of RNA size standards (Invitrogen) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Exon composition of the various forms ofDrosophila CPD mRNA and the corresponding protein forms.

This region of exon 8 has been arbitrarily designated α, β, γ, and δ. The unspliced exon 8 produces the sequence designated “tail-1.” The mRNA species in which the γ region has been removed is designated “tail-2,” and the predicted species lacking both the α and the γ regions has been designated “tail-3.” The location of the BamHI site within this region of exon 8 is indicated for tail-1 and tail-2. C, deduced amino acid sequences of the tail-1, tail-2, and tail-3 splice forms. The first 5–13 amino acids correspond to the end of the putative transmembrane domain.

Accession numbers are AF545816(1A “long” form with tail 1), AF545817 (1B “long” form with tail 1), AF545818 (1B “long” form with tail 2), AF545819 (1A “short” form), and AF545820 (1B “short” form).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The long forms of Drosophila CPD mRNA encode three carboxypeptidase-like domains, each separated by a short “bridge region” (b1 and b2) and then a transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail (Fig. 3 A). Although the mRNA appears as a single species of ∼6.5 kb, this appears to represent at least two and possibly three different splice forms, each encoding a different cytosolic tail protein sequence (Fig. 3 B). The unspliced form, referred to as tail-1, encodes a cytosolic tail of 67 amino acids (Fig. 3 C). The form with the γ segment spliced out, referred to as tail-2, encodes a cytosolic tail of 100 amino acids (Fig. 3, B and C). Both of these forms were detected in roughly equal amounts when RT-PCR was used to amplify this region (data not shown). In addition to these two forms, a third form lacking both the γ segment and the α segment (Fig. 3, Band C) was predicted in the FlyBase data base, but no cDNA clones to this region were detected either experimentally or in the various EST data bases.The short forms of Drosophila CPD mRNA result from the failure to remove the intron between exons 4 and 5. This results in a single carboxypeptidase-like domain, part of the first bridge domain (b1), and then a unique C-terminal sequence of 10 amino acids followed by a stop codon (Fig. 3 A). There is considerable variation in the length of the 3′-untranslated region of these short mRNA forms. Two of the exon 1B-containing cDNA clones obtained from the EST library correspond to the 1.7- and the 2.8-kb forms of 1B mRNA found in the Northern blots. These two clones differ in the site used for polyadenylation. An exon 1A-containing cDNA clone found in an EST library used a third polyadenylation site. Because the polyadenylation site is presumably unrelated to the presence of exon 1A or 1B, it is likely that all three polyadenylation sites are used for all of the short forms. Furthermore, the presence of additional bands on the Northern blots suggests that either additional polyadenylation sites are used or additional upstream exons may be included in some of the forms.The various carboxypeptidase-like domains were compared with each other and to selected members of the E/N subfamily of metallocarboxypeptidases. Domains 1A and 1B have highest amino acid sequence identity with each other (82%), although this includes the common region encoded by exons 2–4. The unique regions of these two proteins show 42% amino acid identity. Both the 1A and 1B forms ofDrosophila CPD have 30–40% amino acid sequence identity with Drosophila CPD domain 2 and with various vertebrate carboxypeptidases (Table I). Interestingly, Drosophila domain 1B does not show higher amino acid sequence identity to the first domain of duck or rat CPD and has slightly higher sequence identity with the second domain of these proteins (Table I). The second domain of Drosophila CPD does show higher amino acid sequence identity to the second domains of duck and rat CPD relative to the first or third domains of these proteins (Table I). The third dom"
https://openalex.org/W2008886999,"Lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH) is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the first two steps of lysine catabolism in animals and plants. To elucidate the biochemical signification of the linkage between the two enzymes of LKR/SDH, namely lysine ketoglutarate and saccharopine dehydrogenase, we employed various truncated and mutatedArabidopsis LKR/SDH polypeptides expressed in yeast. Activity analyses of the different recombinant polypeptides under conditions of varying NaCl levels implied that LKR, but not SDH activity, is regulated by functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains, which is mediated by the structural conformation of the linker region connecting them. Because LKR activity of plant LKR/SDH enzymes is also regulated by casein kinase 2 phosphorylation, we searched for such potential regulatory phosphorylation sites using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. This analysis identified Ser-458 as a candidate for this function. We also tested a hypothesis suggesting that an EF-hand-like sequence at the C-terminal part of the LKR domain functions in a calcium-dependent assembly of LKR/SDH into a homodimer. We found that this region is essential for LKR activity but that it does not control a calcium-dependent assembly of LKR/SDH. The relevance of our results to the in vivo function of LKR/SDH in lysine catabolism in plants is discussed. In addition, because the linker region between LKR and SDH exists only in plants but not in animal LKR/SDH enzymes, our results suggest that the regulatory properties of LKR/SDH and, hence, the regulation of lysine catabolism are different between plants and animals. Lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH) is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the first two steps of lysine catabolism in animals and plants. To elucidate the biochemical signification of the linkage between the two enzymes of LKR/SDH, namely lysine ketoglutarate and saccharopine dehydrogenase, we employed various truncated and mutatedArabidopsis LKR/SDH polypeptides expressed in yeast. Activity analyses of the different recombinant polypeptides under conditions of varying NaCl levels implied that LKR, but not SDH activity, is regulated by functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains, which is mediated by the structural conformation of the linker region connecting them. Because LKR activity of plant LKR/SDH enzymes is also regulated by casein kinase 2 phosphorylation, we searched for such potential regulatory phosphorylation sites using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. This analysis identified Ser-458 as a candidate for this function. We also tested a hypothesis suggesting that an EF-hand-like sequence at the C-terminal part of the LKR domain functions in a calcium-dependent assembly of LKR/SDH into a homodimer. We found that this region is essential for LKR activity but that it does not control a calcium-dependent assembly of LKR/SDH. The relevance of our results to the in vivo function of LKR/SDH in lysine catabolism in plants is discussed. In addition, because the linker region between LKR and SDH exists only in plants but not in animal LKR/SDH enzymes, our results suggest that the regulatory properties of LKR/SDH and, hence, the regulation of lysine catabolism are different between plants and animals. Many metabolic pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes include bifunctional enzymes containing two different enzymes that are linked on a single polypeptide encoded by a single gene. The regulatory significance of such linkages is still not clearly understood. One member of this group of bifunctional enzymes is LKR/SDH, containing the lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) 1The abbreviations used are: LKR, lysine-ketoglutarate reductase; SDH, saccharopine dehydrogenase; LR, linker region; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) enzymes of the α-amino adipic acid pathway of lysine catabolism, a pathway that operates both in animals and plants (1Arruda P.

Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Defects in the LKR/SDH gene in humans are associated with a severe genetic disorder called familial hyperlysinemias, which is associated in some patients with mental retardation (3Markovitz P.J.

It has also been suggested that in mammals LKR/SDH participates in the metabolism of glutamate needed for nerve signaling via glutamate receptors (5Papes F. Surpili M.J. Langone F. Trigo J.R. Arruda P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two documented functions of the α-amino adipic acid pathway in plants are to balance lysine levels and also to regulate carbon/nitrogen partition in response to abiotic stresses (2Galili G. Tang G. Zhu X. Gakiere B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,6Galili G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol.

The significance of the bifunctional nature of LKR/SDH is still not known, mostly because its two enzymes were so far studied as single entities. The activity of LKR, which resides on the N-terminal part of LKR/SDH, but not SDH, was demonstrated to be subject to a complex regulatory control in plants. LKR activity in developing tobacco seeds is stimulated by lysine in vivo via an intracellular signaling cascade requiring Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (10Karchi H. Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Galili G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, plant LKR/SDH polypeptides can be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase 2 (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Karchi H. Galili G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1453-1458Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and this in vitro phosphorylation stimulates LKR activity in a lysine-dependent manner (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The in vitro LKR activities of the maize and rice LKR/SDH enzymes were also shown to be stimulated by salts, including calcium (12Gaziola A. Teixeira C.M.G. Lugli J. Sodek L. Azevedo R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have expressed a full-lengthArabidopsis LKR/SDH enzyme as well as several deletion and mutation versions of this protein in yeast to study whether and how LKR activity is regulated by the bifunctional nature of LKR/SDH. We found that LKR activity is modulated by functional interaction with the SDH domain, which is mediated by the linker region linking these two enzymes. We also identified Ser-458 as a potential candidate for regulating LKR activity by casein kinase 2. Moreover, our results also suggest that assembly of the Arabidopsis LKR/SDH into a homodimer is not mediated by calcium, as was previously hypothesized for plant LKR/SDH enzymes (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis and maize plants were grown in a controlled greenhouse (16-h photo period at 25 ± 5 °C). High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) was used for generating point mutation and constructs, The high molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The full-length Arabidopsisbifunctional LKR/SDH and nonfunctional LKR and SDH cDNAs fused with a tag of six histidines (His tag) in the yeast expression vector pVT102u were previously described (14Zhu X. Tang G. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Zhu X. Tang G. Galili G. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 215-220PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the LKR domain plus the linker region (LKR-LR), a PCR amplification was performed to introduce a stop codon and a StuI site at the end of the linker region. The PCR product was digested by XbaI andStuI, replacing the XbaI-StuI fragment of SK-nHis-LKR/SDH to obtain SK-nHis-LKR-LR. To construct the SDH domain plus the linker region (SDH-LR), PCR amplification was performed to introduce ATG codon and a XbaI site at the beginning of the linker region. The PCR product was digested byXbaI and SmaI, replacing theXbaI-SmaI fragment of SK-cHis-LKR/SDH to obtain SK-cHis-SDH-LR. For deletion of the linker region of the LKR/SDH, two PCR amplifications were performed to introduce a SmaI site at the end of LKR domain (PCR1) or at the beginning of SDH domain (PCR2), respectively. The PCR1 product was cloned into SK as aXbaI-SmaI fragment to produce SK-nHis-LKR (XbaI-SmaI). The PCR2 product was digested byXhoI and SmaI and cloned into SK-nHis-LKR (XbaI-SmaI) to generate SK-nHis-LKR/SDHΔLR. To generate point mutations in the EF-hand-like region of the LKR domain, primers Pala369 and Pasp369 (Table I) were used for PCR on SK-nHis-LKR/SDH as a template. Two PCR amplifications were performed with Pala369 and T3 as well as Pasp369 and T3, respectively. The PCR products were digested with BstXI and PflMI and replaced the corresponding fragment of SK-nHis-LKR/SDH. The resulting plasmids were termed SK-nHis-LKR/SDH (S369A) and SK-nHis-LKR/SDH (S369D).Table IDNA sequences of oligonucleotides used in the present studyPala3965′-ctccaaaatgctgGGCtgcctcttttgcaaattctg-3′Pasp3965′-ctccaaaatgctgGTCtgcctcttttgcaaattctg-3′Pala458f5′-cacgtatgaggaagGcaaatccagaagag-3′Pala458r5′-ctcttctggatttgCcttcctcatacgtg-3′Pasp458f5′-acgtatgaggaagGACaatccagaagaggca-3′Pasp458r5′-tgcctcttctggattGTCcttcctcatacgt-3′P458f5′-ccagttttccacgaaaagata-3′P458r5′-gataggagcatcgttgatcattttcttc-3′Pala238f5′-caagcttcttcctcacGcttttgttgaaccaag-3′Pala238r5′-cttggttcaacaaaagCgtgaggaagaagcttg-3′Pasp238f5′-caagcttcttcctcacGAttttgttgaaccaag-3′Pasp238r5′-cttggttcaacaaaaTCgtgaggaagaagcttg-3′P238f5′-gcgcaattaaccctcactaaa-3′P238r5′-cttcagatgtgctggtagat-3′IEGR1/T35′-tggctgTaTacccTgCCTTcgataatattatcttgtg-3′IEGR1/T75′-cggggtAtAcagccagagaacattcaaca-3′IEGR2/T35′-gattaCctaGGcgagttaatgaaac-3′IEGR2/T75′-ctcgCCtagGtaatccaaTagaagGtCGt atatccccaca-3′The nucleotides in capital letters represent nucleotide for mutation. Open table in a new tab The nucleotides in capital letters represent nucleotide for mutation. To mutate Thr-238 and Ser-458 into Ala or Asp, the following PCR reactions were used. For mutating Ser-458 to Ala, we first performed two PCR reactions with the two primer pairs Pala458f + P458r as well as P458f + Pala458r (Table I). The mixture of the first two PCR products was used as the template for a second PCR reaction with primers P458f and P458r. The second PCR product was cut with Nhe andSpeI and replaced the Nhe-SpeI fragment of SK-6nHis-LKR/SDH to produce SK-6nHis-LKR/SDH (S458A). In a similar manner, we constructed SK-6nHis-LKR/SDH (S458D) using the two primer pairs Pasp458f + P458r and P458f + Pala458r and SK-6nHis-LKR/SDH (T238A) with the two primer pairs Pala238f + P238r and P238f + Pala238r as well as SK-6nHis-LKR/SDH (T238D) with the primer pairs Pasp238f + P238r and P238f + Pasp238r (Table I). To generate the IEGR sites in the linker region of LKR/SDH, four oligonucleotides were synthesized and paired with T3 or T7, respectively, for PCR amplifications. These included IEGR1/T3 (containing XcaI site and IEGR1 site), IEGR1/T7 (containingXcaI site), IEGR2/T3 (containing the AvrII site), and IEGR2/T7 (containing the AvrII site and IEGR2 site) (Table I). Four DNA fragments were amplified with IEGR1/T3 and T3, IEGR1/T7 and T7, IEGR2/T3 and T3, and IEGR2/T7 and T7 using SK-nHis-LKR/SDH as a template. The four DNA fragments were digested with XbaI or XhoI, blunt-ended, and cloned into the Bluescript SK plasmid. The resulting plasmids were named as SK-PCR1 (IEGR1/T3), SK-PCR2 (IEGR1/T7), SK-PCR3 (IEGR2/T3), and SK-PCR4 (IEGR2/T7). The XhoI-XcaI DNA fragment, generated by digestion of SK-PCR2 (IEGR1/T7) with XhoI andXcaI, was cloned into SK-PCR1 (IEGR1/T3) to obtain SK-nHis-LKR/SDH (IEGR1). The XhoI-AvrII DNA fragment, generated by digestion of SK-PCR4 (IEGR2/T7) withXhoI and AvrII, was cloned into SK-PCR3 (IEGR2/T3) to obtain SK-nHis-LKR/SDH (IEGR2). All constructs were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pVT-102u (16Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of all PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. The expression of the recombinant His-taggedArabidopsis LKR/SDH constructs in yeast cells and purification of their encoded proteins on a nickel column as well as SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (9Zhu X. Tang G. Granier F. Bouchez D. Galili D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Floral organs ofArabidopsis and developing grains of maize were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture with or without 10 mm EGTA). The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter. Total protein (300 mg) from plant extracts or 30 μg of purified protein from yeast cells was loaded into a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with or without 10 mm EGTA). Elution was performed with elution buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. High molecular weight protein marker mixture was run under the same conditions and detected by measuring the absorbance of each collected fraction at 280 nm. To monitor the eluted LKR or SDH polypeptides, individual fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-LKR or anti-SDH monoclonal antibodies. The kinetics of LKR activity was measured spectrophotometrically by determining the rate of NADPH oxidation at 340 nm for 10 min at 30 °C. The activity assays included ∼0.1 μg of nearly purified protein in 0.3 ml of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm Lys, 14 mm ketoglutarate, and 0.4 mm NADPH. In the experiments analyzing the NaCl effect on LKR activity, the 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer was replaced with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. One unit of LKR was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 nmol of NADPH per min at 30 °C. The kinetics of SDH activity was measured spectrophotometrically by determining the rate of NAD+ reduction at 340 nm for 10 min at 30 °C. The activity assays included ∼0.1 μg of protein from the nearly purified protein in 0.3 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 2 mm saccharopine and 2 mm NAD+. One unit of SDH was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the reduction 1 nmol of NAD+ per min at 30 °C. To test whether the structural conformation of LKR/SDH is affected by interactions between different domains of this bifunctional protein, we have used yeast as an expression system to produce recombinant wild type and mutant forms of the ArabidopsisLKR/SDH enzyme, fused to a His tag. We have previously shown that yeast represents a highly suitable system for this study and that the recombinant LKR/SDH constructs can be fused to various epitope tags without affecting LKR and SDH activities (14Zhu X. Tang G. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Zhu X. Tang G. Galili G. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 215-220PubMed Google Scholar). Becausein vitro LKR activity of the maize LKR/SDH was previously shown to be stimulated by NaCl (13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we used different NaCl concentrations as a means to alter the structural conformation of the recombinant Arabidopsis LKR/SDH-derived proteins and tested their effects on LKR activity. In addition, because we have used LKR and SDH activities as functional probes to identify interactions between the different domains of LKR/SDH, we have termed the observed interactions as “functional interactions.” To study whether the NaCl-mediated stimulation of LKR activity is dependent on the LKR domain itself or on a functional interaction of the LKR domain with other domains of LKR/SDH, we used five different constructs. These encoded the full-length LKR/SDH (Fig.1 a) as well as four truncated versions of LKR/SDH. These truncated versions included the LKR domain plus the linker region (LKR-LR), the LKR domain alone (LKR), the SDH domain plus the linker region (SDH-LR), the SDH domain alone (SDH), and an LKR/SDH lacking the linker region (LKR/SDHΔLR) (Fig. 1, b–f, respectively). As shown in Fig.2 A, LKR activity of the full-length LKR/SDH polypeptide was lowest in assays lacking NaCl and was progressively elevated by increasing NaCl concentrations, similar to the property of the maize LKR/SDH (13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, LKR activity of the two truncated polypeptides was much less affected by NaCl, and their LKR activities in the lower NaCl concentrations were significantly higher than that of the full-length LKR/SDH polypeptide. This suggested that the reduction of LKR activity in the LKR/SDH polypeptide in assays lacking NaCl was because of a functional interaction between the LKR domain with the SDH domain. Yet LKR activity of the LKR-LR polypeptide was higher than that of the LKR/SDH protein in assays containing 25–100 mm NaCl (Fig.2 A), implying that the linker region is not inert and also functionally interacts with the LKR domain.Figure 2Effect of NaCl on LKR activity of various recombinant Arabidopsis LKR/SDH enzymes expressed in yeast cells. The recombinant proteins were purified from yeast on a nickel column and analyzed for LKR activity under conditions of excess concentrations of all LKR substrates in solutions containing increasing NaCl concentrations.

The recombinant constructs are as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Bars represent the S.D. of four different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify whether the linker region plays any regulatory role in mediating the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains we expressed in yeast another construct in which the linker region was deleted and the LKR domain was directly linked to the SDH domain (Fig. 1 f). As shown in Fig. 2 B, LKR activity of this polypeptide was relatively insensitive to NaCl in a comparable manner to that of the monofunctional LKR (cf. Fig. 2, B withA). This implied that the linker region plays an important role in mediating the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains of LKR/SDH. Because the results of Fig. 2 A suggested some functional interaction between the linker region and the LKR domain, we wished also to test whether the structural conformation of the linker region is important for mediating the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains of LKR/SDH. To this end, we mutated the linker region of the LKR/SDH at two different places, introducing IEGR cleavage sites for the FactorX protease (Fig.3 A; IEGR1 andIEGR2). These mutations included replacement of three amino acids at each site (IANG to IEGR1 and NEDY to IEGR2) and did not alter the overall length of the linker region. In addition, these mutations were easily confirmed by cleavage with FactorX. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the IEGR1 mutation did not significantly affect the activity of LKR and its modulation by NaCl (cf.Fig. 3 B with Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the IEGR2 mutation abolished the NaCl-mediated stimulation of LKR activity, a trait related to the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains. This supported the results of Fig. 2 B and implied that the structural conformation of some parts of the linker region is important for the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains. We also analyzed whether SDH activity was altered in the truncated polypeptides LKR/SDH, LKR/SDHΔLR, SDH-LR, and SDH (Fig. 1) as well as in the two polypeptides with the linker region mutations (Fig. 3) compared with the wild type LKR/SDH. As opposed to LKR activity, no significant change in SDH activity was observed in any of these polypeptides as well as in any of the different NaCl concentrations used (data not shown). The linker region was shown to be important for the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains. However, it was still unknown whether the interaction itself occurs by direct affinity between these two domains or whether the linker region forces these domains to functionally interact. To test this issue we expressed separately in yeast cells either the SDH-LR, LKR-LR, SDH, or LKR domains of the Arabidopsis LKR/SDH (Fig.1, d, b, e, and c, respectively). The proteins were purified using a nickel column and brought to similar concentrations, as deduced from Coomassie Blue staining of their bands in SDS gel (Fig.4 A). We then mixed the LKR polypeptide with increasing amounts of either the SDH or SDH-LR polypeptides and the LKR-LR polypeptide with increasing amounts of the SDH polypeptide. The addition of up to an ∼8-fold excess molar amount of the SDH-LR to the LKR polypeptide (Fig. 4 B) as well as the SDH to the LKR (Fig. 4 C) or to the LKR-LR polypeptides (Fig. 4 D) had no effect on LKR activity. This suggests that the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains does not stem from affinity interaction between these two domains or between the LKR domain and the linker region. Although the results of Fig. 4 imply that the fully folded LKR and SDH domains do not interact, it is still possible that these domains can interact if allowed to fold together. To address this, mixtures containing increasing concentrations of the SDH or SDH-LR domains with the LKR or LKR-LR domains shown in Fig. 4 were unfolded with urea and then refolded in vitro using conditions that will optimally preserve the activities of both enzymes. In all of these unfolding/refolding cases, the SDH or SDH-LR polypeptides had no effect on LKR activity (data not shown). We also tested whether mixing of the LKR and SDH and LKR-LR and SDH as well as LKR and SDH-LR domains affected SDH activity. In all mixing experiments including those followed by unfolding and refolding no significant difference in SDH activity was observed (data not shown). Plant LKR/SDH enzymes are homodimers (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to test whether assembly of this bifunctional enzyme into a homodimer is mediated specifically by one of its three domains, namely the LKR, linker region, or SDH domains. To this end, purified recombinant polypeptides containing the full-length LKR/SDH, the monofunctional LKR domain, the monofunctional SDH domain, and the LKR/SDHΔLR (Fig. 1, a, c, e, andf, respectively) as well as molecular mass protein markers were each fractionated in parallel on a size exclusion column. Individual fractions were tested for the presence of the different LKR/SDH-related polypeptides. As shown in Fig.5, a–d, all polypeptides fractionated with the expected sizes of homodimers (nearly double the mass of the single subunit), implying that assembly is mediated by more than one domain of the LKR/SDH polypeptide. LKR activity of the maize and rice LKR/SDH enzymes is stimulated by calcium (12Gaziola A. Teixeira C.M.G. Lugli J. Sodek L. Azevedo R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequence and mechanism responsible for this regulation is not clear. Kemper et al. (13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) identify a conserved EF-hand-like domain in the C-terminal part of plant LKR/SDH proteins (VDILPTEFAKEASQHFG) and suggest that this domain may regulate the calcium-dependent stimulation of LKR activity in the maize LKR/SDH enzyme. In addition, in a recent review Arruda et al. (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) present a model in which this EF-hand-like domain operates via mediating the assembly of LKR/SDH into a homodimer. Yet another interesting property of this EF-hand-like region is that it contains a Ser residue (Ser-396) that is situated in a putative consensus site for phosphorylation by a calcium-dependent protein kinase. This is of particular interest, because we have previously shown that LKR activity in tobacco seeds is modulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in a calcium-dependent manner (10Karchi H. Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Galili G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). So far our attempts to detect a phosphorylation at this EF-hand-like region by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis were unsuccessful (see details under “Discussion”). 2X. Zhu and G. Galili, unpublished information.Nevertheless, we decided to test the effects of mutations of Ser-396 in this region to Asp or to Ala (mimicking a phosphorylation effect) on LKR activity and homodimer formation of the full-length LKR/SDH. As shown in Fig. 6 A, replacement of Ser-396 by Asp completely abolished LKR activity, whereas its replacement by Ala had no effect on LKR activity. In contrast, none of these mutations significantly affected SDH activity (Fig.6 B). In addition, as shown in Fig. 6 C, both the wild type and the two mutated polypeptides were homodimers as deduced from fractionation on size exclusion column. Because the results of Fig. 6 A did not support a regulatory role of the EF-hand-like sequence in the assembly of LKR/SDH into homodimer, we also tested whether this assembly is mediated by calcium as was previously proposed (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To this end, extracts from floral organs of Arabidopsis or developing maize grains were fractionated on a size exclusion column in the presence or absence of 10 mm calcium chelator EGTA, and individual fractions were reacted with anti-Arabidopsis LKR monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7, a–d, theArabidopsis and maize LKR/SDH were eluted as homodimers both in the absence or presence of the EGTA. Previous studies show that the soybean and maize LKR/SDH polypeptides are phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase 2 (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Karchi H. Galili G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1453-1458Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the casein kinase 2-dependent phosphorylation of the maize LKR/SDH stimulated LKR activity in a lysine-dependent manner (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To identify potential phosphorylation sites on the LKR domain of theArabidopsis LKR polypeptides, a His-tagged-purified LKR polypeptide band (see Fig. 4 A) was subjected to proteolysis followed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. This analysis identified two peptides containing a phosphorylated Thr-258 and Ser-458, which are both situated inside consensus casein kinase 2 phosphorylation sites (TFVE and SNPE, respectively). To test further whether any of these two amino acids regulate LKR activity, the wild type LKR/SDH cDNA was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to replace each of these two amino acids by Ala or Asp, and the mutants were expressed in yeast cells. As shown in Fig. 8 A, replacement of Thr-238 with either Ala or Asp had no significant effect on LKR activity. In contrast, replacement of Ser-458 with Ala significantly inhibited LKR activity, whereas its replacement with Asp had no significant effect of LKR activity. These results are consistent with the presence of a regulatory phosphorylation site on Ser-458. We also tested whether the mutations in Thr-238 and Ser-458 affect SDH activity of the LKR/SDH polypeptide. As shown in Fig. 8 B, none of the mutations significantly affected SDH activity. Although bifunctional polypeptides containing two linked enzymes are quite common in metabolic pathways, the significance of these phenomena is not clear. Such a linkage may enable more efficient substrate channeling between the two linked enzymes. However, this is clearly not the sole advantage because a number of the bifunctional enzymes, such as aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase of the aspartate-family pathway (6Galili G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 2002; 53: 27-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), do not contain two consecutive enzymes of a given metabolic pathway. LKR and SDH are two consecutive enzymes in the pathway of lysine catabolism (2Galili G. Tang G. Zhu X. Gakiere B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but our previous studies did not support substrate channeling between them (17Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Reches C. Schupper A. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that this linkage serves other regulatory purposes. Using the sensitivity of LKR activity to NaCl as a probe, we indeed demonstrated in the present report that LKR activity in LKR/SDH is modulated by functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains and to some extent also between the LKR domain and the linker region. In contrast, SDH activity is relatively constant and is not modulated by any of the potential structural interactions that we tested. To test whether the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains of LKR/SDH is mediated by specific affinity between these domains, we have expressed each of these domains on a separate polypeptide and mixed them in the test tube. The addition of more than ∼8-fold higher molar amounts of the SDH polypeptide to the LKR polypeptide did not inhibit LKR activity in incubation medium lacking NaCl, implying that the NaCl effect on LKR activity of LKR/SDH does not result from an affinity-mediated interaction between the LKR and SDH domains. In contrast, two lines of evidence implied that the linker region mediates the effect of the SDH domain on the activity of its linked LKR domain. First, deletion of the linker region, linking the LKR to the SDH domain, completely abolished the reduction of LKR activity under low NaCl conditions, and this polypeptide possessed nearly identical LKR activity to the polypeptide containing only the LKR domain. Second, mutation in one place of the linker region (Fig. 3; IEGR2) abolished the stimulation of LKR activity by NaCl. We therefore hypothesize that the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains of LKR/SDH is mediated by the structural conformation of the linker region. Alterations in the structural conformation of this linker region as a result of the NaCl concentration may enable the LKR and SDH domains to become either proximal or distal to each other, causing either an increase or decrease in LKR activity, respectively. The location of the SDH domain in proximal position to the LKR domain may interfere with LKR activity, perhaps by masking its ability to bind one of its substrates. In the IEGR2 mutant, the LKR and SDH domains may remain proximal to each other both in the low or high NaCl concentrations, hence rendering LKR relatively inactive. Our suggestion that the linker region is not inert but can modulate the structural conformation of the LKR/SDH polypeptide is also supported by the differential sensitivity of LKR activity to NaCl in the monofunctional LKR and LKR-LR polypeptides (Fig.2 A). Our results extend the previous results of Kemper et al.(13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who find that upon progressive proteolysis of a partially purified maize extract with elastase, LKR activity was first decreased and later started to increase, reaching near the LKR activity before the elastase treatment. After column fractionation of the elastase-treated extracts, the addition of excess amounts of fractions containing SDH activity to those containing LKR activity inhibited the activity of LKR. Although the nature of the protease-digested products was not identified, Kemper et al.(13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) conclude that LKR activity was inhibited by peptides derived from the SDH domain or the linker region, which were apparently present in the extract. As mentioned above, our results clearly show that the SDH domain, when present on a separate polypeptide, does not inhibit LKR activity. LKR activity of the maize and rice LKR/SDH enzymes is stimulated by calcium (12Gaziola A. Teixeira C.M.G. Lugli J. Sodek L. Azevedo R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Kemper E.L. Cord-Neto G. Capella A.N. Goncalves-Butruile M. Azevedo R.A. Arruda P. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1998; 253: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) identify a conserved EF-hand-like domain in the C-terminal region of the LKR domain of plant LKR/SDH enzymes and hypothesized that this domain promotes a calcium-dependent assembly of LKR/SDH into a homodimer and by that also stimulates LKR activity. We found that assembly of the Arabidopsis and maize LKR/SDH enzymes into homodimers is not calcium-dependent and that an ArabidopsisLKR/SDH polypeptide whose activity was lost due to a mutation in this EF-hand-like domain still assembled into a homodimer. Thus, our results imply that the EF-hand-like domain is essential for LKR activity but do not support the suggested function of this region in a calcium-mediated assembly of LKR/SDH into a homodimer. Does the EF-hand-like domain contain a phosphorylation site for a calcium-dependent protein kinase? The fact that replacement of the Ser-396 residue in this region with Asp, but not Ala, abolished LKR activity supports such a potential site (Asp has similar properties to a phosphorylated Ser). However, in an independent research, we have so far been unable to detect any phosphorylation of this Ser residue by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis.2 Nevertheless, we cannot eliminate the possibility that a minor undetectable fraction of the protein may have been phosphorylated at this site. In any event, if a phosphorylation occurs at this site, its inhibitory effect on LKR activity (as deduced from the Ser to Asp substitution) is certainly different from previously studied phosphorylations of LKR/SDH (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Karchi H. Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Galili G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,11Miron D. Ben-Yaacov S. Karchi H. Galili G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1453-1458Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which caused an induction of LKR activity. Additional studies are needed to solve this interesting observation. Previous studies indicate that LKR activity of plant LKR/SDH enzymes is regulated by phosphorylation with casein kinase 2 (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore search for such potential regulatory sites in the LKR domain using MALDI-TOF-MS analysis followed by site-directed mutagenesis. This analysis identified two phosphorylated amino acids, namely Thr-238 and Ser-458, both situated in a consensus casein kinase 2 phosphorylation site. However, although replacement of Ser-458 by Ala but not by Asp nearly eliminated LKR activity, similar mutations in Thr-238 had no effect. The inhibitory effect of replacing Ser-458 with Ala but not with Asp on LKR activity supports a positive regulatory role of Ser-458 phosphorylation on LKR activity. Thr-238 is apparently also phosphorylated in vivo, but our results do not support any regulatory function for such phosphorylation. Our results also do not rule out the presence of additional regulatory phosphorylation sites in the Arabidopsis LKR/SDH polypeptide. Although not studied directly, our results suggest that LKR activity of the LKR/SDH polypeptide is modulated by its linked SDH domain in vivo. Whether LKR activity is modulated by the ionic composition of the cytosol (the compartment in which LKR/SDH is localized in plant cells) (14Zhu X. Tang G. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Kemper E.L. Neto G.C. Papes F. Moraes K.C. Leite A. Arruda P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is not known. However, the ionic composition can vary significantly under abiotic stress conditions, in which expression of the LKR/SDH gene is up-regulated (8Moulin M. Deleu C. Larher F. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 577-585Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, functional interactions between the different domains of LKR/SDH may be responsible for the stimulation of LKR/SDH by lysine and its modulation by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, apparently of Ser-458 (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Karchi H. Shaul O. Galili G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The central role of the linker region in the functional interaction between the LKR and SDH domains and the inability of the LKR and SDH domains to functionally interact when present on different polypeptides may also be relevant to the regulation of lysine catabolism in animal and plant cells. First, amino acid sequence comparison of LKR/SDH polypeptides from various plants and animals show that the animal LKR/SDH lacks the linker region and that the LKR and SDH enzymes are directly linked to each other (1Arruda P. Kemper E.L. Papes F. Leite A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Galili G. Tang G. Zhu X. Gakiere B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Kemper E.L. Neto G.C. Papes F. Moraes K.C. Leite A. Arruda P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This suggests that the linker region has been evolved specifically in plants to acquire special regulatory properties of the LKR/SDH enzymes, which are not needed in animals. Because plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape stress, it may be possible that the linker region enables a fine regulation of lysine catabolism under stress conditions. Second, we have previously shown that the LKR/SDH gene of plants is a composite locus, which under certain conditions can also encode a monofunctional LKR and a monofunctional SDH enzymes as separate polypeptides (2Galili G. Tang G. Zhu X. Gakiere B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Galili G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 2002; 53: 27-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Tang G. Zhu X. Tang X. Galili G. Plant J. 2000; 23: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tang G. Zhu X. Gakiere B. Levanony H. Kahana A. Galili G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The monofunctional SDH is encoded by an internal promoter, whereas the monofunctional LKR is encoded by an intron-localized polyadenylation site within the coding region of the LKR/SDH gene. Our present results suggest that these two enzymes cannot functionally interact with each other and, hence, are not subjected to the same biochemical regulation of the bifunctional LKR/SDH locus."

The C14G mutants inhibited trypsin more strongly at 37 °C than did the C14A/C38A mutant, although bulky amino acids at position 14 largely diminished the inhibitory activity of the C38V mutants. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the enthalpy of unfolding of the C14G and C38V mutant groups differed considerably, which suggests different stabilizing mechanisms in these two groups.

Most disulfide (S–S) bonds in native proteins stabilize the protein structure. The removal of an S–S bond by reduction or by the substitution of other amino acids results in a marked destabilization of those proteins (1Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We are interested in determining which amino acid pair is best able to compensate for this loss of stability and to maintain the native structure under physiological conditions when an S–S bond is removed. To identify these mutations, screening is required to select the optimal substitute pair from the entire set of possible combinations of two amino acids (399 pairs). Methods that use a cellular quality control system have been developed to identify stable protein mutants from a large number of sequences (8Kieke M.C. Shusta E.V. Boder E.T. Teyton L. Wittrup K.D.

The quality control system in secretory pathways uses resident chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum to discriminate between native and incompletely folded structures in a broad range of proteins (11Ellgaard L.

In this pathway, native or correctly folded proteins are secreted, whereas misfolded proteins are retained and degraded within the cells. Moreover, the secretion efficiencies of proteins correlate with their stability (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our method combines screening based on the secretion efficiency of each protein detected by an antibody directed against a generic tag and a simple biophysical assay for comparing molecular weights (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this screening is independent of any prior knowledge of the target protein's functions, such as its enzymatic activity. Therefore, this method can be applied to identify novel sequences that form native structures. In previous work, we screened ∼30,000 sequences that encoded random mutations in an unstable bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)1 variant, which lacks two of three disulfide bonds (C14A/C30A and C38A/C51A), designated 1-SS BPTI, and identified mutations that stabilize the unstable BPTI variant (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). BPTI is widely used to study the mechanism of protein folding (19Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Kuroda Y. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It consists of 58 amino acids with three S–S bonds at positions 5–55, 14–38, and 30–51. These bonds are important for the stability of the native structure of BPTI (1,21–24). Although 1-SS BPTI, which lacks two S–S bonds, retains the native structure, the midpoint temperature of thermal unfolding (T m) is approximately 60 °C lower than that of wild-type BPTI, and 30 °C lower than that of 2-SS BPTI, which contains the mutations C14A/C38A and consequently lacks only one S–S bond. In this work we focused on the S–S bond between Cys-14 and Cys-38 and identified a more favorable combination than the C14A/C38A mutations. First, we made a library of mutant sequences that contained random mutations at residues 14 and 38 on the 1-SS BPTI template. This library was then screened on the basis of secretion efficiencies and a gel electrophoresis assay. With this screening technique, we identified new types of substitutions at positions 14 and 38 in addition to the C14G mutation identified in previous work (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We then measured the inhibitory activity, circular dichroism (CD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of these mutants. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RY810556–2B (MATα ura3–1 leu2–3, 112 his3–11, 15 can1–100) was a gift from G. Fink of the Whitehead Institute (Cambridge, MA). All transformations were performed with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). DNA fragments that encoded a signal sequence, a prosequence, a multicloning site, and a Flag-tag sequence were all inserted sequentially into p415GALS to create p415GSSE (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M.

Gene. 1991; 106: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutant BPTIs that varied in the random mutations at positions 14 and 38 were prepared by PCR usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). First, 5′ and 3′ DNA fragments that encoded the amino acid sequences corresponding to residues 1–17 and 32–58 were amplified using primers randomized at amino acid positions 14 and 38 and primers that contained sequences outside the cloning site. Next the whole BPTI sequence was amplified using the short DNA fragments thus prepared. PCR products were cloned into p415GSSE and transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene). The total number of colonies exceeded 20,000. Approximately 90% of the colonies contained successfully ligated plasmids. In the sequences of 28 randomly picked clones, no clear preference for specific amino acids at positions 14 and 38 was observed. The expression and detection of secreted proteins were carried out using previously described methods (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, in this work we omitted the second screening because the number of possible mutants (400) was much smaller than in the previous work. For on-plate immunodetection, plates of transformants were covered with a nitrocellulose membrane onto which secreted proteins transferred after 3–4 days of induction with 2% galactose. Cells that stuck to the membrane were washed off with water without cell disruption. In this experiment, only secreted proteins were bound to the membrane. Proteins were detected with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). The candidate clones were cultured for 2 days in natural liquid (YEP) medium, with 2% galactose instead of glucose as the carbon source (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001Google Scholar). Each culture medium was subjected to 5–20% nonreducing SDS-PAGE. An M2 antibody assay was used to detect proteins after Western blotting. Isolated DNAs that encoded the candidate mutant proteins and the original BPTI mutants were cloned into an E. coli expression vector, pAED4 (28Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, two control mutants that encoded the C14A/C38V and C14L/C38L mutations were prepared using PCR-based mutagenesis. The cloned sequences were designed to encode a start codon, residual amino acids from the prosequence, and an epitope tag. They were expressed inE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene) and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (29Yu M.H. Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In each case, the molecular weights of the purified proteins were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were found to be identical to the expected values calculated from their amino acid sequences (with an error of ±0.025%). CD spectra were collected with J-720 or J-820 spectropolarimeters (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 °C in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Thermal unfolding was monitored by the change in ellipticity at 222 nm at a protein concentration of 4 μm. The buffers used for thermal unfolding experiments contained 10 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5–3.8), sodium acetate (pH 4.1–5.5), or sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), with 150 mmNaCl and 1 mm EDTA. DSC measurements of 2-SS BPTI and two mutants (C14I/C38V and C14G/C38M/A27V) were made using a 6100 Nano II Differential Scanning Calorimeter (N-DSC II; Calorimetry Sciences Corp., American Fork, UT) in a buffer of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. For both CD and DSC measurements, the heating rate was 1 °C/min. In all CD measurements, more than 80% of CD signals were observed at room temperature after heat denaturation. In all DSC measurements, more than 80% of heat absorption was observed in the second run. CD and DSC results were analyzed on the basis of the two-state transition mechanism using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). In the analysis of the unfolding transitions detected by CD, the free energy change of unfolding at a given pH at temperature Twas:ΔGUpH(T)=(TmpH−T)TmpH−1{ΔHU,37−ΔCp(310.15−TmpH)}Equation 1 −(TmpH−T)ΔCp+TΔCp ln(TmpHT−1)where T mpH and ΔH U,37 are the midpoint temperature of thermal unfolding at a given pH and the enthalpy change from the native state to the unfolded state at 37 °C, respectively. In this analysis, we assumed ΔCp was constant. Because ΔH U,37 and ΔCp should be independent of pH, multiple CD unfolding curves at different pH values could be analyzed by global fitting using the same ΔH U,37 and ΔCp values. For DSC analysis, ΔCp was estimated to be the difference between the base-line values for the unfolded (BL U) and native (BL N) states. BL U and BL N are represented by BL U = BL U1 T + BL U2 andBL N = BL N1 T +BL N2, respectively. Thus, the ΔCpat temperature T is as follows.ΔCp(T)=(BLU1−BLN1)T+(BLU2−BLN2)Equation 2 Therefore, the enthalpy and entropy changes of unfolding are described, respectively, as follows.ΔHU(T)=ΔHU(Tm)−{0.5(BLU1−BLN1)(Tm2−T2)Equation 3 +(BLU2−BLN2)(Tm−T)}ΔSU(T)=ΔHU(Tm)Tm−1−{(BLU1−BLN1)(Tm−T)Equation 4 +(BLU2−BLN2)n(TmT−1)}The molar heat capacity, Cp(T), is calculated by the following equation, Cp(T)=ΔHU(T)2fu(1−fu)R−1T−2Equation 5 +(1−fu)(BLN1T−BLN2)+fu(BLU1T−BLU2)where f u is the fraction of molecules in the unfolded state calculated from the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation and Equations 3 and 4. Trypsin activity was assayed in the presence of various concentrations of BPTI mutants at 37 °C by monitoring, at 405 nm, the release of p-nitroanilide fromN-α-benzoyl-l-argininep-nitroanilide (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) (30Kassell B. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 844-853Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.1), 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 nmtrypsin (Pierce), and 0.5 mm substrate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate after preincubation of the inhibitor and trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. Inhibition at a stoichiometric concentration was determined by the linear extrapolation of measurements at different concentrations of inhibitor. The concentration of protein in the stock solution was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (31Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). We screened approximately 8000 clones on plates on the basis of the secretion efficiencies of target sequences (Fig. 1 A). Fifty-four clones that showed strong signals were selected and cultured in liquid medium for further screening. The supernatants of these cultures were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotting. Eighteen clones that produced intense bands were selected and sequenced (Fig. 1 B). The mutations in the selected clones are summarized in Table I.Table IMutations in isolated clones, Tm at pH 7.4, and inhibition of trypsinGroupsMutations at positions 14/38 (mutation at another position)T m1-aIn this work, the thermocouple was soaked in the cell to measure the temperature of the solution more precisely.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab Because 1-SS BPTI carries the C14A/C38A mutations and is unstable at 30 °C, this sequence is recognized by the quality control system to be unfolded and is not secreted (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutations identified here are considered to be better than the C14A/C38A mutations as substitutes for the S–S bond. Interestingly, all the sequences could be divided into two groups: one group contained mutants with the C14G mutation and the other contained mutants with the C38V mutation. In the C14G group, the mutations at position 38 were Leu, Val, Met, or Gln. In the other group, the mutations at position 14 were Leu, Val, Ile, or Met. The C14L/C38V and C14I/C38V mutations were found in nine and two clones, respectively. It is unclear why the C14L mutation was over-represented, because we did not observe this mutation at such a high frequency in the sequences of randomly picked clones. Two isolated sequences had unexpected mutations at positions other than 14 and 38 (A16T and A27V). The identified mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified. To compare the stability of these mutants with that of 1-SS BPTI and 2-SS BPTI, thermal unfolding experiments were carried out by performing CD at a neutral pH. All of these mutants displayed T m values higher than that of 1-SS BPTI, which indicates that the amino acid pairs substituted in these mutants fit better at positions 14 and 38 than the C14A/C38A pair (Table I and Fig. 2 A). The far-UV CD spectra of these mutants were very similar to those of 1-SS BPTI and 2-SS BPTI, and the intensities of the peaks deviated only slightly from each other, which indicates that all the mutants have similar levels of secondary structure (Fig. 2 B). To further clarify the effect of the C38V mutation, two control mutants with C14A/C38V and C14L/C38L mutations were prepared (Table I). Both these control mutants displayed lower T m values than those of the C38V mutants, suggesting the importance of both the Val at position 38 and a hydrophobic residue at position 14 (see “Discussion”). To examine the effects of mutations on inhibitory activity, we measured the activity of trypsin in the presence of various concentrations of the obtained mutants, 1-SS BPTI, and 2-SS BPTI at 37 °C (Table I). The C14G mutant group inhibited trypsin in a stoichiometric manner, although 1-SS BPTI showed approximately 60% inhibition at this temperature. More than 50% of 1-SS BPTI molecules were unfolded under these reaction condition, and therefore more than a stoichiometric concentration of 1-SS BPTI was required to inhibit trypsin. On the other hand, only very weak or no inhibitory activity was observed in the C38V mutant group. Lys-15 in BPTI constitutes the P1 site in the inhibition of trypsin, and mutation of this residue markedly decreases the inhibitory activity of BPTI (32Castro M.J. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11435-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the C14A/C38V mutant exhibited some degree of inhibitory activity (50%), a bulky side chain at position 14 may reduce the binding affinity of BPTI to trypsin in the C38V mutant group. This result confirmed the uniqueness of our screening method. Mutants with greater stability but lower activity are rarely identified by conventional activity-based screening such as directed evolution. By contrast, our screening technique can identify this type of mutant because the cellular quality control system can directly recognize the structural status of the target protein. To characterize these mutants thermodynamically, thermal unfolding transitions detected by ellipticity at 222 nm were measured at a minimum of six different pH values for each sequence and were analyzed by global fitting (Fig. 3 A). At these pH values,T m values ranged from ∼30 °C to ∼50 °C in both mutant groups. It is noteworthy that the enthalpy of unfolding at 37 °C (ΔH U,37) differed significantly between the two groups of mutants (Fig. 4). The averaged ΔH U,37 values for the C38V group and C14G group were 180 ± 7 and 221 ± 7 kJ/mol, respectively. We also checked whether this difference was apparent in DSC measurements. The enthalpy values at the T m values calculated from DSC measurements for C14I/C38V (C38V group) and C14G/C38M/A27V (C14G group) were 187 and 241 kJ/mol, respectively (Fig. 3 B). From CD measurements, the ΔH U,37 values for the C14I/C38V and C14G/C38M/A27V mutants were calculated to be 184 and 229 kJ/mol, respectively. The difference in enthalpy values between the two mutants calculated from DSC was 54 kJ/mol, which is similar to the difference in ΔH U,37 calculated from CD measurements (45 kJ/mol) and confirms the clear difference in enthalpy values between the two groups. It has been reported that ΔCp of wild-type BPTI is 3.0 kJ/mol at 25 °C and 2.6 kJ/mol at 50 °C (33Makhatadze G.I. Kim K.S. Woodward C. Privalov P.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The ΔCp of unfolding for 2-SS BPTI was estimated to be 3.5 kJ/mol from CD measurements and 2.7 kJ/mol from DSC values (24Liu Y. Breslauer K. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5323-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our experiments the ΔCp values for mutants estimated from thermal unfolding detected by CD ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 kJ/mol. ΔCp values were also calculated from the differences between the base-line values of the native and unfolded states with DSC. The ΔCp values of 2-SS BPTI, C14I/C38V, and C14G/C38V/A27V at T m were estimated to be 1.9, 2.2, and 1.4 kJ/mol, respectively. These values were also used to analyze heat absorption curves and produced a good fit to the raw data (Fig. 3 B). We have identified two types of mutations at positions 14 and 38 to substitute for the S–S bond: C14G and C38V mutant groups. Although these mutants were less stable than 2-SS BPTI which has an S–S bond between 14 and 38, they exhibited T m values 12–17 °C higher than that of the C14A/C38A mutant (1-SS BPTI). Furthermore, the C14G group inhibited trypsin in a stoichiometric manner at 37 °C, whereas 1-SS BPTI showed only 60% inhibition. These results confirm that our screening method can be used generally to identify mutations that can substitute for S–S bonds. The T m of C14V/C38V was 47 °C, and this mutant was the least stable of the selected mutants. Because the C14L/C38L mutant was not selected by screening, the thresholdT m of the mutants that were selected by this screening method should be between 42 and 47 °C. This threshold temperature is slightly lower than that published elsewhere (16Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but is higher than the temperature for yeast growth (30 °C). It can be seen from the CD transition that a small proportion of the unstable mutant proteins are unfolded at 30 °C, e.g. 5% of the C14L/C38L mutants are unfolded at 30 °C. The quality control system may trap unfolded molecules and could thus gradually degrade whole fractions of unstable mutants. Liu et al. (24Liu Y. Breslauer K. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5323-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) systematically studied mutations substituted for the S–S bond between positions 30 and 51 of BPTI. Of the eight mutants examined, the C30V/C51A mutant was the only pair of mutations more stable than C30A/C51A. Proba et al. (34Proba K. Wörn A. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) constructed a sequence library in which the two S–S-forming cysteine residues at positions 23 and 88 of the variable domain of a single-chain antibody were replaced by Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, or Phe; the total number of variant amino acid pairs was 25. From this library, they identified the pairs C23A/C88A and C23V/C88A using a phage display method, which suggests that Ala/Ala and Val/Ala are good substitutes for the S–S bond. However, in this work we identified better mutations than Val/Ala and Ala/Ala (Table I). It is plausible that searching larger numbers of pairs allowed us to identify even better pairs to substitute for S–S bonds. In previous work (10Hagihara Y. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we found that the C14G/C38A mutant was more stable than 1-SS BPTI, which contains the C14A/C38A mutations. Thus, Gly fits better at position 14 than Ala. In the present study, the mutations that occurred at position 38 with C14G were Leu, Met, Val, and Gln. These mutations increased the T m by 2–5 °C compared with C14G/C38A, which indicates that a hydrocarbon at the γ and/or δ positions contributed to the increase in stability. However, the difference between the C14G/C38L and C14G/C38V mutants is small and suggests that the specificity of the amino acid at position 38 is not so critical when it occurs with the C14G mutation. In addition to the C14G mutation, the C38V mutation was identified in this work. Because all the mutated amino acids at position 14 in the C38V group were hydrophobic, we constructed a control mutant, C14A/C38V, to examine the effect of hydrophobic amino acids at position 14. Although the T m of C14A/C38V was more than 6 °C lower than those of the C38V mutant group, this mutant exhibited a T m 6 °C higher than that of C14A/C38A (1-SS BPTI). Therefore, the hydrophobic amino acid at position 14 in the C38V group contributed about half the increase inT m in this group. Furthermore, Val at position 38 is more favorable for BPTI structure than Ala. To confirm the specificity of the C38V mutation, we compared the C14L/C38V mutant with the second control mutant, C14L/C38L. The C14L/C38L mutant was 6 °C less stable than C14L/C38V, indicating that Val fits better at position 38 than Leu when position 14 contains amino acids other than Gly. From the comparison of T m values between Ala and Leu mutations at partner positions in each group, we found that the contributions of hydrophobic amino acids at partner positions were different between the C14G and C38V mutant group. The difference inT m between C14G/C38A and C14G/C38L was 4 °C. On the other hand, the difference between C14A/C38V and C14L/C38V was 7 °C. Therefore, the hydrophobic amino acid in the partner position produced greater stability with the C38V mutation than with the C14G mutation. An S–S bond is the most appropriate structure at positions 14 and 38 in terms of T m. The 2-SS BPTI mutant displayed a ΔH U,37 (208 kJ/mol) slightly smaller than that of the C14G group (221 ± 7 kJ/mol), and thus 2-SS BPTI was entropically more stable than the C14G mutants. The entropy of unfolding at 37 °C and pH 7.4 (ΔS U,37pH7) was calculated for each mutant group from the ΔH U,37 andT m values at pH 7.4. The average ΔS U,37pH7 values for the C38V and C14G groups were estimated to be 559 ± 21 J/K/mol and 683 ± 20 J/K/mol, respectively. On the other hand, ΔS U,37pH7 for 2-SS BPTI was 616 J/K/mol, which is intermediate between the ΔS U,37pH7 values for the C38V and C14G groups. Therefore, in entropy terms, the C38V mutation constitutes a better fit than the S–S bond. In the classical chain entropy model, an S–S bond is considered to stabilize the native state of a protein by reducing the entropy of the unfolded state (35Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this result shows that the S–S bond between residues 14 and 38 in BPTI plays a more complex role and contributes to both enthalpic and entropic energies. Similar observations have been reported for the S–S bonds in other proteins (2Zavodszky M. Chen C.W. Huang J.K. Zolkiewski M. Wen L. Krishnamoorthi R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Kuroki R. Inaka K. Taniyama Y. Kidokoro S. Matsushima M. Kikuchi M. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8323-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) Both mutant groups shared similar T m values at neutral pH values. However, thermodynamic analysis revealed that their enthalpy values of unfolding differed considerably (Fig. 4). In terms of enthalpy, the C14G mutation was favored compared with the C38V mutation. On the other hand, the C38V mutants showed much smaller entropy values (ΔS U,37pH7 = 559 J/K/mol) than those of the C14G mutants (683 J/K/mol), indicating that the C38V mutants are more stable than the C14G mutants in terms of entropy. The difference in the favored thermodynamic parameters in the two groups suggests that a different mechanism operates to stabilize the structures of the mutants, although an understanding of the origin of the difference requires further experimentation with techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography. Disulfide bonds occur in many industrially and pharmaceutically important proteins such as proteases and antibodies. Renaturation of these S–S bonds is one of the most challenging issues in the production of recombinant proteins, especially when the products accumulate in inclusion bodies in E. coli (37Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 38Fink A.L. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Elimination of even one S–S bond critically decreases the possible combinations of S–S bonding patterns and results in a higher yield of renatured proteins. Therefore, our screening method should provide a useful tool with which to increase the production of recombinant protein by removing S–S bonds with minimal stability loss."

NF-κB translocation can be induced in certain target populations with anti-Fas mAb or cross-linked recombinant soluble FasL (rsFasL).

However, the relative capacity of the physiologically derived full-length FasL or sFasL to induce NF-κB nuclear translocation has not been reported. This is an important question because sFasL displays distinct properties and can regulate various functions of membrane FasL.We have shown recently (28Jodo S. Xiao S. Hohlbaum A.M. Strehlow D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39938-39944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that cells transfected with human FasL gene produce not only the expected transmembrane FasL and sFasL but also microvesicles (FasL VP) that express the transmembrane protein. Cleavage of the membrane FasL at position 130 yields a 152-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 26,000–27,000 daltons (24Kayagaki N. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S.

The released sFasL exist as a trimeric unit with a molecular mass of 81,000 daltons (31Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In most cases, sFasL not only fails to induce apoptosis of Fas+ targets but, when in great excess, can actually inhibit the cytotoxicity mediated by the cell-bound membrane FasL (30Tanaka M. Itai T. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 32Suda T. Hashimoto H. Tanaka M. Ochi T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). By contrast, FasL VP remains cytotoxic against the same targets that are sensitive to the parental FasL-expressing cell lines from which the FasL VP is prepared. Interestingly, sFas is able to kill certain transfected target populations that overexpress Fas (31Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In addition, thymocytes, which express a high level of Fas (33Drappa J. Brot N. Elkon K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10340-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), are moderately sensitive to sFasL (31Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar).To explain this conundrum, we hypothesize that sFasL directly induces signal transduction only in targets whose focal Fas expression (local density) is very high such as can be found on thymocytes andfas-transfected cell lines. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the ability of noncytotoxic anti-Fas mAb to create micro-clusters of Fas, and we demonstrated that such treated cells become highly responsive to sFasL. Target cells that are resistant to killing by either agent alone became highly sensitive in a fashion that indicates a synergy for the induction of apoptosis signal had occurred. In addition, the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAb was extended to the NF-κB signaling pathway in target cells expressing high levels of FLIP that inhibits the apoptosis pathway. We demonstrated that nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer could be induced by FasL VP but not by sFasL or anti-Fas mAb alone. However, NF-κB nuclear translocation was effectively induced when both sFasL and anti-Fas mAb were used. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which each sFasL trimer can signal through anti-Fas-induced micro-clusters of Fas and that membrane-bound FasL possesses both the ability to form micro-clusters of Fas and the ability to transduce the Fas-mediated signals. The dual functions of membrane-bound FasL could explain its effectiveness in inducing Fas-mediated signaling pathways.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe a novel property of sFasL, namely that it can act in synergy with anti-Fas mAb in activating the Fas-mediated signal transduction pathways. We demonstrate that sFasL acts in synergy with several anti-Fas mAbs in killing Fas+ targets even though neither agent alone induces apoptosis of the target cells. In addition, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of the p65/p50 NF-κB can be induced by a mixture of sFasL and anti-Fas mAb but not by either agent alone. We have demonstrated this synergy with sFasL prepared from two different FasL-expressing cell lines and four different anti-Fas mAbs. The targets we have examined include tumor cell lines and freshly obtained normal lymphocytes from thymus, spleen, and lymph node. 2S. Jodo and S.-T. Ju, manuscript in preparation. These observations indicate that the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs is a general phenomenon applicable to various anti-Fas mAb and cell populations. Although the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs induces only a moderate signal for p65/p50 NF-κB nuclear translocation, synergy for apoptosis is very potent. Not only a high percentage of target cells were killed but the killing was also acutely induced within a short period of 5 h. Our analysis supports a model in which sFasL with a single binding site for Fas could induce activation and apoptotic signals in cells that express a high focal density of Fas through antibody-mediated focusing.Cross-linking of Fas on the cell membrane induces apoptosis of sensitive targets. However, there are many exceptions and variations to this over-generalized paradigm. Under the experimental conditions of the 5-h cytotoxicity assay, FasL-expressing cells and FasL VP could effectively kill IIA1.6 and LF+ targets, whereas sFasL or anti-Fas mAbs could not (Fig. 2). In addition, both sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs inhibit both cell-mediated and the FasL VP-mediated cytotoxicity,2 indicating that sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs competed with membrane FasL for Fas binding. Thus, it was not predicted that a combination of sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs would deliver a strong Fas-mediated apoptotic signal to the very same target cells (Fig. 3). The synergy is interesting because both sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs bind to Fas, a situation under which competition for binding might be expected. Competition between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs has not been addressed in previous studies, although citing unpublished observations, Nishimuraet al. claimed inhibition of sFasL binding by Jo2 but not by RK-8 (44Nishimura Y. Hirabayashi Y. Matsuzaki Y. Musette P. Ishii A. Nakauchi H. Inoue T. Yonehara S. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, by using target cells that are sensitive to sFasL, we have been unable to inhibit killing with several anti-Fas mAbs to which the target cells are resistant (data not shown).2 Therefore, the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs is compatible with the interpretation that they bind to different regions of the Fas molecule. We favor this interpretation also because synergy in killing was observed with a wide dose range of sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs (Fig. 2).Physiologically derived sFasL trimers have been shown to induce apoptosis in certain Fas-transfected target populations (31Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 45Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.-L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). We showed that purified sFasL bearing a molecular mass of <100,000 daltons can act in synergy with Jo2 to kill IIA1.6 target. This indicates that the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs is not solely due to enhanced cross-linking of the anti-Fas-Fas complex. Indeed, apoptosis was not observed when IIA1.6 cells were cultured with combinations of various anti-Fas mAbs (data not shown). In addition, synergy between anti-Fas mAb was not observed with either FasL VP or FasL-expressing cells (in limiting dose); the latter are multivalent and independently capable of both cross-linking Fas and engaging the physiological binding site. A recent study (46Aoki K. Kurooka M. Chen J.-J. Petryniak J. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggests that sFasL may bind to matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen IV, which could be found as trace components in serum. However, cross-linking by serum components was unnecessary in our system because synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs was also observed when assays were conducted in serum-free medium using targets adapted to growing in such medium (data not shown).The synergy in Fas-mediated signaling between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs is not restricted to apoptosis because sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs also act in synergy to induce nuclear translocation of p65/p50 NF-κB (Fig. 6). It has been demonstrated that Fas cross-linking by FLAG-tagged rsFasL in the presence of anti-FLAG antibodies could induce a signaling complex that contains Fas-associated death domain and FLIP. Aggregated FLIP attracts Raf-1 and TRAF1/2 to the complex to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and NF-κB pathways, respectively (20Kataoka T. Budd R.C. Holler N. Thome M. Martinon F. Irmler M. Burns K. Hahne M. Kennedy N. Kovacsovics M. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). As FLIP inhibits apoptosis, FLIP expression level could dictate which pathway is activated upon cross-linking Fas. Such a correlation was observed in the present study between apoptosis-prone, FasL VP-sensitive IIA1.6 and apoptosis-resistant, FasL VP-resistant K3 targets. Indeed, the FLIP mRNA levels in K3 are significantly higher than IIA1.6, and NF-κB translocation to nucleus could be induced by FasL VP in K3 hybridoma T cells but not in IIA1.6 cells. As with the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs for the induction of apoptosis of IIA1.6 cells, the p65/p50 NF-κB nuclear translocation in K3 hybridoma T cells could not be induced by anti-Fas mAbs or sFasL alone but required the simultaneous presence of both agents. These observations indicate that the synergy between sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs occurs at the step before the FLIP-regulated bifurcation of the apoptotic pathway and the NF-κB activation pathway. The data suggest that the synergy occurs at the level of membrane binding and its immediate signaling event. The data do not support the hypothesis that sFasL and anti-Fas mAbs induce separate signals, and synergy occurs as a result of merging of the two independently induced signals.It should be noted that many receptor/ligand systems such as IL-2 and IL-4 transduce signals without the apparent cross-linking of their receptors. Indeed, even the soluble tumor necrosis factor-α, a close family member of FasL, transduces a signal without the need for cross-linking. It will be of interest to determine whether synergy in killing could be demonstrated with tumor necrosis factor-α and anti-TNFRI mAbs, although this could be complicated by the influence of TNFRII signaling (47Jupp O.J. McFarlane S.M. Anderson H.M. LittleJohn A.F. Mohamed A.A.A. Mackay R.H. Vanderabeele P. MacEwan D.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reason why the sFasL trimer that displays a single binding site for Fas can induce apoptosis in certain targets has not been addressed in previous studies. The targets that are sensitive are usually derived by transfection with the fas gene or naturally express a very high level of Fas (as is the case with thymocytes). Based on the present study, we propose a model to explain how membrane Fas binding activates the Fas-dependent downstream signaling pathways (Fig. 7). We hypothesize that physiologic engagement of a micro-cluster of Fas trimers is required to activate effectively the Fas-mediated signal transduction pathways. The engagement of Fas by sFasL may lead to a conformational or biochemical change of Fas, but only a cluster of such modified molecules can lead to the formation of an effective signaling complex, and anti-Fas mAb can bring about such clusters on target cell membranes. Because anti-Fas antibodies do not engage Fas in a manner comparable with physiological FasL, they can effectively facilitate cluster formation but are less effective in their capacity to induce signal transduction. Conversely, sFasL is ineffective in signal transduction because it does not have the ability to generate micro-clusters of Fas. Our hypothesis is supported by studies using confocal microscopy, which demonstrated micro-cluster formation by anti-Fas mAb and synergy in apoptosis by the co-presence of anti-Fas mAb and sFasL (Fig. 7). A similar hypothesis based on the synergy observed between recombinant sFasL and ceramide has been proposed (29Cremesti A. Paris F. Grassmé H. Holler N. Tschopp J. Fuks Z. Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23954-23961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In this case, the presence of ceramide around the Fas-associated micro-domain allows the recombinant sFasL to cap Fas and transduce an apoptotic signal (NF-κB signaling was not determined). Interestingly, anti-Fas cross-linking activates acidic sphingomyelinase to generate ceramide. Regardless whether ceramide is involved in our model, under physiological conditions membrane FasL, expressed on cells or vesicles, possesses both the ability to form micro-clusters of Fas and the ability to transduce signals. Thus, membrane FasL is the most effective physiologically derived ligand for the activation of Fas-mediated signaling pathways.In conclusion, four major points are made in this study. First, we show that sFasL acts in synergy with noncytotoxic anti-Fas mAb in Fas-mediated signal transduction. Second, the synergy is demonstrated for both the apoptotic signaling pathway and the p65/p50 NF-κB nuclear translocation pathway. Third, the synergy in signaling for NF-κB nuclear translocation or apoptosis correlates with the FLIP mRNA levels in target cells. Fourth, FasL VP, a physiological form of vesicles bearing full-length FasL, is capable of activating both signaling pathways depending on the FLIP level of target cells. The information has relevance to our understanding of Fas-mediated signaling transduction pathway at the membrane level.

Since antidepressants are neither agonists nor antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors, receptor density must be regulated through processes independent of direct receptor activation. Endocytosis and recycling of the β1AR fused to green fluorescent protein at its carboxyl-terminus (β1AR-GFP) were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy of live cells and complementary ligand binding studies. In stably transfected C6 glioblastoma cells, β1AR-GFP displayed identical ligand-binding isotherms and adenylyl cyclase activation as native β1AR. Upon exposure to isoproterenol, a fraction of β1AR-GFP (10–15%) internalized rapidly and colocalized with endocytosed transferrin receptors in an early endosomal compartment in the perinuclear region. Chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) did not affect internalization characteristics of β1AR-GFP when challenged with isoproterenol. However, internalized receptors were not able to recycle back to the cell surface in DMI-treated cells, whereas recycling of transferrin receptors was not affected. Endocytosed receptors were absent from structures that stained with fluorescently labeled dextran, and inhibition of lysosomal protease activity did not restore receptor recycling, indicating that β1AR-GFP did not immediately enter the lysosomal compartment. The data suggest a new mode of drug action causing a “switch” of receptor fate from a fast recycling pathway to a slowly exchanging perinuclear compartment.

Antidepressant-induced reduction of receptor surface expression may thus be caused by modulation of receptor trafficking routes. β-adrenoceptor(s) desipramine β1-adrenoceptor(s) β2-adrenoceptor(s) fusion protein of β1AR with GFP green fluorescent protein β1AR-GFP expressing rat C6 glioblastoma cells G protein-coupled receptor enhanced GFP Chronic treatment with most classes of antidepressants leads to a reduction in the number of central postsynaptic β-adrenoceptors (βAR)1 in vivoand of surface βAR density in cell cultures (1Banerjee S.P.

Disler B. Wiesmann U.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This effect is reported to be specific for the β1-adrenoceptor subtype (5Ordway G.A. Gambarana C. Frazer A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar, 6Riva M.A. Creese I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 211-218PubMed Google Scholar). βAR down-regulation is accompanied by decreased receptor-stimulated cAMP formation (7Vetulani J. Sulser F. Nature. 1975; 257: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The two major effects at the molecular level become apparent in vivo after 10–20 days of drug administration and coincide with the onset of clinical antidepressant response in humans. Therefore βAR down-regulation and diminished cAMP response to catecholamines may relate to the therapeutic action of antidepressants. It has been proposed that the reduction in the number of functional βAR could be a regulatory response to the enhanced presence of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft after acute inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake or of monoamine oxidase activity by antidepressants (1Banerjee S.P. Kung L.S. Nature. 1977; 268: 455-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 8Wolfe B.B. Harden T.K. Sporn J.R. Molinoff P.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1978; 207: 446-457PubMed Google Scholar). Some clinically effective antidepressants, however, neither influence norepinephrine reuptake nor inhibit monoamine oxidase activity but still cause a βAR down-regulation. Furthermore, this model fails to explain the observed time lag between the rapid drug-induced increase in intrasynaptic neurotransmitter concentrations and the delayed receptor down-regulation. Decreased βAR densities following antidepressant treatment can also be seen in cell culture systems lacking a presynaptic input,e.g. in cultured rat C6 glioblastoma cells (9Fishman P.H. Finberg J.P. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Kientsch U. Bürgi S. Ruedeberg C. Probst S. Honegger U.E. Pharmacopsychiatry. 2001; 34: 56-60Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, βAR down-regulation may directly result from postsynaptic actions of the antidepressants. Previous studies have shown that chronic treatment of cultured cells with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) induces phospholipidosis by inhibition of lysosomal phospholipid degradation, leading to changes in membranous and total phospholipid compositions (11Toplak H. Zuehlke R. Loidl S. Hermetter A. Honegger U.E. Wiesmann U.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Altered membrane properties may directly influence receptor function or have an effect on vesicular membrane traffic and therefore on βAR endocytosis and recycling. Desensitization of βAR after agonist exposure induces receptor endocytosis, protecting cells from overstimulation. It is mediated by uncoupling the activated βAR from the GS protein and internalization of receptor from the plasma membrane to early endosomes (12Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 13Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 145-151Google Scholar, 14Carman C.V.

Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). While β2-adrenoceptor desensitization is well studied, much less is known about the mechanism of β1-adrenoceptor desensitization (16Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 17Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Within seconds of agonist binding, β1- and β2-adrenoceptors are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (18Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar,19Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation promotes the binding of the cytosolic protein β-arrestin, which inhibits the ability of the βAR to couple to GS (20Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin then targets the phosphorylated receptor to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis (21Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The modes of internalization and recycling of β1-adrenoceptors (β1AR) are not known in detail. β2-Adrenoceptors (β2AR) are internalized via a dynamin-dependent mechanism through clathrin-coated pits similar to the transferrin receptor (22von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). There is a significant difference in the rate of internalization between the β1- and β2-adrenoceptor subtypes. β2AR are efficiently endocytosed following agonist stimulation, whereas β1AR undergo only slight internalization. The low affinity of the activated β1AR for β-arrestin may provide an explanation for the small extent of internalization (24Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In early endosomes, βAR are dephosphorylated and subsequently recycle back via a perinuclear compartment to the plasma membrane in a fully resensitized state (25Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 26Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Prolonged agonist treatment for several hours causes down-regulation of total receptor number (28Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The currently accepted model for βAR down-regulation postulates that during chronic agonist exposure, endocytosed βAR do not recycle to the plasma membrane but are sorted to lysosomes, where they are degraded by proteases (29Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Moore R.H. Tuffaha A. Millman E.E. Dai W. Hall H.S. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Jockers et al. (31Jockers R. Angers S., Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have recently reported that β2AR down-regulation is fully maintained upon inhibition of receptor endocytosis and blockade of the lysosomal and ubiquitin proteasome pathway, suggesting that the primary inactivation step may occur at the plasma membrane. There is evidence in some cell lines that βAR mRNA levels are decreased during long term exposure to agonist, resulting in a reduced receptor synthesis (32Collins S. Bouvier M. Bolanowski M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4853-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Huang L.-Y. Tholanikunnel B.G. Vakalopoulou E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25769-25775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether antidepressant-induced β1AR down-regulation requires one of these molecular mechanisms is unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the reduction of β1AR cell surface density observed in cultured rat C6 glioblastoma cells following chronic DMI treatment is caused by drug-induced changes in receptor trafficking. Endocytosis and recycling of the β1AR fused to green fluorescent protein (β1AR-GFP) were therefore compared in untreated and chronically DMI-treated C6 cells using a complementary approach of confocal fluorescence microscopy and ligand binding studies. Materials for cell culture were supplied by Sigma and Invitrogen. Unless otherwise mentioned, all chemicals (analytical grade), were from Sigma or from Merck. Wild-type human β1AR DNA was retrieved from pSP65-β1AR (a gift from Dr. Susanna Cotecchia, University of Lausanne) with EcoRI and ApaI and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at the respective restriction sites. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP; Clontech) was fused to the carboxyl terminus of the human β1AR. The 3′-end sequences of β1AR including the stop codon were removed withTfiI. To restore the 3′-end of the coding sequence and to create a suitable BamHI restriction site at the 3′-end for fusion to EGFP, the synthetic complementary oligonucleotides 5′-AATCCAAGGTGGATCTGCAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTGCAGATCCACCTTGG-3′ were used for the ligation to pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The predicted nucleotide sequence of the fusion region was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the resultant construct, β1AR-GFP. The synthetic linker sequence between β1AR and EGFP encodes the amino acids ESKVDLQ, whereby the amino acids ESKV restore the original carboxyl terminus of the β1AR. Rat C6 glioblastoma cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) were maintained in Eagle's high glucose minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.7 g/liter NaHCO3, 200 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml chlortetracycline at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were passaged once a week and replated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. For transfection, cells were grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm dishes. The β1AR-GFP plasmid (6 μg) was linearized with AflIII and mixed with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were exposed to the DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture for 8 h. Two days after transfection cells were trypsinized, diluted, and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 15,000 cells/well. Stably transfected cells were selected with Geneticin G418 (500 μg/ml; Calbiochem) that was added to the culture medium 3 days after transfection. Wells with cells that were resistant to the antibiotic were identified 2 weeks after transfection. Cells were then reseeded into 96-well plates at limiting dilutions to establish clonal C6-β1AR-GFP cell lines. Cell lines with highest expression levels of the receptor were identified by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transiently transfected with 5 μg of either wild-type β1AR or β1AR-GFP DNA, essentially as described earlier (34Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Jaspers S.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28937-28946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the cAMP assay, COS-1 cells were seeded into 24-well dishes at a density of 15,000 cells/well and transiently transfected with 3 μg of β1AR or β1AR-GFP DNA per 24 wells. Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Untransfected and transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing either wild-type β1AR or β1AR-GFP as well as untransfected rat C6 or stably transfected C6-β1AR-GFP cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into ice-cold buffer 1 (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Following two freeze/thaw cycles to disrupt the cells, the resulting suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated for 30 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 2 min, and the supernatants were collected. Proteins from these membrane extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. The blots were then probed with antibodies to the β1AR (Calbiochem) or GFP (Clontech) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Bound antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The number of cell surface βAR was determined in intact C6 and COS-1 cells using the hydrophilic βAR antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 (Amersham Biosciences). The cells were gently scraped into Hanks' solution (1.25 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 5.5 mm d-(+)-glucose·H2O, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 137 mm NaCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4·2H2O) at room temperature. 200 μl of this cell suspension and 50 μl of radioligand solution (final concentrations 0.5–10 nm[3H]CGP-12177) were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of the antagonist timolol (1 μm). The number of total cellular βAR was determined using the membrane-permeant radioligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were harvested in Hanks' solution, pelleted, lysed in 5 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, and subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles. This cell lysate was diluted 1:12 with binding buffer (75 mm Tris/HCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Triplicates (200 μl each) of the diluted lysate were incubated with 50 μl of radioligand solution (final plateau concentrations 10–14 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 μm alprenolol (Novartis). The binding reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold Hanks' solution. 1 ml of the incubation mixture was immediately filtered through presoaked glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C) at constant vacuum pressure. The filters were washed three times with 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution, dried, and placed in counter vials. Cells were then digested overnight using a tissue solubilizer. After neutralization and the addition of 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (ULTIMA GOLD; Packard Instruments), radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Lowry. Binding curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (version 3.0). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then incubated at 37 °C in 500 μl of Hanks' solution containing 1 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and varying concentrations of isoproterenol (10−11 to 10−6m) or no agonist (basal). The reaction was stopped after 10 min by exchanging the Hanks' solution for 500 μl of ice-cold 0.1 n HCl. Following a freeze/thaw cycle to lyse the cells, the cytosolic extracts of each well were collected, lyophilized, resolved in 50 mmTris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and assayed for cAMP using theAmersham Biosciences cyclic AMP assay kit. The cAMP produced in response to agonist exposure was calculated as the cAMP accumulation in stimulated cells minus the cAMP level in unstimulated cells from the same 24-well dish. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Lowry. COS-1 cells transiently expressing either wild-type β1AR or β1AR-GFP and C6-β1AR-GFP cells were stimulated with 10 μmisoproterenol at 37 °C for the indicated times. Subsequently, the medium was removed, cells were chilled on ice, washed 10 times with ice-cold Hanks' solution followed by further incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in fresh medium to allow receptor recycling. Cell surface βAR densities were determined in parallel cultures before agonist addition, after desensitization as well as at the end of the resensitization period as described above (radioligand binding assay). To prevent receptor internalization and recycling in the intact cells during exposure to radioligand, the temperature was lowered to 13 °C. Triplicates (200 μl each) of the cell suspension were mixed with 50 μl of radioligand solution and incubated for 3 h to ensure equilibrium binding. B max values were determined with plateau concentrations of the radioligand, which were previously determined in complete saturation binding experiments. Total cellular binding sites (surface and internal) were measured in C6-β1AR-GFP cells before agonist addition and after resensitization using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as described above. In some experiments, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (200 μm) was used. C6-β1AR-GFP cells were preincubated with the inhibitor for 60 min before agonist stimulation. Cycloheximide was also present during all subsequent steps. C6-β1AR-GFP cells at 90% confluence were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Hanks' solution in the absence or presence of 10 μm isoproterenol. Cells were then washed five times and maintained in agonist-free Hanks' solution containing 1 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine for 10 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation for the same period of time with 10 μm isoproterenol. The cyclic AMP production in response to the 10-min challenge with isoproterenol was determined as described above (cAMP assay). C6-β1AR-GFP cells (7 × 105 cells) were seeded into 10-cm dishes 8 days prior to the experiment. 48 h later, pharmacological treatment was started. The cells were exposed to 10 μm DMI (Novartis) for 6 days or left untreated. The culture medium was changed 2, 4, and 5 days after the beginning of the treatment. Cells were observed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100M; LSM 510) equipped with a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective). GFP was excited at 488 nm (argon laser), and fluorescence emission was detected using a 505–530-nm band pass filter. Rhodamine-conjugated probes (transferrin, dextran) were excited at 543 nm (neon/helium laser). Red fluorescence was detected with a long pass (560 nm) filter. The pinholes were set to 1.1 airy units. C6-β1AR-GFP cells were grown on glass coverslips that were placed in 12-well dishes. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. 48 h later, medium was removed, and coverslips were rinsed with Hanks' solution and mounted on a thermostated imaging chamber. To study receptor endocytosis, the cells were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C in Hanks' solution. Receptor recycling was then observed at 37 °C in fresh Hanks' solution after agonist washout. To study the effects of DMI on receptor trafficking, C6-β1AR-GFP cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. 24 h later, antidepressant treatment was started. To label lysosomal compartments, cells were incubated for the final 24 h of DMI treatment with rhodamine-dextran (1 mg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Excess lysosomal marker was then removed, and the cells were incubated in fresh medium in the absence or presence of isoproterenol (10 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C before imaging. For the transferrin experiments, cells were incubated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 2 h at 37 °C. Rhodamine-labeled transferrin (200 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) was added for the last 60 min of the incubation period. Before imaging, the cells were thoroughly washed with Hanks' solution. To study βAR recycling after agonist removal, cells were maintained in fresh medium, returned to a 37 °C incubator for 60 min, and then viewed under the microscope. For three-dimensional modeling of fluorescence distribution in single live cells, stacks of confocal images were recorded before and 30 min after stimulation with 10 μm isoproterenol. Sampling distances were ∼100 nm in the lateral and ≤150 nm in the axial direction to meet the Nyquist criterion. Stacks of confocal fluorescence images were subjected to image restoration using the iterative maximum likelihood estimate algorithm of the Huygens System 2 (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands) and a theoretical point spread function. Subsequently, three-dimensional models of fluorescent objects were generated with the Imaris 3.2 Surpass and Measurement Pro software modules (Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland) capable of separating objects based on surfaces of equal intensities (isosurfaces). Appropriate threshold values for the generation of isosurfaces were applied to separate intracellular objects and objects representing fluorescence at the cell surface. Quantification of the voxel densities enclosed in these objects then provided a measure for the fluorescence of intracellular and cell surface-associated objects. The β1AR was fused to the amino terminus of green fluorescent protein to provide a tool that would allow us to follow β1AR trafficking by confocal fluorescence microscopy in live cells during agonist-induced internalization and the subsequent resensitization phase. First, plasmids encoding the fusion construct (β1AR-GFP) or the wild-type β1AR were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). An antibody to the β1AR detected two main bands with molecular masses of 50 and 70 kDa in cells expressing wild-type β1AR (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) but not in untransfected cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 1). β1AR are glycoproteins that contain one N-glycosylation site in the receptor N terminus (35Frielle T. Kobilka B. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 321-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is likely that these two bands detected by the antibody represented nonglycosylated (50 kDa) and glycosylated (70-kDa) β1AR. As expected from fusion to the 28-kDa GFP protein, the recombinant receptors showed a lower mobility than wild-type β1AR (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). The 80-kDa band represented the unglycosylated fusion protein with a predicted molecular mass of 79 kDa. Similar to the wild-type receptor, the band with the lower mobility most likely represented a glycosylated form of the GFP-tagged β1AR, since the intensity of the 100-kDa band was strongly reduced by treatment of the cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, whereas the intensity of the 80-kDa band was augmented (not shown). The bands with a molecular weight of about 20 kDa (lane 2) and 52 kDa (lanes 3 and5) seem to represent a carboxyl-terminal receptor fragment, since the difference in mobility shift of the two bands corresponds to the molecular mass of GFP. An anti-GFP antibody detected the receptor-GFP fusion proteins exclusively (Fig. 1 A,lane 5). Expression of the GFP-tagged β1AR was also observed in membrane fractions of rat C6 glioblastoma cells stably transfected with β1AR-GFP DNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). A number of experiments were performed to demonstrate that the β1AR-GFP fusion protein maintained the biochemical and signal transducing properties of the native receptor. [3H]CGP-12177 binding of the β1AR was not affected by attaching GFP to its COOH-terminal tail. Binding isotherms were nearly identical for wild-type and GFP-tagged receptors, as shown in Fig. 1 B, with equilibrium dissociation constants of 5.3 ± 1.3 nm for β1AR and 3.6 ± 1.0 nm for β1AR-GFP. The ability of wild-type and GFP-tagged β1AR to couple to GS proteins and to activate adenylyl cyclase upon the addition of agonist was also examined. Transfected cells were stimulated with varying concentrations of isoproterenol to initiate second messenger formation. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP responses were comparable in cells expressing wild-type β1AR or β1AR-GFP at similar levels (Fig. 1 C). Thus, both forms of the receptor activated adenylyl cyclase with similar efficacy. Cells transfected with empty vector alone also exhibited increased cAMP levels when stimulated with high agonist concentrations. COS-1 cells appear to express sufficient endogenous βAR to efficiently activate adenylyl cyclase at high agonist concentrations. The ability of the fusion construct to internalize upon agonist binding was assessed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Incubation with isoproterenol for 30 min led to a decrease in surface receptor density of 9.9 ± 1.9%, as determined by radioligand binding (Fig. 1 D). Under identical conditions, transiently expressed wild-type receptors internalized to a similar extent (13.5 ± 1.7%). Agonist was then removed to study receptor recycling. The return of the β1AR-GFP to the cell surface was quantitatively similar to that of the wild-type β1AR. 60 min after agonist washout a complete recovery of surface receptor numbers was detected in β1AR- and in β1AR-GFP-expressing cells. Receptor trafficking was further investigated in C6-β1AR-GFP cells using laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 2 A). In the absence of isoproterenol, GFP-tagged β1ARs were mainly localized in the plasma membrane. No detectable receptor endocytosis was observed. Challenging the cells with isoproterenol caused a profound change in receptor distribution. Receptors were internalized and appeared as green fluorescent speckles in the cytosol. The first intracellular receptors could be observed as early as 3 min after agonist addition. Receptor accumulation in intracellular structures became progressively more pronounced during 30 min of agonist stimulation. The density of endocytosed"
https://openalex.org/W2089925259,"Little is known regarding factors that induce parasympathetic responsiveness during cardiac development. We demonstrated previously that in atrial cells cultured from chicks 14 days in ovo, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) decreased parasympathetic inhibition of beat rate by the muscarinic agonist, carbamylcholine, by 5-fold and decreased expression of Gαi2. Here in atrial cells 5 days in ovo,TGFβ increased carbamylcholine inhibition of beat rate 2.5-fold and increased expression of Gαi2. TGFβ also stimulated Gαi2 mRNA expression and promoter activity at day 5 while inhibiting them at day 14 in ovo. Over the same time course expression of type I TGFβ receptors, chick activin receptor-like kinase 2 and 5 increased with a 2.3-fold higher increase in activin receptor-like kinase 2. Constitutively active activin receptor-like kinase 2 inhibited Gαi2 promoter activity, whereas constitutively active activin receptor-like kinase 5 stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity independent of embryonic age. In 5-day atrial cells, TGFβ stimulated the p3TP-lux reporter, which is downstream of activin receptor-like kinase 5 and had no effect on the activity of the pVent reporter, which is downstream of activin receptor-like kinase 2. In 14-day cells, TGFβ stimulated both pVent and p3TP-lux. Thus TGFβ exerts opposing effects on parasympathetic response and Gαi2 expression by activating different type I TGFβ receptors at distinct stages during cardiac development. Little is known regarding factors that induce parasympathetic responsiveness during cardiac development. We demonstrated previously that in atrial cells cultured from chicks 14 days in ovo, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) decreased parasympathetic inhibition of beat rate by the muscarinic agonist, carbamylcholine, by 5-fold and decreased expression of Gαi2. Here in atrial cells 5 days in ovo,TGFβ increased carbamylcholine inhibition of beat rate 2.5-fold and increased expression of Gαi2. TGFβ also stimulated Gαi2 mRNA expression and promoter activity at day 5 while inhibiting them at day 14 in ovo. Over the same time course expression of type I TGFβ receptors, chick activin receptor-like kinase 2 and 5 increased with a 2.3-fold higher increase in activin receptor-like kinase 2. Constitutively active activin receptor-like kinase 2 inhibited Gαi2 promoter activity, whereas constitutively active activin receptor-like kinase 5 stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity independent of embryonic age. In 5-day atrial cells, TGFβ stimulated the p3TP-lux reporter, which is downstream of activin receptor-like kinase 5 and had no effect on the activity of the pVent reporter, which is downstream of activin receptor-like kinase 2. In 14-day cells, TGFβ stimulated both pVent and p3TP-lux. Thus TGFβ exerts opposing effects on parasympathetic response and Gαi2 expression by activating different type I TGFβ receptors at distinct stages during cardiac development. A decrease in heart rate in response to parasympathetic stimulation (negative chronotropic response) involves the binding of acetylcholine to M2 muscarinic receptors and the dissociation of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi2, into αi2 and βγ subunits. The latter activates the inward rectifying K+ channel, GIRK1, increasing diastolic depolarization and decreasing heart rate (1Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). A decrease in the force of contraction in response to muscarinic stimulation (negative inotropic effect) involves the binding of the αi2 subunit to adenylate cyclase followed by a decrease in cAMP production. Several studies support the conclusion that control of Gαi2expression regulates the response of the heart to parasympathetic stimulation. The development of parasympathetic responsiveness in the embryonic chick heart is associated with an increase in Gαi2 expression (2Liang B.T. Hellmich M.R. Neer E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9011-9021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, growth of chick atrial cells in the absence of lipoproteins, which has been shown to result in an increased response to parasympathetic stimulation, is associated with an increase in the expression of Gαi2 (3Haigh L.S.

Finally, expression of Gαi2 in the porcine atrioventricular node resulted in an increase in parasympathetic tone (5Donahue J.K. Heldman A.W. Fraser H. McDonald A.D. Miller J.M. Rade J.J.

This induction of a parasympathetic response was accompanied by an increase in Gαi2 expression (6Barnett J.V. Taniuchi M. Yang M.B. Galper J.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and was reversed by addition of a neutralizing antibody to TGFβ1 to the medium. 2J. V. Barnett and J. B. Galper, unpublished observation.2J. V. Barnett and J. B. Galper, unpublished observation. In contrast, we recently demonstrated that in atrial cells from hearts 14 dio, TGFβ1 decreased the expression of Gαi2 and decreased the negative chronotropic response to carbamylcholine (7Ward S.

These data suggest that TGFβ exerts opposing effects on parasympathetic responsiveness at different stages of cardiac development. The TGFβ family is composed of at least three 25-kDa homodimeric proteins, TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3. TGFβ signaling involves the binding of TGFβ ligand to two transmembrane serine threonine kinases, the type I TGFβ receptor I (TBRI) and the type II TGFβ receptor (TBRII). TBRII has a constitutively active cytoplasmic kinase domain and an extracellular domain that binds TGFβ1 and TGFβ3. TGFβ binding results in the phosphorylation of TBRI by TBRII. TBRI then activates a signaling cascade, which may include a series of transcription factors known as Smads (8Zhu H.J. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Other TGFβ family members such as the activins and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) also signal through a type I receptor by binding to specific type II receptors for activin (ActRII and ActRIIB) and BMP (BMPRII) (9Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar). To date, seven type I receptors have been identified and designated activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs) 1–7. The ligand specificity of these ALKs has been determined by their ability to bind to a given ligand and to activate downstream signals in the presence of a specific type II receptor subtype. ALK1 and ALK5 are activated by TGFβ via TBRII (9Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 10ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). ALK5 in association with TBRII specifically stimulates the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) promoter. ALK5 mediates growth arrest in mink lung epithelial cells following the formation of the ALK5/TRBII complex and the phosphorylation of ALK5 (11Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). ALK2 interacts with TBRII as well as ActRII and BMPRII type II receptors (12Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). ALK2 does not mediate TGFβ signaling in mink lung epithelial cells but has been implicated in the TGFβ-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in the mammary gland of the mouse (13Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The regulation of TGFβ receptor signaling by selective interactions with different type I receptors is an intriguing mechanism that might help explain the pleiotropic effects of TGFβ. Here we demonstrate that TGFβ mediates opposing effects on Gαi2 expression and the response of the heart to parasympathetic stimulation at different stages of chick heart development and that these pleiotropic effects are due to differential activation of ALK2 and ALK5 by TGFβ. Embryonic chick atrial myocyte cultures were prepared by a modification of the method of DeHaan (14DeHaan R.L. Circulation. 1967; 35: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as described previously (15Gadbut A.P. Toupin D.K. Kilbourne E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30707-30712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eggs were staged according to the method of Hamberger and Hamilton (16Hamberger U. Hamilton H. J. Morphol. 1945; 88: 49-92Crossref Scopus (9975) Google Scholar). The embryos 5 dio corresponded to stage 27, and the 14-day embryo corresponded to stage 40. A Gαi2 RNase protection probe was generated from a PstI fragment derived from the chick Gαi2 cDNA subcloned into pBluescript and linearized with BamHI (17Kilbourne E.J. Galper J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), this template gave a 307-nucleotide antisense riboprobe. The glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RNase protection probe, used as a control, was generated from a cDNA template (gift of R. Runyan), which was linearized with HindIII. Using T3 RNA polymerase, this template gave a 250-nucleotide antisense riboprobe. Probes were purified by PAGE on a 6% gel, and the major band corresponding to the predicted molecular weight for the riboprobe was excised and eluted overnight. Total RNA was isolated from cultures of embryonic chick atrial cells 14 dio using guanidinium CsC12 centrifugation as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Press C.S.H.L. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). RNase protection was carried out as described previously (15Gadbut A.P. Toupin D.K. Kilbourne E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30707-30712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Riboprobes were hybridized to 15 μg of total RNA prepared from cells treated with either vehicle or 5 ng/ml TGFβ1. The samples were treated with RNase and analyzed by PAGE on 6% gels containing urea followed by autoradiography. Radiographic exposure was 6 h for Gαi2 and 2 h for GAPDH. The relative intensity of the bands was determined by densitometry scanning using NIH Image Pro. Embryonic chick atrial cells from hearts of embryos 5 dio cultured on coverslips at 5 × 105cells/cm2 were treated either with vehicle (4 mm HCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) or with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 and placed in a perfusion chamber as described (15Gadbut A.P. Toupin D.K. Kilbourne E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30707-30712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on the stage of a Zeiss inverted phase contrast microscope enclosed in a Lucite box maintained at 37 °C. The inlet side of the chamber was connected via polyethylene tubing to two syringe pumps allowing the cells to be sequentially perfused by two different solutions. Perfusion at 0.98 ml/min did not disturb cell adhesion to the coverslip. Cells were perfused with an HEPES-buffered salt solution containing 1% fetal calf serum, 11 mmglucose, 0.6 mm HEPES, 0.6 mmCaCl2, 4.0 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. In this study, each cell served as its own control with the spontaneous beat rate determined before and after exposure to 0.1 mm carbamylcholine. Beating was determined by monitoring the movement of the border of a single cell with a video-motion detector and recording the output with a physiologic recorder (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA) as described (3Haigh L.S.

Polyclonal (rabbit) antiserum raised to the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide from rat Gαi2 was a gift of David Manning. TBRII, ALK2, and ALK5 antibodies were prepared as described (8Zhu H.J.

Cultured chick atrial cells 5 and 14 dio were grown for 3 days in fetal calf serum, homogenates were prepared and Western blot analysis was carried out as described (15Gadbut A.P. Toupin D.K. Kilbourne E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30707-30712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were loaded as determined by a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal loading was determined by Coomassie staining. Embryonic chick atrial cells 5 and 14 dio were cultured in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. On the second culture day, 1 μg of Gαi2-Luc consisting of 1.5 kb of the 5′ upstream region of the chick Gαi2 promoter ligated to a luciferase reporter (7Ward S. Gadbut A. Tang D. Papageorge A. Wu L.

Ercolani) were transfected into heart cells cultured on 35-mm plates by the use of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total DNA was maintained at 2.1 μg by addition of pBluescript (pBS) DNA. At 16 h prior to harvesting, cells were incubated as indicated. At 72 h after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer at 425 μl/plate (24 mm glycyl-glycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The extract was sonicated three times for 10 s and then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for luciferase and alkaline phosphatase activity as described (20Holtzman E.J.

In other experiments, cells were transfected with the pVent promoter luciferase reporter construct, Xvent2-luc, containing ∼250 bp of Xvent2 promoter sequences, which was a gift from Christof Niehrs, or p3TP-lux containing the putative TGFβ-responsive region of the human PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) promoter, which was a gift of Joan Massague. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with pVent-Luc, p3TP-lux, or Gαi2-Luc and constitutively active TBRIs (constitutively active chicken ALK2 (chALK2+) and chicken ALK5 (chALK5+)). Constitutively active TBRIs were generated as described (21Charng M.J. Zhang D. Kinnunen P. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

The specificity of these constitutively active mutants of chALK2 and chALK5 was determined by cotransfection of chick atrial cells with p3TP-lux, which is specifically activated by chALK5 or cotransfection with pVent, which is specifically activated by chALK2. chALK5+-stimulated p3TP-lux 2.8 ± 0.4-fold (± S.E.,n = 6, p < 0.01) while having no significant effect on pVent promoter activity. chALK2+stimulated pVent promoter activity 2.0 ± 0.3-fold (± S.E.,n = 6, p < 0.01) while having only a minimal effect on p3TP-lux promoter activity. Statistical analysis was by Student'st test. During embryonic development, the negative chronotropic response of the chick heart to muscarinic stimulation developed between 2 and 7 dio (25Galper J.B. Klein W. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8692-8699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of TGFβ on the development of the parasympathetic response, embryonic chick atrial cells from 5 dio hearts were incubated for 16 h with either 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 or vehicle, and beat rate was determined in the presence of carbamylcholine. In the absence of TGFβ1, 0.1 mm carbamylcholine decreased beat rate by 30 ± 1% (± S.E., n = 21, p < 0.001, Fig.1). However, after incubation with TGFβ1, carbamylcholine decreased beat rate by 76 ± 1% (± S.E., n = 21, p < 0.01, TableI). These effects on beat rate were reversible within 5 min after reperfusion of cells with carbamylcholine-free medium. Thus TGFβ1 increases the chronotropic response to carbamylcholine by more than 2.5-fold in atrial myocytes from hearts 5 dio. This result is opposite to the effect of TGFβ1 in cells from atria of hearts 14 dio in which we demonstrated that TGFβ1 decreased the chronotropic response to carbamylcholine by more than 5-fold (Table I) (7Ward S.

Open table in a new tab Percent inhibition of beat rate by carbamylcholine in atrial cells 5 and 14 dio treated with vehicle or 5 ng/ml TGFβ1. Data are the means ± S.E. The expression of Gαi2 increases in parallel with the development of parasympathetic responsiveness in the embryonic chick heart (2Liang B.T. Hellmich M.R. Neer E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9011-9021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the opposing effects of TGFβ on the negative chronotropic response of the heart to muscarinic stimulation might be associated with alterations in Gαi2 expression. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether TGFβ1 altered Gαi2 expression in atrial myocytes cultured from hearts between 5 and 14 dio. Incubation of cells from hearts 5 dio with TGFβ1 increased the level of Gαi2 mRNA, whereas in cells derived from hearts 7, 9, and 14 dio, TGFβ1 decreased levels of Gαi2 mRNA (Fig.2 A). The mean of five experiments similar to that in Fig. 2 A demonstrated that when compared with vehicle, TGFβ1 stimulated Gαi2 mRNA 2.10 ± 0.16-fold (± S.E.,n = 5, p < 0.002) at day 5 in ovo while decreasing Gαi2 mRNA at days 7, 9, and 14 in ovo by 0.44 ± 0.06-fold (± S.E., n = 4,p < 0.003); 0.52 ± 0.06-fold (± S.E.,n = 5, p < 0.002); and 0.60 ± 0.02-fold (± S.E., n = 5, p < 0.001) respectively. Similarly, TGFβ1 stimulated expression of Gαi2 protein in cells from hearts 5 dio (Fig.2 B) by 2.30 ± 0.10-fold (± S.E., n = 3, p < 0.002, Fig. 2 C) but decreased Gαi2 protein in extracts of cells from hearts 14dio (Fig. 2 B) by 0.42 ± 0.04-fold (± S.E., n = 4, p < 0.001, Fig.2 C). Finally, TGFβ1 stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity in chick atrial cells from hearts 5 dio by 2.40 ± 0.40-fold (± S.E., n = 5, Fig.3 A) and decreased Gαi2 promoter activity by 54 ± 6% (± S.E.,n = 4) in atrial cells from hearts 14 dio (Fig.3 B). These data demonstrate that the opposing effects of TGFβ on the negative chronotropic response to muscarinic stimulation are accompanied by similar alterations in Gαi2expression.Figure 3Effect of TGFβ1 on Gαi2 promoter activity. Chick atrial cells 5 (A) and 14 (B) dio cultured in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum were co-transfected with a 2-kb fragment from the 5′-flanking region of Gαi2ligated to a promoterless luciferase reporter (Gαi2-Luc) and a human placental alkaline phosphatase (PAP). Following transfection, cells were incubated for 16 h with either 5 ng/ml TGFβ or an equal volume of vehicle. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and PAP activity were determined as described previously. Data are normalized to the ratio of luciferase to PAP activity in cells cultured with vehicle adjusted to 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These opposing effects in the response of chick atrial cells to TGFβ might reflect changes in the expression of TGFβ receptors involved in signaling at different stages of cardiac development. Western blot analysis demonstrated that embryonic chick atrial cells expressed TBRII, ALK2, and ALK5 (Fig.4, A and C). ALK2 and ALK5 have been reported to mediate distinct responses to TGFβ signaling (9Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 10ten Dijke P.

For this reason, we studied developmental changes in these two TGFβ receptors. chALK2 and chALK5 were initially expressed at low levels at day 5 in ovo but increased markedly between days 5 and 14 in ovo (Fig.4 A). Comparison of the fold increase in ALK2 and ALK5 expression between 5 and 14 dio demonstrated that chALK2 increased 2.30 ± 0.20-fold (± S.E., n = 4,p < 0.01) more than chALK5 (Fig. 4 B). TBRII levels increased 4.40 ± 0.20-fold (± S.E., n = 3) between 5 and 14 dio (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus each receptor increased between 5 and 14 dio with the largest increase in chALK2. To determine whether TGFβ signaling might preferentially activate chALK2 or chALK5 at different stages of cardiac development, we compared the effect of TGFβ1 on p3TP-lux and pVent reporter activity in atrial cells from hearts 5 and 14dio. chALK5 specifically activates the p3TP-lux reporter (12Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). pVent is known to be activated by BMP, not by TGFβ, and is one of the best known reporters of ALK2 activation (26Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). To determine whether ALK2 might be mediating a TGFβ response, in our system, pVent was used as a reporter of ALK2 activation. In atrial cells from hearts 5 dio, 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 stimulated p3TP-lux activity 5.20 ± 0.30-fold (± S.E., n = 5,p < 0.002, Fig.5 A), whereas in atrial cells from hearts 14 dio, TGFβ1 stimulated p3TP-lux by 2.5 ± .01-fold (± S.E., n = 6, p< 0.003, Fig. 5 B). In atrial cells from hearts 5 dio, TGFβ1 had no effect on pVent reporter activity (Fig.5 C). However, in atrial cells 14 dio, we observed an unexpected 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (± S.E., n = 7,p < 003, Fig. 5 D) increase in pVent reporter activity in response to TGFβ1. These data demonstrate that in chick atrial cells, pVent is activated by TGFβ and that this activation is specific for cells 14 dio. These data also suggest that in chick atrial cells 5 dio TGFβ signals via chALK5 and not chALK2. The ability of chALK2 to mediate a TGFβ response at 14 dio but not at 5 dio suggests a potential mechanism for the opposing effects of TGFβ at these ages. Specifically, chALK2 might act to decrease Gαi2 expression, whereas chALK5 might act to increase Gαi2. To test this hypothesis, atrial cells from hearts 14 dio were transfected with chALK5+. chALK5+ stimulated Gαi2promoter activity 2.5 ± 0.20-fold (± S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 6 A, column 3). Furthermore, chALK5+ not only reversed TGFβ1 inhibition of Gαi2 promoter activity but also stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity 2.4 ± 0.1-fold (± S.E., n = 4) above basal (Fig.6 A, column 4). In contrast, transfection of cells from chick atria 14 dio with chALK2+ not only mimicked the effect of TGFβ1 but completely inhibited Gαi2 promoter activity (Fig. 6 B, column 3). If chALK2 mediates the inhibition of the Gαi2 promoter by TGFβ signaling, then overexpression of chALK2 in atrial cells from chicks 5 dio should inhibit TGFβ-stimulated Gαi2promoter activity. In experiments summarized in Fig.7, TGFβ1 stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity 2.10 ± 0.10-fold above basal (± S.E., n = 4). Cotransfection of these cells with chALK2+ followed by incubation with TGFβ1 not only reversed TGFβ stimulation of Gαi2 promoter activity but also decreased Gαi2 promoter activity by 9-fold to 0.40 ± 0.06 (± S.E., n = 4)-fold below basal. As expected, chALK5+ alone stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity. These data demonstrate that chALK2 inhibits Gαi2 promoter activity, whereas chALK5 stimulates Gαi2 promoter activity, and that these effects are independent of the developmental stage of the atrial myocytes. The data presented here provide novel insight into TGFβ signaling and the regulation of parasympathetic responsiveness in the heart. TGFβ stimulates the negative chronotropic response of chick atrial cells 5 dio to carbamylcholine, whereas it decreases the inhibition of beat rate by carbamylcholine in atrial cells 14 dio (7Ward S. Gadbut A. Tang D. Papageorge A. Wu L. Li G. Barnett J. Galper J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of TGFβ correlate with alterations in Gαi2 expression. At 5 dio, TGFβ stimulates Gαi2 expression, and at 14 dio, TGFβ inhibits Gαi2 expression. Examination of two TBRIs reported to play a role in TGFβ signaling reveals that chALK5 increases Gαi2 expression, whereas chALK2 decreases Gαi2 expression independent of the embryonic age of the cells. Further, TGFβ stimulates pVent, a reporter of ALK2 activation, in 14 dio, but not in 5 dio, atrial cells. These data, taken together with the finding that chALK2 expression increases markedly between 5 and 14 dio, suggests that at 5 dio, TGFβ activates only chALK5, but at 14 dio, TGFβ activates both chALK5 and chALK2. These findings offer a potential mechanism to explain the change in TGFβ regulation of Gαi2 expression and parasympathetic response during cardiac development. The induction of a parasympathetic response is a critical step in the physiological development of the mammalian heart. The regulation of the parasympathetic responsiveness of the heart not only controls the rate and force of contraction but also may play a role in the development of cardiac arrhythmias (27Schwartz P.J. La Rovere M.T. Vanoli E. Circulation. 1992; 85: I77-I91PubMed Google Scholar, 28Eschenhagen T. Mende U. Diederich M. Hertle B. Memmesheimer C. Pohl A. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Steinfath M. Bohm M. Michel M.C. Brodde O.E. Raap A. Circulation. 1996; 93: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that during embryonic development of the chick heart, the negative chronotropic response to carbamylcholine increased markedly between 5 and 7 dio, reaching a plateau at 7 dio (25Galper J.B. Klein W. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8692-8699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The development of the parasympathetic response in the embryonic chick heart was associated with an increase in Gαi2 expression (2Liang B.T. Hellmich M.R. Neer E.J. Galper J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9011-9021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of Gαi2 expression has been associated with the control of parasympathetic responsiveness in the adult heart. A recent study demonstrated that overexpression of Gαi2 in the porcine atrioventricular node resulted in a decrease in atrioventricular conduction and a decreased response to sympathetic stimulation consistent with an increase in parasympathetic tone (5Donahue J.K. Heldman A.W. Fraser H. McDonald A.D. Miller J.M. Rade J.J. Eschenhagen T. Marban E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a striking parallel between developmental changes in TGFβ regulation of the response of the heart to parasympathetic stimulation and TGFβ regulation of Gαi2 expression. These data emphasize the importance of the regulation of Gαi2 expression on parasympathetic responsiveness and cardiac function. Our data support the notion that the transition of TGFβ signaling in atrial cells from a stimulatory effect on Gαi2 expression and parasympathetic response to an inhibitory effect during embryonic development reflects differential activation of the TGFβ type I receptors, chALK2 and chALK5. Complexes of ALK5 and TBRII bind TGFβ1 to mediate TGFβ effects such as growth arrest in mink lung epithelial cells (11Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Although ALK2 binds TGFβ when co-expressed with TBRII, it does not mediate growth arrest in mink lung epithelial cells. A role for ALK2 has been described during the TGFβ-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of mouse mammary epithelial cells (13Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). A similar TGFβ-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transformation occurs in the atrioventricular cushion during valvulogenesis. Studies using an in vitroculture system demonstrated that anti-chALK2 antisera blocked transformation, whereas anti-chALK5 antisera was without effect (19Lai Y.T. Beason K.B. Brames G.P. Desgrosellier J.S. Cleggett M.C. Shaw M.V. Brown C.B. Barnett J.V. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The finding that specific TGFβ effects may be attributed to ALK2 or ALK5 suggested that the specificity of the downstream response to TGFβ signaling is dependent on the identity of the TBRI activated in a given cell type. In support of this conclusion, chALK2 and chALK5 were shown to exert opposing effects on Gαi2 promoter activity. Constitutively active chALK2 inhibited Gαi2promoter activity, and constitutively active chALK5 stimulated Gαi2 promoter activity independent of the embryonic age of the cell in which they were expressed. Hence differential activation of chALK2 and chALK5 by TGFβ at 5 and 14 dio might result in opposing effects of TGFβ on Gαi2 expression during cardiac development. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of TGFβ1 on pVent and p3TP-lux reporter activity in cells from atria 5 and 14 dio. The pVent reporter is activated by BMP signaling via ALK2 (22Suzuki A. Kaneko E. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Onichtchouk D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the p3TP-lux reporter is activated by ALK5 signaling (11Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). TGFβ1 stimulated p3TP-lux reporter activity in atrial cells from hearts 5 dio but had no effect on pVent reporter activity in these cells. Furthermore, although TGFβ stimulated both p3TP-lux and the pVent reporter in cells 14 dio, the stimulation of pVent was significantly higher than p3TP-lux in these cells. These data support the conclusion that TGFβ signaling at 5 dio occurs via chALK5 and that signaling at 14 dio occurs via both chALK2 and chALK5, with chALK2 predominating. Although it is not possible to directly compare the level of expression of chALK2 and chALK5 at 5 or 14 dio, we noted a larger increase in ALK2 expression than ALK5 expression, consistent with the conclusion that the increase in ALK2 signaling at 14 dio was due at least in part to an increase in expression levels. Taken together with the data which demonstrate that ALK5 stimulates Gαi2 promoter activity and ALK2 inhibits Gαi2 promoter activity, the finding of differential activation of ALK2 and ALK5 would account for the opposing effects of TGFβ on Gαi2 expression at 5 and 14 dio. The unexpected observation that TGFβ stimulates pVent expression in chick atrial cells 14 dio is the first report of activation of a BMP-like signal by TGFβ. TGFβ signaling via ALK5 has been shown to involve Smads 2/3 (30Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that constitutively active chALK5 did not stimulate pVent promoter activity, which indicates that Smads 2/3 cannot activate pVent in these cells. Furthermore, studies of pVent have demonstrated stimulation by the BMP-specific Smads 1/5/8 (26Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This would suggest that TGFβ stimulation of pVent might be mediated by a BMP-specific pathway in these cells. The significance of these developmental changes in TGFβ signaling may be related to a dual role of TGFβ signaling in cardiac physiology and development. In an in vitro model for parasympathetic innervation of the heart, we have demonstrated that induction of a negative chronotropic response to carbamylcholine and the expression of Gαi2 were dependent on the release of a soluble factor (6Barnett J.V. Taniuchi M. Yang M.B. Galper J.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) whose effect was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to TGFβ.2These findings implicate TGFβ in the development of the parasympathetic response. Studies in explanted, intact chick heart have previously demonstrated a marked increase in the response of the heart to parasympathetic stimulation between days 2 and 7 in ovo(31Galper J.B. Barnett J.V. Kilbourne E. Gadbut A.P. Speralakis N. Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Heart. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1995: 431-455Google Scholar). Here TGFβ stimulates a significant increase in both Gαi2 expression and parasympathetic response in atrial cells 5 dio. These data support the conclusion that TGFβ plays a role in the development of a parasympathetic response in the heart. At 14 dio, functional parasympathetic innervation of the chick heart is complete (31Galper J.B. Barnett J.V. Kilbourne E. Gadbut A.P. Speralakis N. Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Heart. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1995: 431-455Google Scholar). The significance of TGFβ inhibition of Gαi2 expression and parasympathetic responsiveness at this developmental stage is unclear. However, TGFβ has been shown to play a role in a number of processes important to cardiac function such as angiogenesis, cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and the response of the heart to myocardial infarction (32Hanatani A. Yoshiyama M. Kim S. Omura T. Ikuno Y. Takeuchi K. Iwao H. Yoshikawa J. Jpn. Heart J. 1998; 39: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Lijnen P.J. Petrov V.V. Fagard R.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 418-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The relationship between TGFβ inhibition of parasympathetic responsiveness and Gαi2 expression to these processes remains to be determined. These data suggest that TGFβ is an important regulator of parasympathetic responsiveness during cardiac development and may regulate the parasympathetic response at least in part by modulating Gαi2 expression. Further, we suggest that TGFβ signaling may involve the activation of both ALK5 and ALK2 in atrial cells and that the relative contribution of each of these receptors determines the level of Gαi2 expression and parasympathetic responsiveness. Our observations suggesting differential activation of two different type I receptors are an attractive mechanism to explain the pleiotropic effects of TGFβ. We thank R. Runyan for GAPDH cDNA and L.

This led to a hypothesis that the previously observed inhibition of processing by bulky residues at position −5 can be suppressed by introduction of Pro, Ser, or Val in the corresponding nearby positions. Subsequent mutational analysis of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase showed that, as it was predicted, Pro on either side of bulky hydrophobic −5 Leu, Ile, or Tyr completely restores efficiency of the maturation. Introduction of Val at position −3 also partially suppresses the inhibition imposed by −5 Leu, while a Ser residue at position −4 or −2 does not restore processing. In addition, effective maturation of a mutant with Pro residues at positions from −6 throughout −4 proved that polyproline conformation of this region is permissive for processing. To understand the effects of the mutations, we modeled a peptide substrate into the active site of the signal peptidase using the known position of the β-lactam inhibitor. The inhibitory effect of the −5 residue and its suppression by either Pro −6 or Pro −4 can be explained if we assume that Pro-containing −6 to −4 regions adopt a polyproline conformation whereas the region without Pro residues has a β-conformation. These results permit us to specify sequence requirements at −6, −5, and −4 positions for efficient processing and to improve the prediction of yet unknown cleavage sites.

The signal peptide directs protein translocation across membranes and is removed by a membrane-bound peptidase after transition through the membrane (1Dalbey R.E. Von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Despite their common purpose, signal peptides have very little amino acid sequence similarity, although they do share general features. Typically 15–30 amino acids long, signal peptides of prokaryotic proteins consist of three distinct regions: a 1–5-residue amino-terminal positively charged segment, a 10–15-residue central hydrophobic core, and a more polar 5–7-residue carboxyl-terminal cleavage region (c-region)1 (2Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). In addition, most bacterial proteins have a 14–18-residue region in the mature part immediately downstream of the signal sequence, which has a negative or neutral net charge (4Summers R.G. Knowles J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20074-20081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kuhn A. Kiefer D. Kohne C. Zhu H.Y. Tschantz W.R. Dalbey R.E. Eur. J.

As a result of extensive research over the last two decades, the role of each region of the exported proteins has been mainly elucidated (for review see Ref. 7Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The export of proteins is initiated by interactions of the positively charged amino terminus with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups of the cytoplasmic membrane (8Nesmeyanova M.A. Bogdanov M.V.

Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 13Chou M.M. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2873-2880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insertion of the signal peptide into the lipid bilayer proceeds in association with proteins of the Sec translocation machinery (7Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 15Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The positive charge of the amino terminus can also govern the Nin–Cout orientation of the signal peptide within the membrane (16Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this orientation, the c-region of the signal peptide is exposed on the periplasmic side where it can be recognized and cleaved by the signal peptidase (SPase) between positions −1 and +1 (1Dalbey R.E. Von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Zimmermann R. Watts C. Wickner W. J. Biol.

A sequence motif with small residues at positions −3 and −1 defines the cleavage site (2Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 19Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The conformational characteristics of the signal peptide are also mainly established. There is a consensus view based on several in vitro experimental studies (20Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 21Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) that the region of the signal peptide inserted into the membrane adopts a α-helical conformation. It is now known that the −3 to −1 region has an extended β-structural conformation, which is recognized by SPase (19Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, the critical physical and structural characteristics of residues −6, −5, and −4 that delineate the hydrophobic core and peptidase recognition site of the signal peptide are still poorly understood. Bacterial signal peptides frequently have α-helix-breaking residues such as proline and glycine at −6 to −4 positions (16Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and this suggested that the disruption of the helical conformation in this region is an important requirement for efficient processing. A number of experimental data supported this conclusion (23Koshland D. Sauer R.T. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 30: 903-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Cannon J.G. Bassford P.J., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13609-13613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of natural sequences (16Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and experimental evidence, it was also proposed that the hydrophilicity of this region rather than its conformation may be important for the maturation (25Laforet G.A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these rules has absolute support from the recent collection of natural sequences: there are exported proteins with c-regions consisting of only apolar or helix-fostering residues. The conformation of the −4 to −6 region is also unknown. The Pro, Gly, and Ser residues that frequently occupy −4, −5, and −6 positions (2Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 16Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) are typical for β-turns of globular proteins (26Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 367-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This observation resulted in a widely accepted opinion that this region has a β-turn conformation (2Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 27Rosenblatt M. Beaudette N.V. Fasman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3983-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some mutagenesis studies of exported proteins showed that a decrease of the processing efficiency in mutant proteins correlates with a low probability of β-turn formation (24Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Cannon J.G. Bassford P.J., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13609-13613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Shen L.M. Lee J.I. Cheng S.Y. Jutte H. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, it was shown that when Pro residues are simultaneously present at both the −5 and −4 positions of alkaline phosphatase from E. coli, this protein is processed properly (29Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The steric constraints of this Pro-Pro tandem allow only a β-conformation of the −5 residue, and, as a consequence, this result cast doubt on the presence of the β-turn in the −6 to −4 region. Rather, it was suggested that the c-region has an extended β-conformation (29Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this conformation, the −5 residue may have contact with SPase, and this can explain why the processing is sensitive to the size of the −5 residue (29Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the bacterial type I SPase co-crystallized with its inhibitor (19Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) allows a final rejection of the β-turn hypothesis and favors the extended conformation of the c-region. However, despite the knowledge of the active site of the SPase and docking of the peptide substrate into its binding pocket, the exact conformation of the −6 to −4 region remains unknown. This could be considered a minor academic problem if it was not known that amino acid substitutions within this region can significantly diminish or even block the maturation of exported proteins (23Koshland D. Sauer R.T. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 30: 903-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol.

Pluckthun A. Knowles J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16192-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this work is to define the sequence requirements and conformation of the −6 to −4 region and its interactions with SPase during the processing. We approached this problem by using sequence analysis of exported proteins, mutational analysis, and molecular modeling. Sequences from Gram-negative bacteria were taken from SwissProt using Sequence Retrieval System software (www.ebi.ac.uk/srs/) and then checked manually. They were 110 proteins from E. coli (68 with known and 42 with well-predicted cleavage sites) and 81 proteins from other Gram-negative bacteria with known cleavage sites. The collection did not include highly homologous sequences with more than 80% identity. Anomalous signal sequences (those whose lengths of the hydrophobic core did not fall into the range between 7 and 17 residues), and proteins, secreted by other or modified secretion machineries (hydrogenases having a RR**F*K pattern within the signal sequence, where * denotes any residue Ref. 32Niviere V.

Genetika. 1986; 22: 2721-2727PubMed Google Scholar) was used to construct mutantphoA genes. Wild-type alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA) was cloned intoHindIII/BamHI sites of vector p15SK(−) containing multiple cloning sites identical to pBluescript SK (Stratagene), p15A ori of replication and chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase gene. 2R. Fischer and W. Hengstenberg, unpublished observations. The resulting phagemid was used to construct and express mutant phoA genes. Helper phage R408 was used to isolate single-strand recombinant phagemids. The plasmid harboring the gene of amber suppressor tRNA2Ala from E. coli in the vector pGFIB (36Kleina L.G. Masson J.M. Normanly J. Abelson J. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. J. Miller. Bacteria for cloning and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis were grown on LB or 2YT medium at 37 °C. All media were supplemented with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol to either select for or maintain phoA-containing plasmids. To screen for colonies expressing active alkaline phosphatase, E. coli cells were grown on agar plates made of LB medium free of inorganic phosphate and containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (37Inouye H. Michaelis S. Wright A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For alkaline phosphatase expression, cells were grown on minimal medium (38Torriani A. Cantoni G.L. Davis R. Procedures in nucleic acid research. Harper and Row, New York1966: 224-234Google Scholar) with 1 mm K2HPO4 and 0.1% peptone to the mid-log phase and transferred to medium without orthophosphate and peptone. To generate mutant forms of phoA, we used a new two step method, which allowed us to omit hybridization with labeled nucleotides during selection of clones containing mutant genes (6Kajava A.V. Zolov S.N. Kalinin A.E. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2163-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Kalinin A.E. Mikhaleva N.I. Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N.

Isolation of single-strand phagemid DNA and plasmid DNA, electrophoresis of DNA fragments in agar gels, phosphorylation of oligonucleotides, and transformation ofE. coli cells were performed by standard procedures (40Sambrook J.

E. coli cells grown to the mid-log phase in the minimal medium with 1 mm K2HPO4 were harvested, washed, and incubated for 10 min in the same medium without orthophosphate to induce alkaline phosphatase synthesis. The cells were labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 60 s and chased for 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, or 60.0 min by addition of unlabeled methionine to a final concentration of 0.05%. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Alkaline phosphatase and its precursor were immunoprecipitated with rabbit antibodies and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Proteins were quantified using a LKB UltroScan laser densitometer. The relative quantity of mature alkaline phosphatase and its precursor was calculated with adjustment for the difference in number of methionine residues between the precursor and mature form. Cells expressing alkaline phosphatase were harvested and converted to spheroplasts in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm sucrose, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min on ice. Periplasmic fraction was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by non-denaturing electrophoresis in 7.5% PAGE (42Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar). Staining of the alkaline phosphatase isoforms was performed by incubation of the gel with α-naphthyl phosphate (Sigma, N-7255) and Fast Red Dye TR (Chemapol, Czech Republic) (43Lojda Z. Grossrau R. Schibler T.H. Enzyme histochemistry: A laboratory manual. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1979Crossref Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase activity was determined by measuring the rate ofp-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis, taking the activity of hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate per 1 min at 37 °C as a unit of enzymatic activity (unit). Total cell protein was assayed by the Lowry method (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial docking of a peptide corresponding to the −3 to +1 region of the alkaline phosphatase into the active site of SPase was made manually based on the known position of the β-lactam inhibitor and using Insight II program (45Dayring H.E. Tramonato A. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1986; 4: 82-87Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Possible conformations of the region −6 to −4 were selected based on two constraints: first, the absence of steric clashes within the peptide chain and between the peptide and SPase; second, direction of signal peptide α-helix (residues −21 to −7) into the cytoplasmic membrane. Then the complexes between SPase and alkaline phosphatase precursor (−21 to +2) were subjected to energy minimization using DISCOVER module of Insight II (300 steps of minimization based on the steepest descent algorithm and the next 500 steps using conjugate gradients algorithm). The CHARMM force field (46Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Computat. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13964) Google Scholar) and the distance-dependent dielectric constant were used for the energy calculations. During the minimization (i) the backbone atoms of SPase were tethered to their positions in the crystal structure, (ii) a carbonyl carbon atom in the −1 residue was covalently linked to the oxygen atom of the Ser-90 side chain forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and (iii) several hydrogen bonds (between the oxygen of the peptide group of −1 residue and hydroxyl group of Ser-88, between the backbone oxygen of −2 residue and NH group of Ile-144, between the backbone nitrogen of −2 residue and backbone oxygen of Asp-142) were enforced by setting the distance constraints with moderate force (K = 50), in order to improve their geometry. In addition, when the region −6 to −4 in the β-conformation was energy minimized the distance constraints were imposed on hydrogen bonds between the backbone CO group of Gln-85 and NH group of the −3 residue; the backbone NH group of Gln-85 and CO group of −4 residue; the CO group of Pro-83 and NH group of −5 residue. To allay the concern that these constraints generated significant tension in the minimized structure, the last calculation was performed without any restrictions to an RMS derivative of 0.4 kcal/(mol·Å). A module “Struct_Check” of Insight II program (45Dayring H.E. Tramonato A. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1986; 4: 82-87Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used to check the quality of the modeled complexes. The figures were generated with Molscript (47Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the introduction of bulky residues at position −5 of E. coli alkaline phosphatase causes a decrease in the efficiency of its maturation (29Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In agreement with this result, the occurrence of large hydrophobic residues Trp, Ile, Phe, Leu, Met, and Tyr (written in the order of decreasing hydrophobicity, Ref. 48Fauchere J. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 18: 369-375Google Scholar) at position −5 for the c-regions of eukaryotic and Gram-positive bacterial proteins is lower than at positions −6 and −4 (17% versus 45 and 27%, and 7%versus 20 and 18% correspondingly). Surprisingly, the exported proteins of Gram-negative bacteria have an opposite distribution: 21% of large residues at position −5 against 14 and 17% at positions −6 and −4. We analyzed a subset of bacterial proteins with bulky hydrophobic residues at position −5 and found that they have a higher incidence of Pro residue at positions −6 and −4, Val residue at position −3, and a Ser residue at positions −4 and −2 compared with the complete collection of these proteins (Fig. 1). This observation led to the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of bulky hydrophobic residue in position −5 can be suppressed by introducing Pro, Ser, or Val in the corresponding nearby positions. In accordance with this, a series of mutant E. coli alkaline phosphatases were obtained (TableI) to test the hypothesis. In addition, a mutant having Pro residues in all −6, −5, and −4 positions was also obtained. The −6 to −4 region of such a protein is sterically constrained in the polyproline conformation, and it was of interest to determine whether it was processed. The fact that this tandem of three Pro was not found in natural sequences provided an additional motivation to study this mutant. All mutant proteins were enzymatically active in cells (data not shown). This result implies that the mutants were translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane, because it is known that alkaline phosphatase becomes active only after translocation into the periplasm, where disulfide bond formation and enzyme dimerization take place (49Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the amino acid substitutions on alkaline phosphatase maturation was assessed by the rate of conversion of a pulse-labeled mutant protein precursor into the mature form in vivo using the standard pulse-chase method. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of bulky Leu, Ile, or Tyr residue at position −5 (proteins L(−5), I(−5) and Y(−5)) notably impaired the maturation of the precursor in comparison with wild-type protein. Even after 60 min of chase almost half of the mutant protein precursor remained unprocessed. In agreement with our hypothesis, introduction of a Pro residue on either side of −5 Leu, Ile, or Tyr restored efficiency of maturation (proteins P(−6)L(−5), L(−5)P(−4), P(−6)I(−5), I(−5)P(−4), P(−6)Y(−5), and Y(−5)P(−4)). Introduction of a Ser residue at position −4 or −2 or Val residue at position −3 also partially suppressed the effect of the −5 Leu mutation (proteins L(−5)S(−4), L(−5)S(−2) and L(−5)V(−3), correspondingly). Pre-PhoA with a stretch of Pro residues in positions from −6 to −4 (protein P(−6,−5, −4)), was converted into the mature form with almost the same efficiency as the wild-type precursor. An unprocessed protein can reside in the cytoplasm or be translocated to the periplasmic side. It is known that the unprocessed but translocated precursor of E. coli alkaline phosphatase has an enzymatic activity, while precursor, which remains in the cytoplasm, does not (50Boyd D. Guan C.-D. Willard S. Wright W. Strauch K. Beckwith J. Torriani-Gorini A. Rothman F.G. Silver S. Wright A. Yagil E. Phosphate Metabolism and Cellular Regulation in Microorganisms. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 89-93Google Scholar). This property of alkaline phosphatase was used to distinguish which of these two situations is true for the unprocessed portions of the analyzed mutants. We visualized alkaline phosphatase isoforms (I, II, and III) in gel after electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. Active alkaline phosphatase can be stained in the gel by treatment with the enzyme substrate α-naphthyl phosphate and an appropriate dye. Furthermore, active mature protein and the translocated precursor can be distinguished on non-denaturing gel, since they have different electrophoretic mobilities (29Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 51Karamyshev A.L. Kalinin A.E. Tsfasman I.M. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeianova M.A. Mol. Biol. (Mosk). 1994; 28: 362-373PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor translocated across the membrane can be found at the top of the gel, probably due to aggregation caused by the presence of hydrophobic signal peptide. Such active precursor was detected (Fig. 3, a series of mutants containing Leu in −5 position are shown) in all cases when significant amount of unprocessed pre-PhoA was present after 60 min of chase (Fig. 2, proteins L(−5), I(−5), Y(−5), L(−5)S(−4), and L(−5)S(−2)). This implies that these mutant precursors are located at the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. Thus, we showed that inefficient processing of L(−5), I(−5)"
https://openalex.org/W2102083342,"The cisternal maturation model proposes that secretory proteins transit the Golgi in cisternae that mature by the continuous retrograde transport of Golgi enzymes in vesicles. We have tested the hypothesis that <i>de novo</i> generation of transport intermediates containing medial, trans, and trans Golgi network (TGN) enzymes is reconstituted <i>in vitro</i>. Our analysis shows that the majority of transport is mediated by a steady state of transport intermediate production and consumption by Golgi cisternae, with only a minor contribution of pre-existing transport intermediates. Transport in the medial and trans regions of the stack involved intermediates containing Golgi enzymes, apparently moving in a retrograde direction. In contrast, transport between the trans Golgi and TGN was exclusively mediated by intermediates containing secretory protein, as expected for anterograde transport. These intermediates may be physiologically relevant, because only these two specific types of intermediates can be detected in cell homogenates. By analogy to the coatomer (COPI)-independent transport of Golgi enzymes to the endoplasmic reticulum, the steady-state production of intra-Golgi transport intermediates was not impaired by inhibition of COPI vesicle formation. These data suggest a model for COPI-independent intra-Golgi transport by cisternal maturation with a shift in mechanism to anterograde transport at the trans Golgi and TGN boundary."
