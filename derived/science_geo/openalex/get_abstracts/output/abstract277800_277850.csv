https://openalex.org/W4233113664,The quantity and chemical composition of oceanic detritus in the northeastern Pacific Ocean has been measured at different depths from the surface to 3000 meters. The results indicate that oceanic detritus must be considered as a source of food for secondary producers.

The sedimentary section consists of Devonian sandstone and shale (Horlick formation), Carboniferous (?) tillite (Buckeye formation), Permian (?) platy and carbonaceous shale (Discovery Ridge formation), and Permian arkose, shale, and numerous coal beds (Mount Glossopteris formation). This apparently is the first report of a Paleozoic tillite in Antarctica."

https://openalex.org/W1974183939,"Numerical experiments with a simplified thermodynamic model of the glacier-ocean-atmosphere global system have been performed. Characteristic regimes of the system are auto-oscillations with periods varying between 20,000 and 80,000 years. The longer climatic waves are generated by the influence of variations of the earth's orbital parameters. Computed changes of glacial area, temperature, sea level, and other climate characteristics have values within expected ranges. The transition from a relatively warm epoch (when continental ice sheets are absent) to conditions characteristic of the Pleistocene is modeled. The calculated curves show how weak temperature fluctuations have been followed by large-scale oscillations."

In it is described the relationship of the establishment of that primate colony to the development of the National Regional Primate Research Center Program in the United States and the Laboratory of Perinatal Physiology in Puerto Rico. The Cayo Santiago colony opened new aspects of biomedical research and stimulated the general use of nonhuman primates in behavioral as well as physiological investigations.

https://openalex.org/W1994068731,"That individual animals within an experimental group may possess an extraordinarily high degree of individuality is indicated by the work of Wade Brown and associates at the Rockefeller Institute published in 1925 and 1926.1 2 It requires some reading between the lines to arrive at this conclusion, because data with respect to individual animals are not given. Male adult rabbits, 645 in number, were sacrificed and dissected and the weights of 17 organs (Table 1) were obtained. These weights were adjusted to take into"

https://openalex.org/W1973849713,"Difficulties encountered in making corrections for the effects of nucleonic magnetic moments on nucleon-nucleon scattering, on account of the unknown effects of wave function distortion, are studied. A partial removal of the difficuity is accomplished by correcting for the magnetic moment effect only in the one-pion exchange (OPE) group of phase parameters. Wave-function distortion in that group is relatively small and the error committed is less serious than if the magnetic effects are used for the whole wave. Since the low L group has its phase parameters determined by adjustment to data, these parameters have to be interpreted as including the magnetic moment effects, which will eventually have to be corrected for, when the origin of the nucleon-nucleon phase shifts is understood quantitatively in other respects. Formulas for the calculation of the magnetic moment effects in the high L group are supplied and some typical cases are considered numerically. Relatively large effects are found for the polarization and the triple-scattering parameter at very small angles. The complication arising in n-p data analysis from coupling of states with different isotopic spin is pointed out. (auth)"

The second and third sentences of the second paragraph should have read, ""I have advocated research on the therapeutic properties of whole coca leaf. Cocaine and coca are quite different substances with very different potentials for abuse and benefit."""
